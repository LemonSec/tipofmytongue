1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:03,600
okay so welcome back everybody I'm off
to lunch break

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,450
and we will continue worse a

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:10,969
some really interesting stuff I think
let's work come

4
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:14,719
I'm bennett extra crunch he's in 2002
ipv6 guy

5
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:18,180
for which a chance of yard w/ is so

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,279
are cried depressing because some we
also love

7
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:26,820
ipv6 II Salzer I'm an old-school archie
security professional and

8
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,869
a now dealing was hot we r and you
represent about

9
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:34,410
from in your piece of hardware his
creating

10
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,730
I am thats and preventing some kind of
secure

11
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:40,760
rendered number generator so Benedict

12
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,210
Showtime thank you okay for some

13
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:48,039
okay good yes arm

14
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:52,070
won't talk about not about my my lettuce
contraction as much

15
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:55,960
but what I've heard while building it
because this is really 320 built it was

16
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,789
just the for the fun to learn things

17
00:00:57,789 --> 00:01:01,550
rather than to build the product I could
sell afterwards and

18
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:05,129
have to go to conferences to some sort
of marketing

19
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:08,380
speak or whatever Yap saw

20
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:11,909
or on talk about his hopper you can
trust and

21
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:16,070
I guess I help nourishing hectic

22
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:20,159
hardly can audit and then trust because
count on it

23
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,430
she shouldn't trust that arm

24
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:27,590
what really drove me to play around but
this was the question

25
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:31,439
Hall far can I go

26
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,100
if I still want to make sure that what I
built its auditable

27
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,850
it's tricky and sometimes Huron true

28
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:42,040
we have problems and

29
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,689
from yeah couple

30
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:48,869
out but some like this sup markings

31
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:52,509
sorry about could you be in computer
science from University

32
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:56,689
da Pont some long time ago arm

33
00:01:56,689 --> 00:02:00,159
did mostly to radical computer science
there

34
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,619
which turns out to be helpful for a
couple of things sometimes

35
00:02:03,619 --> 00:02:07,200
but otherwise my focus is all on
operations

36
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,660
TCPIP networks UNIX security is not
there for a reason I use the same slide

37
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,100
4

38
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:18,500
things as well and I hopped this habit
of refusing to consider security

39
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,340
I dedicated topic

40
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:26,140
on its own right in most situations
because I think having %uh security

41
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:28,160
department in a company's

42
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,900
often but not always but often
counterproductive because everybody else

43
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,010
besides look at is not my department
anymore

44
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:38,060
and then things really go wrong Sol
that's why doesn't anything about

45
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:38,940
security there

46
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:44,270
arm in 2003 I specialized some more on
ipv6

47
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:48,630
Dhanbad year and a half ago some people
stop laughing

48
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:52,350
up me finally I

49
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:57,620
couple years ago of Britain a security
study for the Federal Office for IT

50
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,060
security which I spend

51
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:02,890
mentioned here before a couple not so
exciting

52
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:07,710
context arm which was about how to
connect

53
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:12,780
a government office agency whatever

54
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:17,500
to the internet using ipv6 no

55
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,970
funny tricks involved there it was just
its that thing most

56
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:24,450
never published in that form exactly
because after

57
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:28,440
after we finished it some people they
realize books

58
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:32,190
I've had sex that not just the for layer
thing

59
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:35,410
well but then we got our money

60
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:40,190
and the get it's been come on to
something else which house been

61
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:44,930
published tens and about turn of me
three years ago I stop supplier of

62
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,120
microcontrollers and once I got to

63
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,310
funny thing to work basically means Cup
LED blinking

64
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:54,630
everybody does like that right so what
you're going to do next

65
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:58,910
a parkade astronomer generation stuff
but looks pretty straightforward

66
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:02,620
give it a try and if I don't get it to
work

67
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:06,490
with Anna week or so you know playing
rugby evening

68
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:11,050
arm I'm probably just gonna give up
didn't get it to work

69
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:14,880
as quickly I am still didn't give up
instead

70
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,709
a whole lot of funny things happened

71
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:22,250
saw first of

72
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:25,879
why did I go for this why did I find it
interesting I am

73
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:31,020
I have a better for mental framework
that's

74
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:35,689
slightly unusual to a lot of people
probably not so much to you but just to

75
00:04:35,689 --> 00:04:37,009
make sure you understand

76
00:04:37,009 --> 00:04:40,360
that the thinking behind all this I'd
like to

77
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:45,270
given to but a run on so first off in a
people talk about security IT security

78
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:46,229
in most cases the

79
00:04:46,229 --> 00:04:51,479
they lying because they're not talking
about ICQ tree but they talk about it.

80
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:54,599
security of mitigation at best

81
00:04:54,599 --> 00:04:59,310
it's basically how do we deal with the
next security incident

82
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:04,139
it's not about security but about in
security mitigation I don't like to

83
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:08,819
arm what really annoys me is stopped

84
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:11,960
here's this brand new device

85
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:16,909
I'll try secure blah blah blah blah blah
unless you prove it stops all

86
00:05:16,909 --> 00:05:19,969
and I think this is

87
00:05:19,969 --> 00:05:24,830
inherently wrong trying to find security
holes

88
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:28,699
an existing products to show that
they're insecure this the wrong way

89
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:32,050
around really what should really
happened

90
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:38,150
as that the vendors should give me some
plausible reason to believe that their

91
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:38,830
stuff

92
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:42,710
this secure which they never do

93
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:45,849
because there's no soft or without box

94
00:05:45,849 --> 00:05:50,150
and because of that but here it is and
we say it secured address

95
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:53,750
you prove it isn't well it is a cure
white-hot

96
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:58,860
crazy attitude really if you want more
about this

97
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:03,719
maybe not explain to people who are not
that familiar with the entire topic

98
00:06:03,719 --> 00:06:07,150
I've done a talk at the earliest to hack
last year

99
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:10,759
on the limits of power feat and that
includes

100
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:14,250
part of this discussion a small might be
interesting for some a few

101
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:18,000
just two get a reminder for script after
she

102
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,379
can't actually help with arm

103
00:06:21,379 --> 00:06:26,620
but when it comes to secure hardware we
have a couple questions first of

104
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,860
who do we trust if we buy these

105
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:35,380
trust worth the whatever Computing Group
crossed it but from what your blah blah

106
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:35,849
blah

107
00:06:35,849 --> 00:06:39,440
its trusted because trustworthy because
Scott the name right

108
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,300
who's involved there's two designers
developers

109
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,680
this the actual vendors the the
manufacturers

110
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,310
which might be somebody else component
supplies which is Priya much

111
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:55,889
always somebody else logistics operators
distributors dealers customs authorities

112
00:06:55,889 --> 00:06:58,159
fun things have to cross borders

113
00:06:58,159 --> 00:07:01,740
arm investigative authorities

114
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:05,919
are spooky friends I am

115
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,740
the so-called intelligence agencies
standard missing bodies

116
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:14,639
and who knows whoever else there's a
whole lot of people

117
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,709
involved there and if one of them has
not crossed for C

118
00:07:17,709 --> 00:07:24,709
we actually have a problem one thing
about them protection because that's

119
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,699
important when it comes to hardware

120
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:30,860
a and some cases tamper protection is
actually really important if ya

121
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:35,449
of crypto devices that actually own a
keystore arm

122
00:07:35,449 --> 00:07:38,610
this can be really really

123
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:42,810
difficult on it's gonna take a look at
the station book

124
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:46,440
by Ross Anderson security engineering
it's available online

125
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,879
basically done the deal with the
publisher that three years after the

126
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:53,169
be edition was published he may put it
online

127
00:07:53,169 --> 00:07:56,209
and has a number of nice things about

128
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:59,899
about them protection and what doesn't
work

129
00:07:59,899 --> 00:08:04,860
and are to be followed I mean do things
like you have

130
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,899
this ultra-high secure this just from my
stuff

131
00:08:07,899 --> 00:08:12,870
are ultra secure package and basically
what you do to take a

132
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:17,080
bazooka and shoot a hole in it

133
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:21,740
on me not the the big anti-tank things
but you actually get my card charges in

134
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,399
biology

135
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:25,449
which actually managed to penetrate

136
00:08:25,449 --> 00:08:30,029
capone's PCB's whatever and you get
contacts and their at very high speed

137
00:08:30,029 --> 00:08:33,969
cast what are the stars in a very very
nice reading

138
00:08:33,969 --> 00:08:37,880
but temper protection in some other case
it's

139
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,650
in my case i hav a random number
generator

140
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:45,550
its not that critical because

141
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:51,480
it doesn't store any key material or
anything like that and

142
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:55,370
when it's unnecessary well its
exceedingly difficult

143
00:08:55,370 --> 00:09:00,470
I just decided I'm not to worry about
that a plea stop right now

144
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:03,589
and the other thing about us

145
00:09:03,589 --> 00:09:08,020
course it's a very convenient way to
sell people stuff they can't actually

146
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:08,630
check

147
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:13,500
getting things getting temper protection

148
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:18,490
together with audit ability as really
exciting

149
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:21,820
basically means if somebody wants from
me pumped up to the rest of my life I'll

150
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,370
keep working on it I promise

151
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:28,380
arm for for me one of those things we
never really kept

152
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:31,490
a result that's really satisfying

153
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:35,440
okay or disability

154
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,880
if I take a TPM module from those simple
Cebu so whatever other

155
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,029
at the crib to features in a into
whatever CPU

156
00:09:43,029 --> 00:09:46,920
how can I audited without destroying it
I am

157
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,570
okay so this 600 euros Cebu yep

158
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:55,830
that will secure are so HOT I want I
want to be able to take a look at things

159
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:56,700
and say okay yes

160
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:00,900
this looks reasonable the stock sound I
don't find anything suspicious there

161
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:05,730
and afterwards use it and not try out
six hundred euros

162
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:09,260
just for stupid Cebu arm

163
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:12,750
how can I do that with affordable and
generally available tools

164
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:16,640
I mean if I need some ultra
sophisticated

165
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,330
a crumb rust a microscope whatever but

166
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:26,060
this is OK I can afford to a multimeter
but

167
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:29,360
be on top

168
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,860
on with a rustle up to much scope I
would know how to use it anyway

169
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:36,280
so it's a matter of know how a small and

170
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:40,660
yes there are some I've heard a couple
interesting talks about people reverse

171
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:41,640
engineering chips

172
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,760
so the

173
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,890
arm cut off play after layer on on the
icy and then

174
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:53,200
to also it's funny stuff try to do that
with an Intel CPU

175
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:58,020
RRR was Bob say some spark but now it's
our

176
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:01,250
Oracle SPARC so here

177
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:05,530
okay let's just forget about that arm
this iz

178
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:08,940
what I'd like to see and the question is
how far can we actually go

179
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,980
but up is on billing

180
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:16,180
or tab audit ability possible

181
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:21,260
and to what extent of course question is
what a text so we're dealing with

182
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:24,330
and that's a problem with things are I'm
a bit

183
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:28,480
weird the generally accepted

184
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,370
attitude when it comes to texas we of
dealing with attack us we have to assume

185
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:32,950
they have

186
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:37,070
on the budget resources asx: like dennis
et except

187
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:40,460
they have common technical skills

188
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:44,200
they have unlimited insider knowledge
which is basically at this point

189
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:44,620
knowledge

190
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:48,360
that they have but I don't because they
of course a context to the

191
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,380
Michael a manufacturer so whatever but
have

192
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:56,270
pretty much unlimited political and
judicial backing basically they can do

193
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:58,380
whatever they want they know you wind up
in jail

194
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:01,930
are they happily ignore

195
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:06,540
applicable laws and not even talk about
decency or anything like this

196
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:10,570
I mean they call our Chancellor I'm
lemak a terrorist

197
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:14,190
not directly but after all

198
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:18,110
they were only doing their stuff to
fight terrorism and make up for fall

199
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:22,300
right arm

200
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:25,360
they kept apart from them from
manufacturer us and

201
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,860
that's probably the biggest most
interesting thing you assume they don't

202
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:31,550
make mistakes

203
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:34,810
where the pressure is likely out we're
screwed

204
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:38,580
however we might

205
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:44,190
tried to be a bit more realistic and
take a clear what a jackass and even the

206
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:45,350
NSA has a budget

207
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:49,160
bigger one than I do but a job

208
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:53,690
we can actually safer can make my not
money because

209
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:58,260
a lot of the problems we have these days

210
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:02,010
with this scopic bombing topping
attitude

211
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:05,570
in the NSA and elsewhere its Tasha of
all

212
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:08,740
we've built systems words

213
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:12,280
much too easy to do this we've been
focusing on the wrong things

214
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:15,400
and the way I T works

215
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,450
its berry very

216
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:21,600
easy to go for maas

217
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,690
surveillance rather than doing targeted
stuff

218
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:31,690
so the important thing is what s the
wrists

219
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:36,140
what are the risks that attackers take
they use the risk discovery

220
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:39,580
once it's known there's some sort of

221
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:43,970
Troy and halls round and the anti-virus
whatever

222
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:47,630
security products manufacturers find all

223
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:50,980
it's pretty much useless so

224
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:55,100
staying undiscovered us proven very
important and then there's some personal

225
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:55,990
risk for Thacker

226
00:13:55,990 --> 00:14:00,100
it's one thing to tap

227
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:03,680
the I am high frequency emissions from

228
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:08,600
the from from the monitor cable from a
couple me too so far

229
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:13,060
than hacking into somebody's computer on
the other one the work

230
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:17,950
simply because I think age there's
pretty much no personal risk involved

231
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:21,370
where s if you

232
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:25,970
break into or if you're coming to the
conference he and tried to break

233
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:29,840
into somebody's computer physically if
you found out

234
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:34,100
they're probably a couple people around
here know what to do them

235
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,290
right

236
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:39,210
arm there's also the issue of an economy

237
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:43,300
not be comic risk for an attack again if
things get known

238
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:46,600
or if things kept much out of hand

239
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:50,940
moneywise that's pretty important and

240
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:54,530
what I think what I wanna do is build
things that are easy to build is to

241
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:55,600
manufacture and that

242
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,780
are really hard to attack

243
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:03,080
using one of these on targeted blankets

244
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:08,450
style attacks saw targeted sex

245
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:12,180
on top on targeted attacks okay we've
got about covered

246
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:15,230
attack types now the on all this

247
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:19,380
this passive attacks this active attacks
right that's

248
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:22,420
run-of-the-mill stand up okay about this

249
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:26,930
what business relational back to Austin
operational device

250
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:31,460
what about replacing operational device

251
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:35,060
the first one might be dumb

252
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:38,860
remotely might not but might be the
second one

253
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:42,420
you have to be there physically much
more a scan of their

254
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:46,050
saw boxer similar completely different
story

255
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:49,730
we have to talk to them fusion of
manipulated device us

256
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:52,730
well thats easy he just intercept things
out

257
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:55,970
UPS DHL wherever do funny stuff

258
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:59,300
and gym on and no personal risk

259
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:02,530
for US on attack a hypothetical attack

260
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:05,740
sorry are you can manipulate

261
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:09,990
entire products or products process or
product lines a prop families

262
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:15,130
saw we have

263
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:20,420
these nice sneer ICE's doing some Bob
Loblaw

264
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:26,520
and you don't tell the cost much that
they also have some extra functionality

265
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,700
have but

266
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,610
kinda makes up for that later on

267
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:35,709
we have manipulation of standard
specifications

268
00:16:35,709 --> 00:16:38,860
I guess you've heard of for

269
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:44,640
what the NSA did the working and some
missed working group

270
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:49,670
got shoes should run number generators
it's very convenient

271
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:53,029
because concerts an established found
that

272
00:16:53,029 --> 00:16:59,550
it's pretty much everywhere and even
then we can't you can go beyond that you

273
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:01,260
can go at the political level

274
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:04,280
make a backdoor

275
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:09,059
legally mandatory for example alt law
strong production

276
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:13,610
the such things and that's one thing

277
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:19,530
but things get really ugly and but
doesn't just happen in north korea

278
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:23,220
it also happens here small so

279
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:26,679
what can we do what can we do what this

280
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:30,550
particular weird mindset when it comes
to

281
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:35,280
prosperity hardware the three

282
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,700
fundamentally different category such

283
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:42,690
tech of defense's first technical that's
what I'm mostly gonna talk about

284
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:46,040
I what's what most of us are probably
most interested in

285
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:50,070
but there's also an economic thing I'm
not actually

286
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:53,340
gets in here as well then there's the
political issue

287
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:57,040
but so I'd say guys take care of that
and Syria

288
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:00,040
for serbia of from

289
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:04,100
RK arm

290
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:07,820
a political holdouts some completely
different thing

291
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:11,179
I'm not gonna cover here saw that's why
I'm

292
00:18:11,179 --> 00:18:14,480
come take a look at and watch

293
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,160
can we do we can make things more
diverse if

294
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:24,740
their are only two commonly used
operating system on computers

295
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:28,540
like Windows and Mac OS it's much either

296
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:32,160
is here for the NSA or wherever than if
they were

297
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,720
like 200 different operating systems and
they have to

298
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,820
hack their way into all it's a possible

299
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,600
but makes it quite more expensive

300
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,770
and diversity helps but

301
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:49,100
the way I T works where we have
tremendously high

302
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:52,590
development cost but very low production
cost

303
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:56,090
diversity is difficult economically
difficult

304
00:18:56,090 --> 00:19:00,480
and the one thing I can I think we can
do is make

305
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,880
things public and make people built
things from possibly building blocks me

306
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,170
some

307
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:08,710
we provide but well we have serious
diversity

308
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:13,549
alt ability if people can take a look at
things

309
00:19:13,549 --> 00:19:16,770
I'm not like okay this isn't indoor

310
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:20,140
core i7 blah blah blah blah blah blah
blah but actually

311
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:24,669
take a look inside what's going on that
helps and wake thinks

312
00:19:24,669 --> 00:19:28,419
modular that helps with the first two
because it makes a

313
00:19:28,419 --> 00:19:31,799
easier to build different varieties and

314
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:36,290
to increase on its ability if you have a
single model did moslem

315
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:40,200
up module you can test and then another
mod your and so on

316
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:46,410
much easier than one core i7 so

317
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:51,370
about us storage that although the core
audience

318
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:54,600
how dried want designed to look like

319
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:59,390
first of it has to be easy to understand
and that's difficult

320
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:03,410
is difficult to build things in such a
way

321
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:07,500
there he's young stud wanna stop brought
this up also it's funny circus owner

322
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,320
didn't even a thought

323
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,799
sup understand myself and then just
ripping

324
00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:15,160
things down to the point that it is easy
to explain

325
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:18,500
is actually quite a job

326
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:23,360
is trying to stand as one thing easy to
modify so we get diversity

327
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:28,160
that's important is to reproduce so
people can build

328
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,660
and modify and bill their own designs

329
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:35,600
also quite important arm

330
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,070
development tools must be auditable they
must be generally available

331
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:42,390
they must be affordable if not open
source freely available

332
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:45,970
preferrably of course and available in
multiple implementations

333
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:49,669
the only way to configure our up some
implementation walls

334
00:20:49,669 --> 00:20:53,270
most were its behalf another one and I
can come

335
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:59,430
a result saw the hopper components I use
they should be cheap

336
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:02,640
a bit because being cheap is good right

337
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,470
now they're cheap for a number of
reasons

338
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:09,860
they generally must produced

339
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:14,630
and normally for multiple purposes makes
it much harder to sneak anything in

340
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:15,100
there

341
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:19,730
it's one thing to sneak some Scott a
backdoor enough

342
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:23,220
sick child you're a CPU another thing to
sneak

343
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:26,300
something into .1 send

344
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:30,070
as in beer is just like you hopefully
all spin soaring on the

345
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:33,990
on the bed just by now arm it's much
easier

346
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:37,400
to manipulate the big expensive stuff
then

347
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:41,670
the small stuff you stroll sauce
purposes arm

348
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:45,600
available from other manufacturers again
much easier to

349
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:50,780
make all the manufacturers arm

350
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:55,430
play all simple so if you can get away
without

351
00:21:55,430 --> 00:22:00,370
I cease which is difficult all the
better think should be widely available

352
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:03,950
so even for talking to tech might be
difficult if you got

353
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:07,720
I'm gonna buy them because they're like
five different sources and place where

354
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,210
map

355
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:11,270
easily replaceable with similar
components

356
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:15,770
again all to increase diversity and easy
to use for custom built

357
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:19,090
horrible PCB's

358
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:22,820
on your bed since not first something
like this

359
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:25,930
but through all components and

360
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:28,960
anybody can solve this closing of tunnel
blowtorch

361
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:34,050
toll it takes really surface mount like
you've had on the Badgers

362
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:37,450
is not as bad as it looks but

363
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:41,520
that at least looks much scarier and

364
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,620
its okay like you properly pride to it
by now

365
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:47,440
but

366
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,040
well people might decide nom

367
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:56,940
I now I don't need to really are things
Arts on the chips on the on the badges

368
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:59,060
that didn't happen did not too salty
yourself

369
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:02,380
which are meant for industrial assembly
only because

370
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:05,550
these new condom you can you come to
check out some money

371
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:10,680
so not really good choice I tried to
stick with through hole

372
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:14,760
at least the first person aboard a ship

373
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,800
couldn't get everything I asked her
whole but

374
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,980
small okay saw

375
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:24,550
that's my butt bounce back Rob theory

376
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:31,550
man I did small I little suffix per
month I decides to build a hot a random

377
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:32,580
number generator

378
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:36,180
arm first question is

379
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:40,180
what do I use as an external interface
the 1i

380
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:43,700
normally like best is summerall analog
or

381
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:48,610
near yeah analog output basically
something that's

382
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:51,730
doing cutie level kind of noise thing

383
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:57,250
and issues are Osprey par something like
that for example you can look things up

384
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:57,950
right away

385
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:01,810
that's cool really cool accept but a lot
of computer don't have

386
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:05,100
these GPIO general purpose i/o pins

387
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:10,460
so I needed something else a five-fold
serial interface

388
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:14,340
yes you can solve attach a somehow

389
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:17,410
but again weird

390
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:20,510
at the rust free pie and they're accused
a

391
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:25,390
jump ropes open anyway ours to 30 juice
basically the same as about

392
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:28,420
except that its use in plus/minus 10 to
15 balls

393
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:33,710
everybody in who is old enough

394
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:40,520
should remember these computers once you
stop them

395
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,990
problem is these days you take use be a
doctor

396
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:46,930
just beat your ass 232 and you might
have some problems in those adapters

397
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:47,400
again

398
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:51,030
another problem is stop ours to 30
doesn't provide

399
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:54,910
power over its connector sought hafter
need have to have some some pics on a

400
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:55,500
possible

401
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:59,840
solve the immediate options are USB and
PCI Express

402
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:04,730
didn't go for PCI Express because that's
real hard prick into stuff on

403
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:08,500
to Hall I don't know if I wanna touched
up

404
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,920
so when for use be which is one

405
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:16,070
crappy the for bus a complete

406
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:19,180
nightmare but okay so

407
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:22,750
I need a microcontroller do some

408
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:26,470
processing on the site just feed their
deer or

409
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:31,660
near analog outputs strain to Osprey pie
my choice there was

410
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:34,860
and iPod eighty tiny 2013 smallest micro

411
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:38,530
control I could find with the serial
interface arm

412
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:42,480
where their GCC compile is available

413
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,910
documentation is pretty good they're
pretty well known to the people coming

414
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:47,500
from the ER in a proud

415
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:50,500
promised the sting

416
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:55,630
uninstall I am 20 been through a whole
package so that's quite easy to solar

417
00:25:55,630 --> 00:26:01,940
and to make the connection between the
Syrian to face and USB interface on

418
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:05,640
computer I picked an FTDI ft 232 RL

419
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:09,030
yes space more about that in a moment
arm

420
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:12,810
a colleague of mine Frick 2 a.m. whose

421
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:15,990
a Swedish guy working in the crib at
project

422
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:19,900
a project's other initiated by Randy
Bush

423
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:24,060
I'll some who might actually hurt if
she's been

424
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:27,780
is written a couple RC's he's been all
over the place I T of meetings right but

425
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:28,540
it's whatever

426
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:31,900
arm for accused Ms before 30

427
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:37,840
for a number of reasons and also the
FTDI chip works

428
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:41,720
been to a couple of meetings with the
Quebec people and

429
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,780
so weird just developing things well

430
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:48,830
kinda independently but exchanging ideas
to increase diversity again

431
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:53,870
and it's more fun that way anyway
problem here is this after the I chip

432
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:58,360
alternative there some pic by control us

433
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:02,250
available in through a whole which have
USB interfaces except that the first

434
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:02,950
ones here

435
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:07,090
of to come program them you using open
source

436
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:12,640
so I had intend to test the bigger ones
have never of that yet

437
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,820
otherwise there's some become my
controllers with on boat

438
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:18,830
the use P which

439
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:23,840
are surface on me sub smart only which
I'd like to

440
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,010
avoid up have one I want to have at
least the option

441
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:31,060
two-goal arm to go sub smart

442
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:34,220
sub Smart's father Ken because title

443
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:38,290
be easier for some people so what's
wrong with the FTDI chip

444
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:41,750
for those who have who hasn't heard
about after the I get

445
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:45,140
are quite a few people

446
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:49,940
okay basically what happened FTDI has a
problem that there are

447
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:54,070
are some allegedly Chinese company's
manufacturing

448
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:59,420
fake or counterfeit FTI chips so in
September last year

449
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:03,860
they released an updated driver which

450
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:07,600
first checked is the ship on the other
hand

451
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,480
a genuine one or not

452
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:14,640
an explosion you want to break it
prominently

453
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,670
they always tune

454
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:21,600
recover from the app's if you know what
to do what you do but most people these

455
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,220
days don't

456
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:27,260
may just without warning but device

457
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:30,240
not much fun if you think about where
these chips are used because they're not

458
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,940
used just for those

459
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:37,240
PC USB to Rs 232 interface but for some
other more important or small serious

460
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:37,789
stuff

461
00:28:37,789 --> 00:28:42,049
as well arm basically yeah

462
00:28:42,049 --> 00:28:45,220
break things no warning given that means

463
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:50,460
that chip must go I'm not gonna have a
chip but can be remotely

464
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:53,970
break without warning in a security

465
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:57,029
related design aside from the way

466
00:28:57,029 --> 00:29:00,200
they were protecting their

467
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:04,899
business are having a chip that can be
bricked

468
00:29:04,899 --> 00:29:08,809
like this is pretty much unacceptable to
me

469
00:29:08,809 --> 00:29:13,230
and I personally screwed up because when
I decide to use it I read the specs

470
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:17,710
and I thought okay you there's this form
pin you have to pull Ohio whatever to

471
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:18,559
problem things

472
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:22,080
I missed a crap I thought it actually
have to

473
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:26,080
added political connections you can
program things in that after the archer

474
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,510
ok lesson learned the hard way

475
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:33,279
so expressed nurse

476
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:36,799
what are you new to use as a noise
source their number of ways you can do

477
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:37,210
that

478
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:40,409
one you find and and a lot of books

479
00:29:40,409 --> 00:29:43,740
is radioactive decay so

480
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:47,640
take some to forward to the local
nuclear power plant a

481
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:52,000
you have some bed active waste from me

482
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,610
sure but forget about the cup there we
give you hope barrow

483
00:29:56,610 --> 00:30:00,910
just sign here okay

484
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:07,260
say find in textbooks nothing I'm not
people have been using the app's

485
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:10,480
is ready ascetic says 710 pointing
straight up

486
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,680
and you stop ass

487
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:17,660
noise and park you can do that problem
is

488
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:22,350
if you are serious about security you
might not make yourself

489
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:25,470
inherently manipulate people

490
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:29,530
from from the outside so did you talk
about that

491
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:32,580
month ng mouths but people have fused

492
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:35,910
issue takers he's a teacher prominent
former digital camera

493
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:39,280
put on a dock box and just read our part

494
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:42,510
and on the least significant bits of the
Opera

495
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:47,390
just have some noise just by the way
they work from their issue got a big

496
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:47,930
chip

497
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:51,790
expensive chip relatively expensive so

498
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:55,820
the idea stop people might actually
manipulate top

499
00:30:55,820 --> 00:31:00,170
dawn Poppe somebody else

500
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:05,670
I I found was using from an awesome
resist of your own car to resist so you

501
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:06,110
get

502
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:09,200
you actually get noise very

503
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,170
blowout low amplitude very low power but
you can amplify it to a point that's

504
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:14,240
actually usable

505
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,480
problem there is Jeff sup to you need

506
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:24,040
so much amplification that these things
are again easily manipulated from the

507
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:24,580
outside

508
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:27,750
because they're susceptible to very very
low

509
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:31,590
up in France from there which then gets
amplified

510
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:35,490
somebody else John a bump is all IOU's
us

511
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:38,610
it's a ring oscillator basically means

512
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:41,830
you take a Nov number of negation gates

513
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:46,390
I'm permanent ring and that things can
also lead

514
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:51,400
as gotta be you but how about us later
because it's gonna be

515
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:55,440
really arm are

516
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:00,900
really frequency in stable could also
use a microphone ericka gunn playground

517
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:04,370
that's probably for good run moist but I
don't have fun

518
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:09,320
nearby anymore used to live near one for
couple years

519
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,330
and said what I uses the avalanche

520
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:16,070
effect and so-called zener diodes they
are zener diodes in there so call Tina

521
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:16,700
Dietze

522
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:21,190
zener diodes work at low bought injures
at higher voltage issue get pretty much

523
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:21,780
the same

524
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:26,440
net effect but its cost five different
physical phenomenon

525
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:30,150
was just the Avalanche affect which is

526
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:33,890
pretty noisy and

527
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:36,930
easy to handle I think

528
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:40,870
problem is he need some high voltage

529
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:44,620
and at that point there are already two
choices again

530
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:48,360
for Nick it shows a choc charge pump
which is using a

531
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:52,930
I see couple a external capacitors and
generates high voltage

532
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:56,540
problem there is it can only increase
voltage by some

533
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:59,870
factor or arm depending on the input
voltage

534
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:03,180
good thing is it does need to conduct
Kansas

535
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:08,500
I refuse to step up converter standard
MC 3463 which is a

536
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:12,210
ultra-cheap you find in pretty much any

537
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:16,260
I if the server small-scale USB power
supplies and stuff

538
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:20,140
they all over the place different
vendors ultra-cheap

539
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:23,590
everybody knows about them they do need
an inductor

540
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:29,010
arm but they are

541
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:32,590
fairly independent of the input voltage
to even have shifted if you have flocked

542
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:33,390
raking

543
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:37,130
input voltage for its fathers things
that can happen with USB

544
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:41,920
quite badly on their supposed to love 5
false but sometimes you only get three

545
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:46,140
are or less arm

546
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:50,670
both work on we have two different
models for that drop

547
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:55,250
cool so much about a visit at that point
the overall layout

548
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:58,390
of what I use looks like this I've got
the USB connector

549
00:33:58,390 --> 00:34:02,460
a step-up converter the actual noise
generator

550
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:07,560
a little amplifier singer transistor fit
that into my control and then through

551
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,780
the FTDI chip

552
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:13,109
alt for the use been to fix

553
00:34:13,109 --> 00:34:17,639
that's it now fun thing about my sis
that nobody wants a

554
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:21,730
except me I'm a weirdo arm

555
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:25,790
to take a look at pretty much any data
sheet and the

556
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:29,909
at best you find something they're
saying you have

557
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:33,270
at most noise sence also which is six

558
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:36,859
exactly not what I need I need noise

559
00:34:36,859 --> 00:34:40,859
I want moist I'm a noisy first sorta

560
00:34:40,859 --> 00:34:45,569
this is her was really a problem

561
00:34:45,569 --> 00:34:50,599
arm and its not specific to the have
much effect

562
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:56,069
you find that all of the place you check
CCD chips are cameras and the same noise

563
00:34:56,069 --> 00:34:56,649
only

564
00:34:56,649 --> 00:35:00,260
bahbah you checked radio transceivers

565
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:04,670
and they say okay noise from other
frequencies no more than someone saw

566
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:09,150
sweet you really

567
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:12,160
run into problems with that what
happened to me

568
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:15,369
I went to of local electronics store in
Frankfort

569
00:35:15,369 --> 00:35:19,059
got myself a 17 yr olds are avalanche
diodes

570
00:35:19,059 --> 00:35:22,150
solar zener diodes and

571
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:25,930
these are for different voltages they
used for what stabilizing what just

572
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:26,430
normally

573
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:29,650
later on but the man

574
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:33,170
things actually work perfect right

575
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:38,569
arm then I decide to come a car by the
sets I wanna buy

576
00:35:38,569 --> 00:35:42,130
individual months aside K I try couple
different

577
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:46,069
pipes but a dozen or so and none of
these

578
00:35:46,069 --> 00:35:50,089
I ordered by specific type was nauseous
these

579
00:35:50,089 --> 00:35:53,640
non some hmm

580
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:57,049
didn't work at all because most of us
were so no out-tough

581
00:35:57,049 --> 00:36:00,940
are would have had to add another
amplification stage

582
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:04,780
arm these hot

583
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:08,640
a tight marking are printed on them
didn't say anywhere in the datasheet but

584
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,369
bad type back on their order exactly the
same

585
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:14,809
see no outs but this type and they
didn't work

586
00:36:14,809 --> 00:36:17,970
the only explain

587
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:20,539
explanation week

588
00:36:20,539 --> 00:36:24,449
bought myself a pickup truck project we
came up with was

589
00:36:24,449 --> 00:36:27,509
they're selling whatever didn't pass
quality control

590
00:36:27,509 --> 00:36:30,999
and that's exactly what I from want

591
00:36:30,999 --> 00:36:35,039
but my daughter these

592
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:39,249
I mean I'm not gonna buy like serve 300
these and I can only use 15

593
00:36:39,249 --> 00:36:43,319
because there's twenty different a
voltages for

594
00:36:43,319 --> 00:36:47,400
so yeah these things up and the

595
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:51,119
there's a reason why didn't say where
buy it but because I took a picture from

596
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:52,549
the catalog I have put in a

597
00:36:52,549 --> 00:36:56,219
okay

598
00:36:56,219 --> 00:36:59,929
top eventually and the up

599
00:36:59,929 --> 00:37:03,019
could pick project we can help these
were the magic

600
00:37:03,019 --> 00:37:06,599
zener diodes magic because we're
producing really lots more ice

601
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:12,410
way beyond what we'd expect motor not if
we found you can also use time that's

602
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:15,869
a by Paul R junction transistors use

603
00:37:15,869 --> 00:37:19,900
just the be junction in reverse priority

604
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:23,259
it works if his crop on a breadboard a

605
00:37:23,259 --> 00:37:26,630
but they on like 45 cents each arm

606
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:30,579
but is currently the best option we hop

607
00:37:30,579 --> 00:37:34,989
arm and it still the question where to
get

608
00:37:34,989 --> 00:37:38,099
noise components by know beforehand but
they're noisy

609
00:37:38,099 --> 00:37:42,369
hurt especially if I might actually a
pump went to Sonic gonna

610
00:37:42,369 --> 00:37:45,419
in order to keep this Kickstarter
campaign and build a couple on these

611
00:37:45,419 --> 00:37:45,909
things

612
00:37:45,909 --> 00:37:49,779
what actually happened sometime I don't
know arm

613
00:37:49,779 --> 00:37:53,439
the other was big surprise then

614
00:37:53,439 --> 00:37:56,589
building for disability how do I built

615
00:37:56,589 --> 00:38:00,249
a ball and design that's easy

616
00:38:00,249 --> 00:38:03,529
to audit first the circuit has to be
really

617
00:38:03,529 --> 00:38:06,989
simple and that takes time and effort

618
00:38:06,989 --> 00:38:11,959
first designs up his head least three
times as many components us months

619
00:38:11,959 --> 00:38:15,380
I'm using these days don't have test
plans all over

620
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:18,769
you want to have a PCB layout

621
00:38:18,769 --> 00:38:22,529
that people can look at must look like a
128 slayer

622
00:38:22,529 --> 00:38:27,299
multilayer PCB where you have chrome
player

623
00:38:27,299 --> 00:38:31,660
on either outside then some PowerPro
Apocrypha

624
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:34,810
comprends pas planes whatever so
complicated side

625
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:38,290
arm and it should be possible to bill

626
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:41,810
at home if job for

627
00:38:41,810 --> 00:38:44,980
soldering iron some basic stuff

628
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:48,610
this is the circuit for the actual
generator

629
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:53,610
and the amplifier if you've never done
any electronics

630
00:38:53,610 --> 00:38:58,910
don't worry this is easy yes basically I
have something here to sterilize to be

631
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:01,120
input voltage so it's impossible

632
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:04,200
or place for difficult to inject my pic
consist of their

633
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:07,470
and use the easy no rush I'll

634
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:11,160
the resistance here make this

635
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:14,750
capacitor coffin bought it at some point
to get 'em up

636
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:17,790
nosing at outbreak Tom Waits this thing
breaks

637
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:21,270
good thing is that can take that
multiple times

638
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:25,770
a mic Palmdale we get a car impression
through the

639
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:30,080
transistor which gets amplified and we
get some bought forty million false

640
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:33,390
I p2p signal out here

641
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:39,470
use the come discover capacitor dude a
couple its feet up into a single very

642
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:40,340
simple

643
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:44,000
a fish cation stage in here we feed

644
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,580
trial fault upwards this takes 5 faults
with the alcohol or 3.3 with the

645
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:52,520
a mystery for 30 an output is near
digital

646
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:56,670
noise kept personal thing

647
00:39:56,670 --> 00:40:00,040
very easy to explain placed if you have
but from the cockpit electronics

648
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:04,010
if you don't well find somebody who
tells you there this is simple

649
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:08,370
there's nothing much to it this is the
board I don't

650
00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:11,540
unreal looks like this

651
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:15,980
arm nothing much on their

652
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:20,070
so we've got to step up converter which
is pretty much all of this slot

653
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:24,560
test plans around with every I see this
iz were output the

654
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:28,310
diode in there I've made that talk about
soccer player on

655
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:32,640
with different ones more test plans the
amplification

656
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:36,540
part Bob Loblaw my controller with some

657
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:42,859
a LED's and a programming had a this is
the FTDI chip but still has to go

658
00:40:42,859 --> 00:40:46,859
and by the way the reason why put on the
separate breakup of course

659
00:40:46,859 --> 00:40:50,250
when I it manufactured or when I have
the sports manufactured

660
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:53,390
they screwed up or for some reason

661
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:56,400
something went wrong with the from
solemn OSC

662
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:00,050
so I couldn't tolerate onto the board
directly

663
00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:04,270
a problem was with this design that I
actually have to

664
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:08,640
to this test pin that I talk shouldn't
be used for

665
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:13,570
if you don't have a problem things but
thing works and use some some

666
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:16,570
Moyes decoupling solid stuff so

667
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:21,990
nothing fancy a takes me about like half
an hour to solidly sup

668
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:26,720
and even my problem not the problem is
this uncertainty

669
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:30,000
businesses hopi 20 I'd package when you
first

670
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,750
realize Jeff to go that way it's in
their hands

671
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:37,080
I don't want to this is Andy and the
successes be that means

672
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:40,310
I its point six something millimeter

673
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:45,260
pin pitch: which means you take you over
average soaring are

674
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:48,340
and it spans Bob 324 pent-up the same
time

675
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:52,280
and before audited

676
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:56,810
I took a look at future and yea right
there were some people to this is simply

677
00:41:56,810 --> 00:41:57,160
a

678
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:00,960
on okay I want the stuff

679
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:05,820
and these chips are about small biggest
mall i scoffing Hispanic 28 pins

680
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:11,410
look at YouTube again they still claim
it was easy

681
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:16,100
give it a try or not it actually is but
it's carried first time you do it

682
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:20,190
its its it actually works quite simple
just

683
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:23,260
if somebody tells you you need flocks

684
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:27,619
for this to work I'm not flux but simply
not true

685
00:42:27,619 --> 00:42:30,990
flux doesn't help the only thing that
helps

686
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:34,250
is way more flocks but that gets knocked
up

687
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:38,119
but that gets a dub dub arm yup

688
00:42:38,119 --> 00:42:41,760
thats the output so basically to collect
a check

689
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:47,070
if you want I've got this stuff here was
pretty much the same right

690
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:50,390
of fish for you too

691
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:54,230
that's the output

692
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:57,790
from the proceeds from the actual
generate a call

693
00:42:57,790 --> 00:43:01,710
I'm not look so easy sort of special if
you look there because

694
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:05,590
but it's not a movie that justice still
and

695
00:43:05,590 --> 00:43:10,050
you take are individual stop shops

696
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:13,950
different time scales different up a
vertical scales

697
00:43:13,950 --> 00:43:17,280
yeah and you see I'm jus

698
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:20,490
proper ground so you get some Morris
ripple in here

699
00:43:20,490 --> 00:43:25,600
but this looks well exactly what to
expect

700
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:31,800
flanker soft but noisy but okay

701
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:36,140
so this is what I get from

702
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:41,220
the first from doctor to first
transistor second transistor looks like

703
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:42,540
this and you already see

704
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:45,700
this is media five-fold this is near

705
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:52,700
sure hope so this is near digital if you
change the same time scale don't see

706
00:43:52,770 --> 00:43:54,900
that too on on the on the skin yeah

707
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:57,980
you have to come on here

708
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:01,320
basically what you can see here on the
scope proper

709
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:04,390
is stops the

710
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:08,330
the UB rising curfew they their
breakdowns all over the place

711
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:11,630
at different voltages so this stuff is
noisy

712
00:44:11,630 --> 00:44:15,760
yeah that's another way to look at it
bus

713
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:19,520
the digital up again well

714
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:22,660
case you want to take a closer look

715
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:26,520
up this remark about the scope with me
arm

716
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:30,050
thats moist bro so

717
00:44:30,050 --> 00:44:34,160
questions how do I turn this noise into
when members

718
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:37,530
home

719
00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:41,980
easy right take X sample and samples

720
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:46,119
to annex or use those and

721
00:44:46,119 --> 00:44:50,950
yep that works it's fast it take it runs
a constant speed which is nice because

722
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:52,609
you can then have multiple from

723
00:44:52,609 --> 00:44:57,290
these run in parallel but depending on
the quality of you my sauce

724
00:44:57,290 --> 00:45:00,609
this is gonna be

725
00:45:00,609 --> 00:45:04,170
predictable specially if something
breaks

726
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:07,420
will continue to produce output but it's
not gonna be very

727
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:11,119
Brenda and I learnt the hard way

728
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:17,180
I've implemented that and then came up
with a better solution

729
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:21,010
arm which is

730
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:24,890
to measure time between rising at just
and

731
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:28,000
are you got hurt for weeks worth of our
part

732
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,450
ran some tests on them and realize this
is topless randoms its pasta be

733
00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:35,599
it took me days to figure out that

734
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:39,940
I've use the first approach with the was
in a day or two which was not quite as

735
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:41,520
magic a small use before

736
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:44,920
poor week's worth

737
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:48,160
estate up up saw

738
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:51,640
what I'm doing and that works nice
bottom left PGA

739
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:54,740
thing like with the cryptic people

740
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:59,170
and with the with my controllers

741
00:45:59,170 --> 00:46:03,270
I just measured time between rising at a
site Tampa between rising at

742
00:46:03,270 --> 00:46:08,150
big Tom Pope values and measure the time
between rising edge us

743
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:11,710
we're just like this law which one to
variable spewed depending on the input

744
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:14,850
but which adopts to the quality of the
source

745
00:46:14,850 --> 00:46:19,900
which is famed safe and not if they are
no more edge is coming in because

746
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:20,940
something is broken

747
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:25,680
it'll stop produce are put and it
automatically removes

748
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:29,760
correlation in pots because

749
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:33,080
I measure between to rising interest and
I do some processing the measure between

750
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:34,930
to rising interest again so there's

751
00:46:34,930 --> 00:46:38,150
one rising edge in the whole between

752
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:44,300
that this sting get to correlate arm

753
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:48,390
the trick to show that this

754
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:52,810
com have correlated its

755
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:56,080
in its operatives basically Welsh be
able to store

756
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:59,110
information and the secretary saw
simplicity really helps here

757
00:46:59,110 --> 00:47:02,410
it's possible to do a formal proof that
it works although I didn't

758
00:47:02,410 --> 00:47:06,560
me to do right now is test things but
they are actually just wanna miss a

759
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:07,020
thing

760
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:10,700
s I think and that's a completely
different problem arm

761
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:14,590
question is how to remove bias if I more
0 us than once

762
00:47:14,590 --> 00:47:18,830
which can happen with the circuit I use
upon my man extractor their

763
00:47:18,830 --> 00:47:22,080
works like this I take to bits and a
fail the same a throwaway

764
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:25,250
if they're different I take the first of

765
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:28,480
or the segment doesn't matter

766
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:32,250
but just have decided when about the
stuff which one

767
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:35,920
that means no matter how biased

768
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:39,840
input it I will get unbiased

769
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:45,900
output as long as subsea competes are
not Karnataka took me some time to find

770
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:50,059
out about that but it's actually quite
useful

771
00:47:50,059 --> 00:47:53,849
arm yup the board I called Dr Port

772
00:47:53,849 --> 00:47:59,630
doesn't have to do with wasting Paul
weeks of my life

773
00:47:59,630 --> 00:48:05,260
so it's

774
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:08,480
the auditable real random number
generator

775
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:13,339
hardware yeah I

776
00:48:13,339 --> 00:48:17,040
thats that's what I've got

777
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:20,329
that's what I've done so far and they
still work to come

778
00:48:20,329 --> 00:48:23,609
but what of it what of what I learned in
this

779
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:27,359
suffix per month first of

780
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:31,309
I see suck specially from FTD I but in
general

781
00:48:31,309 --> 00:48:36,640
for all components suck because the
stupid thing doesn't fit in my keychain

782
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:40,190
as the components suck even worse

783
00:48:40,190 --> 00:48:43,500
and they only talk by USB

784
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:46,980
and I'm not gonna do it revenues be here
because

785
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:50,770
travis has already gone and hit after
hit the art

786
00:48:50,770 --> 00:48:54,470
do it for them together something like
that arm

787
00:48:54,470 --> 00:48:58,210
building auditable hardware is difficult

788
00:48:58,210 --> 00:49:01,410
you put some extra work in there

789
00:49:01,410 --> 00:49:05,099
but from what I've seen so far it is

790
00:49:05,099 --> 00:49:10,450
actually possible and yes

791
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:13,619
complexity is a problem not a solution

792
00:49:13,619 --> 00:49:16,849
if something doesn't work the way it is

793
00:49:16,849 --> 00:49:22,420
don't try to add things try to pull
things out perhaps difficult

794
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:24,770
it's really difficult

795
00:49:24,770 --> 00:49:28,590
I'll and yes readiness looks really
simple

796
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:32,890
on this you really try to both things
cusub

797
00:49:32,890 --> 00:49:36,600
a spinning couple more years on this so
might actually Cooper some

798
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:40,110
more talk future and

799
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:43,810
wateva name talked about because that's
where I'm still working out as

800
00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:47,830
testing there are no real proper testing
methods

801
00:49:47,830 --> 00:49:51,780
there are some for for

802
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:55,230
or even tools this some force you to run
number generators

803
00:49:55,230 --> 00:49:58,320
yes and even they are questionable most
the time

804
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:01,430
but they're not for this job that's a
different

805
00:50:01,430 --> 00:50:05,300
thing entirely so I'm now back to

806
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:09,560
corning c plus plus on believable

807
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:14,940
arm and also learned that testing for
endless is basically the long way around

808
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:18,190
what you do in statistics is better

809
00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:23,960
you show there is a correlation between
this and out most the time

810
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:28,970
saw all the textbook of gathered so far
because I'm not freed up for done on

811
00:50:28,970 --> 00:50:30,260
statistics myself

812
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:34,990
they get it wrong only thing that I
found that this country's tallest no

813
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:38,170
of cultural programming volume to from

814
00:50:38,170 --> 00:50:42,730
1969 but he still got the basics on top
there

815
00:50:42,730 --> 00:50:47,030
his son a guide acted he's he's really
gets

816
00:50:47,030 --> 00:50:50,050
into the stuff where everybody else's as
a kid this is

817
00:50:50,050 --> 00:50:53,180
too complex

818
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:56,190
left as an exercise to the reader or
whatever

819
00:50:56,190 --> 00:51:00,000
arm and yes I've learnt that the NIST

820
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,860
screw things up again big-time wised up

821
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:08,840
because and trips 140 there are

822
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:12,920
requirements for rent hopper a random
number generators in there

823
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:17,530
which take 20,000 pits and a block

824
00:51:17,530 --> 00:51:23,230
run a couple tests on them and then
decide all this is man enough to order

825
00:51:23,230 --> 00:51:24,440
wat pixel x1

826
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:28,750
which doesn't make sense artistically
because the search space just get

827
00:51:28,750 --> 00:51:29,330
smaller

828
00:51:29,330 --> 00:51:32,850
if you do of a exhaust church attack

829
00:51:32,850 --> 00:51:38,480
and they didn't explain why twenty
thousand but that didn't take

830
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:41,520
explain why these are all at once why
the specials

831
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:47,450
nothing but some other algorithms look
familiar

832
00:51:47,450 --> 00:51:51,580
iPhone guess where

833
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:54,920
cloth of computer programming

834
00:51:54,920 --> 00:52:00,330
Martin 69 except back north used them to
test it

835
00:52:00,330 --> 00:52:05,340
to test soon a random number generators
and not for cryptographic the purposes

836
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:08,930
but for general-purpose whatever people
did for computers in the lake

837
00:52:08,930 --> 00:52:12,710
late sixties and they just

838
00:52:12,710 --> 00:52:15,830
copied those said okay you have to test
things

839
00:52:15,830 --> 00:52:21,300
this way I was scary no explanation
given

840
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:24,840
why and that's what ready upset me

841
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:28,800
there was no explanation given why the
specials why these are welcomes

842
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,900
nothing months basic be

843
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:37,350
something that's not an open design or
anything

844
00:52:37,350 --> 00:52:41,050
okay hopefully maybe next year or so

845
00:52:41,050 --> 00:52:44,280
up something more to tell about that
aside from that

846
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:48,060
couple things might want to take a look
at this this

847
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:52,850
the stock market a lives of photography
find on youtube up going to be a block

848
00:52:52,850 --> 00:52:53,520
where do

849
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:58,040
some the stuff a small and the cryptic
project for we're building a fpga-based

850
00:52:58,040 --> 00:52:59,320
full-blown

851
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:02,820
eighty Sam Harper security module with
Keystone everything

852
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:06,430
it's also quite interesting quite an
interesting crossville

853
00:53:06,430 --> 00:53:13,430
I watched as marking a pic the

854
00:53:18,819 --> 00:53:24,799
okay questions anybody K

855
00:53:24,799 --> 00:53:31,799
I

856
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:37,010
could you place a few votes about that
dole and physical process all this noise

857
00:53:37,010 --> 00:53:41,059
so examine it comes from okay and
actually have a second shot question

858
00:53:41,059 --> 00:53:44,809
yeah I could also say how many bits per
clock cycle you can

859
00:53:44,809 --> 00:53:47,880
produce your generator outputs

860
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:51,510
arm the sport generous depending on the
end on the

861
00:53:51,510 --> 00:53:57,030
how much magic the component mass
between 13 and 16

862
00:53:57,030 --> 00:54:03,170
or 13 and 20 kilobytes per second of
Frederick tony has been using a faster

863
00:54:03,170 --> 00:54:07,040
stm32 microcontroller gots sure about
30-35

864
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:10,839
with otherwise same circuit arm

865
00:54:10,839 --> 00:54:14,680
the effect that some of theirs you have
her by polygon chin

866
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:19,020
you've got electrons in there and
positive charge us

867
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:22,589
and its and then in reverse bias

868
00:54:22,589 --> 00:54:26,270
at some point individual electrons will
pass through

869
00:54:26,270 --> 00:54:30,190
because of the voltage difference and
they kick

870
00:54:30,190 --> 00:54:33,950
lose other charge us and the cause in

871
00:54:33,950 --> 00:54:37,700
avalanche in fact that's why it's called
avalanche effect and these calls

872
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:40,950
a rush of current which were quickly
recover the cost

873
00:54:40,950 --> 00:54:44,420
you will run out of possible electrons
are

874
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:48,380
or charge that can be moved and that
makes this nice to use

875
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:51,690
because you don't half like a possum
distribution

876
00:54:51,690 --> 00:54:55,520
for when things were next up you can be
pretty sure it'll be in a

877
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:59,430
reasonably reasonably a short time frame
bust the

878
00:54:59,430 --> 00:55:03,740
basic thing be on top Wikipedia is
probably more help on that the Nyack

879
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:07,420
I okay anybody else

880
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:12,339
the for King and great talk about a few
to secure how do you

881
00:55:12,339 --> 00:55:16,349
provide people that use your
implementation with testing if that guy

882
00:55:16,349 --> 00:55:17,950
ought that's used which is

883
00:55:17,950 --> 00:55:22,799
obviously a potential weakness who is
actually a good one for the purposes of

884
00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:24,180
random number generation

885
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:25,539
on

886
00:55:25,539 --> 00:55:28,670
okay diet is not that much from weakness

887
00:55:28,670 --> 00:55:32,180
because wanted to confirm it because for
the got to manipulation

888
00:55:32,180 --> 00:55:36,269
it's a 2-pin device burn on what's going
through they so she copped a termite

889
00:55:36,269 --> 00:55:37,589
control or whatever in there

890
00:55:37,589 --> 00:55:41,369
if it breaks and use this extra edge
detection

891
00:55:41,369 --> 00:55:46,940
wherever you process the noise that
doesn't come up anymore

892
00:55:46,940 --> 00:55:51,289
tell people stop if something breaks

893
00:55:51,289 --> 00:55:54,619
this this design will stop producing

894
00:55:54,619 --> 00:56:01,130
any output at all a half you consider

895
00:56:01,130 --> 00:56:06,210
a implementing to use P stuff and if I
could control itself leaving the

896
00:56:06,210 --> 00:56:09,650
a FTDI it completely arrayed yes

897
00:56:09,650 --> 00:56:13,019
are there a couple ways to do that first
one that doesn't work

898
00:56:13,019 --> 00:56:16,650
is called the the USB which is a USB

899
00:56:16,650 --> 00:56:20,539
Annette Bening find the list abuse be
which is a

900
00:56:20,539 --> 00:56:24,440
peace USB 11 implementation and that's
too slow

901
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:27,819
it's simply too slow because

902
00:56:27,819 --> 00:56:33,160
my control here is really busy thats the
the the key thing that's lost thanks Tom

903
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:36,289
arm other thing is

904
00:56:36,289 --> 00:56:40,150
by want to take a look at this pic my
controller since they have used be built

905
00:56:40,150 --> 00:56:40,489
and

906
00:56:40,489 --> 00:56:44,519
so that might actually be an option to
get to of Hosni of

907
00:56:44,519 --> 00:56:49,009
without having to go AS&E again and
otherwise

908
00:56:49,009 --> 00:56:52,150
to begin my contras lot of them half
years beyond what a small

909
00:56:52,150 --> 00:56:56,719
but that stuff you don't want us all to
yourself necessary song

910
00:56:56,719 --> 00:57:00,140
there is no one-size-fits-all solution
to that but I want to cater for

911
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:01,390
different people and

912
00:57:01,390 --> 00:57:05,489
in increase diversity but side era okay
thank you

913
00:57:05,489 --> 00:57:09,460
okay so Benedict thank you very much

914
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:09,809
you're welcome
