so about the topic Prince buy finpecia
gonna group sold the phenomenon

18
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:15,290
and never them I think everybody heard
about it

19
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:20,020
because it for them a on wary active in
in in this

20
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:23,560
your community in there this be combated
so there was a

21
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:28,520
beak the data leak and and the middle of
the year a

22
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:32,270
and the middle of the last year and
there was for the you go by today to

23
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:33,079
more stolen

24
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:37,650
ion roughly everything a application
brochures

25
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:41,280
really arrays know what full support
databases

26
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,759
I'm very interesting staff is on the

27
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:46,499
on the

28
00:01:46,499 --> 00:01:49,679
mickey leaks summarized in detail the

29
00:01:49,679 --> 00:01:53,159
then I and brochures are there

30
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:58,369
so I if you are interesting you can
check it and softer debt to me

31
00:01:58,369 --> 00:02:01,920
we know that what is that ability of
town

32
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,229
application and bacteria I'm would like
to know how it made the

33
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:11,660
technically saw holiday saw the
encryption parts how this all that

34
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,700
communication the configuration

35
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:17,190
soul the technical part of it and

36
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:20,790
this this is a very special mall there
because

37
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:24,370
the smaller and was created by by the
good guy

38
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:27,680
for or a gains the bad guy saw I am

39
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,239
and its I think it's quite unique and

40
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:34,890
and which is very interesting I think
the question is

41
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:39,540
is there any weaknesses which could be I
used to exploit this

42
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,569
a estar and and what is the

43
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:47,359
what he's them quality of an application
like like the speakers

44
00:02:47,359 --> 00:02:50,920
it can be used legally against the

45
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,470
pool or bad people soul

46
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:57,980
I am it have to be a very good quality I
think

47
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:01,290
so what causes in

48
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:05,049
in the league I was folk with only
change as the AP ki

49
00:03:05,049 --> 00:03:08,090
first off because then they're wasn't
any

50
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:11,599
a interesting where the theater analysis

51
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:15,389
at that time in and on and a pic you a
regional dir

52
00:03:15,389 --> 00:03:18,669
on their fees I sold that was my my
target

53
00:03:18,669 --> 00:03:23,410
and ended and in the league and the
first version

54
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:26,430
on which was needed was there for us a

55
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:29,500
20 long and latest was there for

56
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,460
not

57
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:34,540
no fifty long soul these are the
division we have

58
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:38,500
and the first Muslim obfuscated which
was there

59
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:43,270
where you'd for for us and makes done
elicits much easier

60
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:46,900
and the latest version waller's

61
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:50,680
a is is much much power for Roy

62
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:55,470
has to roots Stoffer and its they are
able to

63
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:59,530
make screenshots a eats obfuscated
button

64
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:03,320
the the basic stuff be the same so if
you know

65
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,770
and no origin of our older version

66
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:11,250
it's much easier to you to analyse de
newer version because you just find

67
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:14,600
the new stuff and the basic concept is

68
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:19,280
a you already have so hard to I'll tell
me lies how long

69
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,490
to have a be a quick look about their an
application

70
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:26,740
and I used East do was

71
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,980
a roughly tune to get

72
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:33,190
inside information the first i think im

73
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:37,460
is AP ki which are used for a for extra
beat up from a pic is

74
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:40,940
and x2 jarara and GD gooey job

75
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,950
and these are a come on and

76
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:48,580
which is not so popular but I think very
good application is AG logger and

77
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:52,880
AP ki smash at these combinations very
powerful

78
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,590
I I will describe it and

79
00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:00,270
so the pair mission which is needed for
an application is quiet

80
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:03,670
rain and pride big range you needing I

81
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:07,710
that score in the damone main
functionality of the

82
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:12,620
on the up the phone so you will be able
to monitoring

83
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:16,640
although all the star which she's going
we didn't we def on

84
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:23,570
saw action asset on which are interested
by that by the application is also all

85
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:27,550
incoming calls receiving SMS the on
monitoring doubt

86
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:32,820
the house all the on the device so
buttery state and the live stage not to

87
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:33,380
be

88
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,660
a

89
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:38,310
mmm to address evil or or something so
if you

90
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:41,910
burns so much energy or using so much a

91
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:44,920
story John the Divine the Dr able to

92
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,990
a recognize it and then the and

93
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:52,090
turned to speed on not to not to be sole
annoying

94
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:55,100
ass on these are these are the
interesting

95
00:05:55,100 --> 00:06:01,740
action switch which can be an an artist
down the services and the receivers

96
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:05,840
in a in a a number on don't push Katy
Perry Jean

97
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,500
the names are are very good that the
services like a

98
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,360
let up service which is sir I think it's
easy

99
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:18,070
tune to figure out the tracking service
as well

100
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:23,040
saying in on droid services that thinks
which continuously running in there and

101
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,080
about their own saw

102
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,670
a few Buddha the application in

103
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:31,510
in background it's still running saw
these are down these are them

104
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:35,860
core function offer after application
they're easier to remove

105
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:39,840
at service we chill which is and unique

106
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,670
that I think in and in molar

107
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:47,230
on and here i win angle describe

108
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:51,470
and creature I is very interesting

109
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:54,490
down I summer through see if this I

110
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:58,270
action has secured and the phone is
receiving an SMS

111
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:03,390
on the no

112
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:07,280
this this class will be you been
modified about the

113
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,740
about the you want and the content on
day one so the

114
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:15,290
down today told SMS will be we'll be

115
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:19,180
bush to them push to Dec Dirk loss saw

116
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:22,220
a picky smash as i as i mentioned here
to worry

117
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:27,140
you the application and it s two
features are you can't use it

118
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:32,450
my only one or or or both I'll and the
first is just seeking over India

119
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:36,140
this money court for interesting staff
strings

120
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:40,860
eg expresso us and it will be
summarizing the report

121
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,930
that which part could be interesting for
you:

122
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,980
where he is up and

123
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:49,520
a encryption a worries it database

124
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,840
stop or or device taking so on

125
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:57,780
if you would like to know a mmm quickly
analyze an AP ki just

126
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:01,270
just executing you will get the a
detailed report

127
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:06,550
which class could be interesting for
you: and if you use it we do

128
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:10,310
DG longer it can you do

129
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:15,560
patch the now origin are small the final
with DG longer

130
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:19,480
in a interesting part of it and im when
you upload a

131
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:24,480
application to modified application to
the deal I send and running and Paul K

132
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:29,410
and different way it will be trace out
and log out all the activities

133
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:34,040
so you will be gotta I trace log home

134
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:37,479
on the application works and what
happened a few

135
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:40,860
if you stand a messege or or something
soul

136
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:45,070
a in the situation plan manned

137
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:48,710
applications starting he's matter what
are called soul

138
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:52,870
on create the case normal up make
configuration fine

139
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:56,590
I think the resting get confirmation
extra a

140
00:08:56,590 --> 00:09:01,780
P key signature or and and finally in
their easy a base64 decode

141
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:05,580
so long just three dollar and you will
be the

142
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:09,620
you get that get an idea are and the
tile how it this works

143
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:14,130
and for and can be fused and them an SMS
message to the

144
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:18,280
to the device and gives the give the

145
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:22,820
activity and the dates are and on the
bay 64 décor

146
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:28,750
also courts all maybe would like to do
something with your ass amassed in a

147
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:29,950
base64

148
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:34,510
way storm maybe that that we'll be doing
good way to

149
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:37,710
to communicate the application saw

150
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:41,800
it took it to worry very fast they're
way to you to get the

151
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:46,220
view abound ability to function and the
Beeb rhonda

152
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:49,640
up there application saw

153
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:54,540
if we'll if we have to deal with
modernist I think the first thing you

154
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,170
have to figure out

155
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:59,200
I highlights configure how its control

156
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:04,330
but the but to be control you have to
configure to the configuration is always

157
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:05,300
a unwary

158
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:08,690
wary a interesting and and focused on

159
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:12,900
and in the state on things by

160
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:16,230
and Emma group yeah has unwary a

161
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:19,610
good way I think it's a it's a long

162
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:23,510
two very good way to deliver
configuration they use

163
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:26,570
up %um anti by

164
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:30,320
5s to create the worry DT Reid

165
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,300
the Zep fire and age issues and

166
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,500
the records never in this EP fine

167
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,920
to delivery information because things
you find a

168
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,030
and there is a table of contents

169
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:47,600
and in this table of contents you have
up

170
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,870
to and four banks for ittt in turn on a
trip with and exon of trouble

171
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:58,360
and if youth not use you have six Pines
each fide

172
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,530
and you can put something there for day
use the sinks

173
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:06,560
by to you a point a be solved the

174
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,810
Bay 64 at to the up to

175
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:14,070
down and dizzy price so that was the way
how the

176
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:17,750
the splayed their origin are am
B-sixteen

177
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:21,830
up for a training and yes but it to PCs
and their

178
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:23,230
I am and

179
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:26,530
put to def 6 bytes and

180
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:30,350
PCs on

181
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:34,040
I I do not the no I didn't a

182
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:37,280
on mmm mmm right there

183
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:41,080
on at Scripps to to extractor on lies
the thing

184
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:45,590
I just copying the origin of stores from
the mall her I created a

185
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:48,970
I and annual I am

186
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:52,130
java project to do origin ass or school
folder

187
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:56,240
Malvar that that part of which belongs
to the

188
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,930
the extraction and and I use it to axe
threatened

189
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:03,380
a the configuration I think it

190
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:07,270
itself already factoring or something so
you don't have to ride

191
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:11,320
a cool stuff you can use their the stuff
of the mall or

192
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,370
as well so if we analyzed the

193
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:20,330
the configuration there are very
interesting properties and and thinks we

194
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:24,330
we fall sold the first-team berries and

195
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:28,800
hardly think they're law and the
inference by everything you know is a

196
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,970
based on heart beat so hard meat could
be triggered by

197
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:35,830
time that's rare and its can be
triggered by

198
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:39,250
even soul they didn't make communication

199
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:42,560
just because the always have a purpose
tho

200
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,710
you have a new message ok it's
interesting stuff I with %uh

201
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:49,860
sandy this information to the master or
or

202
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:53,060
you change the SIM card or something

203
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:56,320
eso that would be on the trigger on to

204
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,770
and the communication there at two
non-traditional

205
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:04,510
I property remove a day so we'd
configuration the

206
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:07,750
then they can decorate the day which
which

207
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:11,950
and on the infection so if the phone
region that day

208
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:15,200
just disinfect the the fornix comes from

209
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,660
I think the law most of the country has
a

210
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:21,730
straight low how you would be I

211
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:27,320
money to rise and they always have a
time frame for it so there is no

212
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,780
no chance to in fact the fall on and

213
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:34,970
just lackey infected mine because maybe
there will be something interesting so

214
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:39,570
that you have to decorate a a for
because it's at that date on that's the

215
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:41,790
reason 30 but it could be a

216
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:44,830
a time thought da other interesting

217
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:47,890
a what the f if there is no connection

218
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:51,100
we did proxy saw they get the on

219
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:54,700
saloon the control you have to decorate
their

220
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:59,320
a time frame when when it has to be
disinfected because you lose the Contra

221
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,110
so you done

222
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:03,620
dunno and the phone is used by your
targeted

223
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:06,710
the mcpherson or or maybe

224
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:09,740
just sell it or or its its form

225
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:13,370
so you have to you have to be a sure
about not

226
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:16,390
not to monitor riser or or and

227
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:20,030
do malicious tough week we did and
innocent people

228
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:23,840
soul proxies a proxy port

229
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,340
tradition are and nothing threatening
Dez

230
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:30,950
away if the first I thing this is the

231
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:34,130
the GUID and that can be

232
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:37,470
that could be that's their as: key
that's their

233
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:41,589
only part on the 80 S key which can be
configured

234
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:46,260
by the by the the question where is it a
user

235
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,550
the intelligent agency that police
agency so

236
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:52,780
that's their on the app Unity Day have a

237
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:56,480
that's their own a encryption key

238
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:01,040
so that for by it's a form right way

239
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,730
and there is too much a number less
money is a

240
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:07,970
a master phone number reach in

241
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:10,980
can be used if you do not have the

242
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:15,730
good net for connection or you use this
way for communication

243
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:21,080
the fall on a.m. can control it and then
did give today tell

244
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:24,390
by SMS is so it could be a lil late had
a two-channel

245
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:27,620
and now Voice phone amy is the

246
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:31,600
is a special phone number which turns
the device in place by Mon

247
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,240
so if there is a incoming call from that
number

248
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,830
and on the phone to instill

249
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:42,230
and mean in spinal and for these are the

250
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:46,290
denied the heartbeat demands so what

251
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:49,810
kinda UNC you are interesting a

252
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:53,070
for buchanan you can configured the

253
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:57,720
device as you would like to and missing
the interesting part I think the

254
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,520
restriction

255
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:03,300
so you can you can a you can configure
reaching way

256
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,310
could be used for for communications saw

257
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:09,730
maybe you turn of all the ways and using

258
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:14,310
just use for example the 3G which is
quite tricky to

259
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:18,210
Toumani Toure I saw if someone is miss

260
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:21,810
mmm I put someone would like to
monitoring their

261
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:25,680
the NetWorker 3G net for communication
you

262
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,020
have to use mmm something gas or or

263
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:32,880
bps or something because the in in wifi

264
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:37,390
it's very easy and to monitoring net for
a connection stand and detail

265
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:40,940
but the ending 3 G's is difficult or in
Dewani

266
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:43,990
to be silent just turn all a

267
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:47,960
options of and the application where do
nothing

268
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:52,340
and you can also

269
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:55,980
the configured which more do this you
would like to use

270
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:59,510
during the during the monitoring session

271
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:03,590
a which also means then the application
always carrying

272
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:07,100
older all the functionalities all the
models which

273
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:10,130
not a good idea I think because if you

274
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:13,810
lost the application you list all your
models

275
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:17,000
still

276
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,250
after a quick analysis a.m. I've found a

277
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:23,480
phone the way how to gotta

278
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,720
the on the difference wife devices

279
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,760
infected with the supplication down we

280
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,860
this way you can you can def take care
the

281
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:36,470
exist after after application saw on

282
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:40,190
the receive bar national 3 few bar that

283
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,200
that

284
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,420
on the decor barfi saw

285
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:47,610
detailed SMS just decoded

286
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:50,800
as up to base64 so it has to be a

287
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:54,250
Bay 64 a string eight students to

288
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:58,300
up now by Terry the first for

289
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:02,629
by it nothing thirsting can just keep
the second for by

290
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:06,930
these an integer and it could be

291
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:12,050
to integer and in the situation you
enter in the east

292
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:17,950
are the called and find any its aboard
the broadcasts on that means if you put

293
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:21,470
these one of B's their number thing the
right

294
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:27,230
position at Dec holding may 64 and send
it to the phone which is infecting

295
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:32,270
that we ll a the trio aboard the
broadcasting so you won't get the

296
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:33,010
message

297
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:36,880
one be not if I about a message has been
received

298
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,300
stole that the

299
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:44,500
that's the that the bike part of it in
France by

300
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,870
everything he's to a type length where
you

301
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:51,060
blank type player so that's that's the
better

302
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:55,170
fracture so the am always four by and
for Clank

303
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:59,700
for a bite for type for by plank type

304
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:04,830
and data and the data could be another
packet it so we're easy and and old

305
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:07,930
technique staying in net therapy I am

306
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:13,010
protocols to and earned it I plan for
you you guys at the top structure

307
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:16,240
soul let's in fact the

308
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,100
device

309
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,870
so I have a I have a

310
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,919
piece by here and I just in Stony

311
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:32,330
and that way could be most of the times
the real way because

312
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:36,549
ion spying agencies police agencies in

313
00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:41,159
mother to month at the time they have
the ability to get the phone

314
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:44,379
in some circus at these circumstances
and and

315
00:19:44,379 --> 00:19:48,830
got in fact it so it's not over and over
and

316
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:53,690
because mmm also the time they are they
are just lock Ali fork with

317
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:57,919
soul a on I all the creamy Knaus

318
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:02,350
are are data on the country different
parts so there is no ni

319
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:06,720
to infect someone up other parts of the
bird because it's

320
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,919
not your your target percent you're
creaming off in

321
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:13,750
locally and maybe you can you can do. we

322
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:17,059
yeah with the infection storm

323
00:20:17,059 --> 00:20:23,480
and now owned fees by atheist on but the

324
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:30,480
it's not finished

325
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,460
yeah and

326
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:50,429
so there is no file in a now order

327
00:20:50,429 --> 00:20:55,909
but now I stand a message to the device
an SMS message

328
00:20:55,909 --> 00:20:59,289
and there are plenty of of activity

329
00:20:59,289 --> 00:21:02,370
activities which can trigger and to to

330
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:06,269
mas tarde the defeats by soul

331
00:21:06,269 --> 00:21:11,580
use the device and if everything's Vera

332
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:14,720
properly I will receive a message there

333
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:21,720
yeah saw it's alright

334
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:29,419
and yeah

335
00:21:29,419 --> 00:21:32,549
stall days and you'll find Sol

336
00:21:32,549 --> 00:21:36,600
that application just started and its
extract the

337
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:40,149
the contribution the DUP from the AP ki
and it saved

338
00:21:40,149 --> 00:21:44,039
in the in now private for their as their
40

339
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:47,369
and have 84 see doc

340
00:21:47,369 --> 00:21:51,039
and that define this so

341
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:55,679
way region actor all day long salwen and
a confirmation fight is not

342
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:58,999
encrypting for you can see it's come our

343
00:21:58,999 --> 00:22:02,119
a quality of service by:

344
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:06,450
the departure and there are some phone
number so that's the

345
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:09,929
the configuration of the on the form now

346
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:14,340
okay so we have a deal I S

347
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:18,200
anthology the an hour I am

348
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:22,190
mmm piece by on on them so hard to debug

349
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:26,919
that letters were easy because just
three the word the court figure oliver

350
00:22:26,919 --> 00:22:28,730
and what should be good

351
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:32,129
on and and be I'm

352
00:22:32,129 --> 00:22:35,509
and could do this but then

353
00:22:35,509 --> 00:22:40,320
if you would like to rivers engine anger
for protocol or service season

354
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,970
star the you have to be bad application
because

355
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:47,549
its difficult to make it in in paper or
mine

356
00:22:47,549 --> 00:22:50,769
because it's difficult psalm and

357
00:22:50,769 --> 00:22:54,600
repair King to mean could be the these
yes to wait to you

358
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:58,210
to solve this problem just axed around

359
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:01,820
on on day AP ki fine

360
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:05,070
we did at AP ki 20

361
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:10,289
up minus the which means the three a bf
fijian of I

362
00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:15,090
I'll and a it could be open we need the

363
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:18,190
and weed at clips and which could be

364
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:22,239
a used a 22 de boda

365
00:23:22,239 --> 00:23:27,139
the application psalm and and you have
to spend so much our

366
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:30,739
in in a debugger to trace and and step
over and and

367
00:23:30,739 --> 00:23:34,879
figure out how it works if you don't
want to touch application

368
00:23:34,879 --> 00:23:38,590
iight it's a difficult part where you
have to use

369
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:41,720
other other away for example a

370
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:45,720
you dizzy good what are to to waiting
for new application and if

371
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,899
there is new process: just hooking into
the

372
00:23:48,899 --> 00:23:51,909
the process which means you don't have
to to

373
00:23:51,909 --> 00:23:56,639
mmm changed AP ki which means you change
that signature Sr

374
00:23:56,639 --> 00:23:59,990
or something so on I that that

375
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:04,870
I'm a better early to to morning to rise
and and and this way you can change the

376
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:05,990
application as well

377
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:09,830
so only if there is there and knowing
function that they are or something you

378
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:14,440
me just ignore it or turned off Sol

379
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,570
and the next step that their
communication which

380
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:21,049
their should be checked I am it's always

381
00:24:21,049 --> 00:24:24,340
the interesting what but the

382
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:29,919
the done after a protocol hollowed
application all the mall verbal like to

383
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:30,659
communicate

384
00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:34,240
we deserve each days in a and I'm

385
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,460
configuration so I just the create their

386
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:41,210
on a freak server it was very difficult

387
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:44,610
and their use the use a ITT

388
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:48,870
a mmm keep it a bus to

389
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:52,850
up hijack the come onto

390
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:56,059
to you another catch to catch the
communication

391
00:24:56,059 --> 00:25:00,340
to emulate yeah a fake bomb so what is
the park at I

392
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:03,539
I we seen and now we know that first

393
00:25:03,539 --> 00:25:06,629
for binding if the pocket side

394
00:25:06,629 --> 00:25:09,860
the type of the bucket and the data okay
and

395
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:13,110
150 data and ate out is jus

396
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:17,169
in the number on their after four the
form which

397
00:25:17,169 --> 00:25:22,379
reach just infected so that means the
first packet contains

398
00:25:22,379 --> 00:25:26,580
the main number on this phone and you
will see why

399
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:31,500
worry wary creepy and

400
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,610
Sol and and a

401
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:38,070
he read the encryption handcrafted part
of their

402
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:41,490
up to after data so if we got here

403
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:45,120
the have to focus on on the

404
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,270
on the

405
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:49,700
encryption Park so that's the

406
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:53,000
that's the ion

407
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,010
heighten implementation on their

408
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:59,419
on the on the encryption I am

409
00:25:59,419 --> 00:26:02,950
partner there I application day use to

410
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:06,850
and edit key the ski are continuously

411
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:10,460
used and Daxter only key what is used

412
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:13,460
thought that and DEF and

413
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:17,990
the Oni only the possibility to changes

414
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:21,600
just before buying which comes from the
conflagration

415
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,770
configuration 5 and their missus

416
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:29,049
for by day that turrentine to

417
00:26:29,049 --> 00:26:32,390
streaming solely will be 89 min

418
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:35,820
we know it did the source was for so
it's for

419
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:39,740
a and that's the way Persian origin are
key

420
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:43,100
whose depth stop he get that the Jets
that BB dickey

421
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:46,190
and second that would be a initial a key
and

422
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:50,070
heads the that the encryption older all
difference by has

423
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:53,419
this be set so you shouldn't and

424
00:26:53,419 --> 00:26:57,770
in in my in my drop leading

425
00:26:57,770 --> 00:27:02,380
digital the ocean I just just start my
script to read a mystery

426
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:06,640
which can seek or a we do pick-up 5 a

427
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,179
seeking for 2004 by which can be good
too

428
00:27:10,179 --> 00:27:13,390
to pick up their the right back it and
then

429
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:17,299
e-reader and cryptic bar and just brute
force it because

430
00:27:17,299 --> 00:27:22,440
the the biggest bar the debt yes key you
already know and soldiers

431
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:26,090
for but you have to brute-force and
Indias

432
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:30,029
in the situation we decide where you its
takes the

433
00:27:30,029 --> 00:27:34,020
takes on the four minutes for a five
dollar

434
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:37,809
the cloud server if you are not so lucky
soul means

435
00:27:37,809 --> 00:27:41,830
a fat than donde and

436
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:44,960
the space it maybe takes 30 are in

437
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,049
in a you know heightened

438
00:27:48,049 --> 00:27:52,090
and court so I not not the Rio and not
the good

439
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:55,190
way to to and creep something

440
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:57,690
in the normal the way in a normal way

441
00:27:57,690 --> 00:28:04,240
you can defeat de cinq reaction in
minutes soul

442
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,340
must there come on on yeah

443
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:10,559
if you remember there are two numbers to
reach kid

444
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:13,610
a could be good yeah and and

445
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:17,919
ignored by the application so it's just
been a

446
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:21,090
stop the broadcasting saw these two
types a

447
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:26,879
offer the message is is interesting and
used the first is a

448
00:28:26,879 --> 00:28:30,340
the monster.com on Mastercam on as 2 per
person

449
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:33,669
foresees acknowledgement the previous
and the

450
00:28:33,669 --> 00:28:37,059
and mmm send some new and knees the

451
00:28:37,059 --> 00:28:41,399
Commons can be uninstall the application
immediately

452
00:28:41,399 --> 00:28:44,679
because base some trouble I

453
00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:48,080
you can force the Asha mash SMS away

454
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:52,370
well we def come on or you can for the
network connection

455
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:56,700
testings purpose are are you have new
configuration or something

456
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:00,860
just send a message to their phone come
to home and I have to

457
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:05,409
te something to you or or something and
you can start the

458
00:29:05,409 --> 00:29:10,669
the tracking surveys and stop on and
stop it so long way if you would like to

459
00:29:10,669 --> 00:29:11,919
track someone just

460
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:16,539
San message trucking is starting collect
the data and when you would like to

461
00:29:16,539 --> 00:29:17,120
finish in

462
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,929
just send the different the type and and
their it we haven't finished

463
00:29:20,929 --> 00:29:24,039
on I think a

464
00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:27,080
the SMS is very good way I'll I

465
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:30,870
because most under mustered up part in
Bern

466
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:33,980
a GSM service are available

467
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:37,620
so you 1 got long you want laws the

468
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:38,600
the

469
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,920
the controller device because it's much

470
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:46,610

00:37:44,789 --> 00:37:51,789
for connections on and

586
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:58,640
here you can you can see the

587
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,820
up the hymie in Terrebonne so home how
often

588

minutes or

590
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:14,640
now we have to wait and done that for a
implementation of its quite tricky

591
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,170
because it's full week sleep then stop

592
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:20,250
see if you do not have the good
connection

593
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:25,020
it cleaned could rub the con I
connection then you can see

594
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:29,470
it soon will need only their hand cheney
and that's the name

595
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:33,580
on the device I it's good coming from
the

596
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:37,290
mmm configuration that the main number

597
00:38:37,290 --> 00:38:40,710
that's the location and

598
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:44,820
counter-terrorist soul and as you can
see I just

599
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:49,410
and just after the fall onto town mean
they're the collected fide least

600
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:52,980
here and and I just the

601
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:56,240
it to rate and then use these finest

602
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,660
had to get all the detail trauma from
the

603
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:03,430
from the vice and to have a better
viewing

604
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:06,740
I'm just crane the

605
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:13,740
asked of to to lead this

606
00:39:16,370 --> 00:39:18,710
yeah

607
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:22,230
soul these are the messages year

608
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:25,380
and here saw

609
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:29,070
I was able to to reconfigured to do is:

610
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:33,900
and the and Lunt from with with night
with my server

611
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:36,950
we do very implementation there are the
contacts

612
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:40,190
soul Don Cornell now

613
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:43,640
and on and other other malicious

614
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:50,640
malicious people soul

615
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:58,090
I I think it's it is query scary thing
because this

616
00:39:58,090 --> 00:40:02,420
the application East for for government
agencies

617
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:05,430
who has the the limited right to
collecting

618
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:08,450
and monitoring a I am

619
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:11,780
maybe malicious or or or evil

620
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:18,600
I now person but the it has to be wary
streaked and limited and secular

621
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:22,480
because it's prided the Tar and and

622
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,940
them the they have to do it you know

623
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:30,770
you know wary writing in The given way I
thing because

624
00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:34,390
if you are just there I targeted people

625
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:38,160
I your device is infected and malicious
people

626
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:42,130
can hijack your phone and looted and it
could be a very

627
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:45,330
wearing back story I think better the
lot

628
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:49,600
last the mauna file I i received from

629
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:53,000
I like this that I we do media jeera

630
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:58,040
your ask reid it was she'll be it wasn't
obfuscating the the

631
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:02,960
we'd sheared forgy I must the scary
thing it's

632
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,040
the I used the differ and the same

633
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:09,510
I am wait to be configured the theme

634
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:13,180
theme by values which for me

635
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:16,260
it's very good because for for signature

636
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:19,580
it's very represent that the so if you
use the Commons

637
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:23,130
and the Commons are more than 100 you
are

638
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:27,580
100 a chance to to have a good detection
for it saw

639
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:31,380
II and don't understand why one day
after using this

640
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:34,460
what most a on but

641
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:37,880
much mirth he's done is the

642
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:41,560
as: keys Dr still the same and them

643
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:45,180
II I am seem so many

644
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:48,210
version of the of spin things by

645
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:51,780
and embedded he was always the same

646
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:54,800
which is the home which is the

647
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:59,910
very very bad thing

648
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:02,550
so I mean and Ameren for

649
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:06,140
dot 21 and you can you can

650
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:09,320
and you can hijack the phone

651
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:13,060
were easily you can the wreck on for
your and

652
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:17,910
and looted if you want a and the latest
the marriage in

653
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:22,110
I'll on and down encryption keys always

654
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:26,160
the the same and the only chance to

655
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:29,720
have your your own key is just for by
pictures

656
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:33,180
which is a an joke and and its worry

657
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:36,440
Marie hair few salt for me

658
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:41,290
that that's means that the these protect
has very good

659
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:46,330
parts because the SMS barred the
configuration part how they come

660
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:50,780
hold a deal either the configuration and
these are very good so

661
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:54,310
I think they're not stupid ion

662
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:57,900
but I think a the dank reaction parties

663
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:01,850
intentionally intentionally we to let

664
00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:07,800
other Arab countries are some countries
tomb be able on monitoring and and

665
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:12,310
just just ignore their than Creek shown
because if you know the way if you have

666
00:43:12,310 --> 00:43:12,970
the ski

667
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:16,390
a few have this knowledge it's very easy
to

668
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:19,660
to 2d and to defeat

669
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:23,370
and get all the information and this the
miss brockbank

670
00:43:23,370 --> 00:43:26,730
cell learn to earn they use the by

671
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:30,910
my tour agencies who I'm

672
00:43:30,910 --> 00:43:34,000
doesn't have that ability and in on each
to

673
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,690
to I'm lies an application like this
just using

674
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:42,810
a and maturing did they provide
information for other countries

675
00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:46,210
abound a ring to rest and they are
targeted

676
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:50,140
person and and so i i think that depth
would be

677
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:53,510
for mean that's the only on the on

678
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:58,690
reason other thing why only for by could
be used because in configuration you can

679
00:43:58,690 --> 00:43:59,210
use

680
00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:03,680
I any any name for the device and this
name could be

681
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:07,150
as long as you on so and the technology
has

682
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:09,950
and ability to use as

683
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:13,950
long key if you would like to but it
straight to for Beitzel

684
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:17,910
that first step

685
00:44:17,910 --> 00:44:20,970
presentation if you have any question
its welcomed
