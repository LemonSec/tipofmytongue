1
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:09,810
morning robust actually this one plan
initially

2
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:17,350
but that due to say

3
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:21,020
popular popular request so many guys
like showing up

4
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:24,769
can you play a video game all right
mister yesterday that's why we decided

5
00:00:24,769 --> 00:00:26,699
to do it and I think it was a good way

6
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:31,539
getting into today next to those who got

7
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:35,649
into that day by participating the run

8
00:00:35,649 --> 00:00:39,809
I not many of them I hear I see some
places

9
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:43,870
some %uh standard what's kind of but the

10
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:47,700
the run was great packet loss was great
ass

11
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,539
from what a hot Pro Plus was great so
far

12
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:56,730
I'm a happy man and I'm very happy that
we can get into the second day

13
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:02,250
was mild cramps I get process test two
guys who have been

14
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:07,380
contributing in the sense of the talk
our keynote

15
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:12,090
to H in which the additional 20 percent
say

16
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:15,090
since a close one that is our Rico

17
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:18,439
of right way to go I already here

18
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:21,570
that if so I would have been surprised
but

19
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:25,340
hush fell over you have you should make
jokes on

20
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:28,820
yes you do there on what did he do the
run

21
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:32,979
naw I N but that was the

22
00:01:32,979 --> 00:01:37,070
there was a hop number of because cell I
was really impressed and

23
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:40,860
of course I was impressed with everybody
else tool that what I saw

24
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,140
already struggling I'm but our body
Wichita

25
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:48,369
Sol that was good site brought us

26
00:01:48,369 --> 00:01:51,720
up yeah

27
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:57,940
second the

28
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:04,180
thing I'm so over a lot from second
stage

29
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:07,820
okay feel like crap

30
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:11,630
to a bus and railway you can wind s
thats

31
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:15,210
as the enterprise tough day after China
just collective haul

32
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:18,850
with him and at think that start lotto
tickets will be put in a bowl

33
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:22,090
%uh here a holy cause looks

34
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:25,140
K picking dollars I'm going to

35
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:29,320
all iPad actually a passion

36
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,920
and now's hagit K go ahead thank you

37
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,150
think Anna great to be here I A
absolutely love this

38
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:41,320
place and I absolutely love the so dense
so thank you for having me

39
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:46,420
of my somewhat disorganized keynote is
going to be called my favorite things

40
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:49,550
I was thinking I have I a better title
but

41
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:53,850
you now here we're stuck with this one
and favorite things come in all shapes

42
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:54,959
and sizes

43
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,500
you now raindrops on roses whiskers on
kittens August

44
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,030
arranged in their relative importance
for the internet

45
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:06,019
are sometimes things with tentacles on
these

46
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:09,830
Arshad births a might go once that sort
of thing

47
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:14,040
and I just could not resist a another a
picture of that kind

48
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,489
well my favorite things as you might
know all weird

49
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:22,130
not just that not not as weird as I'll a
kiss on the prettiest slides

50
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:25,970
abut they're weird and impossible shell

51
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:29,160
you have those impossible problems %uh

52
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:33,100
laws of nature things that you key
employees thank you

53
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:36,940
things that you can strive against
things that you should learn to work

54
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:37,709
around

55
00:03:37,709 --> 00:03:40,970
the halting problem and

56
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:45,150
hot even more undecidable things well
now there's only one this

57
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:48,510
on the side ability that is connected
with two things

58
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:52,620
two programs to compete national systems
seeing a different thing

59
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:56,510
I surfacing different things when you
show them this one

60
00:03:56,510 --> 00:04:00,769
%ah message stream a packet

61
00:04:00,769 --> 00:04:04,530
a exploit cell right programs that

62
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:08,570
a run on programs than actually run
programs and of course we all know and

63
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:09,090
love this

64
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:10,590
as exploits

65
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:15,170
in the more reason why we have so many
the reason why things are still broken

66
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:15,900
and

67
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:19,220
I'll will remain broken a for years to
come

68
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:23,050
is actually a hard a mathematical fact

69
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:26,199
that some things are simply not
computable

70
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:30,150
show let's get into the diff between the
first

71
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:33,530
days keynote and the second is kidnapped
first

72
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:38,100
I the thought though the first one was
about things that the hard this one is

73
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,540
more about things that are probably
impossible

74
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:43,610
in the difference between the heart and
possible

75
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:48,130
is just the same thing as it between
safe flight or by engineering

76
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:53,090
21st century a and things like perpetual
motion so flight

77
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:57,490
is worth struggling for a perpetual
motion is not with inventing

78
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:00,740
is not worth trying to invent hard all
get figured out

79
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:05,180
impossible just keep failing and so when
you're doing something over and over

80
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,169
again and nothing good comes out

81
00:05:07,169 --> 00:05:10,910
up question is maybe this is impossible
not hard

82
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:14,740
in the second thing is up complexity

83
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:18,560
well complexity is hard

84
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,650
and sometimes impossible but the thing
about complexity it's not

85
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:26,729
all created you'll at taken airplay its

86
00:05:26,729 --> 00:05:30,169
delicately complex yet we trust
ourselves

87
00:05:30,169 --> 00:05:34,610
to them in they do just don't do that
badly as technology goals

88
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:38,000
on the other hand again on the other
hand again some things are just

89
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,110
play not there so this landscape
complexity landscape has

90
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:46,590
cliffs and the basis and i win

91
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:50,330
you are building something it pays to

92
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:54,880
steer clear over those sheer drops so I
must know when the wind up and we

93
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,729
haven't been

94
00:05:55,729 --> 00:05:59,130
so far and the los diferentes

95
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:03,930
is that I'll of her own deplored that
people are leaving for

96
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,930
offense I 810 to cheer on that

97
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:11,229
because offense is what drives science
the choir pollution

98
00:06:11,229 --> 00:06:16,820
up offense and defense what us the
understanding oh why things are insecure

99
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:20,710
it will continue to do so up John
Lambert

100
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:23,769
us said that defense is offenses child

101
00:06:23,769 --> 00:06:27,659
another great saying but which I cannot
attribute at the time

102
00:06:27,659 --> 00:06:32,249
up a theory of security comes from a
theory of insecurity

103
00:06:32,249 --> 00:06:35,539
again we must understand what is

104
00:06:35,539 --> 00:06:39,309
are going on in order to I'll I secured

105
00:06:39,309 --> 00:06:43,019
we must understand that computation that
happens on the dark side

106
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:46,149
cell we are suffering

107
00:06:46,149 --> 00:06:50,259
chrome a failure over language from the
failure of communication

108
00:06:50,259 --> 00:06:55,549
our exploits are just simply posed by
construction that certain unexpected

109
00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:56,759
competition exists

110
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:00,909
in traditional science what because
you're a day is just called the paper

111
00:07:00,909 --> 00:07:05,159
a new result worth publishing all
science

112
00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:11,759
is up your day it's the search for
things that we don't know yet

113
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,349
so somehow people don't talk about
regulating science papers

114
00:07:16,349 --> 00:07:21,599
but they want to regulate 0 then we'll
come to that welcome to the darkside

115
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:26,189
right this is how you learned about
software

116
00:07:26,189 --> 00:07:30,279
and then this is how you find out it
actually works

117
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:35,479
right and again there is a reason why
the world

118
00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:39,429
I'll looks that way and that reason

119
00:07:39,429 --> 00:07:45,779
is natural law %uh perpetual motion up
we note to clients or other we know that

120
00:07:45,779 --> 00:07:47,079
too kind don't exist

121
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:51,139
you know you can get free work without
energy and

122
00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:55,159
you can't transform energy without loss

123
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:58,399
otherwise both her those machines out
would work

124
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:03,649
and then there is an impossibility in
every area physics wherever you look

125
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:07,609
auspey delight it's very hard to
transcend transcend that

126
00:08:07,609 --> 00:08:10,769
of Heisenberg uncertainty principle at
the quantum scale

127
00:08:10,769 --> 00:08:14,079
and so on hot no matter how hard you try

128
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:18,649
you will not get a solution to those
problems engineers

129
00:08:18,649 --> 00:08:21,979
physical world engineers have been aware
of this

130
00:08:21,979 --> 00:08:27,799
since forever engineering is actually
defined by knowing physical disabilities

131
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:32,169
like their is no loss thus energy
conversion energy conversion as heart

132
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:35,669
I engineers know that

133
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:39,500
I energy preserves is preserved momentum
is preserved

134
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,659
and they work around that that's why
those planes fly

135
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:46,250
so impossibility doesn't mean that this
is imports a boat

136
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:50,410
but out you should never attempt they
have which

137
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:55,300
won't ever work in nature no to limiting
laws and never be as your design

138
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:59,220
on the hope of cheating them this is how
an engineer

139
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:02,370
works how do we work right

140
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:05,990
a mechanical engineer knows what I

141
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:10,000
his and disability is that would be
conservation laws

142
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,399
of normal engineer goes by
thermodynamics laws

143
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:17,490
a computer engineer knows about energy
dissipation

144
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:21,639
and latency being limited and the
quantum effects as you frank the size

145
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:25,250
any of the software engineer what is
your impossibility

146
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:30,110
what should I know what attempt bush
what should I not build ought

147
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:36,000
and you might get something about
certain crypt the problems being heart

148
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,550
this is a problem will live

149
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:44,279
in the world the pollution that
everything is possible

150
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:48,339
in symbolic manipulation this is just
not sole

151
00:09:48,339 --> 00:09:52,610
most our designs of however they work

152
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:56,540
and they were kinda like 'cause those
engines really

153
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:00,639
up they are based on things that

154
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:05,810
jest can't so it took you many to quite
a bit of time

155
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:10,380
from the people who first saw that
certain things are impossible such as

156
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,529
Leonardo da Vinci

157
00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:15,339
we seekers after perpetual motion cease
and desist

158
00:10:15,339 --> 00:10:18,720
but Chu people um

159
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,839
getting to build those things in their
garages and wondering why they don't

160
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:23,899
work again

161
00:10:23,899 --> 00:10:27,009
so it was quite a bit of time right

162
00:10:27,009 --> 00:10:31,259
knowing what not to expect too much

163
00:10:31,259 --> 00:10:35,949
all is a really important

164
00:10:35,949 --> 00:10:39,670
point for an engineer it is up to
scientists

165
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:43,360
to inform that that way so cyber the

166
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,310
whole point ove hot you know the whole a
point of cybernetics

167
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:51,760
up was formulated by target where in
1964

168
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,970
when that the medical modeling was
supposed to rule the world

169
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:58,170
and was supposed to up from produce

170
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:01,320
up on search to all kinds of heart
problems

171
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:06,210
back then he said while the chief duty
is over the mathematician

172
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:10,060
in acting as an advisor to scientists is
to discard them

173
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:14,830
from expecting too much from the
thematic ce now think about that

174
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:20,050
this was the time when we believe ATI
would become commonplace by now

175
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:24,310
well we sorta believed a on the other
side of the wall

176
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:28,030
we start to believe that we would have
communism by year two thousand

177
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:31,120
were a even 1980

178
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,330
instead as they joke they got the we've
got the Olympics

179
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:37,840
up so I'll

180
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:41,900
the world was really a different place
back them in terms of expectations

181
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:46,910
in there was a flaw in it in this law is
with us

182
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:50,790
till this time you have the political
belief

183
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:54,920
acting out being acted out even now that
computers can improve

184
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:58,450
everything and anything because

185
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:02,550
they're just leap a leading symbols and
symbols are easy to manipulate

186
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:07,180
you know we sprinkle computer magic dust
on our power grid will get the smart

187
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:07,650
grid

188
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:12,100
will sprinkle it on %uh something
medical we get the electronic health

189
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:12,960
records

190
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:16,920
and remote medicine and things like that
again

191
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:21,310
do this people stop and think what is
the impossibility here

192
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:24,450
what other physical limits that we
should work against

193
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:27,870
are no they do not so

194
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:31,480
symbols can be a manipulated

195
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:36,560
at deceptively low cost one small scape

196
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,970
one larger scale impossibility strikes

197
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:44,480
physics does not suddenly break down on
this level of human activity

198
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:49,680
the 1979 I wonder the most insightful
papers about computer science

199
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:54,900
out which exists only as a Technical
Report and I will give you a link

200
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:58,350
in my slights as so that he could read
the I think and

201
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:01,410
in its entirety so

202
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:03,870
I propose that I

203
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:07,740
the law of cyber cyber a stolen from
Norbert Wiener

204
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:11,910
is while achieve duty is okay computer
scientist

205
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:15,300
in acting as an advisor to everyone
really

206
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:19,760
because everyone is depending on those
devices on those computations these days

207
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:24,230
is to discard them from expecting too
much from computers

208
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:27,500
and while you're at it I let's make it

209
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:31,090
hocker so a stolen from number two in
there

210
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:34,490
I you saw it here this is the

211
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:38,410
up main Professional Responsibility OBR
hours

212
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:41,460
I put also what is it

213
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:45,730
that's really of heart not just card but
impossible

214
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:50,250
that's analysis but the made-up analysis
of programs

215
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:54,800
right we know all this is a mathematical
result

216
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:59,110
due to the likes a church in touring
that programs are really bad at

217
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:00,480
analyzing programs

218
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,720
and any exploiter niles

219
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:08,930
that all inputs of programs impact you
feel this program

220
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:12,650
any input whatsoever any changes state

221
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:17,800
and perform some computation your you
put is really the program your program

222
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,260
is really the processor

223
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:23,150
everything is an interpreter it follows

224
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:26,210
that programs are bad at analyzing

225
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:29,750
inputs and so we must know

226
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:33,310
just how bad they are and avoid

227
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:36,750
are those cases when we strike
impossibility

228
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:40,900
of course %uh the put most

229
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:44,120
though well-known formulation well
there's some possibility

230
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:48,380
is the halting problem since I come from
the College where doctor seuss

231
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:51,830
are went to school I i cant reach you to
the

232
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:55,790
are a sketcher the proof right

233
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:59,200
but no general procedure for bud checks
will do

234
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,530
no general procedure for verifying

235
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:06,580
if a program holds or does anything one
treaty

236
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:10,660
known as I says the room I will deal not
one just asserted

237
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:13,800
I'll prove it to you well I won't I'll
just sketch

238
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,330
both that although you might work till
you drop you cannot tell

239
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:20,399
if the competition will stop of stopping

240
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,709
is a non-trivial property there are many
others

241
00:15:23,709 --> 00:15:27,240
so basically

242
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:31,200
at the halting problem is up proven

243
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,420
this way this is the your dog

244
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:39,579
arm proof I heard you had a program for
analyzing programs

245
00:15:39,579 --> 00:15:44,019
cell I put the program that analyzes
programs

246
00:15:44,019 --> 00:15:49,290
into a program for you to analyze this
is how the proof schedule goes

247
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:54,000
I you have you assume that you do have
such a program

248
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,660
and I you faded to itself

249
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:02,230
and then you arrive at the contradiction
I won't bore you with the details

250
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:07,339
but this is really as much as other
proof that much of the proof as their is

251
00:16:07,339 --> 00:16:11,420
I applying this ostensibly existing
program to itself

252
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:14,610
and you will a get I N

253
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:18,180
ad absurdum cell you heard this before

254
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:23,649
right this is one of the paradoxes that
are at the core of mathematics

255
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:27,610
at the core of the set theory that where
resolving

256
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:31,029
with chills like a tight phiri if you
like haskell

257
00:16:31,029 --> 00:16:34,709
than the this is really one of the
reasons I promise you

258
00:16:34,709 --> 00:16:37,850
I try to do this I had to redo the

259
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:42,060
Bertrand Russell a a paradox with a
hacker but K

260
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:45,180
you now can the hacker hack himself

261
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:48,839
let's stop on thick

262
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:52,180
see here is our most favor it

263
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:57,140
are more dull all the general-purpose
computer inputs versus programs

264
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:00,410
right I there is this enlist tape

265
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:03,690
which represents input and

266
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:07,400
there is this state machine which you
can sync I'll as your processor

267
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:11,800
that sits in between and you know it
reads and writes from the tape

268
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:15,629
this is the most powerful computing
device I

269
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:20,490
this is the most powerful computing more
though your processors are essentially

270
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:24,100
in a sense are equal to the apt of
course

271
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:27,220
what this is what we see in reality

272
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,840
we see angry bits and

273
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,950
I destroyed a pic castles but

274
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:39,240
again this very its depending on the
kinds of automata we have

275
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:44,049
so general purpose processors are get
out there okay

276
00:17:44,049 --> 00:17:49,730
right I we don't see a rock out to
processors every day

277
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:53,990
and final potomac to are okay

278
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:59,250
so underside ability does not apply to
them you know those birds are

279
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:02,799
not really that angry I mean we're right
elevators

280
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,399
every day and your elevator is your
typical finite automaton

281
00:18:06,399 --> 00:18:10,279
and then of course we come to a
general-purpose programming

282
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:13,700
if you don't recognize this code I will
I replayed

283
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:19,090
a I shortly air and ya that's when we
have

284
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:22,539
I really really angry birds and

285
00:18:22,539 --> 00:18:26,179
in fact up we r completely screwed there

286
00:18:26,179 --> 00:18:30,130
that code was by the way from the hardly

287
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:33,899
said really angry bird there

288
00:18:33,899 --> 00:18:37,330
okay so again on storing the

289
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:40,620
a possible criticism alf of course every
bob

290
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:44,419
once it's been explained is trivial
hindsight is 20/20

291
00:18:44,419 --> 00:18:48,299
you know what else is 20/20 perfect
vision

292
00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:51,679
%uh you now workplace

293
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:56,510
safety rules are hindsight to in Russian
we have this

294
00:18:56,510 --> 00:19:00,470
I a saying that workplace safety rules

295
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:04,120
are written in blood for every case

296
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:07,549
other is for every rule there is a
really nasty

297
00:19:07,549 --> 00:19:12,450
Keiser course so such

298
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:16,000
hindsight is really overdue in software

299
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,950
and so instead of out not checking
voltage with our fingers

300
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:24,940
we should basically avoid solving the
halting problem

301
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:29,200
we should avoid basing our designs one
thing's a talk

302
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,549
impossible not just heart and of course

303
00:19:32,549 --> 00:19:34,120
there are some others and I

304
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:37,470
you now I really like those posters a

305
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:41,080
now don't stack up your breaks too high

306
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:45,490
doneski and where people are using I'll
fly under where people are using tools

307
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:48,760
done big under a

308
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:53,440
have each axis tel right in a forceful
of

309
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,820
but I we start to program

310
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:00,190
and when we need to work right

311
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:05,100
you I cannot permanently exist in the
state of paranoia

312
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:09,169
show there is somewhere a lie after
which

313
00:20:09,169 --> 00:20:12,769
you stop up I'll

314
00:20:12,769 --> 00:20:15,909
worrying about your inputs and

315
00:20:15,909 --> 00:20:19,830
then you can do dangerous things like
may look mm Korpi

316
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:24,110
and even the arithmetic all those things
that are known to

317
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:29,240
somehow become the neck and for exploits
%uh this is the theory

318
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:34,370
that you have a lead they can imports
you recognized inputs

319
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:37,570
as we assay I'll clarify why

320
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:41,850
and then you're home free and you don't
need to perform those

321
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:46,149
checks all the time because you can't
because they're just so many conditions

322
00:20:46,149 --> 00:20:49,929
in the logical your program that you can
to keep track of them

323
00:20:49,929 --> 00:20:53,899
so there has to be a point when you stop
checking can rely

324
00:20:53,899 --> 00:20:57,860
on some on the result so that check and
they will catch you

325
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:01,250
in reality it works kinda something like
this

326
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:04,279
so they're a their skin boats and it is
a nation

327
00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:08,120
all God what an anti patter you can send
you guys

328
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:11,260
input right I you can't recognize

329
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:15,820
all the badness this is impossible
sanity checks again there is no se ni

330
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:16,649
gene called

331
00:21:16,649 --> 00:21:19,740
there is no saint in computation there's
just

332
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:23,909
what you specify and then of course I
got this happens

333
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:29,029
and your may look the is insufficient
can you ma'am Korpi

334
00:21:29,029 --> 00:21:33,260
overwrites your buffers and you are
integers overflow

335
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:36,309
and their emerges that this cell

336
00:21:36,309 --> 00:21:40,139
%uh Turing machine the weird machine

337
00:21:40,139 --> 00:21:45,480
on which your exploit runs impressionism
okay

338
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:51,250
so I hardly

339
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:54,980
right this is the simplest

340
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:58,980
yep I'll I really disastrous

341
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:03,000
up bud a and it was southbound

342
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,390
in 2014 right how could we kept

343
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:10,530
foretold how could we have said

344
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:13,660
that something about this protocol

345
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:17,240
is a gift that keeps on giving gifts
like this

346
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:20,750
I posit that this is actually quite
simple

347
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:24,130
look at this semtex there is this

348
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:27,390
sl3 record and

349
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:31,130
it has a link any inside that

350
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:34,740
there is another record which also has a
lick

351
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:37,900
now this message this packet

352
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:40,920
is only valid when these

353
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:44,350
two links agree right

354
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:48,140
and show what happens if the

355
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:51,650
disagree whale hardly right

356
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:55,070
here is your packet coming in saying
that

357
00:22:55,070 --> 00:23:00,370
the link for this record is four bytes
law of endless record

358
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:04,230
says that its length which is smaller
than this one

359
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:07,810
is 65,000 bites right

360
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:11,460
which links would you goal by when you
are

361
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:14,920
I running your code and of course

362
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:18,550
a you a have the

363
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:22,510
upon at you believe this length or so

364
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:27,880
hour or so did SSL and you export the
65,000 bites

365
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:31,270
in your heart beat and there goes your
private key

366
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:35,350
but there is a reason why this is
happening

367
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:39,070
right the first read the ad two reasons

368
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:42,270
the first reason is that I

369
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:45,920
you help the same think in Houston Tex
twice

370
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:49,610
the second thing is that the code

371
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:53,230
that parses this message looks like this

372
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:57,780
does this look like a parser to you

373
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,650
does the sparser give you

374
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:03,190
any clue as to what it is expecting

375
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:07,440
for the correct input does the sparse
are you

376
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:12,560
any cool when I should reject a message
can you

377
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:16,760
how much can you really find out by this
coat and the officer

378
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:20,310
is none over this this is why

379
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:25,040
this code will keep one giving syntactic
complexity

380
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:29,320
even with this treaty oak tends to play
those kind of games

381
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:33,540
if you don't %uh defamed against that by
having your

382
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:37,620
code that process is this message all
look alike

383
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:40,640
if really expects a valid

384
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,230
I agree Mr here I you will fail

385
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:48,550
and so you do and this by the way is the
name copy that gives

386
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:52,180
the private key away so

387
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:57,650
this is the patch does the patch solve
the problem

388
00:24:57,650 --> 00:25:02,070
show I'll yeah let's get rid of her
skull

389
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:05,470
this is bad code quite unclear what does

390
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:09,150
let's replace it with this code arm

391
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:12,230
okay so while plus

392
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:15,610
to plus payload plus 16

393
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:19,010
what the hell of those things right

394
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:22,400
what is their relation to the grammar to
the

395
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,870
I valid input that we should accept an

396
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:30,050
act on confidently or I reject it

397
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:35,660
and throw it out before we allocate any
memory whale

398
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:39,520
%uh this is kinda love %uh this is kinda

399
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,550
a little bit better but still you now

400
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:46,020
%ah what are all those up

401
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:50,750
arbitrary constants in the cold it is
not going to get this is not a fix

402
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:55,680
it is not going to get better I is just
one of those things that you should be

403
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,630
careful with

404
00:25:56,630 --> 00:26:00,230
right I your your cold is a dangerous

405
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:04,440
think so it come to this your input

406
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,389
sick up is

407
00:26:06,389 --> 00:26:09,429
a language you should treat it as such

408
00:26:09,429 --> 00:26:13,059
you should write the spec and most
importantly

409
00:26:13,059 --> 00:26:16,929
ya parser code should we need like that
speck

410
00:26:16,929 --> 00:26:20,590
so that you will be able to she for all
the parser code

411
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:25,059
exactly what is the valid a message

412
00:26:25,059 --> 00:26:28,830
that this code is expected to except

413
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:31,889
or reject so

414
00:26:31,889 --> 00:26:36,359
I in on this spot are not surprisingly

415
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:39,999
even possible problems lurk some
languages

416
00:26:39,999 --> 00:26:43,309
are just too hard to recognize

417
00:26:43,309 --> 00:26:47,679
so first you should apply for
recognition

418
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:51,919
before processing that means before you
allocate memory

419
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:55,019
you should be sure work that your
message

420
00:26:55,019 --> 00:27:00,109
is a valid you can be sure if your
message is valid I left that message is

421
00:27:00,109 --> 00:27:01,149
fully defined

422
00:27:01,149 --> 00:27:05,139
so you now I sake with cats

423
00:27:05,139 --> 00:27:09,639
or say it with ASCII this is actually
not

424
00:27:09,639 --> 00:27:14,619
ASCII this is unique code and this is
unique owed by Melissa

425
00:27:14,619 --> 00:27:17,909
a bad idea who works have error code and

426
00:27:17,909 --> 00:27:21,659
writes novels and up owing you winning
songs I

427
00:27:21,659 --> 00:27:26,139
one of the job sell their ego you can
put that principle

428
00:27:26,139 --> 00:27:30,509
in your code it some

429
00:27:30,509 --> 00:27:34,159
it's quite impossible out to know what

430
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:39,299
give privilege to the attacker to not
give the computational privilege

431
00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:43,099
of extra space extra transitions

432
00:27:43,099 --> 00:27:46,779
which exploits are known to exploit

433
00:27:46,779 --> 00:27:51,219
are known to Ron I or one %ah

434
00:27:51,219 --> 00:27:55,289
unless you really structure your code
properly if you don't

435
00:27:55,289 --> 00:27:58,320
if you don't stick to the computational
models

436
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:03,869
%uh that we know work then I your
examples are going to be this trail

437
00:28:03,869 --> 00:28:07,190
right this is the go to failblog

438
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:12,629
implements a state machine we have an
obstruction call the state machine

439
00:28:12,629 --> 00:28:15,809
our computation goes through a buncha
circles

440
00:28:15,809 --> 00:28:19,460
note that in the abstraction that
computation

441
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:23,149
does not escape it does not enter

442
00:28:23,149 --> 00:28:27,029
unexpected state it does not drop shell

443
00:28:27,029 --> 00:28:30,120
it does not become a a weird machine

444
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:34,480
however if you have a state machine

445
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,480
treat it as such you now

446
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:40,929
if you generate your state machine by

447
00:28:40,929 --> 00:28:45,020
up cotton paste whale

448
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:48,240
a one time you will paste one more

449
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,590
up pace than necessary now this is
complexity

450
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:56,179
this complexity and scale you can't

451
00:28:56,179 --> 00:29:00,120
or talk Jan you you can't a medically
check this code

452
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:03,669
because bears no intent

453
00:29:03,669 --> 00:29:08,399
it bears no evidence over the state
machine that you expected

454
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:12,270
to conform to and are predictably

455
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:15,929
it has to feel just once these are the
effects of scale

456
00:29:15,929 --> 00:29:19,830
so just don't do that

457
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:23,490
right don't step on fish I mean it's
this

458
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:29,750
it's this it's that simple I N you might
say well you know so Apple screwed up

459
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:33,500
everyone screws scores up and are we
don't like Apple anyway

460
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:38,110
maybe well I kinda like mine on up but

461
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:43,090
hey get a less hello bach this is the
patch

462
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:46,429
can you guess I'll what went wrong

463
00:29:46,429 --> 00:29:50,740
right misery loves company when you see
a page like this

464
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:55,460
you know your length if you're checking
that the length is greater than

465
00:29:55,460 --> 00:30:01,080
okay right it its most likely a buffer
overflow

466
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:07,600
so I'll this is the wood courts

467
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:12,360
overt remember they also sell three
record you have a record

468
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:15,620
and their record inside

469
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:20,169
and their record inside and the year

470
00:30:20,169 --> 00:30:25,850
in closer Oregon has a link and then
click the in cold record has a link

471
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:29,970
and this a record has a link to and
guess what

472
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:32,870
its only valid if all

473
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:37,020
3 Lancs I add up so

474
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:40,360
of course this is what it takes up

475
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:44,510
this is what it takes %uh to trigger
this blog

476
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:47,700
you jest get those links alt of

477
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:51,880
sink ugh

478
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:55,690
don't do that but I its actually

479
00:30:55,690 --> 00:31:00,830
a little bit more complex than that the
same text class

480
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:04,140
all this %uh language over imports

481
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:08,280
0 away over language that nests or
objects

482
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:12,770
at two %uh a.m. up presumably

483
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:16,860
arbitrary depth well certainly here to
the depth of 3

484
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:19,990
is what we call a context-sensitive link
which

485
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:23,370
context-sensitive language parsers

486
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:27,890
of hard to verify the reason why people

487
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:32,100
up screw up on this is that this is a
really

488
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:36,040
hard problem eventually becomes
impossible will see exactly where

489
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:39,750
so you see the situation over and over
again this is a

490
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:43,120
call a failure patter nested links

491
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:47,500
are about data structure boundaries they
should be handled

492
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:51,480
as syntax they should be checked in the
parser

493
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:55,200
before you actually gramm the attackers

494
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,580
the privilege 12 up ma'am copy

495
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:03,540
and allocate and I'll into Joppa rations
that can overflow

496
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:08,410
so some technical email messages just
should not be allowed through

497
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:13,470
in its your fault for choosing the
syntax

498
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:19,870
in the protocol that's hard to check
okay

499
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:23,580
so anything okay well you now I

500
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:27,480
again another height another twenty 20
right or maybe in

501
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,540
SSL stinks anyway this is I

502
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:35,059
this all cold days and you have to keep
compatibility and

503
00:32:35,059 --> 00:32:39,970
sometimes it's easier to just start over
like with secure channel

504
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:44,320
Microsoft I read decides to

505
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:44,920
a

506
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:48,480
redo the secure transport and this is
new coat

507
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,540
but there's one thing that unites at
with the old code

508
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:58,400
it uses the same day to form a it uses
the same context sensitive

509
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:03,110
of nested links I

510
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:06,280
integers up must agree across the entire
packet

511
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:10,240
kind of syntax ancel this is the

512
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,760
I'll trigger for that all their ability

513
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,890
right you haven't ASL 10 coding

514
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:20,330
type length value several values

515
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:24,060
in the a certificate in the client
certificate

516
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:28,040
that you re ga up your SSL client to
send to the server

517
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:31,510
and the trick is

518
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:34,880
that you don't actually know from this
some coding

519
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,450
from the input on coding how much space
you need

520
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:43,460
you need to compute it then you allocate
memory for that

521
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:46,490
this is where are the problem a bite you

522
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:51,160
because you a in this particular case
they allocate memory before:

523
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:55,750
they competed decoded the message and
the reason why it's hard

524
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:59,190
again there is quite hard to catch and
to test for

525
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:05,200
that this is a context-sensitive
grammars an OK

526
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,909
now all forget

527
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:12,080
I let's go deeper into the land of crypt
are

528
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:15,290
let's go berserk right this is another

529
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:19,800
2004 2014 I'll flaw

530
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:23,419
found in a merciless a an ass

531
00:34:23,419 --> 00:34:29,790
and so as you can imagine a whole bunch
of us software that relies on this

532
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:30,320
library

533
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,429
a is vulnerable in this

534
00:34:33,429 --> 00:34:36,760
is a our parser ambiguity

535
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:41,190
in the aslo y on where can we heard this
before

536
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:44,410
in coded signatures

537
00:34:44,410 --> 00:34:47,900
so this gift will keep on giving right

538
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:51,820
you have complex syntax you have at some
point

539
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:55,240
and on this I double problem in test

540
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:59,860
thing the parsers that out work with
that syntax

541
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:03,369
I which brings me a chill

542
00:35:03,369 --> 00:35:07,390
a my favorite case I'll a parser
differentials

543
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:11,660
you have this these two parsers one
message

544
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:15,530
MAC two different things and two

545
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:18,560
everyone in the up

546
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:22,760
network intrusion detection this is
painfully familiar

547
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:27,190
painfully familiar since 1999

548
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:30,770
formatting your network streams

549
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:35,650
so that the idea sees one thing and then
the target cat machine

550
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:39,020
sees another is I'll

551
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:43,020
whale just the world of pain that we
live in I

552
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:46,340
this applies to x5 online shirts

553
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:50,170
the contents of a cell %uh me berserk

554
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:53,760
and the secure channel syntex

555
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,690
as well well the connection was made in
2000

556
00:35:57,690 --> 00:36:01,250
tap and those

557
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:05,030
it turned out that those kinds of packet
reordering ce

558
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:08,820
that trigger different reassembly
actually

559
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:13,440
apply to coleman names in certificates

560
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,940
so imagine I you should be familiar with
this if you're running

561
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:21,000
anything SSL related I there is a way

562
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,800
to encode the certificate request

563
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,820
so that the signing authority the CA

564
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:32,840
she's one thing in the common name and
the browser

565
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:38,530
the client she is another I'll

566
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:43,770
LSS among their defenders and then
kaminsky

567
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:46,890
were looking for such cases after they'd
found

568
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:50,230
20 o'day this is clearly or day

569
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:54,140
because you can sign any put on domain
in heaven appear

570
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:59,150
till your users as your eBay or your
Amazon

571
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:02,490
after they found twenty they got bored

572
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:06,369
right again there is a reason for that

573
00:37:06,369 --> 00:37:10,099
I you have regular languages

574
00:37:10,099 --> 00:37:13,690
which are fixed width I'll which amp

575
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:17,720
fixed Winfield's a.m. can be parsed
completely

576
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:22,460
by regular expressions yet the
deterministic context-free

577
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:26,130
which can nest objects to are but real
depths

578
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:30,060
but do not include things like killing
fields

579
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:33,460
then you have not deterministic
context-free

580
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:36,630
which is where you get to most all the
formats

581
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:41,119
I mean this would be XML this would be
ipv4

582
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:44,690
except for I'll options

583
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:47,849
and you know how nice options are

584
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:51,810
I mean if you're on the firewall you
probably block them at the border

585
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:55,290
so there is a reason for that if you
have

586
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:58,290
to automata that decide

587
00:37:58,290 --> 00:38:03,330
a language checking

588
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:06,760
if they accept the same language is

589
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:10,140
impossible no laughter how much

590
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:13,250
effort you put into their education no
matter

591
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:17,280
how much effort you put in testing you
will not succeed

592
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:22,570
you need testers will not succeed you
automatic code analysis will not succeed

593
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:26,260
if this in text or killing which is
beyond

594
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:30,770
deterministic context-free air 71 is way
out there

595
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:34,990
in fact there is this decide undecided
Billy T

596
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:39,020
cliff right ipv4

597
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:42,550
without options is here Jason

598
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:46,250
is here XML would be safe except for the

599
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:50,730
MTTs and that's why we have quite a bit
of XML

600
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:54,690
I'll a parser vulnerabilities ipv6

601
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:56,750
with its arbitrarily

602
00:38:56,750 --> 00:39:03,750
chain headers is over the cliff you have
to strike really hard to bring you back

603
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:07,160
on the safe side and this is why

604
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:12,520
you have to drop I hear up to forty
percent of all packets at the border

605
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:15,530
if you care about well formed ipv6

606
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:19,100
X 509 is way in the water

607
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:22,140
out together with the many tentacles
things

608
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:25,250
%uh PDF which

609
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:28,490
Adobe Acrobat actually rewrites

610
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:33,130
that is to say Adobe Acrobat is part of
the machinery

611
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:37,730
on which the exploit Iran's and you
don't know what machinery that the

612
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:38,580
shimmery is

613
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:41,960
because it changes the version to
version flash

614
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:45,540
and of course JavaScript well as during
complete what do you expect

615
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:49,550
you can't analyze those things this is
the halting problem this is the rice is

616
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:50,010
the RAM

617
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:53,190
no cold on earth will be able to tell

618
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:59,150
good been eyeing JavaScript from a non
B-nine JavaScript lol by the way

619
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:02,380
html5 pasqua skating style sheets

620
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:09,090
is Turing complete good luck analyzing
and so basically

621
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:12,150
again we get to this point way and

622
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:15,560
I checking whether

623
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:19,000
Chu machines except

624
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,060
the same language whether Juno Awards in
your clout

625
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:28,160
that use different cold basis will
actually she the same message

626
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:31,520
whether you ides and get target

627
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:35,630
will see the same content and so the IDS
would be able to

628
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:39,290
do something about that that is before
it hits the target I

629
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:42,960
the moment you pick a language that's
outside this

630
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:48,330
safe pale you lose you're solving an
impossible problem you know

631
00:40:48,330 --> 00:40:53,270
oil subscribe to solving us impossible
problem Android

632
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:56,890
right so I Android

633
00:40:56,890 --> 00:41:00,020
packages whale are they come site

634
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:05,210
right and of course %uh you don't want
to rule your own crypto

635
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:09,609
so you take this wonderful crypto
library written in Java

636
00:41:09,609 --> 00:41:13,660
does your verification yeah you know you
just need to unzip it first

637
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:17,380
okay nvm if it verifies

638
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:22,400
then are you go install that and your
installers in C plus plus

639
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,180
because who would want to write them job
anyway alright

640
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:29,470
I is just boring mind-numbingly boring

641
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:33,609
and you know you've checked so now

642
00:41:33,609 --> 00:41:37,529
yellow language that's quite
context-sensitive

643
00:41:37,529 --> 00:41:40,720
outlook at your I unzip format

644
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:44,369
have in fact look at your poker GTFO

645
00:41:44,369 --> 00:41:48,049
I look at the article love on Albertini

646
00:41:48,049 --> 00:41:51,789
on the common formats and how to mistake

647
00:41:51,789 --> 00:41:55,749
those formats for each other right %uh

648
00:41:55,749 --> 00:41:59,170
so again there is a reason for that the
reason

649
00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:02,829
is upbeat syntactic class over the

650
00:42:02,829 --> 00:42:06,680
particular input language specifically
zipping

651
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:10,720
now it just so happens lead Java

652
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:13,829
up %uh the Java

653
00:42:13,829 --> 00:42:17,999
a crypto very fire she is a different
thing

654
00:42:17,999 --> 00:42:24,470
than the sheep last last installer I G c
plus plus have all signed integers

655
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:28,019
Java docent you have different results

656
00:42:28,019 --> 00:42:32,529
up from you a verification you see a
different package

657
00:42:32,529 --> 00:42:36,150
when you verify you install a different
package

658
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:39,259
when you actually pasta verification

659
00:42:39,259 --> 00:42:42,349
this ES a hard problem

660
00:42:42,349 --> 00:42:46,099
this is impossible problem you should
not have been attempted

661
00:42:46,099 --> 00:42:49,609
be cool if there is no automated way

662
00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:53,710
and no general solution to it so

663
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:57,349
the first to try to fix that up by

664
00:42:57,349 --> 00:43:01,769
up catching the parsers to remove those
differences

665
00:43:01,769 --> 00:43:04,940
they failed they finally fixed the
fright

666
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:09,960
they use the same parser for both
verification installation this is the

667
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:10,980
only way

668
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:14,239
any other way will fail and you just

669
00:43:14,239 --> 00:43:18,580
should stop doing that right

670
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:22,000
up show think of how many

671
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,700
instances of different parsers for
complex in taxes

672
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:30,590
are in your %uh systems I

673
00:43:30,590 --> 00:43:34,170
it if they hurt show

674
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:37,740
%uh let's look at something that's us
like a different

675
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:40,920
say here's your HTTP signed in coding

676
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:44,440
right here's your Apache I

677
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:48,380
chigney 2002 right I

678
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:51,760
in 2002 this chunked encoding

679
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:56,970
was found to be liable what is this junk
I'm code it eliminates the need for

680
00:43:56,970 --> 00:43:57,650
constant

681
00:43:57,650 --> 00:44:02,490
Kong are contemplating so basically you
want to start sending your responses

682
00:44:02,490 --> 00:44:03,050
back

683
00:44:03,050 --> 00:44:07,020
before you know how long they are your
traversing a database

684
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:10,480
science other said guide sending back 1

685
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:13,800
%uh single link you send back a bunch of
chunks

686
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:16,890
each preceded by a pic right simple

687
00:44:16,890 --> 00:44:21,270
enough whale not so simple

688
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:24,380
right and what if you're

689
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:28,630
I'll length is kinda big and

690
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:31,900
a sense it's a hexadecimal let's just
say

691
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:35,680
has also going to be she

692
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:39,200
a show %uh this is a I

693
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:42,510
a similar ability that gets triggered
I'll buy

694
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:46,440
a having a longer arm a paleo

695
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:49,710
than expected this is the fix

696
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:55,740
right so off from the fix you can see
what the vulnerability what's

697
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:59,680
says she has BUFSIZE that is being

698
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:04,340
converted 10 on signed int before the
comparison

699
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:08,490
right well of course it was assigned

700
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:11,570
and of course at overflowed

701
00:45:11,570 --> 00:45:15,900
can cause memory corruption simple
enough right

702
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:21,090
you know this is really %uh nineteenth
century construction technology

703
00:45:21,090 --> 00:45:24,160
all we know how to do those things

704
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:27,330
what do we

705
00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:30,420
it took 11 years to discover

706
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:34,260
the exact same thing in engine X

707
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:37,900
so you know when you see a patch like
this

708
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:41,200
now what if the only 0 yeah I really

709
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:46,170
what what what what that well perhaps
you should not continue processing

710
00:45:46,170 --> 00:45:50,140
okay I how did not fail

711
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:53,270
your I am

712
00:45:53,270 --> 00:45:59,160
your engine X is this enormous state
machine we like state machines

713
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:03,300
state machines are regular state
machines are the are kinda computation

714
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:04,410
its easy to come take

715
00:46:04,410 --> 00:46:09,550
except this is the state machine that
bites of one character

716
00:46:09,550 --> 00:46:16,220
in one character at the time so by that
time you go through all those causes

717
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:19,880
I and you determine which kinda love

718
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:24,420
a grammatical term your in easy to
forget that that's

719
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:28,200
I engine X

720
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:31,650
HEPA up parse a

721
00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:37,030
has fifty-seven switch statements with
272

722
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:40,050
single cab clauses and

723
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:43,420
over I 2300 outlines of cold

724
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:47,900
understanding which state you're in
understanding from

725
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:53,300
this what grammar You're Expecting his
unintelligible

726
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:57,790
that's why it took 11 years on the high
value target

727
00:46:57,790 --> 00:47:01,700
with everyone knowing what kind of a
problem chunked encoding had

728
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:06,100
cell not so easy you should have written

729
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:11,240
it should have been written in a star
I'll that makes it clearer

730
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:14,540
and for the first time in the evening at
the parser Combinator style

731
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:18,310
what is it that you're parser is
expected of

732
00:47:18,310 --> 00:47:25,310
fight machines that look like this will
not say

733
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:28,020
I'll whale for desserts

734
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:32,770
right if you take your input and up

735
00:47:32,770 --> 00:47:36,309
pa said to know something that's called
parson execute

736
00:47:36,309 --> 00:47:41,770
you know you have a problem but what's
the real problem

737
00:47:41,770 --> 00:47:44,940
can you specify the grammar

738
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:51,940
over your shale input turned out people
could not even specify the channels

739
00:47:52,049 --> 00:47:55,289
and left one of them

740
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:58,690
environment strings completely alone

741
00:47:58,690 --> 00:48:03,970
without any kind of checks so
computational power exposed to external

742
00:48:03,970 --> 00:48:07,849
inputs ease power given to attack I

743
00:48:07,849 --> 00:48:12,740
you're just giving it away a.m. it does
not matter how that happens it will

744
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:13,920
happen eventual

745
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:17,530
like bash is a really bad thing to have

746
00:48:17,530 --> 00:48:23,210
anywhere near your inputs and then of
course you know Bash is really a local

747
00:48:23,210 --> 00:48:24,799
app that woke up one morning

748
00:48:24,799 --> 00:48:27,799
on the I'll worship CGI Dan

749
00:48:27,799 --> 00:48:31,510
with a pounding headache away from the
shore impressed

750
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:36,000
into the service so here is your
appropriate maritime

751
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,339
I am a

752
00:48:39,339 --> 00:48:42,710
safety poster this is actually fish

753
00:48:42,710 --> 00:48:46,099
pic cell

754
00:48:46,099 --> 00:48:49,369
I don't even know how to translate the
name of that poll

755
00:48:49,369 --> 00:48:55,619
but basically be aware of it cell

756
00:48:55,619 --> 00:49:00,010
I hope I have convinced you that parsers

757
00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:03,190
a hard you should not role you're all

758
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:06,990
just like creeped out became a lot
better

759
00:49:06,990 --> 00:49:11,589
when people understood that not reveal
computations were involved

760
00:49:11,589 --> 00:49:15,529
that were hard to foresee hard
mathematics were in was involved

761
00:49:15,529 --> 00:49:19,119
so with parsers parsers have

762
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:22,829
not just card but possible problems

763
00:49:22,829 --> 00:49:27,750
associated with them some construct
cannot be parsed properly

764
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:31,260
some programs cannot be decided on
whether they

765
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:36,610
conform to proper I a properties or not

766
00:49:36,610 --> 00:49:41,410
so use a parser construction kit hot we
r I'll

767
00:49:41,410 --> 00:49:44,810
meredith Patterson on Mike author and a
bunch of other

768
00:49:44,810 --> 00:49:47,860
really bright folks might break the
folks on myself and much better

769
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:48,660
programmers

770
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:53,180
are working on this kit called hammer a
parser construction kit

771
00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:57,500
and all we are I would hope to
eventually release the

772
00:49:57,500 --> 00:50:00,570
reference implementations 0

773
00:50:00,570 --> 00:50:03,730
parsers 04 standard protocols called

774
00:50:03,730 --> 00:50:08,240
tongs I'll culminating in a secure
parser construction kit

775
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:11,940
let me give you a taste of that so

776
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:15,760
we start with the principle that the
input inputs are language

777
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:18,880
I the need to be

778
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:23,000
properly up accepted or reject it

779
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,390
before you do anything that is
computationally powerful

780
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:30,470
so pastels principal is pure mischief

781
00:50:30,470 --> 00:50:34,640
you can't beat liberal about what you
accept

782
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:38,360
if you care about your users you have to
be definite

783
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:42,080
about what you accept yeah be
conservative in what your scent of

784
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:42,590
course

785
00:50:42,590 --> 00:50:46,060
of the user all the first UNIX

786
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:50,330
and the inventor UNIX pipes and manager

787
00:50:50,330 --> 00:50:53,770
love occurring again and Richie I at one
point

788
00:50:53,770 --> 00:50:57,520
a out that McIlroy he is

789
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:00,820
I an emeritus professor at Dartmouth

790
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:06,170
in when we came to him he said I always
thought that plus tells principal was

791
00:51:06,170 --> 00:51:07,100
pure Misch

792
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:10,830
these other foundations on which we
build

793
00:51:10,830 --> 00:51:14,380
our internet this is why our internet

794
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:20,120
is as trustworthy as it it's so

795
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:25,040
you have to give a lot more attention to
how you program your partner's

796
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:29,860
you have to be definite about that your
posture should resemble the grammar

797
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:34,060
and you should have the grammar that is
if you can code

798
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:39,130
I it's much better if you want to
generate so

799
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:42,670
you have to have a bright lie between

800
00:51:42,670 --> 00:51:47,010
the processing and the recognition n you
can

801
00:51:47,010 --> 00:51:49,570
isolate this by oil

802
00:51:49,570 --> 00:51:54,490
means or you can isolate this by means
of verifying this cold

803
00:51:54,490 --> 00:51:58,090
you're not going to verify the majority
owner called

804
00:51:58,090 --> 00:52:01,280
this is a I'll a few tile hope

805
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:07,550
it won't scale I again the halting
problem looms

806
00:52:07,550 --> 00:52:11,880
in this space but you should limit the
computational power

807
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:15,830
over your parser you should have a
grammar spec

808
00:52:15,830 --> 00:52:18,920
that's not too hard deterministic

809
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:22,170
context-free up do not play

810
00:52:22,170 --> 00:52:25,560
in endlessly on

811
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:29,990
encapsulated payloads and one leave him

812
00:52:29,990 --> 00:52:33,570
you can safely expose your competition
power

813
00:52:33,570 --> 00:52:38,030
your once you have the definition of the
language

814
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:42,020
EN I hierarchical

815
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:46,580
down to the smallest elements oh yes
syntax

816
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:49,580
be the integers be the dividers

817
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:54,270
get a single characters be they words
you should build you a parser

818
00:52:54,270 --> 00:52:58,950
up ASB grammar that it is expected to
parse

819
00:52:58,950 --> 00:53:04,160
this is called the parser Combinator
style this is how you can write

820
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:07,420
a parser Combinator in hamar

821
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:11,020
there are other a language is a like
Costco but

822
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:15,140
hammers and see because it's kinda hard
to find industry programmers who do

823
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:15,840
Hoskote

824
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:19,760
so you have even a single parser

825
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:23,180
for this constant ok you have a parser

826
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:26,450
foreign entered your image you have a
parser 4

827
00:53:26,450 --> 00:53:31,250
8-bit and 16-bit integers in you combine
that

828
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:34,430
you up build up

829
00:53:34,430 --> 00:53:38,460
your grammar for all those elements this
is the entire ATT

830
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:42,370
over your parser this parser is possible
to

831
00:53:42,370 --> 00:53:46,060
would if you choose a language

832
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:49,070
that's to reach like be awk

833
00:53:49,070 --> 00:53:52,730
or 2 I'll be curious when you have so
many ways

834
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:56,470
like five or seven tune called in into
juror string

835
00:53:56,470 --> 00:54:01,250
you are going to have a berserk and you
are going to have

836
00:54:01,250 --> 00:54:05,850
SSL certificate that parts that parse
different so use the

837
00:54:05,850 --> 00:54:08,920
GE aw definitive encoding instead

838
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:12,420
if you have BR things will go bad for
you

839
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:15,560
again and again with SSL this is not the

840
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:18,900
bystanders view of the BAP this

841
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:22,720
is the fundamental principle on which
some complexity

842
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:28,000
is just too bad to HAP look at this CD
accounts

843
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,270
I these are the she has for XML

844
00:54:32,270 --> 00:54:35,690
and notice how many of them are due to

845
00:54:35,690 --> 00:54:41,000
up external NTT is that break the
simplicity I love the syntax

846
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,710
this is how many there are four Jason
Jason

847
00:54:44,710 --> 00:54:48,910
is strictly a context-free which is why

848
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:52,500
Jason doesn't seem to have the problem
that XML

849
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:55,619
I seems to have so when you undertake

850
00:54:55,619 --> 00:54:59,130
on what it'll be a code OSC your

851
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:02,310
programmers where is your recognizer

852
00:55:02,310 --> 00:55:06,640
where is the grammar for your language
can you tell

853
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:11,010
from this piece of code which language
you expect

854
00:55:11,010 --> 00:55:15,390
and then are if you don't need a
recursive nesting

855
00:55:15,390 --> 00:55:19,680
that pushes you over inch of the
complexity cliff

856
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:22,859
especially with are nondeterministic
grammer's

857
00:55:22,859 --> 00:55:26,440
don't just keep it regular keep it

858
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:29,960
fixed with out what airport

859
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:33,109
as long as you think you game when
unique stand

860
00:55:33,109 --> 00:55:37,470
your system forcibly is going to be it
not by the course of upkeep

861
00:55:37,470 --> 00:55:40,609
and the security costs so cross

862
00:55:40,609 --> 00:55:44,470
object dependency is just pure points
and by the way

863
00:55:44,470 --> 00:55:47,690
protocols like are those that keep up
your lights

864
00:55:47,690 --> 00:55:52,170
D mp3 for example one parser that we're
trying to rework

865
00:55:52,170 --> 00:55:55,840
they have crossed or object dependencies

866
00:55:55,840 --> 00:56:00,250
across layers %ah this is bad news

867
00:56:00,250 --> 00:56:02,930
for the so-called smart grid

868
00:56:02,930 --> 00:56:06,080
cell and now their proofs right

869
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:09,180
you can't prove programs I'll

870
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:14,250
%uh in 99 she and I are 69

871
00:56:14,250 --> 00:56:18,110
I share our core I originated the

872
00:56:18,110 --> 00:56:21,910
art and science objection proving
programs correct

873
00:56:21,910 --> 00:56:26,560
right this as the seminal paper on this
the axiomatic basis for computer

874
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:27,210
programming

875
00:56:27,210 --> 00:56:31,420
and this always proving are the
correctness of programs

876
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:35,560
very fine programs were supposed to do
your reliability

877
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:39,050
documentation and compatibility get

878
00:56:39,050 --> 00:56:43,760
cell but are the principal so let you
know

879
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:46,760
you have the preconditions you have the
cold

880
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:51,380
and once this cold has been applied you
have the post conditions

881
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:55,230
and this post condition is assured if
your program has proved

882
00:56:55,230 --> 00:56:58,250
then you can change them along right PA

883
00:56:58,250 --> 00:57:02,180
%uh goes to the cold gives you s yes
goes to the code

884
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:06,060
argues your of and you just keep
composing them

885
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:10,830
and up in the AM

886
00:57:10,830 --> 00:57:17,040
strange things happen so here is your
precondition here is your approval code

887
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:20,390
what if is cold this cold

888
00:57:20,390 --> 00:57:24,010
that is proven correct gets a different

889
00:57:24,010 --> 00:57:27,190
input that's a lot p

890
00:57:27,190 --> 00:57:31,230
how much will hit compute how much

891
00:57:31,230 --> 00:57:35,870
extra power will be there I mean single
is called your processing called

892
00:57:35,870 --> 00:57:39,490
think out whatever I is here

893
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:43,000
is your parser if your boss in

894
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,210
something that is not fully recognized

895
00:57:46,210 --> 00:57:49,930
you're going to get all of that and

896
00:57:49,930 --> 00:57:53,260
the standard methodology for up roofs

897
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:56,410
does not include anyway a reasoning

898
00:57:56,410 --> 00:58:00,360
about what will happen if the
preconditions do not hold

899
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:03,470
so I you cannot

900
00:58:03,470 --> 00:58:07,010
just trust your approved programs

901
00:58:07,010 --> 00:58:10,100
and of course a composition is

902
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:13,270
a tough mistress because you know you
have your

903
00:58:13,270 --> 00:58:16,260
but the Rams and then you have your

904
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:20,500
shins and then you are on are and there
is

905
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:26,060
farm and then there is Tom to then there
are several assembly languages

906
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:30,470
and you can read the code every which
way and by the way on x86

907
00:58:30,470 --> 00:58:34,590
you might even land at we inside
instruction

908
00:58:34,590 --> 00:58:38,600
and make your own program out over the
pieces of instructions

909
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:41,840
%uh so a red cell of course this is

910
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:44,990
harder in practice and that is in theory
but of course

911
00:58:44,990 --> 00:58:48,960
some people have proven I x86

912
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:52,170
and have constructed I the

913
00:58:52,170 --> 00:58:55,370
x86 proved assembly in caulk

914
00:58:55,370 --> 00:59:00,090
which is a a theorem prover but

915
00:59:00,090 --> 00:59:04,150
all the time we do a different kind a
fear improving

916
00:59:04,150 --> 00:59:07,610
we do exploitation I

917
00:59:07,610 --> 00:59:12,000
we understand that an exploit is
approved by construction

918
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:16,220
that the cold can do something else
other than expected

919
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:19,580
are the Accademia catching up

920
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:24,690
so there's this effort in automatic
explain generation and yes

921
00:59:24,690 --> 00:59:29,100
it can generate won the nineteen ninety
is kinda exploit so far

922
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:34,270
you know buffer overflows without a SLR
with Audi p

923
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:37,480
but the most important outcome

924
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:40,500
of that project is that from

925
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:43,620
its that

926
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:48,400
exploitation is actually it kinda
verification task

927
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:52,000
it's a Costco where you construct proofs

928
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:56,060
it's a task where you search execution
pots

929
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:59,430
I to determine if a certain property
holtz

930
00:59:59,430 --> 01:00:03,990
right so all the time we have been doing
math

931
01:00:03,990 --> 01:00:07,400
all the time exploring

932
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:12,260
the fallout of trying to solve the
possible problems

933
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:16,390
all vendors claiming that they sold the
halting problem

934
01:00:16,390 --> 01:00:20,930
we have been doing practical exploit
exploration

935
01:00:20,930 --> 01:00:24,740
or what church in touring exploit
explored theoretically

936
01:00:24,740 --> 01:00:28,330
the limits the boundaries of computation

937
01:00:28,330 --> 01:00:34,700
now we have a problem or do we have a
problem are there is this

938
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:37,720
arrangements arms control treaty

939
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:41,280
that went into effect in December 2013

940
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:45,330
and if you read it you will see that it
defines

941
01:00:45,330 --> 01:00:48,830
this kind ok software that they call

942
01:00:48,830 --> 01:00:53,510
intrusion software in their wisdom and
what does intrusion software

943
01:00:53,510 --> 01:00:56,990
it is defined it something that

944
01:00:56,990 --> 01:01:01,510
as something that modifies standard
execution

945
01:01:01,510 --> 01:01:05,670
paw other program can you think of
something

946
01:01:05,670 --> 01:01:10,230
that does that modifies the standard
execution Popova program

947
01:01:10,230 --> 01:01:13,390
in order to allow the execution
externally provide instructions

948
01:01:13,390 --> 01:01:18,840
it's a debugger exactly I can you think

949
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:22,240
0 I something else that

950
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:25,530
modifies the standard execution pop all
the program

951
01:01:25,530 --> 01:01:31,230
I and exploit yes

952
01:01:31,230 --> 01:01:34,770
but outlets not out let's stick to the

953
01:01:34,770 --> 01:01:38,420
things that we use everyday hi are a
lady in strict

954
01:01:38,420 --> 01:01:43,220
tell a joke dynamic linker dynamic
patching

955
01:01:43,220 --> 01:01:46,470
right cell hustler in its wisdom

956
01:01:46,470 --> 01:01:51,140
up protects debuggers excludes debuggers
explicitly

957
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:54,320
it also excludes the

958
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:57,630
I reverse engineering tools so those are
not

959
01:01:57,630 --> 01:02:02,610
arms but you know what on Zach arms are
rules have changed your rating:

960
01:02:02,610 --> 01:02:03,660
developing

961
01:02:03,660 --> 01:02:07,560
and operating intrusion softer your
father

962
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:10,670
is a weapon

963
01:02:10,670 --> 01:02:14,090
your I

964
01:02:14,090 --> 01:02:17,930
at your compiler I

965
01:02:17,930 --> 01:02:21,590
your job are you now are up gidget
finder

966
01:02:21,590 --> 01:02:25,000
all those are now controlled

967
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:28,260
items actually your imports

968
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:31,300
I mean the very hold %uh the real point
oven

969
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:35,300
input is for the machine to do something
different

970
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:36,240
on that

971
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:39,410
right inputs are regulated arms

972
01:02:39,410 --> 01:02:43,490
I am

973
01:02:43,490 --> 01:02:47,569
against any string you type if it has an
unexpected effect

974
01:02:47,569 --> 01:02:51,710
I they try to give a very general
definition

975
01:02:51,710 --> 01:02:56,470
they succeeded they all close imports

976
01:02:56,470 --> 01:03:00,700
right cell others more about this

977
01:03:00,700 --> 01:03:06,089
in our talk with the Felix lindner FX at
the USENIX security symposium the

978
01:03:06,089 --> 01:03:09,680
you can find this I online

979
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:14,380
on the is next site but we have a
problem you now

980
01:03:14,380 --> 01:03:18,910
you're not just mathematicians your arms
dealers

981
01:03:18,910 --> 01:03:22,240
if exploits come from you or

982
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:26,290
in particular if any automation of
inputs come from you

983
01:03:26,290 --> 01:03:30,450
so we have thus it is a science in which

984
01:03:30,450 --> 01:03:35,540
almost all the effective countermeasures
came from the coevolution

985
01:03:35,540 --> 01:03:39,740
of people exploring the bounce all what
is computable

986
01:03:39,740 --> 01:03:43,010
and demonstrating again and again I am
that

987
01:03:43,010 --> 01:03:46,710
at the measures to contain the
computation have been ineffective

988
01:03:46,710 --> 01:03:49,790
that things that are not thought to be
computable

989
01:03:49,790 --> 01:03:52,880
were trusted not to be computable or

990
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:56,150
in this is the same exploration

991
01:03:56,150 --> 01:04:00,700
that a touring and church were I engaged
in as I already said

992
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:03,760
this is something very fundamental to
computer science

993
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:07,859
this is where the laws and the
impossibilities the natural limits

994
01:04:07,859 --> 01:04:12,119
on this realm of human activity lie and
we're going to

995
01:04:12,119 --> 01:04:16,549
have this citizen science seriously
undermined

996
01:04:16,549 --> 01:04:19,760
on less we can persuade the regulators

997
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:23,540
that ot and exploit is really

998
01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:26,619
just a theorem that

999
01:04:26,619 --> 01:04:30,890
zero-day means a new scientific fact

1000
01:04:30,890 --> 01:04:35,130
that science in fact he's pursued o'day

1001
01:04:35,130 --> 01:04:41,180
in every up walk of human activity
physics chemistry biology

1002
01:04:41,180 --> 01:04:44,230
a computer

1003
01:04:44,230 --> 01:04:47,140
yeah well you know enjoy your arm

1004
01:04:47,140 --> 01:04:50,750
prison term or something right

1005
01:04:50,750 --> 01:04:54,060
also recommendations up

1006
01:04:54,060 --> 01:04:57,800
steer clear I love I impossibilities

1007
01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:00,940
simplify your inputs

1008
01:05:00,940 --> 01:05:04,550
your parsers should be I

1009
01:05:04,550 --> 01:05:09,070
resembling the grammar that they expect
our air that they expect except

1010
01:05:09,070 --> 01:05:12,400
people in which as soon as as simple as
possible

1011
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:17,310
keep it a regular context-free or just
stick to simple rules like

1012
01:05:17,310 --> 01:05:21,980
variable-length fields should be avoided
if you can

1013
01:05:21,980 --> 01:05:25,820
nesting recursion should be avoided as
you can

1014
01:05:25,820 --> 01:05:29,490
left the blanks that must agree across a
message

1015
01:05:29,490 --> 01:05:33,470
should be avoided out whenever you can
cell

1016
01:05:33,470 --> 01:05:37,010
odd because all those things require
harder

1017
01:05:37,010 --> 01:05:40,170
computational I'll

1018
01:05:40,170 --> 01:05:43,570
power and you arguing that power to
attacker

1019
01:05:43,570 --> 01:05:46,570
if you employ it at communication
boundary

1020
01:05:46,570 --> 01:05:51,030
so really the only way forward out on
complexity

1021
01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:55,760
is the up caught his eye of data formats

1022
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:59,340
now it's too late 4 up

1023
01:05:59,340 --> 01:06:03,380
onward or PDF I

1024
01:06:03,380 --> 01:06:06,670
with ipv4 an ipv6

1025
01:06:06,670 --> 01:06:10,080
we'll see convergence to a simpler

1026
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:14,140
subset to simpler sub link which the way
ipv4

1027
01:06:14,140 --> 01:06:18,230
converged to a simpler sub language the
same will have to

1028
01:06:18,230 --> 01:06:21,420
happen with ipv6 but going forward

1029
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:25,870
and building future control protocols
vehicle control protocols

1030
01:06:25,870 --> 01:06:29,030
are it will have to be the quick as I
can code update

1031
01:06:29,030 --> 01:06:34,110
and I i mean if you're interested in how
these things work

1032
01:06:34,110 --> 01:06:37,290
we I we are going to skip through this

1033
01:06:37,290 --> 01:06:40,620
because I haven't kick

1034
01:06:40,620 --> 01:06:44,700
right of otherwise we're going to

1035
01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:48,390
of start sheen more and more those
weaknesses

1036
01:06:48,390 --> 01:06:52,440
I'll let me direct you to this up common
weakness enumeration

1037
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:55,530
which up finally a tries to go

1038
01:06:55,530 --> 01:06:59,050
be you on this you use any numerate
principles

1039
01:06:59,050 --> 01:07:02,060
I love how you get weaknesses

1040
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:06,260
and so almost all those weaknesses if
you look

1041
01:07:06,260 --> 01:07:10,680
I feel years over recognition you lose
the security game

1042
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:17,140
when you design your former I am here is
our workshop

1043
01:07:17,140 --> 01:07:23,070
for the second year are going are that
we are trying to explore those topics

1044
01:07:23,070 --> 01:07:26,600
apt so if you find yourself are a

1045
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:30,010
around San Jose a on on May 21st

1046
01:07:30,010 --> 01:07:34,740
please join the link which conspiracy
five minutes overtime
