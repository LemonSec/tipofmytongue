1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:03,720
okay so but come back after lunch

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,990
and will change the schedule a bit

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,349
I am my cross member present our I'm

4
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:13,769
apart as topic 3 exchange that
perspective ticked

5
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:17,640
who will give us talk tomorrow I'm Mike
were come

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,750
to Heidelberg a mike is quite well known
for his

7
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,769
from wireless security research and some
interesting chance to get shirts and

8
00:00:26,769 --> 00:00:29,990
of course I V RW we like this get Ruth
and

9
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:34,239
I think you were talking about some new
interesting actor for text based on

10
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,579
RF re to reflect earth and it has been
inspired by the NSA right

11
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:41,629
allegedly okay so

12
00:00:41,629 --> 00:00:45,079
Micah thank you and to please stop thank
you very much

13
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:49,340
it's always a pleasure to be back at
troopers and thank you to Benedict for

14
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,480
training time slots with me %uh sorry

15
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,180
if anyone's and the wrong talk because
at that but to

16
00:00:56,180 --> 00:01:00,050
hopefully you enjoy this %ah I

17
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:04,019
game a talk last summer at Def Con

18
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:07,290
on are afraid to reporters and I

19
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,689
talk couple times on the subject I am

20
00:01:10,689 --> 00:01:14,460
the stock here's a above an overlap but
slightly different um

21
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:20,400
on like previous talks this one does not
contain any leaked classified contact

22
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,170
I and my hope is that

23
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:29,400
up by publishing some of the information
that I've come up with on this topic

24
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,369
I without such contact content that

25
00:01:33,369 --> 00:01:37,250
it will open the door to are more people
being able to

26
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:40,829
I being able to learn about this subject

27
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:44,750
and on the other hand another talked
about given

28
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:45,250
I

29
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:48,840
I have included leaked classified
content and

30
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,320
I hope that in those cases people are
able to learn

31
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,729
something that they wouldn't otherwise
get the land swap being

32
00:01:55,729 --> 00:01:59,400
a if you are interested in that stuff

33
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:04,040
I recommend taking a look at the
introductory material and that Duff Kahn

34
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:08,700
talk and also I any of the NSA playset
series

35
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:13,320
talks the I in particular the 1i day
with team Pierce

36
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,510
at to our camp last summer I

37
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:22,660
might be interest interesting
introduction to be at a place at me

38
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:25,730
I BSA playset is a

39
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:30,690
project to know I allow us to kind of
play along with the NSAA

40
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:33,720
based on wheat class by content

41
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:38,690
stuff that we know about the PSA is
doing are tools that the NSA has

42
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:43,200
and and I showing people that

43
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,530
the kinds of tools that nation-state
actors

44
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:51,060
use are not outreach that they're
actually fairly

45
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,590
easy for people hobbyists

46
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:58,340
enthusiasts hackerspace is I'll

47
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:02,360
re security researchers to be able to
experiment with on their own

48
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:06,120
and last summer at DEFCON we actually
put together

49
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:11,360
a series of talks im of us who did at a
place at talks put a bunch

50
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,709
up toys in a bucket and our reaction did
of

51
00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:19,810
for the FF I raced I think twenty-five
hundred dollars for the EFSF which was

52
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:20,730
really cool

53
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:24,410
I am the subject i'm talking about.

54
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:27,989
is are a threat to reflect urs or

55
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:31,519
or more generally reflective radio
attacks

56
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,720
and what I'm interested in years the
ability for

57
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,819
an attacker to I A beam

58
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:42,840
a signal act a target and then

59
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,530
get information back in a reflection now
it's basically a radar

60
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:51,450
a radar technique you are firing a radar
at a target

61
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:55,349
and bad I picking up the return
reflection

62
00:03:55,349 --> 00:03:59,450
and trying to get information out are a
device

63
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:03,319
cable et cetera and in this case

64
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:06,860
I am dealing with everything and I'm
talking about today

65
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:10,440
is pretty much dealing with the a

66
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,769
the be scenario where there is an

67
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:17,260
implant actually im the target device

68
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:21,690
that that somebody has installed a small

69
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:24,800
implant I'll talk about how small I am

70
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,500
into a target device that on

71
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:33,229
creates this reflection this capability
for reflection a radar signal

72
00:04:33,229 --> 00:04:37,760
and I'm and I'm gonna show you

73
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,840
the implants that I've built

74
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,560
and the test results that iPad me

75
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:50,780
a very high like to do this stuff are a
big part of the reason I like to use

76
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:55,690
stuff I like on stage is to were you in
here to hear me rant about the state of

77
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:57,310
Michigan emission security

78
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:01,880
I there are unintentional emissions

79
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,410
that people have heard a bit about you
might have heard 0

80
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:09,400
tempest for example I and there's been a
fair amount

81
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:15,419
research done online I how attackers
could take advantage of unintentional

82
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:16,010
emissions

83
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:21,139
and get information out up your device
is your video screens your printer's

84
00:05:21,139 --> 00:05:24,919
so forth but there hasn't been a lot of
research

85
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:27,960
in reflective RF attacks where

86
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,630
an attacker about as a signal of other
device

87
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:36,150
and actually potentially get emissions
other than those

88
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:40,650
that one the device winner what have are
produced on it saw

89
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:43,229
the first

90
00:05:43,229 --> 00:05:47,099
RF retro reflector that anyone knows
anything about

91
00:05:47,099 --> 00:05:50,770
I it was the fame and also known as the
Great Seal bug

92
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:53,999
it was found inside be great seal

93
00:05:53,999 --> 00:05:57,009
up the United States a wooden carving a
grey seal United States

94
00:05:57,009 --> 00:06:00,960
in the US Embassy in Moscow Anna
supposedly this

95
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:06,080
was found in the early fifties and
deployed in the mid 1940s

96
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,300
I it was revealed it in nineteen sixty

97
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,529
revealed to the public now this device

98
00:06:12,529 --> 00:06:15,680
consisted a and a antenna

99
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,689
connected to microphone and that's it

100
00:06:18,689 --> 00:06:23,319
had no other components whatsoever no
active components no battery

101
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:26,509
I it did not need any power supply

102
00:06:26,509 --> 00:06:30,370
it's simply was a contender a condenser
microphone

103
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:34,680
that would based on a sound pressure
based on the air pressure

104
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,909
module eight me impedance connected to
the antenna

105
00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:42,490
and that allowed a radar system to be
able

106
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:45,749
to I get a return from the device

107
00:06:45,749 --> 00:06:50,740
that would carry the ambient audio so it
was a very simple

108
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:54,180
but elegant design I'll

109
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:57,919
supposedly deployed around 19 forty-five

110
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:01,029
1 a group russians schoolchildren

111
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:04,139
made a gift up be I wouldn't carving

112
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:08,020
to me US Ambassador I

113
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:12,330
which is on my favorite details the
story up

114
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:16,219
and this device was really quite
advanced

115
00:07:16,219 --> 00:07:20,349
technology for the time and it remains a
very elegant

116
00:07:20,349 --> 00:07:23,999
II accuse of Technology

117
00:07:23,999 --> 00:07:29,449
one up one of the things that was great
about it was that it had no power supply

118
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,289
required

119
00:07:30,289 --> 00:07:33,449
and so it could run for years

120
00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:36,699
or centuries I with

121
00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:40,610
out I without having to change a battery
or anything like that

122
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:45,069
also it was very difficult to detect
with equipment have the day

123
00:07:45,069 --> 00:07:48,649
because it didn't actually transmit any

124
00:07:48,649 --> 00:07:52,440
there was never any signal to be
detected

125
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,900
while it was just sitting there unused

126
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:58,340
it was only during a time when there was

127
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:01,890
a I radio a powerful radio signal

128
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:05,420
I reflecting of a bit when it could be
detected

129
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:09,540
and especially back then people didn't
know to look for that kind of thing so

130
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:10,500
it probably

131
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,610
went undetected for years I

132
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:17,340
there was a IR leak up some information

133
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:21,430
at the end of 2013 and then there was

134
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:26,040
that review the revelation up the thing
in 1960

135
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:31,170
and am between we had just like 53 years
a rumor and speculation

136
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:34,240
there was no public information about

137
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,610
any type pressure reflector attack I

138
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:41,300
or reflective radio attack I there were

139
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:46,330
there a little hands from certain
declassified documents here and there

140
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:49,770
but to no public demonstrations

141
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:53,750
no research papers published I haven't
been able to find

142
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:57,310
anything other than a single paragraph

143
00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:02,610
brief mention one academic paper during
this entire fifty three year period

144
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:05,680
I that I would consider to be anything

145
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,980
concrete I am when I say concrete

146
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:13,310
I mean like something new you can build
at home something that you can

147
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:16,850
demonstrate the effectiveness up and
show people

148
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:20,570
how it works the a

149
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:23,580
the phenomenon that's being used and

150
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:27,850
in our approach a reflector is RF
backscatter communication

151
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:31,260
and back years actually very well
studied

152
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:34,460
and so if you look in the literature for

153
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:38,640
I RFID systems for example RFID

154
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,540
systems use best typeof communication
especially

155
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:46,090
the higher frequency RFID systems like
UHF

156
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:50,960
RFID that operates for example around
900 megahertz

157
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:54,390
that kind of technology is very very
similar

158
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:58,480
to what I'm doing with our effort to
reflectors and

159
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,830
the basic a

160
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:05,640
the basic capability up being able to
modulate been reflected

161
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,890
the reflection from antenna anna's

162
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:12,170
something that that he is quite well
studied and

163
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:15,390
so we can take advantage of that and
when where

164
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:19,200
trying to build our own types of
implants that use that technique

165
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,210
the first paper that I'm aware on

166
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:27,070
this method love RF backscatter
communication

167
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:31,410
was published in 1948 realize that this
was

168
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:34,830
after the thing was deployed I

169
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:39,100
which kinda tells you something about
how advanced a technology that

170
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:42,420
that but what the I

171
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:45,760
modern research as I mentioned I am

172
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,770
mostly if you want to learn about how
this the how this

173
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:53,100
technique works and how to make optimal
designs the best place to look is

174
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:53,860
probably

175
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:57,670
a studies on UHF RFID

176
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:02,680
now today i'm talking about. intentional
elimination

177
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:06,220
meaning that I'm intentionally
transmitting

178
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:10,570
a signal at my target and I'm also
talking about

179
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:14,840
at Target that is an intentional
rhetoric lecture at specifically

180
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,280
designed implant

181
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:20,570
to give me the best reflection I can get

182
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:24,370
in a very small package so this is

183
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:29,300
lineup only only one up several areas
where I think we should be doing more

184
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,060
research

185
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:33,120
I i think we should be researching

186
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,790
unintentional illumination so for
example

187
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:41,430
I'm standing near the target with a cell
phone in my pocket

188
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:44,680
I my cell phone is transmitting a signal

189
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:48,690
that is getting reflected of us and so

190
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:52,990
an attacker could have passive

191
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:57,220
radar technology an not have to

192
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:01,990
transmit a high-powered signal at the
target and might be able to

193
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:06,920
guy eavesdrop on the device that way
that's an entire category that hasn't

194
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,760
been researched

195
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,560
and I think we should also look at
unintentional Racha reflectors

196
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,000
right now I'm showing

197
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,070
a device that that I've specifically
bill

198
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:20,420
for the purpose of reflecting a signal
but

199
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:24,010
there are hands and some declassified
documents that

200
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:28,320
a that suggest a as far back as the
nineteen eighties

201
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,270
that suggest that there may be
electronic devices

202
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:35,279
that could be eavesdropped on with out
being

203
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:40,290
implant that just the characteristic of
the device with a cable itself

204
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:44,230
is such that somebody could I A

205
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:48,930
by radar at it eliminate the fame
actually get information out of it that

206
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:49,310
way

207
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:52,410
and personally I think that is the most

208
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:55,900
interesting area research because it man
form

209
00:12:55,900 --> 00:13:00,250
how we can build electronic devices

210
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:06,040
I in a way that I makes us more or less
vulnerable to that type of attack

211
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:10,290
and I really don't know yet I don't
think anybody really knows yet how

212
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,480
vulnerable

213
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:15,980
today's devices are to that type of
attack I would really like to know that

214
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,600
and I think

215
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,740
I some %uh view might like to know that
too

216
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:23,940
Bob so in order to

217
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:27,520
implement this type of attack we need
direct reflection but we also need a

218
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,110
radar

219
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:31,410
and one of the first things that I tried

220
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:34,810
was to just get a at all police

221
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:38,339
radar gun from UK and

222
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:43,660
that worked by that's the 1i found la
parade Sat like 24 gigahertz

223
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:47,660
which is super high frequency and at the
Little Bear

224
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:51,260
are may be a lot higher than necessary
and its

225
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:55,550
a lot I it's hard to get very much
equipment that really operates and that

226
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:56,980
kinda frequency range

227
00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:00,970
but for experimentation other than a
radar gun itself

228
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:06,680
and the so that there for a number of
reasons that we didn't seem to be the

229
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:10,500
most optimal solution although it's fun
to play with I am

230
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,680
so that I found a Hot Wheels radar gun

231
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,760
I am and I have a box below

232
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,240
by half a dozen movies now I

233
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:23,610
you can find them on eBay at least in US
I don't know

234
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:27,070
II don't actually know office product
was ever sold am Europe

235
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:31,030
I but I have meant on a while it is Ben

236
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:34,390
defunct for a while but this area's

237
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:39,160
basically the same as a police radar gun
except that it operates had to around 10

238
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,410
gigahertz it is.

239
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:44,450
ten-and-a-half gigahertz there are a
number of products like yet

240
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:47,720
most have which are not toys but are

241
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,050
I am low-cost radar I

242
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:54,440
speed detectors I am that are

243
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,500
many of them are are marketed for sports

244
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:02,800
IQ want to find out how fast you through
ball or something like that I am

245
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:07,440
that those types over radar devices tend
to be fairly affordable

246
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,700
like a hundred or two hundred dollar
something like that I

247
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:15,560
that's a lot less them to %uh say a
brand new police radar gun would cost

248
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,980
so and you can often find those used

249
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:22,760
I love on you game so forth so

250
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:26,870
those types the devices are potentially
useful for their sit still

251
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:31,040
pretty high frequency me and you know
some other tools that I like to use like

252
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,930
suffered by radio platforms don't

253
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:38,260
tend to go up ten gigahertz so it was
fun to play with and actually the first

254
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:42,480
successful retro reflector experiment
that I did

255
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,680
was using a hot meals radar gun I

256
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,940
nice thing about it is that

257
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:52,550
even though they often are broken

258
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:57,880
have I like the devices I bought from
ebay most of them arrived not working

259
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:02,320
even though that's the case I they're
really easy to take apart

260
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:07,020
and I am and get the park out that you
need

261
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:11,560
that probably is working actually I
should clock off by that they're not as

262
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:14,210
easy to take apart as they should be
because I think they

263
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:18,870
like keep oxy the screws or something
but if you can remove two screws

264
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:23,170
then there easy to figure out kinda how
they're put together

265
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:25,030
there's I

266
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:28,710
a battery pack in the handle all and a
little switch to trigger

267
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:32,890
that's pretty easy to spot and then
there's a a little cable that goes from

268
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:35,000
the handle to a control board

269
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,130
and a control board up the rear advice
has the little

270
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:42,140
I LCD that that displays the speed

271
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:46,230
I and then there's a little black cable
that goes from the control board

272
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:50,510
to the radar unit which is the big to
waveguide antenna

273
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:54,950
has a little circuit board back at the
antenna that as a very simple 10

274
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:55,790
gigahertz

275
00:16:55,790 --> 00:17:00,200
our radar analog radar device the cool
thing here

276
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,990
is that every failure that i've seen
when I

277
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:08,530
when I get a a bad unit male every
failure I've seen has been in the

278
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:09,390
control board

279
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:14,840
and I don't need it I I just take that
black cable going to the radar unit

280
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:18,800
and I had to separate that from the rest
and

281
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,460
I it has three wires you give a crown
empower

282
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:25,460
and Ben you monitor the other cable and

283
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:28,710
or the other wire and it's just the
returns signal

284
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:31,880
that you can plug into an oscilloscope
and watch that

285
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,940
%uh watch the received signal here
getting

286
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:38,060
I it's really quite easy to use if you
have

287
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:42,150
even a little experience in electronics
so

288
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:45,810
are you can't find them for as cheap as
about twenty-five dollars

289
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:50,230
and I recommand if you want to play with
one of these things are you check out

290
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:51,270
that website

291
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:54,350
I somebody a few years ago who first
took

292
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:57,680
these things apart and posted photos
including one i just showed

293
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:01,690
on on kinda time people how these things
can be

294
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:05,300
taken apart used independently are
having a

295
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:09,480
the components used independently there
are similar devices out there like I

296
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,800
mentioned there are those

297
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:14,200
%ah I sport radar

298
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:18,920
that are very similar and that also tend
to be an attempt to hack it hurts ban

299
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,080
their are also some newer

300
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,530
very inexpensive modules that

301
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:31,300
are quite similar that are geared toward
hobby electronics of you search

302
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:34,990
eBay for Arduino radar for example
you're probably fine

303
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:39,640
these little single-board radar units
made in China

304
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,930
that that ship for like

305
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:46,010
five to ten dollars something like that
I

306
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:49,030
and I may

307
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:52,330
so they're super affordable they're not
quite as good as

308
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:56,190
as like the Hot Wheels radar because
they don't have a big waveguide attached

309
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:56,730
but

310
00:18:56,730 --> 00:19:00,090
I there they're pretty nice option for

311
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:04,920
desktop experiments at a very low price
are but they work basically the same

312
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,320
plane as a little bored

313
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,100
and pain Hot Wheels radar trap now hope

314
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:13,540
for some experiments newsprint parents
I'm doing today

315
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:17,010
and most of the experiments that I've
done a since by

316
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:20,350
very very first ones I have been using

317
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:25,300
software defined radio technique I am
one option would be to use the Copy can

318
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,000
read our

319
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,820
a that as made famous by great shara

320
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:33,250
and at a really cool project and it's
basically a

321
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:36,880
software-defined radio fairness
specialized

322
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,980
for I implementing are small-scale
doppler radar

323
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:44,670
I am out with and copy can antennas

324
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:48,450
I and that the drawback ovett is that

325
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:52,540
the software part about and requires you
interface with the

326
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:56,410
with the radar using a sound card that's
the way it's Ben

327
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:59,800
done in the past anyway and so the

328
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:03,950
the good thing is that it's pretty low
cost overall

329
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:07,520
and it operates in 2.4 gigahertz band
which is pretty convenient for

330
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,000
interfacing with other tools

331
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,270
and also for complying with laws and

332
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:16,810
the a such a bad thing though is that
it's it is typically

333
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:21,980
implemented with the sound card and so
even though he have a lot of control

334
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:26,260
be a software I it's very low bandwidth
and a

335
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:29,950
the bandwidth is very important no 1s a
ban wave

336
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:33,140
i'm talking about. be I paying

337
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,450
I

338
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:37,190
term apart within be radio

339
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:42,180
and digital signal processing community
where I mean a very specific thing

340
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:45,190
you might be familiar with the term band
with I

341
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:49,450
like from networking technology where we
throw the word man with a round to mean

342
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:51,980
something like how many bits per second
you can get

343
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:56,790
over the Internet I but I mean something
very specific which is the with

344
00:20:56,790 --> 00:21:00,690
in Hertz are a

345
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:04,010
some setups the frequencies are some
signal I

346
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:07,180
across the radio spectrum so for example

347
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:12,460
are the 2.4 gigahertz I SM bad which
were familiar with from WiFi and

348
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,650
Bluetooth ZigBee

349
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:17,800
I've that band is about eighty three
megahertz

350
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,930
wide cell that's the bandwidth

351
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:24,460
%uh that particular band but with a net

352
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:28,950
their different communications that
happened there are 20 megahertz wide

353
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:32,190
wifi channels so you can get a few more

354
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:36,840
a non-overlapping wifi channels in that
band there are

355
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:41,570
a Bluetooth Jenner 79 Bluetooth channels
in F&N each one of those is only one

356
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:42,680
megahertz why

357
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:46,330
topper individual to pack it has a pan
with

358
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:51,110
up one megahertz I and depending on what
type of signal

359
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:55,030
you wanna pick up and primarily
depending on the data rate up that

360
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:55,650
signal

361
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:58,820
you may need more or less bandwidth

362
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:03,140
I to capture in order to analyze that
signal

363
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:07,020
and in the case up a sound card

364
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:11,540
a sound card only has enough bandwidth
to describe audio that you're here can

365
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,080
hear

366
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,290
and you're here can only hear about 20
kilohertz

367
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:18,910
a banquet not megahertz killer cell

368
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:23,470
sound cards are in bad order of
magnitude of bandwidth and adjust

369
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:26,580
isn't enough for a lot of things but i
wanna play with so

370
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:30,130
if I'm going to use a cop again radar I
need to know

371
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:34,430
retrofitted with something other than
sound card which leads me to know

372
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:38,590
a suffer defined radio platforms like
agar f1

373
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:42,600
I like her up one because I designed it
and that

374
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:46,910
I am I and I designed it to be you

375
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:50,870
like the device that I wanted so I am

376
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:56,250
so a and its open source hardware so
anybody can build it for improve on a

377
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:59,539
design or adapt the design to their
particular needs

378
00:22:59,539 --> 00:23:03,750
are it's a little bit more expensive
than like buying a Hot Wheels radar

379
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:06,910
going off ebay but you don't need an
oscilloscope so

380
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:10,429
I am so it works well and

381
00:23:10,429 --> 00:23:14,130
the maximum bandwidth a pack rf1 is

382
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:18,330
20 megahertz and 20 megahertz is enough
to do I'll

383
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:21,730
lot up interesting things which are seen
very shortly

384
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:24,750
and its about how sometimes more band
where

385
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:28,400
approximately then you get out of a
sound card

386
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,159
cell this is thousands sound cards
essentially

387
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,909
I it's a software defined radio
peripheral and by

388
00:23:36,909 --> 00:23:40,940
software-defined that mean that your
building radios and software

389
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:44,620
I it's kinda like a sound card except
instead

390
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:48,570
I'll microgram said a microphone speaker
you have antenna

391
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:53,549
and just like a sound card can analyze
or produce

392
00:23:53,549 --> 00:23:58,250
arbitrary sound waveforms a
software-defined radio platform can

393
00:23:58,250 --> 00:23:59,620
analyze or produce

394
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:04,950
arbitrary radio waveform operate over a
very wide frequency range from actually

395
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:08,820
just about to change the official range
from

396
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:11,860
10 maker as a six-game hurts to

397
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:15,850
one megahertz 26 Kirk's I and

398
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:18,860
it has up to 20 megahertz band with as i
mentioned in its a half-duplex

399
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:20,010
transceiver

400
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:24,490
so that means I can transmit or receive
but I can't do both at the same time

401
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:29,200
so in this application sense I want to
be able to transmit and receive at the

402
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,059
same time

403
00:24:30,059 --> 00:24:34,130
amusing to love them I am clock
synchronizing them

404
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:38,150
which years a convenience but isn't
absolutely required

405
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:43,490
for this application I it does simplify
some other software to happen clock

406
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:46,590
synchronizer know you have to do to
synchronize and just connect a cable

407
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:47,659
from one to the other

408
00:24:47,659 --> 00:24:51,360
sell the first setup that I used

409
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,530
was with these up these PCB antennas

410
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:59,720
that our lawn periodic antennas produced
up by

411
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,809
can Britain in the US %uh their

412
00:25:02,809 --> 00:25:07,020
very I excellent antennas for their size
and cost

413
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:11,309
their quite portable I can fit them in
my laptop bag which is terrific

414
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:14,370
and they're quite directional and a

415
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:18,570
they operate overall very wide frequency
range so I can experiment at a lot of

416
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:19,549
different frequencies

417
00:25:19,549 --> 00:25:22,940
and so I would just put them on a
tabletop like this

418
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:26,490
and two short-range radar experiments
with two antennas

419
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:29,660
aimed at my target one transmitting and
one receiving

420
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:35,440
the biggest problem with this was that
the radiation pattern of these antennas

421
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,620
while most have the energy goes out in
the direction and they're pointing

422
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:43,750
some other energy goes sideways and the
heck its

423
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:48,140
tricky when you're trying to to pick up
a fairly weak reflection

424
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:52,260
up when you have a signal that's going
directly

425
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:55,360
from your transmit antenna to you
receive into

426
00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:00,900
there's a strong ass a there's a
stronger amount of energy going sideways

427
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:04,650
then you get going forward and then
bouncing back

428
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:09,679
the the reflection is very weak itself
even though most of the energy is going

429
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:10,390
forward

430
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:14,299
there the reflection is very tiny
relatively and so

431
00:26:14,299 --> 00:26:17,380
in order to make this work properly I
would usually have to

432
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:22,210
I am might put some big metal shield in
between the two

433
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:25,830
and tennis usually worked like I would
just taken a laptop or something

434
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:29,260
put it between two antennas and suddenly
things will start working

435
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:33,669
on but instead up doing that I found

436
00:26:33,669 --> 00:26:36,750
that its a little bit more convenient to
have the setup time

437
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:40,630
I just put together last night here I
with coffee cans

438
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:44,049
similar to great shots copy can read our

439
00:26:44,049 --> 00:26:48,120
trip to the coffee cans don't have any
other on circuitry or anything

440
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:52,059
there just waveguide in tennis I put
together

441
00:26:52,059 --> 00:26:55,970
and connected to hack Rs so there's
nothing to this setup other

442
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:56,690
then

443
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:59,760
a laptop to hack RF ones and

444
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:04,080
to antennas that happen to be built are
copycats and

445
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,950
since I was preparing for dem on Europe
I decided to use European copy

446
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:13,420
I'll I I spent a lot more on the copy
that I could have

447
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:17,100
buying as in the US but on a mime

448
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:21,840
employees was quite happy about it I via

449
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,180
as he gets really good copy while I'm
traveling on

450
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:28,400
so base in taszar very simple

451
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:32,150
they just have a tiny little wiring in
there like up

452
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:35,370
two or three centimeters long and I

453
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:38,420
its just a little monopole

454
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:43,280
antenna inside the waveguide and
connected to these as a May connectors

455
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:46,840
that's all there is to it so that's my
radar

456
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:50,510
now I want to talk about the river the
rector reflectors themselves

457
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:53,550
and so the implant that I have over here

458
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:57,060
is based on this very very simple design

459
00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:00,590
at years I one transistor

460
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:04,380
with an antenna antenna in this case

461
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:08,110
years iodine poll antenna so it's just

462
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:11,540
too little pieces of wire so the same
little length of wire that I have inside

463
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:12,130
my own

464
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:15,840
waveguide here and have to have them and
they're connected

465
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:19,680
through this are MOSFET transistor

466
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:22,800
and man the game up that Moscow

467
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,930
is connected to the signal that I want
to monitor

468
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:28,940
that's all there is to it its

469
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:32,400
the simplest design that I've been able
to come up with

470
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:37,850
and I think it's important even know
more complex designs are certainly

471
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:42,860
use Paul I think it's important to
understand kinda the simplest case

472
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:45,940
before we get too crazy with a

473
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:50,440
complicating things so the first the
first try bill was just like

474
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:54,830
a loose transistor with wire soldered to
it but I thought well be nice to make a

475
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:56,320
little PCB's a loving

476
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,120
ha stays together I

477
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:03,290
and so I made Asia a little circuit boar
printed circuit board

478
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:06,350
on notice that happen the circuit board
as

479
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:10,330
had nothing on it other than a label
hahh amps

480
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:13,560
a and and i ended up being

481
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:16,900
my original design ended up being much
smaller than like a minimum design that

482
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,340
night circuit board house

483
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:22,950
would support so I'm made a bigger by
adding some optional components and a

484
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:24,790
big label on it but again

485
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:28,210
its one transistor went to pieces two
pieces of wire

486
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:32,320
and this is codename Conger flock in Mia
NSA playset

487
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,580
because everything is a place that has
to have a ridiculous name

488
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:41,690
I hey this is an example of Hama flock
wired into a cable

489
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:44,870
cable has a signal that I wanna walk
monitor

490
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:48,520
and so all I have to do is connect
ground and signal

491
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:51,600
from within the cable network stripped
out some

492
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,730
some %ah up a shielding I

493
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:58,450
or lacquered shielding whatever's there
on

494
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:01,680
I've stripped out the the sheaf

495
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:05,290
an attached condo clock to a data line

496
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:08,460
and ground and this is the kind of setup

497
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:12,180
I was able to get my first my first
successful reflections from

498
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:15,820
I I wanna chill let people a desk on the

499
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:19,090
bilbies things for themselves so I made
sheets of

500
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:23,790
like a thousand of them I and I don't
know how many people took a matchup but

501
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:25,340
this was my hardware hacking village

502
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:29,520
and attack on him there wasn't much left
in it why I got into the weekend

503
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:35,540
interestingly the up by we I use those
cable ties to attach

504
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:39,740
the be cutters to it so people could cut
in strips on

505
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:43,490
wire antennas and of course you can use
the the cutters

506
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:47,790
to a cut cable ties better holding the
cutter

507
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:51,030
but amazingly no one did that for at
least 24 hours

508
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:54,530
job are so this

509
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:58,470
but was not in the next I the next
threat to reflect your day bill

510
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:01,710
and is the one that I have appear for my

511
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:05,170
live demonstration today have called for
Michael flock

512
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:09,510
and there isn't much to it it's pretty
much the same as calm before Oct one

513
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:11,690
transistor two pieces of wire

514
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:15,440
is gist on a circuit board that has two
ps2

515
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,999
keyboard connectors on it and the reason
for that is just

516
00:31:18,999 --> 00:31:22,070
to make it convenient to experiment with
I

517
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:25,779
theoretically this type of device could
be implanted inside a cable

518
00:31:25,779 --> 00:31:29,490
or inside a keyboard rather easily but

519
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:33,379
I for experimenting with different
keyboards on

520
00:31:33,379 --> 00:31:36,659
different setups it's very convenient to
have connectors on

521
00:31:36,659 --> 00:31:40,690
and that's the only reason why I and
made some abuse particular designs

522
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:44,629
it's just to have connectors for yousef
use while experimenting

523
00:31:44,629 --> 00:31:48,730
and with me flank oh clock

524
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:53,940
what I walk to do is determine the
keystrokes that are being typed

525
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:57,379
so if you look at the ps2

526
00:31:57,379 --> 00:32:00,919
keyboard protocol you'll see that
there's a clock signal

527
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:05,119
and a data signal so up he rides from
from the stop

528
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:10,749
this example image online you can see
channel a is a clock signal

529
00:32:10,749 --> 00:32:14,899
but tolls the receiver cartels aka the
host computer wind

530
00:32:14,899 --> 00:32:18,779
sample the I A the channel B which is

531
00:32:18,779 --> 00:32:23,529
me data signal so the information that's
unique to the letter Q

532
00:32:23,529 --> 00:32:27,480
is this particular pattern in the data
signal where I have three short

533
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,629
downward Paulson's followed by one long
poles

534
00:32:30,629 --> 00:32:33,799
three short pulses followed by a long
poles so

535
00:32:33,799 --> 00:32:37,389
if I were to be monitoring the signal
that is

536
00:32:37,389 --> 00:32:41,119
and are monitoring one other signals on
the day to mine the one I'm most

537
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:44,610
interested in is is the data signal
shall be here

538
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:48,029
I don't really care about the clock
signal it would be nice to have a clock

539
00:32:48,029 --> 00:32:49,549
signal I would help me

540
00:32:49,549 --> 00:32:52,769
decode the data signal more easily by

541
00:32:52,769 --> 00:32:57,039
the important thing if that I get there
o'clock our side the data signal

542
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:00,369
and high show your a little
demonstration here so

543
00:33:00,369 --> 00:33:05,669
man a star Anna transmitting change
being with one antenna

544
00:33:05,669 --> 00:33:09,809
2.4 gigahertz ban and bad I'm going to

545
00:33:09,809 --> 00:33:12,999
start my little photographing the new
radio I

546
00:33:12,999 --> 00:33:18,320
to get try to get information from the
return signal it's reflecting

547
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:22,039
of up be of the rat reflector

548
00:33:22,039 --> 00:33:25,409
I'm only doing this experiment over on
what

549
00:33:25,409 --> 00:33:28,909
you know 30 centimeters or something
like that not very long

550
00:33:28,909 --> 00:33:32,700
I am but you have to start somewhere
high so

551
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:36,669
I'm going to set up a little trigger
Heroes is like an oscilloscope

552
00:33:36,669 --> 00:33:39,769
trigger and the a

553
00:33:39,769 --> 00:33:43,499
let's see what happens on when I press
the letter Q

554
00:33:43,499 --> 00:33:46,649
oh there we go that's a little stronger

555
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:50,989
that was last night a there so

556
00:33:50,989 --> 00:33:54,879
as you can see I have three short pulses
followed by a long poles

557
00:33:54,879 --> 00:33:58,739
the only difference from what I was
looking for is that is upside down

558
00:33:58,739 --> 00:34:03,139
I am and whether it's upside down or
rightside up seems to be a little

559
00:34:03,139 --> 00:34:04,159
unpredictable

560
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:07,169
I have not actually figured out yet I A

561
00:34:07,169 --> 00:34:10,389
if there's a way that I can control that
by

562
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:15,139
if definitely recognizable like were to
correlate for this pattern of three

563
00:34:15,139 --> 00:34:17,220
short pulses followed by a long poles

564
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:20,730
I would very easily be able to didn't
act won so many

565
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:24,039
typing the letter Q and just as another
example

566
00:34:24,039 --> 00:34:27,730
%uh the letter so that's a letter Q

567
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:31,500
I the letter A should be like too long
poll since

568
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:37,559
a rico I and interestingly this is the
first time this demo has ever worked

569
00:34:37,559 --> 00:34:43,080
and alive I haha I live the

570
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:48,700
I so thank you to troopers for having
missed the

571
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:52,050
miss lecture and out big fair in a cage
I am

572
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:55,750
make us I %ah wanna

573
00:34:55,750 --> 00:35:00,940
above the a one of the reasons well two
reasons why I think that this demo has

574
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:03,630
failed a lot in the past when you're
staying right here

575
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:07,280
SEO that poll so just happened that
kinda squarish polls

576
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,820
there was little downward pull some a
source squarish one very strong but

577
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:15,370
up act I in the past

578
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:21,340
I've done this demo overlay a maybe 60
centimeters instead of 30 centimeters

579
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:24,800
that may not sound like much but the

580
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:29,040
a the signal strength in a radar system
is proportional to

581
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:32,880
beef fourth pay its like the radius or
the Just Dance

582
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,930
to the fourth power so Inc increasing
additions a little bit

583
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:40,420
degrades the signal quality the
reflection a lot

584
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:44,400
so I was trying to do it over I was
kinda pushing the limits and doing it

585
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,690
over like more distant I really needed
to for proof of concept

586
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:50,940
and I would get things like those little
square

587
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:54,670
squarish patterns both are much bigger
in proportion

588
00:35:54,670 --> 00:36:01,670
to my reflected signal and those things
are probably mostly wifi packed

589
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:06,980
and I'm yeah and I'm seeing wifi
packages kinda interfere with my

590
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:11,680
experiment but now course ever actually
doing something smart like

591
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:16,260
like using map to correlate to the
particular pattern i'm looking for.

592
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:20,640
then the wifi pack it shouldn't matter
much but if I'm doing something dumb

593
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,360
like just triggering when I saw scope
like this

594
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:26,560
then life I package can shook me up a
lot

595
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,580
even though I'm not on frequency with
WiFi

596
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:33,630
WiFi signals are pretty powerful
relatively speaking an often

597
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:36,860
acecomm fairly close range and so

598
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:40,770
even the Audi I guess I'm adjacent
channel interference just enough

599
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:44,510
to cause trouble I experiment cell

600
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:47,530
%uh this works pretty well

601
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:50,820
and but it's pretty low bandwidth these

602
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:55,290
ps/2 keyboard signals are only a few
killer hurt like

603
00:36:55,290 --> 00:36:55,930
maybe 10

604
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:58,840
for fifteen killer hurts a band with her
something like it's like that so it's

605
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,430
something that actually could be done

606
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:04,400
with the sound card but one thing I
tried to do

607
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,430
in order to to alleviate

608
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:11,500
the problem up interference I that I
just mention

609
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:16,420
ways to do something like oh that's not
gonna work because I destroyed that

610
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:19,940
tempfile I don't really need a modest
gains not gonna work anyway

611
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:25,280
by I tried to do I am a direct sequence
spread spectrum

612
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,400
and implementation and what that means
here's

613
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,550
instead of transmitting a constant
carrier

614
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:35,460
and then trying to pick up the
reflection I transmit pattern

615
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:36,430
information

616
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:40,510
and I generate that pattern with a
random number generator so that no one

617
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:42,330
else is using that pattern

618
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:46,410
and then on my receiver in software

619
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:49,540
I try to do a pattern matcher
correlation

620
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:53,460
and I look for how strong the reflection
up that pattern

621
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:58,150
yes and be radically I should be able to
distinguish

622
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:01,580
reflections from any other radio
interference

623
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:05,740
I A hasn't worked yet and I'm not
entirely sure why

624
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:10,390
but I do like last night I was playing
with it as a setting up this demo

625
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:13,540
and thinking doggone it working finally
ended in

626
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:17,630
I'm I got it working where I was
definitely correlating reflections I

627
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:21,080
could move my hand around in front of
being an actor definitely see that that

628
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,440
cause and effect

629
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:27,830
but I wasn't able to get the actual
reflection from Racha reflector

630
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:30,900
discernible my software not tire leisure

631
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:35,290
why I one thing that that does not help
me with however

632
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:38,860
even if I got the direct sequence spread
spectrum thing working

633
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:44,030
I at that would not help me
differentiate between the reflection and

634
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:44,970
i'm looking for.

635
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:48,600
and other reflections like things
happening

636
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:52,610
cutting are reflecting about wall over
there maybe unintentional rhetoric

637
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:54,580
elections coming from the monitor down
here

638
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:58,740
there are a lot of things that could be
creating actual reflections up my

639
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:02,099
signal I am that the the

640
00:39:02,099 --> 00:39:05,579
correlation does not necessarily help me
with although up there

641
00:39:05,579 --> 00:39:09,619
they're far enough a parking space I
might actually be able to distinguish

642
00:39:09,619 --> 00:39:11,800
between them which would be fun to play
with

643
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:15,559
up I wanna show you a little bit of what
I'm doing here

644
00:39:15,559 --> 00:39:18,900
and a new radio to to actually

645
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:23,240
accomplish this detection and it's very
simple

646
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:27,630
but you don't really need to know much
about the new radio are all this PLO

647
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:28,119
graph

648
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:32,099
all you need to know is this one block
right here complex to mag

649
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:35,430
squared I that is doing

650
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:40,400
amplitude d modulation and that's the
important ingredient all I'm doing is

651
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,579
just measuring

652
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:44,700
how much the how much a min

653
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:48,420
amplitude up the transmitted signal I'm
receiving back

654
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:51,440
and I just popped that amplitude
overtime I

655
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:55,230
that's really the only important thing
to know here so

656
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:59,210
go back here this is this is an example
of when it's

657
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:02,730
kinda flipped around the other direction
example of what I've actually

658
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:06,520
found my test results I have an expresso
reflector I made

659
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:09,589
was tango flock which is a USB rhetoric
lecter

660
00:40:09,589 --> 00:40:13,250
and I haven't done a whole lot of
experimenting with it but I have briefly

661
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:14,049
tested

662
00:40:14,049 --> 00:40:17,950
a low-speed USB to figure out

663
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:21,359
had and I'm what I've done it just kind
of worked insanity check

664
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:24,559
the the return I got to make sure that

665
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:28,980
it looks like low-speed USB and it does
it looks similar to the same signal by

666
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:33,430
get if I just probe the USB cable

667
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:37,240
with an oscilloscope so I'm definitely
getting a good return

668
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:41,270
with a low-speed USB and of course
low-speed USB is interesting because

669
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:44,420
most keyboards these days are not ps2

670
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:47,640
but they are low speed USB I

671
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:52,849
and to in order to do low-speed USB you
need to capture ban where

672
00:40:52,849 --> 00:40:56,369
that I can remember exactly but in the
neighborhood have a megahertz

673
00:40:56,369 --> 00:40:59,990
much more than you can get with the
sound card so if you want to take this

674
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:01,200
type of experiment

675
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,920
and move upgrade from from my ps2

676
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,990
to USB keyboards than

677
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:12,290
you definitely need something more I
higher band with more sophisticated and

678
00:41:12,290 --> 00:41:12,970
sound card

679
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:17,920
so I haven't tested anything with full
speed USB but I

680
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:21,500
think there's a good potential and i
could get some date out a bit

681
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:24,770
job the and

682
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:29,319
Hannah I the other options hi-speed USB
SuperSpeed USB are things that are very

683
00:41:29,319 --> 00:41:30,579
unlikely to work

684
00:41:30,579 --> 00:41:34,609
without using extremely expensive
equipment so I'm not really going to try

685
00:41:34,609 --> 00:41:35,950
to target those things

686
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:39,000
and then the next one I tried

687
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,190
s also flock which is VGA

688
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:45,020
pressure reflector in this one's a
little more complicated if you look at

689
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:46,059
the circuit down there

690
00:41:46,059 --> 00:41:49,119
is not large but it has more than one
transistor

691
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:53,329
I and the reason for that is because
buga signaling

692
00:41:53,329 --> 00:41:59,589
is very low voltage it only aim
fluctuates between 0 and about .7 bolts

693
00:41:59,589 --> 00:42:03,190
and that isn't high enough can't get
into the active region

694
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:06,950
where most transistors wall do anything
interesting

695
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:12,150
with that signal so I need to bias the
transistor and you to raise the voltage

696
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:15,180
up and the trick amusing to do that

697
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:19,960
is actually have siphoning off teeny
tiny little bit of power

698
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:25,140
from be I the little digital signaling
that goes between the host computer and

699
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:25,859
monitor

700
00:42:25,859 --> 00:42:30,160
there's a little bit of control channel
in addition to me

701
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:34,339
a video signals and the control channel
is actually

702
00:42:34,339 --> 00:42:37,940
very similar to a ps2 control channel
where it has

703
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:42,250
data and cock and if you notice from
from the ps2

704
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:47,400
signal notice that before and after a
transmission the voltage level is high

705
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:50,900
that's exactly what happens on a like

706
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:54,130
on the ps2 are sorry I'm a control thing
on PGA

707
00:42:54,130 --> 00:42:58,299
so I'm able to just our site than a
little tiny bit a power of a clock

708
00:42:58,299 --> 00:42:59,079
signal

709
00:42:59,079 --> 00:43:02,380
in the BGH fast enough to raise the
voltage

710
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:07,349
and to allow mine my BG rhetoric like to
work so it's a little bit of a more

711
00:43:07,349 --> 00:43:09,809
complicated circuit requires a little
bit more

712
00:43:09,809 --> 00:43:12,740
knowledge about rocks to build something
like this are designed something like

713
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:13,059
this

714
00:43:13,059 --> 00:43:17,680
but the actual mechanism a modulating
the

715
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:20,570
modulating the reflection from the
antenna is identical

716
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:25,070
and then again after I put on a board
with UGA connectors to make it well

717
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:29,109
easier to work with now I don't have a
live demo of this one but I have some

718
00:43:29,109 --> 00:43:30,119
same data

719
00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:33,560
that I have captured from a previous run

720
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:38,359
and I do well show you the flow graphic
it's not very interesting again but

721
00:43:38,359 --> 00:43:41,900
I am but again it has the same

722
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:44,869
essential element which is

723
00:43:44,869 --> 00:43:49,029
is right here complex to mag I'm taking
the magnitude

724
00:43:49,029 --> 00:43:53,170
up to receive samples so again I'm just
doing amplitude e modulation

725
00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:57,299
and converting the output into bites
that I stuff into a file

726
00:43:57,299 --> 00:44:01,349
that's all there is to it just Apple 2d
modulating to receive signal

727
00:44:01,349 --> 00:44:06,869
and then head it's a little harder to
interpret the way former PGA miss you

728
00:44:06,869 --> 00:44:08,859
actually visualized somehow

729
00:44:08,859 --> 00:44:13,950
so I saved a bunch of bytes to a file
and it's just a list a bite

730
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:17,730
that has the be amplitude to receive
amplitude

731
00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:22,730
at instance in time just a whole lotta
received ample tunes in a row

732
00:44:22,730 --> 00:44:25,999
that caller is this file at out just
open up

733
00:44:25,999 --> 00:44:29,109
and damp I the a

734
00:44:29,109 --> 00:44:33,309
was a call here we go if you give game a
file name that dot data

735
00:44:33,309 --> 00:44:36,390
it just region as Rob bytes and

736
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:39,799
lets you can play around with a pram
earners to see if you can pull an image

737
00:44:39,799 --> 00:44:40,480
out a bit

738
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:43,630
I am so so

739
00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:46,700
like I don't necessarily know what

740
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:51,609
what with I'm going to fine but if I
kinda Rasta rising with a variety of

741
00:44:51,609 --> 00:44:52,529
different wins

742
00:44:52,529 --> 00:44:56,769
I can see images pop I'll I and
hopefully

743
00:44:56,769 --> 00:45:01,960
you know of Finance actual whole screen
image at some point I if I keep

744
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:06,059
just trying different different
resolutions now the resolution here

745
00:45:06,059 --> 00:45:11,380
the with that I'm typing an I is is
going to be close to the one that

746
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:15,549
above the target monitor but not exactly
because it has to do with

747
00:45:15,549 --> 00:45:18,970
the ratio between the pixel rate above
the target

748
00:45:18,970 --> 00:45:22,099
and Mike capture sample rate

749
00:45:22,099 --> 00:45:25,050
on the

750
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:29,560
tho

751
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:32,130
so this is an actual up signal

752
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:35,750
you know that I received with the setup
just like this on

753
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:39,250
unfortunately I I I actually tried to
set up a live demo this

754
00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:43,600
and have completely failed I don't know
why it worked once in my lab in has it

755
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:44,230
works at

756
00:45:44,230 --> 00:45:47,480
I maybe I broke the circuit somehow I'm
not completely troubleshooter

757
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:51,370
a job done the troubleshooting but it
definitely worked what's

758
00:45:51,370 --> 00:45:54,440
and I you can see I was

759
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:57,960
I had booted pen to run a tard computer

760
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:01,380
and you can actually see the output love
XR NR there were

761
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:04,760
I had set the output to 640 by 480

762
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:10,580
at 60 Hertz now I specifically chose 640
by 480 is 60 Hertz because there's like

763
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:11,300
the lowest

764
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:15,540
be easiest target that I could get right
I didn't wanna have a wild and crazy

765
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:17,150
huge resolution

766
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:21,590
that would have more bits per second and
require more bandwidth to capture

767
00:46:21,590 --> 00:46:27,600
64 if you multiply 640 by 480 by sixty
you end up

768
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:32,460
a little bit under 20,000 and %ah and
then there's a little bit of inflation

769
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:33,520
because there's a

770
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:36,700
there's a vertical sync period

771
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:40,550
added to it I would you might be able to
see here if you

772
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:44,300
if I can ask for all over this way see
that bright line on a side that's that

773
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:45,050
movie saying

774
00:46:45,050 --> 00:46:48,230
I think are maybe that's actually that

775
00:46:48,230 --> 00:46:52,090
that's probably apart something that was
on screen me saying is probably in this

776
00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:53,290
noise in between

777
00:46:53,290 --> 00:46:56,360
frames here I anyway during that meeting

778
00:46:56,360 --> 00:47:00,040
period at the globe it so it ends up
that there about

779
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:03,740
20 a million pixels per second at the
screen resolution

780
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:07,930
and that means that the maximum
frequency I need to capture

781
00:47:07,930 --> 00:47:11,700
it 10 million 10 megahertz

782
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:15,760
so I need to capture band with a 10
megahertz which is well within the range

783
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:18,890
a pack rf1 back I should be able to go
twice that much

784
00:47:18,890 --> 00:47:23,850
but of course twice that much still is
in a very big screen resolution remember

785
00:47:23,850 --> 00:47:24,310
cuz

786
00:47:24,310 --> 00:47:27,690
I dealing with a Academy area of the
screen

787
00:47:27,690 --> 00:47:30,700
not to not the height or width the
screen cell

788
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:34,190
it so even with a car f1 I don't
necessarily have enough

789
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:39,480
resolute bob and capture band where to
be able to resolve so clearly

790
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:40,790
a image

791
00:47:40,790 --> 00:47:44,850
from a monitor that is running a very
much higher

792
00:47:44,850 --> 00:47:49,010
screen resolution so I did some
experiments I just took this same data

793
00:47:49,010 --> 00:47:53,120
and filtered in different ways to try to
simulate what would have happened if I

794
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,240
had captured it with less bandwidth

795
00:47:55,240 --> 00:48:00,860
I am because that gives me an idea of
how successful this attack might be

796
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:03,990
even if I have a capture band with that
as

797
00:48:03,990 --> 00:48:07,280
not sufficient to fully describe the
image

798
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:11,190
that's on somebody scream and and so

799
00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:15,300
this is what you know this is what the
image looks like I A

800
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:20,480
when I had to fall capture bad way and
so I sent by simulated what if I A

801
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:23,650
only captured the lower frequencies like
a quarter

802
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:26,960
up the bandwidth and I think I need and
it looks like that

803
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:31,200
notice the difference this is the full
band with this is a quarterback

804
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:34,610
so even at a corner bandwidth there's
quite a bit of the image that is

805
00:48:34,610 --> 00:48:35,750
resolvable

806
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:39,030
even if I only have one for southern
part amway

807
00:48:39,030 --> 00:48:42,860
and then I tried designing where I only
had half the ban wave and I decided to

808
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:46,470
focus on the higher frequency components
and set up a lower frequency component

809
00:48:46,470 --> 00:48:47,000
so I could

810
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,330
theoretically I could to my radio just
to get

811
00:48:50,330 --> 00:48:54,010
like I would strip away from the center
frequency

812
00:48:54,010 --> 00:48:58,850
be transmission in order to get the
higher frequency module

813
00:48:58,850 --> 00:49:02,420
other components in the modulation
that's happening from the reflection

814
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:05,750
handed ups with something like this and

815
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:09,830
dog depending on your need what your
what type of thing you're looking for on

816
00:49:09,830 --> 00:49:10,880
somebody's screen

817
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:14,070
are you might be better off looking at a
lower

818
00:49:14,070 --> 00:49:17,840
I lower a frequencies or higher
frequencies

819
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:22,790
and %ah if you're looking for tax free
sample high frequencies might be

820
00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:27,020
more help for but if you but if you look
at lower frequencies you basically just

821
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:27,650
have

822
00:49:27,650 --> 00:49:31,080
have a lower resolution image up with
the screen its

823
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:34,440
however there's one thing I haven't
taken advantage of yet and I want to

824
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:35,550
point this out

825
00:49:35,550 --> 00:49:38,560
if I look through this file

826
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:42,500
look at this I have the same screenshot

827
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:48,530
over and over and over again how often
does the image on your screen change

828
00:49:48,530 --> 00:49:50,810
when you're reading some taxed or
something

829
00:49:50,810 --> 00:49:53,980
well the entire screen is transmitted

830
00:49:53,980 --> 00:50:00,130
sixty times per second at least many
miners have a higher refresh rate so

831
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:04,590
I could be taking advantage of the fact
that I've captured

832
00:50:04,590 --> 00:50:10,180
hundreds or thousands up still the same
skirmish screen image or almost a skank

833
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:11,240
same screen image

834
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:15,600
and I should be able to get better and
better resolution simply by combining

835
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:17,850
many consecutive images together

836
00:50:17,850 --> 00:50:22,860
so I take this to mean to me that if I
were to capture something like best

837
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:23,640
quality

838
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:27,140
but I capture it a thousand times then

839
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:32,910
I can probably I actually polling
information out read text of a bit I

840
00:50:32,910 --> 00:50:36,680
without too much trouble so I

841
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:40,990
me the NSA place at project is

842
00:50:40,990 --> 00:50:44,110
continuing today I hope that

843
00:50:44,110 --> 00:50:47,750
some of you will check out some of the
other talks that I've given and other

844
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:48,710
people have given

845
00:50:48,710 --> 00:50:51,740
up check out as a playset outward

846
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:55,940
and i join the fun I definitely
encourage you especially if you have a

847
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:59,170
project in mind something you've been
wanting to play with that you think

848
00:50:59,170 --> 00:51:00,550
would fit well in our

849
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:03,630
in our toolset come join us

850
00:51:03,630 --> 00:51:08,520
I all of my designs the a little
electronic pressure reflectors

851
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:12,170
that i've shown are on get hub and

852
00:51:12,170 --> 00:51:16,510
I of course I you can find me angry
Scott gadgets dot com

853
00:51:16,510 --> 00:51:19,730
and do we have many you have a minute
for a question

854
00:51:19,730 --> 00:51:26,210
yes exxon and questions

855
00:51:26,210 --> 00:51:29,310
her well Russia 10

856
00:51:29,310 --> 00:51:32,310
lower up i fix

857
00:51:32,310 --> 00:51:36,070
eyeliner on getting lower with the
frequencies II

858
00:51:36,070 --> 00:51:39,650
that way you can gain or are I'll more
distance

859
00:51:39,650 --> 00:51:44,430
all lower frequencies that instead of
using 2.4 gigahertz lower frequencies

860
00:51:44,430 --> 00:51:47,820
I am so that's a good question

861
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:51,640
%uh inherently and I think we're here

862
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:56,890
employer suggesting is that a lower
frequency radio signals tend to have

863
00:51:56,890 --> 00:51:58,000
better propagation

864
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,140
arm and thats

865
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:04,770
at least mostly because I'm for you know
them sizeof the intent

866
00:52:04,770 --> 00:52:10,510
but to me the reason that i've targeted
2.4 gigahertz

867
00:52:10,510 --> 00:52:13,680
as several other there are several
reasons

868
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:17,950
wanna here's I am all

869
00:52:17,950 --> 00:52:21,440
one is to do where just them legality

870
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:24,710
playing with a stop in demonstrating in
multiple countries

871
00:52:24,710 --> 00:52:28,150
you can get away with a lot in the 2.4
gigahertz ban

872
00:52:28,150 --> 00:52:34,350
and I'm and in particular I'm using the
high and in the 2.4 gigahertz ban which

873
00:52:34,350 --> 00:52:36,170
in many countries including the US

874
00:52:36,170 --> 00:52:39,720
I is not occupied by wifi

875
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:43,800
the highest WiFi channel is legal in the
US is a little bit below

876
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:47,110
%uh the top and a the 2.4 gigahertz bad

877
00:52:47,110 --> 00:52:50,950
and there's a couple megahertz there
that is unoccupied by bluetooth

878
00:52:50,950 --> 00:52:55,050
either so head lease for the lower band
with experiments that I'm doing

879
00:52:55,050 --> 00:52:58,390
I I have some pretty wide open

880
00:52:58,390 --> 00:53:01,890
%uh spectrum that nobody really cares
what I do with

881
00:53:01,890 --> 00:53:05,730
I the only thing that's likely to get my
way is like

882
00:53:05,730 --> 00:53:09,220
somebody using a microwave oven nearby
or something but those tend to be in the

883
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:10,560
lower reaches a ver

884
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:14,880
up the wifi bear a bit asaro 2.4
gigahertz ban

885
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:19,280
so I it's a good suggestion to try
things at lower frequencies

886
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:22,810
I but the lower I go the bigger antenna

887
00:53:22,810 --> 00:53:27,470
I'm going to need and so like this type
up a waveguide antenna becomes rather

888
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:30,980
cumbersome at very low frequencies but I
could use you now being

889
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:35,510
Yankees or something and do stuff and in
maybe the

890
00:53:35,510 --> 00:53:35,930
low

891
00:53:35,930 --> 00:53:40,900
or UHF band or the high VHF band summer
somewhere like hundreds have megahertz

892
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:44,540
I think that would be a fruitful idea
for

893
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:51,540
for future work definitely I am a while
another thing to keep in mind is that be

894
00:53:51,650 --> 00:53:55,130
I the unintentional emissions

895
00:53:55,130 --> 00:53:58,770
are more of a factor in the lower in
frequency you go

896
00:53:58,770 --> 00:54:02,340
so like year modern a

897
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:06,690
are any any display is going to have a
lot on intentional

898
00:54:06,690 --> 00:54:10,480
emissions that are in me tens 202
megahertz

899
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:14,430
and so if I get well above the hundreds
megahertz

900
00:54:14,430 --> 00:54:18,120
then I can be more certain that what I'm
seeing

901
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:21,810
is a reflection from my signal as
opposed to seeing

902
00:54:21,810 --> 00:54:25,240
and unintentional mission in addition to

903
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:29,370
my sick or unrelated to what I am
reflecting of it so that that's another

904
00:54:29,370 --> 00:54:30,350
reason to

905
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:34,940
%uh log you course you could set up a
controlling your experimenter

906
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:38,230
account for that but good pop

907
00:54:38,230 --> 00:54:42,430
any other questions circuit or

908
00:54:42,430 --> 00:54:48,270
read a paragraph

909
00:54:48,270 --> 00:54:51,780
others wanna back row your cross on a
Saturday

910
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:55,440
okay i three active fighter

911
00:54:55,440 --> 00:55:00,180
budget so

912
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:03,460
the the repeated the image rate

913
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:07,360
that gives you a signal at the

914
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:10,780
and aliased frequency great mmm

915
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:13,940
the but they're not just the repetition

916
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:17,160
implies a leasing I'll

917
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:21,580
wouldn't it I was I was trying to think
that would to increase your band with

918
00:55:21,580 --> 00:55:22,730
quite a lot

919
00:55:22,730 --> 00:55:28,130
to catch that 0 well in the bath be
increased bandwidth have the repetition

920
00:55:28,130 --> 00:55:31,740
comes in the form love the pixel clock
being higher

921
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:34,750
so if your screen refresh rate is 60
Hertz

922
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:38,210
versus somebody else's screen refresh
rate a 85 hurts

923
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:41,870
I you know they're pixel clock as
considerably higher

924
00:55:41,870 --> 00:55:45,130
and so that means more bandwidth
required to capture

925
00:55:45,130 --> 00:55:50,000
on my supposition is that I should be
able to

926
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:54,330
I I kinda compensate for that

927
00:55:54,330 --> 00:55:57,370
Lawson band with better as an attacker

928
00:55:57,370 --> 00:56:02,440
I by taking advantage of the fact that
there are more repetitions I can put

929
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:08,309
together

930
00:56:08,309 --> 00:56:10,970
wanna back grow up there okay

931
00:56:10,970 --> 00:56:17,970
now ok I will be our last fall sports a

932
00:56:18,869 --> 00:56:22,309
political de moss I mean from my salter
guide at

933
00:56:22,309 --> 00:56:25,769
amazing like to me it's like magic but I
was wondering

934
00:56:25,769 --> 00:56:29,739
a mean I guess your goal was to to see
if you know you could refer use

935
00:56:29,739 --> 00:56:32,739
an essay and France capabilities right

936
00:56:32,739 --> 00:56:36,289
a how far do you think they they can go

937
00:56:36,289 --> 00:56:40,720
interrelate the stands right we first
specific agreement where you know budget

938
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:41,690
is not an issue

939
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:44,730
which I guess for you was a constraint
so far you know

940
00:56:44,730 --> 00:56:47,799
you mentioned several times about cost
and then and

941
00:56:47,799 --> 00:56:51,279
you know technology that was available
right how much is you know how much you

942
00:56:51,279 --> 00:56:51,739
think

943
00:56:51,739 --> 00:56:54,759
that they can go interrupt the synthetic
that's a good question I

944
00:56:54,759 --> 00:56:58,130
what kind of difference like nick has
clearly I'm not doing any impressive

945
00:56:58,130 --> 00:56:58,989
distance here

946
00:56:58,989 --> 00:57:02,170
have on me I I

947
00:57:02,170 --> 00:57:06,160
ever enter the inspiration for the
project a I want to make it clear that

948
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:09,160
I wasn't just inspired to make

949
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:14,019
toy is similar to the NSA I was inspired

950
00:57:14,019 --> 00:57:17,170
to research an area that i think is on
research

951
00:57:17,170 --> 00:57:20,200
I I think that that

952
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:25,380
devices anna & elect the equipment that
we use today that carries sensitive

953
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:26,289
information

954
00:57:26,289 --> 00:57:29,319
may be vulnerable in ways that we don't
understand

955
00:57:29,319 --> 00:57:34,180
and if we don't understand it I'll will
never be able to improve on those

956
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:36,499
systems and make them less vulnerable

957
00:57:36,499 --> 00:57:39,710
so I think it's extremely important that
%ah

958
00:57:39,710 --> 00:57:43,819
we as a community explore this area
research to understand that their

959
00:57:43,819 --> 00:57:45,140
weaknesses are devices

960
00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:48,839
about getting back to the distance I as
I mentioned earlier the

961
00:57:48,839 --> 00:57:52,670
the distances as a other the amount of
reflection I get

962
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:56,690
is related to the the fourth power up
the distance so I have to increase my

963
00:57:56,690 --> 00:57:57,140
power

964
00:57:57,140 --> 00:58:02,049
a lot and order to I in order to
increase my distance not have done

965
00:58:02,049 --> 00:58:02,880
experiments

966
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:06,230
over longer distances like a couple of
meters

967
00:58:06,230 --> 00:58:11,039
a but it's very difficult to get right
it's more sense it's more prone to

968
00:58:11,039 --> 00:58:11,880
failure

969
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:16,349
I am it's more prone to make slight
adjustments in a

970
00:58:16,349 --> 00:58:19,829
the orientation my antenna and I am

971
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:24,150
more prone to interference so it's a lot
harder to get working

972
00:58:24,150 --> 00:58:29,109
however be radically the only thing
preventing me from

973
00:58:29,109 --> 00:58:32,280
doing this over significantly longer
distances

974
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:35,829
years the amount of power my transmitter

975
00:58:35,829 --> 00:58:39,260
and the quality my antenna I

976
00:58:39,260 --> 00:58:43,319
need as I increase the power mine my
transmitter

977
00:58:43,319 --> 00:58:47,760
I increase the amount of direct coupling
from Meijer transmitter to my receiver

978
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:51,210
and so I need better antennas that that
directed their

979
00:58:51,210 --> 00:58:54,349
I their output or input I

980
00:58:54,349 --> 00:58:57,960
more then be used to perhaps and

981
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:01,940
and increase the amount of shielding
between the two antennas and that's one

982
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:03,809
of the great advantages to the waveguide

983
00:59:03,809 --> 00:59:08,059
merced the PCB is that they kind of are
inherently shielded from each other a

984
00:59:08,059 --> 00:59:08,680
little better

985
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:12,299
are a lot better than the PCB antennas
were I me

986
00:59:12,299 --> 00:59:15,980
via so theoretically I think

987
00:59:15,980 --> 00:59:19,890
if I were to increase my power a lot
have better antennas I think I could do

988
00:59:19,890 --> 00:59:20,670
this

989
00:59:20,670 --> 00:59:23,740
with this very retro reflector all for

990
00:59:23,740 --> 00:59:27,230
for something in the order of a hundred
meters I

991
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:30,760
but I haven't tested that I haven't
demonstrated that by I think it's very

992
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:31,660
possible

993
00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:36,640
and the main thing keeping me from doing
it and the amount radio energy that I

994
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:39,180
have transmit an experiment to do that

995
00:59:39,180 --> 00:59:42,920
and the potential for me interfering
with other news have a spectrum would be

996
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:43,910
very high

997
00:59:43,910 --> 00:59:47,020
and I I try to avoid those things

998
00:59:47,020 --> 00:59:51,160
now keep in mind that I'm using hack RF
which has a maximum

999
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:54,190
transmit power I in this band

1000
00:59:54,190 --> 00:59:57,650
about are 20 mil wats

1001
00:59:57,650 --> 01:00:01,559
20 mil a lot since considerably less
than a typical

1002
01:00:01,559 --> 01:00:05,160
WiFi device cell I am

1003
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:08,970
so I'm using very low transmit power
right now

1004
01:00:08,970 --> 01:00:12,049
and I also am NOT even

1005
01:00:12,049 --> 01:00:15,319
I'm not even close to the maximum power
the heck are up

1006
01:00:15,319 --> 01:00:19,540
if I goal take a look at the command
line I don't you remember what

1007
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:23,300
transmit power I use I used I

1008
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:26,590
oh yeah I use a tiny fraction I use
something

1009
01:00:26,590 --> 01:00:29,880
cool I talk on

1010
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:33,960
25d be less than the maximum transmit
power so

1011
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:37,320
overall I don't think I've come even
close to

1012
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:40,520
exploring the distance hasn't been a
priority

1013
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:43,560
for me higher priority has been proven
concept but

1014
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:46,780
just off the top my head I would guess
that this type of attack could be

1015
01:00:46,780 --> 01:00:48,790
practical to hundreds of meters

1016
01:00:48,790 --> 01:00:52,650
okay so I'm if therapy for other
Christian

1017
01:00:52,650 --> 01:00:56,400
I am I think Mike will be a waiver for
more questions

1018
01:00:56,400 --> 01:01:00,280
after the talk yeah I'll up the doc
people

1019
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:03,020
yeah so thank you very much mike have
had their
