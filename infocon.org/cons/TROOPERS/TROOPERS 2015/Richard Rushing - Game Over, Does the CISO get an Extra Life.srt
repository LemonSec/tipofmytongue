00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,129
I so love without further ado

3
00:00:07,129 --> 00:00:10,490
about me I am the CISO for Motorola

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:19,859

wish to follow me on twitter

6
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:23,609
I'm secretary I is enough that makes no
sense

7
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:28,640
but just go with it on that site ever I

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,810
I Miami for kids arm

9
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:35,239
do not wanna father follow in their
father's footsteps im

10
00:00:35,239 --> 00:00:40,120
anything technical or anything out yet
we have conversations

11
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,790
I truth common conversations that we
hide because we end up with

12
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:47,059
is much your daughters and one is
complaining that

13
00:00:47,059 --> 00:00:50,610
the other one broke into your Facebook
account and posted thanks and

14
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:55,039
I look at my daughter I save did you do
it she goes she had a crappy password

15
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,590
and at some point you're like a

16
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:04,019
while karma is comes back and hit you
every single time

17
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:09,260
the second instance is a help sponsor
event in Chicago contact for kids

18
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:13,840
it's a kid security conference on with
everything else my youngest daughter was

19
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,350
in there

20
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:19,470
and I had a couple parents come out and
makeup in here to change your Netflix

21
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:20,560
password

22
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,720
and Mike did my daughter like give out
the past 15

23
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,189
no no no no she talked about how to
create secure passwords and used your

24
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:32,380
Netflix password as an example

25
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:35,560
a am going

26
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,780
I going to live to the c50

27
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:43,659
I'm not sure I'm doing this a really
really long time I do have experience on

28
00:01:43,659 --> 00:01:44,740
both sides

29
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:48,110
have the facts I did a veteran security
startups

30
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:51,250
I did security Verisign

31
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:54,850
and air defense all successfully
acquired all

32
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:59,140
done very successfully on that site ever
I've also been on the corporate side

33
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:02,409
I work for some of the largest companies
in the world

34
00:02:02,409 --> 00:02:05,759
both GE and Siemens and now Motorola so

35
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,780
I can go from both sides is a slander
stand and it was very interesting in

36
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,780
today because I've

37
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:14,690
played both sides of the attack in the
deficits like to tell you it is so much

38
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:15,750
easier to play

39
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:20,180
on the attack inside and on the defense
inside you sleep a lot better at night

40
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:24,930
tell you that I'm and where the other
key items that he brought up was

41
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:25,920
extremely

42
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,220
point is for some bizarre reason and it
has nothing to do with this stuff only

43
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,019
way we can make

44
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:35,420
our networks more secure is by adding
complexity and total

45
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:39,010
we're just doing ourselves to failure at
this point in time and if we don't

46
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:40,310
really have a choice

47
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:44,319
kinda made our bed we have to sleep in
it this is a huge problem that we have

48
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:44,680
to

49
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,380
under and work with and work around and
some other cases

50
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:51,450
so about the gaming area I'm avid game

51
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:52,470
I

52
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:55,990
I've got four kids yes I play everything
across the Sun

53
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:59,060
and everything else so I started looking
at security in gaming

54
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:02,280
when I first heard looking at the stop
again said hey there's a lot a

55
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,840
correlation between us

56
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,440
and we're not just talking about lag
we're talking about a lot of different

57
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:07,990
things

58
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:12,320
so are the big ones that I want to bring
up is what I refer to a security cam P

59
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,490
for how many gamers do we actually have
been here

60
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:19,490
okay we've got a few okay you can raise
your hands is not a bad thing

61
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:22,510
I'm so for camping actually is

62
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:26,880
is the ability to people like I don't
wanna go run around I'm not that good so

63
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,380
I just hide somewhere

64
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:31,520
and when I see somebody I shoot them
from a long distance or anything else

65
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:35,500
typically kinda like a sniper it's an
area on everything else and most the

66
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,560
people after a while ago

67
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,900
really I can't you do something else
besides stand there

68
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,800
and they will hunt you down and kill you
usually and is usually by

69
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,010
twelve-year-old you can hear laughing
across the

70
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:49,260
the mic at the other end of the phone
I'm but

71
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:52,670
it's one of those things that goes into
it but we do this in the security

72
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:54,220
organization as well

73
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:57,720
we focus on something so closely we miss

74
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:01,580
everything else and are some key areas
that we constantly see this a

75
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:06,360
the IR process the incident response
process we will get focused on this we

76
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,120
were Friday

77
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,700
book it will cover pages and
documentation call list

78
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,790
here's our here's ours liaisons and
everything else the second that

79
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:20,230
thing is paged published we signed up
for head go to the CIO CSR's

80
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:24,880
as everybody see this go to the board so
they know we have one it saturday

81
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,270
weather's been to reorder some marketing
by that warning or an HR the liaison

82
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,540
that was an hr's now left so you don't
have anybody

83
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:35,580
and no one figure this out tell boobs

84
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,860
pick up the book okay call the person DD
DD

85
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:42,169
numbers been disconnected

86
00:04:42,169 --> 00:04:45,589
this is the problem that you run into
you come so focus you miss the larger

87
00:04:45,589 --> 00:04:46,330
areas

88
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:50,259
you don't figure out how to do this in a
regular air were really big about

89
00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:53,929
data center good people hey SAP

90
00:04:53,929 --> 00:04:57,169
had to the data center it's a

91
00:04:57,169 --> 00:05:00,219
we want to focus on this money and
effort and Watson's

92
00:05:00,219 --> 00:05:04,029
things and bells and whistles and lights
and blinky things and

93
00:05:04,029 --> 00:05:07,189
things that don't blink you put all this

94
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:11,249
time and effort in there and then you
realize that yeah

95
00:05:11,249 --> 00:05:14,469
we have it's a third party

96
00:05:14,469 --> 00:05:19,069
and they had it issue with the sas70
report and

97
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:22,830
yeah anybody at one point I'm could walk
in a plugin breach

98
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:27,599
our whole network and you put a lot of
money and effort in that the supposed

99
00:05:27,599 --> 00:05:30,879
and gets by you because you're trying to
look so closely at this

100
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:34,749
and that's where the value actually yes
or someone gets power

101
00:05:34,749 --> 00:05:39,110
with malcolm happens the be the
administrator for when the TV is

102
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:43,060
you end up with the data breach

103
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:46,050
we focus on a parameter Michael

104
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:50,880
nothing can get through I'm sorry our
printers today are like switch shoes

105
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,000
they would take anybody not to be able
to get through our parameters in most

106
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,640
cases were

107
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,720
that I think are safest place probably
outside

108
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,320
most organizations Internet is a safer
place than a

109
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,750
apartment inside your network and this
is one of the things you

110
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:10,880
you can see and if you're so focused and
on the target

111
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:17,520
like this you don't see the Chancellor
decides around you and you will not have

112
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,780
time to read actor

113
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:25,780
and will never ever see it coming you're
taken completely by surprise

114
00:06:26,849 --> 00:06:28,780
you do get

115
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:31,760
own by twelve-year-old and you can tell

116
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:35,740
because we like to use marketer
laser-focused

117
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:41,640
it's like no bad idea because you're
camping at that point in time if you're

118
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,130
that focused on something

119
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:47,460
you realize that you're camping you're
missing the bigger picture on that side

120
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:47,750
up

121
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:51,590
so Argo for those s

122
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:55,270
dealing with aggression and what kind of
aggression it is well your

123
00:06:55,270 --> 00:07:00,360
attracting things to attack so to focus
a progression that's their

124
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,840
on and the game it's it can be

125
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,270
useful somebody places like to use it in
security it's

126
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:11,910
really me about your attack surface and

127
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:15,240
our tax surfaces are a mess huge

128
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:19,160
we go well beyond what we were
protecting last year

129
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:23,040
it's almost like an to backs call it but
different kind of

130
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:28,140
walk Richards law pay your tax surfaces
goes by to access every year

131
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:31,140
because it literally does that's that's
what

132
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:34,700
for don't have mobile phones now you
have mobile phones

133
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:41,040
next year will be applications it keeps
growing and growing right now the

134
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,610
problem you get into it is

135
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:47,790
wearing how that attack surface is
extremely important you want to control

136
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:48,450
your

137
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:51,590
you don't wanna say hey come beat me up

138
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:55,430
and it happens complete do this all the
time

139
00:07:55,430 --> 00:08:01,150
if you don't believe it it's like hey
stick a server out

140
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:03,979
just right put in your DMZ at a DNS
record and

141
00:08:03,979 --> 00:08:07,440
upstart to stop watch people done it
before

142
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,650
it doesn't take long before a sensible
I'm attacking

143
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:15,039
weicker's no it attracted attention

144
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,340
it was something that changed in the
ripple effect

145
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:22,639
decide to get there now I like to use
the term shark in

146
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,169
the waters for this

147
00:08:26,169 --> 00:08:30,560
there's a couple things you don't piss
off people

148
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,190
the part what

149
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:37,330
you don't wanna piss off security
researchers you don't piss off somebody

150
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:38,250
that's reporting

151
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:41,930
website for ability to you you don't
wanna piss off

152
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:44,980
group for people one-term you should
never

153
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:51,980
ever ever uses a term called theoretical
time and time again people love to use

154
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:52,870
this term

155
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:56,680
people like that's a theoretical you
want to make it practical

156
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:02,390
its just a little bit of ca we get
caught up in this

157
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:05,470
so when the key areas

158
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:10,290
you have to know how the attackers look
at your network and i'm talking about.

159
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:15,390
outside no information what do you look
like

160
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:20,050
pleasure name servers pull-down what is
your DNS information

161
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:23,950
what is the registry say about you order
all these things

162
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:28,760
externally the attackers a car look at
without ever touching you

163
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:32,660
or touching you that you'd be able to
figure out they're going to take a look

164
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,080
at this information and say hey

165
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:40,540
but actually they're so you have to know
your network and you gotta make sure

166
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:42,000
there's not something in the air

167
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,360
we see it all the time all this records
there and this comes back from

168
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:51,320
doing contest and everything else it was
like hey this backup server

169
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:56,650
testified it's not bad just all this
other day and house it does both

170
00:09:56,650 --> 00:10:01,530
internal and external DNS for resolution
people

171
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:06,330
go after these things and they continue
to go it's one of the things that are

172
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:06,670
there

173
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:10,660
they take a look at the outside in all
your weaknesses

174
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:14,910
everything that you haven't done exactly
100 percent they're gonna see if

175
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:17,990
before that and so they will go on to
that

176
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:21,500
and they were attacking you see it you
see it with the vulnerabilities whether

177
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:21,970
it's

178
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:25,780
freak weather it's hardly whether it's
shell Ciroc

179
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:29,270
gay will see it they were scan you they
will come after

180
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:32,710
but actually they're so sparred gaming

181
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:36,810
there's what we refer to as grinding in
farming which are

182
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:41,030
different between the two but brian is
kinda the

183
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:45,190
to hear the extremities gotta go one
place I gotta go to another I gotta do

184
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:47,280
this I gotta do this at the level up

185
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:51,120
it's what we do had a good check the
logs

186
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,710
gotta do this it's not some other stuff
that we really liked it too

187
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:58,190
it's kinda the main game

188
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:02,920
kinda stuff that we deal with but it's
something we do on a regular minasian on

189
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,120
a mission is real good

190
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,760
now you'll see me say on a missions good
automations Eve which one is it

191
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,820
tense it's the hacker answer for that
but the CSL

192
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:16,860
pants guess what what you're trying to
do

193
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:20,570
really depends on whether automation is
the best tool suited for this

194
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:24,580
its credited over over stuff and if
you're just looking for

195
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:27,740
a binary operation animations good

196
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:31,600
if going out if the outcome is kinda be

197
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,750
different on a mission can be back as
the night goes think about Lodge

198
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:37,870
people like who I'm

199
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:44,150
you can show all a lotta logic but it's
time consuming and you may not be right

200
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:46,950
so look at things like IP lookups

201
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:51,140
back kind of animation hey go look and
find all information I can find about it

202
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:51,720
to give me

203
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:56,620
some cancel every day that is a good you
serve on a mission account management

204
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,470
which account is expired

205
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:04,470
make sure they're not exist anymore
that's good automation I

206
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:08,040
log analysis moon not so

207
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:13,170
good unless you're just looking for
details such as but there in five 22%

208
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:16,900
arm Microsoft event ID's

209
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,960
running through which is kinda bypassed
the hash

210
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:26,570
that on that people work for

211
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:29,769
but one other things you typically when

212
00:12:29,769 --> 00:12:32,959
do there's a lot of tools %um Nana

213
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:36,920
vendor basher anything else but
typically your automation is your

214
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:42,970
automation your group automation your
company's on a mission don't necessarily

215
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:46,570
want to buy it because it's kinda the
square peg in a round hole

216
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:49,600
sometimes it fits sometimes it's much
bigger

217
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,010
I do I really want to spend the money on
yes

218
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:57,010
because it does this one thing that I
need but it does 22 other different

219
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:57,480
things

220
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,519
if you don't need the other 22 it's not
a really good

221
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:06,480
set so I like to go with the idea that
building you know your network you know

222
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,740
you have a structure better than anyone
else

223
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:12,140
you know what is Brian D what is going
around

224
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:15,589
what you have to do every time if you do

225
00:13:15,589 --> 00:13:19,890
it's much easier to build been doing and

226
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:24,890
this is one that the areas that you get
into

227
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:28,980
so my next favorite topic lack flag
kills

228
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:33,560
and a discussion you can always blame it
on lack to its kinda like to thank a

229
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:37,300
in a game it's like bone om

230
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:41,120
it was lax sorry I you've got me on that
one but

231
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:46,900
lag is a gamer term for delay it's like
ok the controller lagged the network lab

232
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:47,230
and

233
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:51,320
the x-box lacked the PlayStation lag my
PC lagged

234
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,820
we do it on a regular basis and blame
for everything it's kinda like

235
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:58,080
game version I love the firewall

236
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:02,430
what's rockets the fire was well but

237
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:06,440
it's usually associated with networks

238
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,520
slowdown things like that be also have
to remember

239
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:13,060
the people lack and you can tell the
people lack

240
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:16,910
think about if you someone that cannot
make

241
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:20,490
a decision you know that person well I
don't know

242
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:25,750
what's gonna happen if you put them in a
decision are IRS response: processes as

243
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,630
you make a decision in 15 minutes

244
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:30,790
their head will explode

245
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,949
but these are some you need to know this

246
00:14:32,949 --> 00:14:36,380
because you do not want them in the
process of trying to make something this

247
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,139
there do we take the website down yes or
no

248
00:14:38,139 --> 00:14:42,300
I right or wrong

249
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:45,329
gotta pick a side

250
00:14:45,329 --> 00:14:47,389
so it is

251
00:14:47,389 --> 00:14:50,600
par decision process and people allowed
them to compare

252
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:55,730
state literally cannot make a decision
on that

253
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:59,170
now one or the other things you succumb
to lack

254
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:03,700
gamers everybody there is a lag portion
that's out there

255
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,780
you get the lead and you will get

256
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,790
killed I ten-year-old by an eight year
old

257
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:15,200
it happens but the problem is that goes
around and the processes that

258
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,990
is

259
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:20,180
Blackhawks impaction if you to let

260
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:23,620
and vulnerability reports is one my
favorite

261
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:28,290
like a slight turn those things and the
people found a bug here you go

262
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:32,959
and it pisses me off you I sent one &
Manuel

263
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:38,949
for today's haha pay what's up be nice
if you told me that you got this

264
00:15:38,949 --> 00:15:42,800
and so this is some other stuff you run
back into

265
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,589
that that just as going to infuriate
somebody in somebody's gonna go hey hey

266
00:15:46,589 --> 00:15:47,350
guess what

267
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:52,389
boom here you go fix this so Dave and
now you're dealing with a whole separate

268
00:15:52,389 --> 00:15:54,790
problem for karla serve

269
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:59,639
whose fault you pointing fingers hey
we're in passion and Timex enter

270
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:02,899
them at the point it's gone its out

271
00:16:02,899 --> 00:16:07,629
that broke down at like some bad
marriage so guess what

272
00:16:07,629 --> 00:16:11,000
its over whether ir processes

273
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,600
is key to

274
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:17,070
key to the time that's actually there
the have to be able to work with us

275
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:22,990
always know that a problem that you're
trying to solve in this process will

276
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:25,230
never

277
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:28,910
correct itself it's not like asap L

278
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:35,440
the state average but it really happened
we have no proof irv exfiltration

279
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,750
therefore it did not happen

280
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:40,810
yeah people are laughing at them

281
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:44,320
that's an all-school wave going like can
you make this disappear

282
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,930
no sold this is where the issues you get
into

283
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:53,580
so a lotta games are multi-player

284
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:57,839
the people as I call multiplayer it's
fun you're playing against people

285
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:02,100
but I don't like to play in the world
where people can attack me and I like to

286
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,410
be in the nice

287
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:08,949
rainbows and unicorns doesn't exist
unplugged the internet stay away

288
00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:12,670
multiplayer is always

289
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:16,480
player versus player but you also have
to think of it as

290
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:23,360
security is a team sport it is a team
you have a team of people

291
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,569
use them or maybe not

292
00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:31,100
if you don't have a camera people we
have a team a friends

293
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:35,519
if you don't have to your friends by
some

294
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:40,390
the call consultants

295
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:46,110
they will come they'll be your friend
but it's all when you wanna thinks

296
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:50,510
anytime you want to do something you
bring your group it's kinda like gang

297
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:51,090
warfare

298
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:55,799
bring mine my say we show up altogether

299
00:17:55,799 --> 00:18:01,190
and there's a reason for that especially
when you're doing processes

300
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:06,570
incident response correct the problems
other things the more people you have

301
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:10,809
decisions are being made now a lot of
thought and allow a lot of processing

302
00:18:10,809 --> 00:18:11,910
lifetimes

303
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:17,230
its its for lack of a better term got in
some cases knowledge in some cases

304
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:20,480
and sometimes you need the person to sit
back and go

305
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,260
I'm what about this server that

306
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:28,950
in turkey when we cut this connection
it's gonna lose and that means all our

307
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:30,040
VPN traffic

308
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,340
for the restive Asia is now gone

309
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:39,330
books docked at the circus you but
sometimes you need the person to have

310
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:39,720
some

311
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:45,169
insight that you may not have be able to
go home wait a second but it's also one

312
00:18:45,169 --> 00:18:46,700
other things as you get into it

313
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:51,140
they help make decisions

314
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:54,030
to you have this and one other things
too ass people

315
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:57,450
is when you say can you go do this yeah
you got this

316
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:02,290
sure yeah I got it done Obama it doesn't
help but wonder ground rules

317
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:06,120
long security team is like I can ask you
fifteen times if you got this

318
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,820
don't get pissed at me because

319
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:12,930
I wanna make sure because it falls on
the floor

320
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:18,190
bad things happen doesn't happen or you
say hey I can do this in 30 minutes and

321
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,530
30 minutes is now gone

322
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:22,610
you like oh it's going to cool a bit
longer new new

323
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:25,690
me 30 minutes or less so

324
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:29,080
this is one of the things that's their
and always do you need help

325
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:33,080
sometimes more security people like no
need quiet

326
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:36,250
your cocaine here here's your headphones
back

327
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:40,750
go go go go memorize just looking at him
as he types feverishly on a keyboard

328
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:44,960
hit backspace best-dressed I sup

329
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,050
it's one of the things that's their in
this multiplayer so you have the players

330
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:49,740
to bring

331
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:53,240
to the thing so power leveling

332
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:57,950
wanna my favorites because why we're
doing it

333
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:01,880
power leveling is that this is a map a
while this is

334
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:05,690
hey guess what you run around like a
chicken with my head cut off going to

335
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:07,530
fifteen different places and takes three
days

336
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:12,610
persons this way which I use a little
help from my friends and said hes go

337
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:14,790
here do this do that do this do that

338
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:20,220
much shorter much faster

339
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:23,640
so power leveling is about knowing a
strategy to get

340
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,990
batter 20 security conference is all
about

341
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:30,200
that's why we're here is

342
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,700
the power level her own characters for
lack of a better

343
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,820
ourselves

344
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:39,019
you can learn from friends you can learn
from strangers

345
00:20:39,019 --> 00:20:43,049
and I'm really did not want to put this
in there but after this morning I think

346
00:20:43,049 --> 00:20:46,489
I guess on my own guy so therefore you
can learn from all guys too

347
00:20:46,489 --> 00:20:50,739
this also works

348
00:20:50,739 --> 00:20:54,570
when you takin going to your vertical
market people like wall

349
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:58,159
okay this is what you would classify

350
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:01,320
as you need to mark this on

351
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,710
client confidential but spoke

352
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:07,749
the privileged information therefore the
lawyers can't look at

353
00:21:07,749 --> 00:21:11,299
I if you work for vertical markets
number ever tell the lawyers

354
00:21:11,299 --> 00:21:14,840
have your organization I know it's bad
but just get in the way

355
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,479
in some cases but you don't have to make
it a working

356
00:21:18,479 --> 00:21:21,789
you go for beers you go for drinks

357
00:21:21,789 --> 00:21:23,910
you got for lunch

358
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:27,970
everybody pays their own bill but
worrying from

359
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:33,850
other people and security folks have to
met working in vertical market day

360
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:39,060
we will share information they will talk
to each other they will tell you

361
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:42,080
what their problems are issues

362
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,960
hey have you seen this and that because
guess what in the vertical markets

363
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,760
targeted attacks all this other stuff is
huge

364
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:55,530
because they're going after different
portion Anderson and using your

365
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:56,610
competitors

366
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:59,840
or frenemies war

367
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:04,370
whatever you wish to call them is a
great way to share information to keep

368
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:06,750
them hey this is what we saw did you see
this

369
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:10,420
Yes No now we can see this won't be on
the lookout for it

370
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:13,620
is that a competitive advantage or
disadvantage

371
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:17,030
I don't know but I like to use the term

372
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:20,190
I don't wanna be in the lifeboat by
myself

373
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:23,730
it sucks and that is a key area

374
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:28,930
and my favor that I do for that will
probably be repaid at some point in time

375
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:32,460
because they will get hit with the next
round

376
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,550
stuff

377
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:40,460
works in the community community share
information very close net

378
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:44,940
we have group from Chicago ever own
communities

379
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:48,790
that set up a meet on regular basis
everything from

380
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:50,800
city government to

381
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:55,230
to aviation to other sides are all in
tertiary information

382
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:59,430
with out any other entities involved in
the mix

383
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:02,730
I'm not a big fan a government sharing
not that

384
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:08,510
it doesn't work the problem has that
it's a one way street most the time hey

385
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:10,340
if you share with us

386
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:15,470
yeah we'll get back to you on that you
like really

387
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:19,670
and now you're certain to see at least
in the US side that they're kinda

388
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:24,080
cursed because we're all sharing with
everybody and we're kind of like a you

389
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,410
had your chance go away we're not gonna
talk to you

390
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:29,550
but we want to protect you are we saw
that before

391
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:33,900
national sure about that so governor
sharing

392
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:37,250
if you're involved in it works great if
you're not involved in it you're not

393
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,520
missing much

394
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:42,470
for that much Saida was checked Twitter

395
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:45,520
its perfectly fine om

396
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:49,820
sharing is great I like to do whatever
refer to as a trial by fire

397
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:53,260
yeah it's great for looking things

398
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:56,750
I like to conduct honey parts collect
well when that

399
00:23:56,750 --> 00:24:01,650
sounds like you take the things out and
pay go get this clay target 10

400
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:07,810
all sorry now I'm hun parties were
looking for stuff on the network gather

401
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:09,200
much people around

402
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,350
we say hell the school fine thanks

403
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:15,520
one indicators do we have are we seeing

404
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,100
what's there let's go get it and we do

405
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:23,110
we find stuff from binaries hashes
network IP addresses here here here

406
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:28,030
and everybody works together because it
forms the synergy that works really good

407
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:32,190
people get used to hey we can go through
this it also help bring people in from

408
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:32,450
the

409
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:36,920
outside of that were and it helps them
as well because they hail hail now I

410
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,900
know who to go get

411
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:44,210
from the speaker pieces of information a
I love to invite

412
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:47,530
executives because they're like 1000

413
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:51,160
the stuff still by we got stuff going on
how is this gonna be

414
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:55,290
safe to get on the network no no no
don't get on the network I

415
00:24:55,290 --> 00:25:00,280
this is some other areas that are there
I executives are great to bring

416
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:04,940
to thats like this it's an I opening
experience for most other

417
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:07,970
I rather be any kinda love

418
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:11,950
security affect on this really a
conference is dealt with knowledge

419
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:12,660
learning

420
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,640
and stuff along those

421
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,430
major it is hugely important and
impactful for these organizations

422
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:21,950
because I I personally love from people

423
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:25,520
there was like all your SAP system in to
go look at a SEP

424
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,200
you should go see it through all these
topics for me

425
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,340
and tell me how bad it's gonna be

426
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:36,610
this is some other stuff you want to get
back to the people that have

427
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:39,690
this information MPC's

428
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:43,950
non-player characters the part of the
story without on

429
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:47,920
it would be really born born gay because
you won't talk to anybody because

430
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:52,210
gotten must other character want to talk
to you and if I was that way I'd be like

431
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:53,670
I'm attacked its character

432
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:58,840
let me alone is following me around now
non-player characters

433
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,279
yes

434
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:05,559
you have to have them but you also think
government in the IT security space

435
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:08,710
is your cloud providers your help desk

436
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:12,220
this is your supply chain these are
people

437
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:16,039
that you depend upon to make a product

438
00:26:16,039 --> 00:26:19,970
make your support actually function

439
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:24,000
so you have to sit down and think about
it

440
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,280
if you need to make a story you use them
now

441
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:33,050
don't look abuse them because they was
the stock not

442
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:37,500
talking to you but you need to use them
for what they're there for

443
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:41,690
use the supply chain to figure out hey
how things are moving

444
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:45,630
materials again allow the supply chain
folks are the ones that reach deep

445
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:47,660
inside your organization to go to data

446
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:52,840
on that site if they have malware it
reaches deep inside game system to go to

447
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:53,350
the day

448
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:56,480
and time and time again it's like a

449
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:01,620
this is on this trusted administrative
VPN access that 0

450
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:05,930
doesn't have any firewall doesn't have
anything just has IP address that

451
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:10,300
that's it and they can go to yes these
two IP addresses Richard the critical

452
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,610
servers up the company

453
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:18,670
on understand that always remember when
you're dealing with non-player

454
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:19,520
characters

455
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:26,240
who pays the bill sometimes they forget

456
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,590
and that they're like all that's not in
our contract yeah

457
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:35,429
so is Slaa so is this so is that that
we've overlooked in okay I guess we're

458
00:27:35,429 --> 00:27:35,980
going to have to

459
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:39,270
terminate this again a lot of times they

460
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:42,700
don't wanna do things because at the end
of the day

461
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:46,090
maybe you didn't strike the best deal in
the world

462
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:49,130
they thought you he told them you're
going to buy more

463
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:52,650
didn't buy more therefore the Commons
not ups

464
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:56,179
set with you but hey we're trying to
count on this

465
00:27:56,179 --> 00:27:59,990
million dollar deal and it's only a five
hundred thousand dollar deal and we're

466
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:00,720
kind of like

467
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:07,720
myth at this you sign the contract you
live with that

468
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:11,500
so dealing with new characters

469
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:18,500
NOP snoops in the games are the ones are
like our my gosh

470
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:21,950
you need to embrace it if you like what

471
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:25,050
I'm not going to embrace an 8-year-old

472
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:29,720
in the game environment security wise
embrace the people coming out of school

473
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,760
and their haha to drive me nuts

474
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:36,040
that's good the one thing they cap

475
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:39,290
passion

476
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:42,530
seen it time and time again you go here

477
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:46,050
here's a turbine a lot files can you go
through this people I can be back in two

478
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:46,510
weeks

479
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:49,870
next morning he is in your office
waiting for you here to report

480
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:55,180
me but wall stop that first you make me
look really bad

481
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:59,300
second I'm when abuse if you do that
again cuz it's like wow how did you

482
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,020
process this

483
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:03,370
you watch not in process anything I went
hand sorted through this

484
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:08,150
Rock Hall but there's a passion is the
key

485
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:11,200
they hey what toll on now anything in a

486
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,600
you get up you don't have to spoon feed
it to them

487
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,860
it's not all dogs learning new tricks

488
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:22,390
it's a puppy and you can teach it
anything you want to

489
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:24,780
and they're wanting to learn

490
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:27,430
I'm sorry for all the students in there
are just called your puppy please

491
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:27,990
forgive me

492
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:32,750
but it is true the youth in this

493
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:36,960
the noms a newbie they're just coming
into this don't have all the baggage

494
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,970
that we have

495
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:41,990
to to be quite honest that governments

496
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:45,120
regulatory and compliance issue they're
not by the time they're done with this

497
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,800
are probably never even heard of that

498
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:51,760
they're going back to hey look now where
workstations are you ball

499
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:56,720
they've got it right in a lot of cases
because they're in

500
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,410
the new area versus trying to be drawn
into the new area

501
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:03,480
teach know you mentor them

502
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,590
catch them to your employees

503
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:09,870
here set with him but a should now mover
here

504
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:13,080
they like it they know it

505
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:16,980
you have for lack of a better term you
have

506
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:21,600
backup train but at the same time at
least the knowledge doesn't happen if

507
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,090
someone gets hit by a train you're not
like hopes

508
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:28,190
nothing no one knows anything in it

509
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:32,679
worst you can use them for cannon fodder
pay go distract

510
00:30:32,679 --> 00:30:37,780
the director why we do something that
we're not supposed to do

511
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:42,940
sup

512
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:46,720
they're not just the security market we
have interns we have other things

513
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,320
go find them see come out has again the
high-tech the court

514
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:55,210
they see things that you want to be able
to see and it's really cool tool

515
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:58,230
embrace that and get them to be

516
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:02,130
deputize you can't run an organization
by yourself

517
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:05,140
it's huge its problematic at best

518
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:10,659
to try to run something so big but

519
00:31:10,659 --> 00:31:15,590
if you get deputies hey arkin standing
up another web site

520
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:19,980
through this third-party I think you
should know about it

521
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:23,299
okay I will go have a conversation with
the director Mark

522
00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:28,070
before you would never even known it was
there until hey here comes as PR

523
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:33,230
announcement you like hot we bang my
head on my desk but

524
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:37,179
this becomes your process it's there
leveraging used a

525
00:31:37,179 --> 00:31:41,039
on AI

526
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:44,519
I really think is misused its

527
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:47,940
often abused by vendors hey

528
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:51,019
we do as we term AI

529
00:31:51,019 --> 00:31:55,909
we do machine learning you're like haha
your writing parsers

530
00:31:55,909 --> 00:31:59,070
now having them machine right person is
that right parsers

531
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:05,980
that is not intelligence thats parsers

532
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:10,000
one other things that time and time
again and if you talk to anybody

533
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,140
they're really give actors person versus
machine and then there's no te hey you

534
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:14,980
can sort i cant

535
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:19,420
I can get his lap as elastic as I need
to get

536
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:23,980
I can do a lot of processing power at
the end that and maybe a fun stuff

537
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:27,880
her brother well but if you start
digging

538
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:32,580
the unknown unknown it's always gonna
win

539
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:35,530
because there's something they are not
only person that's going to actually

540
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:36,420
find it

541
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:40,290
is the person and it

542
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:44,730
you can call it a gut feeling you can
call it some knowledge locked away they

543
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:49,960
look at something in the go that's not
right

544
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,750
convene never sends

545
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:56,370
two packets after

546
00:32:56,370 --> 00:32:59,310
why is there to not four to

547
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:02,700
you can even get draw success

548
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:07,250
so what's up with that

549
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:09,059
why is that way

550
00:33:09,059 --> 00:33:13,189
to find don't big unknown I there
something wrong

551
00:33:13,189 --> 00:33:17,359
I hang on to this the right move on but
I can alter something here and sure

552
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:17,819
enough

553
00:33:17,819 --> 00:33:22,129
on the whole there's something there but
it is part of the process and his

554
00:33:22,129 --> 00:33:25,249
partner the intelligence in part the
people process that we kinda

555
00:33:25,249 --> 00:33:28,829
slight left behind and we're getting
back to this

556
00:33:28,829 --> 00:33:32,379
need people to be able to do the things
that need to be able to do

557
00:33:32,379 --> 00:33:37,149
glitches they exist

558
00:33:37,149 --> 00:33:41,469
or software errors we see now in there
in games

559
00:33:41,469 --> 00:33:45,109
pay this treasure reappears forty
million times

560
00:33:45,109 --> 00:33:49,169
I you can get killed here I can hide
behind this rock

561
00:33:49,169 --> 00:33:52,629
transparent I can shoot through whatever
it yes

562
00:33:52,629 --> 00:33:56,439
we all know these an all too well

563
00:33:56,439 --> 00:34:00,619
no on our network their own abilities

564
00:34:00,619 --> 00:34:04,899
that need patching gotta fix them we
have more up front that we have

565
00:34:04,899 --> 00:34:10,179
days in the week most part A

566
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:15,670
the problem is that if you start sitting
there thinking about it inside

567
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:18,470
if you think

568
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:22,000
we have issues on this he always had a
holler for

569
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,279
crashed this the servers bad at all
we're really in trouble

570
00:34:25,279 --> 00:34:29,490
the same thing goes for the other side
of this is well now

571
00:34:29,490 --> 00:34:34,379
are the issue with clout I like to refer
to it is kinda

572
00:34:34,379 --> 00:34:38,279
slightly less glitchy

573
00:34:38,279 --> 00:34:44,049
because now I if you take an overall
summary of it it doesn't go down for the

574
00:34:44,049 --> 00:34:44,710
most part

575
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:48,819
most the cloud providers and services
that are well orchestrated

576
00:34:48,819 --> 00:34:52,569
railed on they stay up now there are
outages

577
00:34:52,569 --> 00:34:56,950
I will be the first to admit their
outages but if you take that as a

578
00:34:56,950 --> 00:35:01,270
a look it was down shame on it it's in
the cloud that's the reason it's like

579
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:04,720
WoW is probably a bunch of other reason
but if you took that into your own

580
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,430
internal

581
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:09,490
network how many times would have been
down usually there's a pretty good size

582
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:11,089
factor that it's not

583
00:35:11,089 --> 00:35:15,349
so in some cases where you don't want
glitches and you don't want stuff hate

584
00:35:15,349 --> 00:35:17,609
the clout does make you think just
remember

585
00:35:17,609 --> 00:35:21,789
touting control it's a non-player
character give them stuff

586
00:35:21,789 --> 00:35:26,990
you hopefully they'll keep it but it's
one or the other thing that's their

587
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:30,160
now pardue games

588
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:34,109
is always the Easter acts and

589
00:35:34,109 --> 00:35:37,799
the Easter eggs are just at it's one of
the things that's

590
00:35:37,799 --> 00:35:41,000
hidden messages inside application which

591
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,940
at this point if this direction never
exist if you look at secure

592
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:48,710
a life cycle for code development it is
not

593
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:52,990
it somebody sure looked at this and said
hey we do not need to put all the name

594
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:54,549
to the developers in the pictures

595
00:35:54,549 --> 00:35:58,180
doesn't exist bad well apparently I'm

596
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:01,890
its okay and it still exists today you
see it in there

597
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:05,299
head of full version of Microsoft Flight
Simulator

598
00:36:05,299 --> 00:36:08,550
index up

599
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:12,130
that should tell you where those fifteen
million lines have chrome exist hey

600
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:14,960
there's a online game with the transfers
jumping over

601
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,290
cactus or something Mike really

602
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:21,690
okay but this is something the stuff you
into

603
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:24,820
is that there always is head and thanks
but

604
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:30,980
from a bad guys version of the strengths
may leave things behind

605
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:36,350
because they're really bad a cleaning up
themselves so they leave the tools

606
00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:39,750
why cuz they may come back army still be
there

607
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:42,820
the leader talks there River shells

608
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:46,620
nom hash numbers net sniffing

609
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:50,310
things because they don't want to use
your tools because your tools locked to

610
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:51,830
the Windows Server

611
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:55,990
shows off her is typically don't and
some cases

612
00:36:55,990 --> 00:37:00,390
in these typically do different things
so these are tools that you search for

613
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:06,320
on a regular area now you'll never find
all that use to Rex you can talk to the

614
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,950
US State Department about this

615
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:12,030
like a were shut down our mail system
were shut down the network

616
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:15,560
where turning everything off because we
can't get these people

617
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:19,030
out over network as I report to rip burn
it all down

618
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:25,029
you saw that for those that familiar
with the New York Times hacked the

619
00:37:25,029 --> 00:37:28,409
last year so they literally pulled up
dumpsters

620
00:37:28,409 --> 00:37:34,119
and through equipment and the dumpsters
took everything out because they were

621
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:37,359
told to rightfully rightfully so

622
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:41,169
and sometimes that's the best way
because you ever you have no idea what

623
00:37:41,169 --> 00:37:44,199
in fact and what's not affected and

624
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:48,039
I don't care it's very difficult to 100
these people

625
00:37:48,039 --> 00:37:51,630
and more times than their but

626
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:56,409
if you look at it and in the search for
things like IP address hashes

627
00:37:56,409 --> 00:38:01,169
I processes DNS requests files

628
00:38:01,169 --> 00:38:05,679
registry keys I don't have

629
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:08,739
those some pool functionalities inside
my

630
00:38:08,739 --> 00:38:14,110
enterprise check countries tracks at all

631
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:18,430
so I can search for you're gonna never
be able to find these tracks

632
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:22,510
they're already there they will remain
hidden

633
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:27,910
or your replacement will actually go
find them because they will

634
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:32,010
due to bad things and the network no
guarantee guarantee that

635
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:36,610
and they probably already are some cases
so if you can't look for this

636
00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:40,470
come when the basics that need to be
able to be done because they're they're

637
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:44,200
every single time now

638
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:50,120
tanking so what a tanking is is somebody
that gets lots of armor lotsa boson

639
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,330
everything else is hey I can take a hit

640
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:56,510
rule number one there are no such thing
as major tax

641
00:38:56,510 --> 00:39:01,310
I don't care when he said his there are
no major banks they were close to her

642
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:06,450
can't do anything I don't care this is
problem with that we have these common

643
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:07,820
myths the major banks

644
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:12,860
is a call compliance sorry I'm not a big
compliance person

645
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:16,840
per se I don't want think a piece a
paper really going to protect me

646
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:22,450
and a lot of cases PCI hey look we have
PCI compliance for yesterday

647
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:26,810
ok now we put everything back the way it
was I

648
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:30,700
policy and procedure look we have this
book procedures that we told everybody

649
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:34,869
and sign a piece of paper that said yes
they're gonna follow

650
00:39:34,869 --> 00:39:38,280
that's not protecting you in time you
know what people are going

651
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:42,130
I mean it's good

652
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:47,490
its requirement don't rely on also hey
I'm PCI compliant typeset

653
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:52,310
now did good

654
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:57,619
get your awesome armor get your stuff
and it's one of the things that's their

655
00:39:57,619 --> 00:40:01,480
com you increase the specs that matter

656
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:04,760
you increase the ability to say hey I
can respond to stuff

657
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:09,540
I'm not worried about preventing it I
know what's going to happen I want to be

658
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,550
able to detect and respond to that

659
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:15,819
much quicker then they have which gives
me a

660
00:40:15,819 --> 00:40:19,410
beneficial to other things you look at
our attack surface

661
00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:22,430
our tax surfaces static

662
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:26,829
we don't change why cuz if we change it

663
00:40:26,829 --> 00:40:30,950
are that would cause problems hey this
IP addresses really now over here

664
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:33,790
womb hard to do

665
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:37,920
but the problem is that detection and
response and time is

666
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:42,030
people to mobility I can change that I
can change firewalls

667
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:46,500
I can change things on the I can add
different things into environment I can

668
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,010
reroute traffic if needed

669
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:51,390
given that flexibility gives me this

670
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:56,720
specs that actually matter and I know
how to fight now one of the big things

671
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:00,020
on kinky as I look at it as I R

672
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:03,430
incident response something Bad's
happened

673
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:07,560
you're gonna have to take a hit you
don't sit back and got

674
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:11,620
I we're not going to comment on that
it's going to get worse

675
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:17,100
for my kids would you are you gonna get
mad at me if I tell you

676
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:22,549
no I'm not I'm you're grounded I'm

677
00:41:22,549 --> 00:41:25,619
it's one of the things you have to be
able to take the hit you have to be able

678
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:26,819
to deflect

679
00:41:26,819 --> 00:41:30,859
information is there period in come up
with something good

680
00:41:30,859 --> 00:41:33,910
PR firms are really good at this is
called spear

681
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:37,799
else been anything into a good thing and
you have to get to spend

682
00:41:37,799 --> 00:41:41,950
appropriately

683
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:46,020
now not all games are like there are
many different types

684
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:50,810
they're like organizations not
organizations are like what works in one

685
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:56,020
does not necessarily work in another one
always play the game that you can win

686
00:41:56,020 --> 00:42:01,880
not when go for the top

687
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:05,380
also don't play cuz you don't really
have a choice don't play okay shut the

688
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:08,080
doors was moved router this business

689
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:12,280
not gonna do that go for hi figure out
how to

690
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:15,630
get the talk

691
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:18,990
you know I cases everyone's plane for a
lot of ties

692
00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:23,440
not for any other reason cuz we don't
have the budget or the money

693
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:27,190
to say hey these threat actors that have

694
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:30,730
nation-state kind of support including
our own nation I

695
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:34,700
really can't compete that level

696
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:41,170
so what do I do i play for the time

697
00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:46,240
and again not organizations home make
the games that why choose

698
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:50,650
realize some games you lose understand
wine

699
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:55,160
go back in play here this time to play
to tie

700
00:42:55,160 --> 00:43:00,400
or maybe play to win

701
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,390
work it

702
00:43:01,390 --> 00:43:04,290
inside and understand really

703
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:08,820
the who what where how the games are
being played internal rather you want

704
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:11,170
call is politics or whether you just
want to call it

705
00:43:11,170 --> 00:43:14,920
ear to the ground in this one other
comments those brought back up is

706
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:18,870
are this is really not good because this
information

707
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:22,830
is not so we don't want to release this

708
00:43:22,830 --> 00:43:26,340
and is back to the same thing it's a lot
a

709
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:30,390
understanding that a lot of trust

710
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:33,770
and it's good to have the trust and its
easy to develop

711
00:43:33,770 --> 00:43:37,380
they see it they go you're on top a

712
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:42,170
I'm not to worry about trust me and I
are process is much easier when you run

713
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:42,670
something

714
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:49,089
and your CEO sense thanks when you send
a message hey we got something going on

715
00:43:49,089 --> 00:43:54,500
news like thank you I was like no
questions no nothing they know that pay

716
00:43:54,500 --> 00:44:00,079
under control as a huge one for that
site %uh verses now he's

717
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:03,700
contacted 15 over there other people
there are contacting you going hey what

718
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:04,640
are you doing about this year

719
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:08,040
I'm answering emails not working

720
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:11,160
so this is one of the things that's
their

721
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:14,270
final boss

722
00:44:14,270 --> 00:44:18,980
all games haven't the big thing at the
and it comes out and tries to kill you

723
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:21,079
when you spend 35 minutes trying to kill
it

724
00:44:21,079 --> 00:44:25,640
and died five or six times and
everything else problem with security

725
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:31,079
there is no final boss is never over

726
00:44:31,079 --> 00:44:35,640
it is always something going on you feel
like you're in a grocery store and it's

727
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,910
like cleanup on aisle sex cleanup in
Aisle seven

728
00:44:37,910 --> 00:44:42,250
couch I'd like to say I'm the chief
janitor officer because I'm cleaning up

729
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:44,890

732
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:54,900

om are rushing at Motorola to answer the
question there

737
00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:16,770
is no extra life when you're at a caso
level

738
00:45:16,770 --> 00:45:20,430
so you better grab all the power-ups all
the boss

739
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:24,910
all the pushin all the spells roles
anything that will help you

744
00:45:52,110 --> 00:45:53,930
I

00:45:53,930 --> 00:46:00,440
thank you here today

746
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:04,069
out I'm scared you now I'm going to take
aggressive recon I

747
00:46:04,069 --> 00:46:11,069
expected that I expected that

748
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:17,370
track

749
00:46:17,370 --> 00:46:18,710
you think

750
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:20,320
lights

751
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:23,700
part

752
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:25,620
that

753
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:29,800
okay log question I in compliance a
question cool

754
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:32,820
confidential information up I'm

755
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:36,820
you are you have a couple a different
locks

756
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:40,930
farm question there is a data retention
policy that all companies have to say we

757
00:46:40,930 --> 00:46:42,300
can keep blocks for so much

758
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:46,590
if you ever tell a lawyer you keep blogs
over that period of time

759
00:46:46,590 --> 00:46:50,390
they will head will explode or twist
around side ways and

760
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:55,660
the environment for whatever I so you
have to be careful love that side of it

761
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:59,510
on the issue with locks is

762
00:46:59,510 --> 00:47:02,620
you have a lot of times when you're
discovering something

763
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:06,590
like all someone releases a report or
anything else and I

764
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:11,540
look at the dates and this is this is
research done six and a half months ago

765
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:14,770
eight months ago in your like my large
go back ninety days this is really

766
00:47:14,770 --> 00:47:15,420
helpful

767
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:19,420
not really so this is par the issue logs

768
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:22,440
are good to have around for ever now

769
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:25,560
logs that are online

770
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:29,450
searchable it used should not be around
forever

771
00:47:29,450 --> 00:47:33,470
they should match what your data
retention policy yes so if you backup

772
00:47:33,470 --> 00:47:34,680
logs are put on an

773
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:38,320
archiver some of the other stuff you can

774
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:42,320
use the talk to your rediscovery
personal data retention person say hey

775
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:43,200
this is there

776
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:46,160
because they did data retention people
we don't want on have logs for

777
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:47,870
everything to go back for however

778
00:47:47,870 --> 00:47:53,740
but a good way is the least a year's
worth the locks because most the stuff

779
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:54,810
you see

780
00:47:54,810 --> 00:47:58,900
is dated back to the point where you not
be able to find things

781
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:01,110
and that's kinda critical I

782
00:48:01,110 --> 00:48:06,210
very critical and a lot of cases because
hey I got this IP address or this DNS

783
00:48:06,210 --> 00:48:07,980
name to go back all we can to

784
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:12,290
really is kind of a downer because
you're like

785
00:48:12,290 --> 00:48:19,290
I kid and you can't find think so that's
one of the key areas for that

786
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:27,620
yes

787
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:34,310
yeah

788
00:48:34,310 --> 00:48:38,480
is like a deorbit a good until yet and
this is this is why you have a lot of

789
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:41,450
the places that have such a hard time
clearing out

790
00:48:41,450 --> 00:48:44,730
the threat actors because they'll come
and the plant themselves

791
00:48:44,730 --> 00:48:48,250
they'll mediately once they're
supplanted Dell change

792
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:51,820
their code in migrate to something house

793
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:55,150
hopefully that you won't actually see it
so you'll see that ones that are talk

794
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:56,560
but you miss one or two

795
00:48:56,560 --> 00:49:00,530
point x1 they got him once before they
get in again it's not like they

796
00:49:00,530 --> 00:49:05,390
don't can't get in and out at kind of
really well for most this case is so

797
00:49:05,390 --> 00:49:09,140
but having the logs is hugely important
com

798
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:12,540
on that's like as you go back and in
Vail about a what's there

799
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:16,340
what's that actually outsider that and
things of

800
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:21,119
another question for lots external logs

801
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:23,359
com

802
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:26,579
going out are much more important and
what's coming and

803
00:49:26,579 --> 00:49:29,789
pertaining logs for like your e-commerce

804
00:49:29,789 --> 00:49:32,959
system environment crack tickling good

805
00:49:32,959 --> 00:49:37,159
but typically contain a lot a PIII
information which is kinda data breach

806
00:49:37,159 --> 00:49:42,079
material so you don't necessarily why
hey our web server logs which have all

807
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:44,289
this data in here retained for year

808
00:49:44,289 --> 00:49:48,119
is that makes your data did abortions
very huge

809
00:49:48,119 --> 00:49:52,249
so that is one of the things I'd rather
worry about extra-large rather tryna

810
00:49:52,249 --> 00:49:59,130
gather things that are coming into to be
not much later

811
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:06,130
other questions yes

812
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:09,010
here

813
00:50:09,010 --> 00:50:16,010
him

814
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:22,560
there is no major thank you what number
one it's back to the same thing

815
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:26,530
a you its its kinda why those think this
is OK

816
00:50:26,530 --> 00:50:32,200
practically it works but at the same
time your

817
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:35,180
guessing for what

818
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:39,550
yes what current is available in its all
about what you see not necessarily in

819
00:50:39,550 --> 00:50:40,500
the future and

820
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:44,590
and what's gonna that happen next in
this weather issues that comes at

821
00:50:44,590 --> 00:50:47,790
you don't sit down and figure out that
hey

822
00:50:47,790 --> 00:50:51,310
I don't need this I can go rapidly
recover

823
00:50:51,310 --> 00:50:55,900
my stuff for anything else you look at
things such as

824
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:59,870
I we don't we don't me all these

825
00:50:59,870 --> 00:51:03,600
sophisticated tools or lightweight will
this

826
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:07,040
blow things and and and completely
reflash if something goes

827
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:10,700
wrong am the new ways people are getting
an

828
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:14,380
USB I

829
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:17,470
I'll browsing hijacking

830
00:51:17,470 --> 00:51:20,970
other sides ovett you're only as good as
watch you

831
00:51:20,970 --> 00:51:24,720
actually developed for not what's coming
down the pipe so

832
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:28,710
at one other point sometimes it's going
to be like we've seen is that you have

833
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:29,470
the security

834
00:51:29,470 --> 00:51:33,180
heard that says hey this is really
popular and think

835
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:38,619
and we fix it but we never really fix
site goes away for a year and a half an

836
00:51:38,619 --> 00:51:42,170
ounce on appears back up again that's
the kind of stuff that will

837
00:51:42,170 --> 00:51:49,170
defeat the major take some time and time
again that

838
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:54,770
how it we've had things we've seen
things that people might find Citrix

839
00:51:54,770 --> 00:51:57,630
images and things like that like a look

840
00:51:57,630 --> 00:52:04,040
all your vendors now over my where and
perfectly great South I'm

841
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:07,050
thats that's one of the areas that's
their I hope exact answer

842
00:52:07,050 --> 00:52:10,330
enough or we talk more offline 12

843
00:52:10,330 --> 00:52:15,880
any other questions

844
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:16,430
thank you very much
