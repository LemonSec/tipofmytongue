1
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:04,819
so looking at implicit trust
relationships in your organization

2
00:00:04,819 --> 00:00:08,000
and then a couple kinda low-level
attacks that's where I play I have a

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,059
talk next week it's a scan which is
looking at have CPU level type stuff

4
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:16,190
and so looking at this more from a
management this is the management track

5
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:16,920
and

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,619
kinda taking some overview away from
that so

7
00:00:20,619 --> 00:00:24,250
whom I I work at a company called the
shirt information security

8
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:27,410
I live in Denver like the ski like to
run like to bike

9
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:30,980
arm and wanna sergei slang sec cultists

10
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:35,850
and I like to play in places that not
many people play so awsome and VM and an

11
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:38,149
unbiased level type stuff as well as a

12
00:00:38,149 --> 00:00:42,350
operating system as well and savage
group for people at Denver that

13
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:47,379
that do that with me and I will be at
the run tomorrow and I hope olive you

14
00:00:47,379 --> 00:00:48,300
are as well

15
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:55,300
yes brian excite dressing we're gonna go
through a little bit here

16
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,890
on some background so I will actually
talk about

17
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,909
a pretty low level or to a couple
low-level tax

18
00:01:04,909 --> 00:01:08,810
and so just bring everyone up to speed
at least understand the impact on my go

19
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:09,880
through some background

20
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:14,250
on a talk about army no mapping the
trusted code base at every or

21
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,140
application

22
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:18,619
and then you know who you realize you
don't realize you're trusting but

23
00:01:18,619 --> 00:01:21,970
you are so a lot of companies they have
a really nice process for

24
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:26,540
vendor management they bring in I
especially after the target hack when

25
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,020
they reach back system

26
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,590
provider got compromise and that was
kinda the entry point a lot of

27
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,200
organizations have a really great
process for vetting their vendors

28
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,130
and I evaluating them in putting some
teeth in a contract saying of we get

29
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:40,970
breach because view you're in trouble

30
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:44,890
there's a lot of vendors that you don't
realize that your

31
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:48,850
can implicitly working with I and some I
talk about a few that

32
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:52,909
and then well last one had a management
takeaway is is kind of

33
00:01:52,909 --> 00:01:57,619
selling information security to your
border to your CIO or your CEO

34
00:01:57,619 --> 00:02:01,990
and talking about have how you can track
your investment and not be

35
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:05,250
security folks are the ones always
saying now like all we built this

36
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,320
product it's gonna

37
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,959
go out to market and the security folks
a no you can't do that because your help

38
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:11,170
in this poor on firewall

39
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:14,170
we don't do that so rather than being
the naysayers

40
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:17,510
how you can vote best yourself involve
yourself in earlier in the design

41
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:18,530
process to be

42
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:23,610
kinda a value add your organization with
that

43
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:27,360
information security is is seen as a
casa doing business it's kind of like

44
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,000
the security tax you pay

45
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,520
I in our organization with a very
insular security conferences where

46
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,350
we all feel like we're doing is the most
important thing in the world

47
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:40,470
but I'd don't necessarily agree with
that

48
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:44,010
are but you know we are there to support
business schools

49
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:48,269
like the most secure organization or
that any computer that any employees

50
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:52,470
and that's not really I calvary
successful business

51
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:55,730
I'm so I've been talking with some
sisters and director IT folks

52
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:59,610
and am providing this adversarial
mindset and thinking about how stink

53
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:00,880
about security because

54
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,420
also the media's entirely skewed and
that you know

55
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:09,640
like it her own mentioned on you getting
the news about the NSA level attacks

56
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,600
which are not necessarily something that

57
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,110
you as an organization if you're
director IT security are gonna have to

58
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,040
be concerned about

59
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:20,829
I you don't see the boring attacks like
up someone had a terrible password and

60
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:22,049
then we compromised them

61
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:25,940
our hopes someone had a computer on
their desk they forgot about it wasn't

62
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:26,299
kind

63
00:03:26,299 --> 00:03:30,130
manage properly so

64
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:33,120
I like to bring an attacker's
perspective the table and the help

65
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:33,700
identify

66
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:37,870
press your business and that how you can
sell a return on investment so

67
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:40,910
I'll great keynote this morning helped

68
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:44,000
lead in this is the the blog post just
versus poker

69
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,390
and so little bit more detail on that so
research

70
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:50,640
focuses on like elegant so I thought of
this and I was a kid

71
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,450
newspapers have the chess problem say
the chess board in a certain

72
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:54,400
configuration

73
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,690
and I'll say something like five moves
to checkmate

74
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:03,290
and you gotta figure out from that kinda
arbitrary starting point how you get

75
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:07,010
to check me in a very kind of
constrained way and so that's kinda what

76
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:10,819
we focus on that so we see a black cat
we see on the project zero blog where

77
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:11,489
you have this

78
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:15,840
very cool attack you know like a one
bite overflow then transitions like

79
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,410
thirteen percent of the time

80
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:21,200
into something that you can then
compromise on a certain set up with

81
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,979
running certain versions of software

82
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:27,230
where's attackers and users barely focus
of what's happening

83
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:31,300
you know from between the keyboard and
wherever they're accessing that's kind

84
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,420
of like that's a step

85
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:36,450
a transparent layer to them they want to
be able to look at pictures and their

86
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:39,990
kids they want to be able to do whatever
they're doing shopping online

87
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:43,720
and not really have to worry about that
and so we're over here solving these

88
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,070
problems that are not relating to them
and

89
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:49,930
alive what we say what we think and what
we do is

90
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:53,130
so far ahead of where they are it you
know we're kinda

91
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:56,300
were playing a different game and
they're playing poker where the

92
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,800
adversaries have a model

93
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,930
their incentivize not by speaking at
Black

94
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:05,030
you don't see people who go and do these
attacks a and this is how i hack Sony

95
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:07,270
and then they so the sweet rock chain a
maid

96
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:11,630
because anything beyond just taking a
pastor from the password to excel

97
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:15,340
spreadsheet that was on their server is
now losing them

98
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:19,140
return on investment now investing money
in time and something that's not gonna

99
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:22,040
benefit them as long as they can get in
and make some money they're going to buy

100
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,520
the easiest way possible

101
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,620
because why we're not there not
incentivize the same way we are

102
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:33,620
so I'm rewarded for any traction and
elegant exploits

103
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:40,240
and a synthetic fabric environment and
then def

104
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,590
defenders are rewarded for deploying
solutions in new defenses

105
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:47,180
like the keynote said you may feel
really great when you play in a new box

106
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,070
in the green light shows on and now
you're

107
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:52,390
your barracuda and others slogan is
network security

108
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:57,300
period salt period me seat is especially
in DC in the metro systems were all that

109
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,790
the government folks go so they think
our ads players box in

110
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:04,820
I'm all set and in fact that's really
not solving a problem if you can make a

111
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:05,770
product they would

112
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:09,080
keep folks that you know do these
common-sense things

113
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,090
from doing them so we all think are a
great good passwords

114
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:15,870
don't email your credit cards in plain
text don't a

115
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:19,230
you know don't you click on links from
emails from random people

116
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:23,190
if you could product eyes that
commonsense knowledge to make an

117
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:26,570
a simple easy way to use that people
will no longer

118
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:30,320
click on links in emails you know
everyone he organizations I was talking

119
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:30,700
with us

120
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,550
maas last night he said that

121
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:35,460
you have a security conference in the
emailed him his credit card information

122
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,000
says this is correct

123
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,210
please verify this is credit card number
his name and address and so it was that

124
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:42,639
a security conference that

125
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,539
you know because I've the fact that
there are some support staff there that

126
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:48,500
don't realize what we all think it's
common sense and that's really the

127
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,470
problem right there you

128
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:52,830
know you could make a lot of money you
can monetize your product eyes

129
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:56,500
well we consider common sense and if you
heard speaker black cat saying

130
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:00,150
why I make my password 40 characters
rather than 29

131
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:03,560
that's not something that you're gonna
get accepted

132
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:09,419
everyone he is technology is a
practitioner information security

133
00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:12,710
so

134
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:16,970
cyber civilians one accomplish their
goal attackers are motivated by

135
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:21,389
you know number different means um you
know if you think about it and you how

136
00:07:21,389 --> 00:07:23,210
to compare it to physical space

137
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:28,020
you know in this case there is everyone
is on the same battle zone it's not like

138
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,870
the soldiers are out there and they're
fighting the war with other professional

139
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:31,569
soldiers

140
00:07:31,569 --> 00:07:34,909
and we're over here sitting around and
we're not gonna get shelled

141
00:07:34,909 --> 00:07:38,039
their everyone's in the same playing
field and everyone is on the same

142
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:40,830
battleground nationally the only
difference between

143
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:44,289
our industry and me physical space needs
space

144
00:07:44,289 --> 00:07:47,310
attackers were really motivated by well

145
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:50,789
money so I you know the easiest way to
make you money

146
00:07:50,789 --> 00:07:54,880
will provide the highest high investment
and so that's why they're not going to

147
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,090
spend a lot of time building an amazing
rock

148
00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:01,710
entire opted for a rock chain that
bypasses and 5.1 is your day

149
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:06,319
when they can just send out a check out
this sweet game dot exer dot

150
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,530
no photo .jp to EXE in most the time
they're gonna make

151
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:13,639
some profit I mean spam people when do
if they don't get a couple users to

152
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:14,750
click on enter the ring

153
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:18,009
credit card information and how anyone
could read that thing it's

154
00:08:18,009 --> 00:08:21,080
makes no sense in has random words in
there to get past am filters

155
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,750
whatever think that's a good you know
would be profitable but they still do it

156
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:28,699
I had someone talk it was at finance
company they got breached

157
00:08:28,699 --> 00:08:33,409
and but the attacker didn't even realize
they had preached a finance firm

158
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:36,919
and they work monetizing all this high
frequency trading and account

159
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:37,589
information

160
00:08:37,589 --> 00:08:41,810
they stole the UPS account and we're
just mailing stuff for free

161
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:45,310
and like selling stolen goods on Ebay
that was there

162
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:49,570
how they were going to monetize that
very quickly and then there's the really

163
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:53,260
scary ones right the revenge attack so
this is like things like Sony where

164
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:56,940
you're not in the pack you know you're
not like being chased by a bear with

165
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,350
your friends and you just gotta outrun
the slowest person

166
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:02,660
that bears like I want to get back I and

167
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:06,480
that's a really scary situation in their
goals more destruction not show hide in

168
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,230
their tracks

169
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:10,480
on and so that where you see with the
Sony attack where

170
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,700
they're out there and rather than
monetizing all this information on this

171
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:14,150
EP

172
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:17,240
IP based on age is releasing it out to
destroy and you know

173
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,779
watch the world burn and then there's
fun

174
00:09:20,779 --> 00:09:25,580
so these guys they usually aim for soft
targets and then they move on to find an

175
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:26,540
extra game in

176
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:29,790
I would not say that they're really
malicious in the sense that

177
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:32,820
they don't really want to harm people
were talking about this earlier in the

178
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,500
sense that

179
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:37,650
in our current excuse me stated dr.

180
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:41,380
is is be trivial for probably

181
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:45,120
ninety percent of people in this room to
hack into a power station from their

182
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,300
laptop right here

183
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:50,230
and cause a massive catastrophic failure
why doesn't that happen

184
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:53,810
is because now you're going from just
doing something that people think is a

185
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:58,350
fairly victimless crime where I steal
someone's credit card information they

186
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:01,510
get a thing in the mail saying that
update your password and here's our new

187
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:05,480
credit card issuers have a minor
inconvenience

188
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,300
but if you're at the point where you're
actually than causing catastrophic

189
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,710
failure gone back into the point where

190
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:14,400
you know it just like people who have no
problem pirating music

191
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,450
would not go into a store and steel that
CD

192
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:21,480
and there's kinda these different kind
of thing where you think I'm not really

193
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,620
that bad of a person I'd is run some
scripts

194
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:27,500
and also that could bring it back to us
quote from stolen saying

195
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,589
you a thousand people thousand people
dying is a statistic

196
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:35,420
but one is a tragedy if you grab some
your credit card company has 10,000 rows

197
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:39,020
you like sweet as 10,000 times four
dollars or whatever the going rate is

198
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:42,500
you're not thinking that's that one
person that I just killer I made their

199
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,640
job really hard for

200
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:47,510
they're out of a job

201
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:51,050
so technical debt a lot of people from
the development side know this but not a

202
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,760
lot of security folks keep on this

203
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:56,070
and so it's kind of tracking the gap
between

204
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:59,500
I what you have right now are your
minimum viable product

205
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,990
and the perfect world so especially in a
startup senior

206
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:06,800
a new development effort you make kinda
shortcuts like I surely do it this way

207
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,160
is to be like your maintain this is a
much cleaner design

208
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,810
but you know we gotta get up to market
first we know our competitors are coming

209
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:13,960
out the some more product

210
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:17,010
we're gonna kinda we're gonna try to
jump the gun I am wall

211
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:21,280
acknowledged and so the sexually way
that no VP's an engineering RCT ocean

212
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,950
communicate with their born same here

213
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:27,010
like this is the debt we're taking on
and these are the risk and as long as

214
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:28,950
you guys are willing to take on that
risk

215
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:32,640
and down the road you know pay that
offer may be facing consequences for

216
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,020
that

217
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:36,680
that's what it's going to take for us to
get out with the current resources

218
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:43,490
and so they can use this in monetary
terms to say

219
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:47,300
maybe give us an extra underground right
now in the development process

220
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:50,230
he'll be a lot save us a lot more time
in the long run me a lot of these

221
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:52,800
systems you see running special in the
finance industry

222
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,010
are still running on IBM mainframes
written in COBOL

223
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:59,620
and now they're facing el really
struggling trying to find people they

224
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:02,440
can program call on their paying
outrageous salaries

225
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:06,420
because they wrote their software in a
dead language or and stuff

226
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:09,540
keep going on so the cost overall above
them

227
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:13,220
having the software is far beyond what
it cost them to develop

228
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:16,560
and so with that no maintenance over
your life cycle

229
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,190
may rapidly outstrip your initial
investment and so that's kind of the

230
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:22,260
balance but if you take on No technical
that

231
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:26,020
you never gonna get it to market major
and the focus on making the personal

232
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:29,530
male the best product ever in your gonna
write in Haskell and then I'll never

233
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:34,800
actually come out to the real world

234
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,080
do you trust code base your trusted
computing base

235
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:41,100
this is the Americo did its part of your
privilege container

236
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:44,340
and so well it's a privilege you know
there's

237
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:47,970
in Minister publishers operating system
a colonel privilege hypervisor

238
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:51,250
thank the one is really that at the end
the day that matters is

239
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:55,830
who has access or what code has access
your sensitive data

240
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:59,860
there's a statistic that I can remember
off the top my head it 3 percent of an

241
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,080
organization's data

242
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,130
accounts for between like 70 and 90
percent

243
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:07,400
that person that company's publicly held
value to public company

244
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:11,020
and so that right there like that data

245
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:14,210
whoever has access to that whatever code
has access that whatever vendors have

246
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:14,990
access to that

247
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:18,020
are you should be concerned about and i
also think about humans

248
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:23,980
like as we talked about Aquino a the
lowly paid EVA that has access to all

249
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:27,660
your data or the helpdesk guy that could
really easily go in and make

250
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:31,340
you know his yearly salary three times
over by just

251
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:35,260
changing someone's password for someone
your goal is to shrink who

252
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:38,500
you know what your trusted computing
base is too small as possible

253
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,590
and then if you can measure being
trusted computing

254
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:45,050
or protect this code base and then you
hope that

255
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:48,240
you know you're not going to be able to
access that sense to data

256
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,850
unfortunately mapping this out is

257
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:57,130
extraordinarily difficult arm so you
know you Intel legacy due process so

258
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:58,640
this is you buy new Dell

259
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:02,820
your vendor organization you that adele
is a great organization there

260
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:06,230
rated a with the better beer me in
Business Bureau and what not

261
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:09,410
you push the button and now biases
loaded

262
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:13,780
into RAM and now you're trusting the
buyer Spanier then you by a slender

263
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:17,580
which is Hashim checked usually but it
to get an abortion

264
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:21,620
and then you're loading any option rom's
of devices were if I drivers on your

265
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:22,380
system's

266
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:25,710
their trust in your Jeep you vendor your
neck then do you rate vendor

267
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:29,660
and I didn't see this on the side in the
Dells Asian uniform agreement with

268
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,830
envidia and say and air Seagate

269
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:37,380
and a whichever Nick provider and then
your bias losure operating system for

270
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:41,510
desi obviously you're trusting Microsoft
relax on and then you could have a high

271
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:44,839
price is right drivers well and so they
like the new arm

272
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:49,360
when does a newer comes with their
hyper-v hypervisor pre-installed

273
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,450
and you just gotta go and tick the box
and so now you're trusting

274
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:57,589
at all levels all these vendors before
your application review gotten the login

275
00:14:57,589 --> 00:14:58,080
prompt

276
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:02,380
and you haven't gone through the vendor
vetting process for all this

277
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:07,380
now your application is running so any
libraries using the leverage your link

278
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:07,940
against

279
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:12,410
or in any these other privileged
applications drivers for every device

280
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:13,589
you install so the

281
00:15:13,589 --> 00:15:17,700
faced answer from Travis is a great
example love you emulate some random

282
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,339
device

283
00:15:18,339 --> 00:15:22,680
and some driver especially in the next
it was written by some guy who got this

284
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,010
device from China he really wanted to
make it work

285
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:28,490
he's not a software engineer you don't
work for that company just wanted to

286
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:29,240
make it work

287
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:33,399
you plug it in its gonna low that guy's
code is probably written very poorly and

288
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:33,830
so

289
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:37,790
his face dancers a father for USB
devices and is pretty

290
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:41,020
crazy how many crashes you can get to
spare randomly

291
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:46,200
emulating USB devices and then
everything running with privilege over

292
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,279
your application so your antivirus

293
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:52,709
which think HBSS is over 10 million
lines of code on there was a great

294
00:15:52,709 --> 00:15:56,310
talk benchmark on by much we showed a
graph

295
00:15:56,310 --> 00:16:00,120
love the sizeof code so you have all the
exploits

296
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:04,750
and the offense a code remain static for
the last 20 years about 20 lines of code

297
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:08,730
and then you see how big the defensive
software is so

298
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:11,750
first firewall me the hunter thousands
echoed

299
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:16,690
and now you see this exponential growth
to HBSS which is like the McAfee

300
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:20,820
Endpoint Protection at ten million lines
of coke and so

301
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:24,260
and then you have your digital your
ideal p your operating system here

302
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:27,649
hypervisor see you have all this code is
running with more privilege over your

303
00:16:27,649 --> 00:16:28,500
application

304
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,990
a bug in any these could be an entry
point or

305
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:35,399
you could just have a business that
maybe he's doing something

306
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:40,050
malicious to you but not for them so
FTDI makes USB devices

307
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:43,680
and they were really concerned about
counterfeit USB devices and so they

308
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,980
wrote software that was

309
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:49,579
signed by Microsoft as their trusted
vendor it would when you connected

310
00:16:49,579 --> 00:16:54,010
your device if it was counterfeit would
pick the device and so

311
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:57,329
that was their business goals coming
before yours

312
00:16:57,329 --> 00:16:58,130
you're just

313
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:01,290
to buy a USB stick you not sure which
factor came from China

314
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:05,069
whether they're using legitimate or
counterfeit devices which are very hard

315
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:05,589
to tell

316
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:09,600
you plug your device in your Windows
computer and now it's broken because

317
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,860
FTDI has a vested interest in not having
counterfeit devices work

318
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:16,940
but you is your organization are you is
just yourself

319
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:20,300
and I wanted that USB to work for you
can copy your presentation somewhere

320
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:25,540
and then again the I do you that these
vendors and your typical vendor

321
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:26,810
evaluation process

322
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:30,220
so we're going talk about some low-level
attack

323
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:34,270
these are very unlikely to be used for
your organization

324
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:38,730
up Bruce Schreiner talks about to movie
plot terrorist attacks

325
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:42,510
and so he has a contest every year where
you come up with a terrorist attack

326
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:44,030
which would be great in a movie

327
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:47,160
really unrealistic and so these are here

328
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:51,460
are those exactly in that their just
there to highlight the attacker could

329
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:54,270
probably always find any thirst
officially determined

330
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:57,830
if you've gone especially determined
attacker you're already failing

331
00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:01,090
and then I CBSE wanna make sure that

332
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:04,820
that doesn't happen so the first wanna
talk about

333
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:10,030
for my favorites by red balloon

334
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:14,730
called steppin' pones in 2013 they
create a PDF

335
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:18,380
include the instructions for HP printer
to update its firmware

336
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:21,980
to the a new firmware image they had
embedded

337
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:25,350
because running mates so your typical
desktop AB

338
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:28,980
all good here because schmitz
instruction it doesn't actually show up

339
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:31,540
as anything in there was no PDF fires in
action

340
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:36,700
impact here your desktop computer at all
and new email to an HR focus to Haiti I

341
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,810
really like work for you guys here's my
resume

342
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:42,310
would you mind printing it out and and
sending it around to see if people are

343
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:43,050
interested

344
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:48,090
she is a push print it updates the HP
printer which River shells back to him

345
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:51,220
and then it would give it through that
in effect every desk phone

346
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:55,860
like the Cisco no desktop phones and all
the Smart Switches as well

347
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:59,520
it would then do a network inventory of
all the device that it hacked into

348
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,630
anyone others went away but the IP
address for the Mac addressed on the

349
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:03,170
network

350
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:06,920
maybe you reset your phone to upgrade
the version it would then go through an

351
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,870
RTI attack that

352
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:11,990
so that you have to shut down everything
at once reflash all your devices which

353
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:15,260
and I'm in a how you would do that like
for some other devices

354
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:19,590
and then reset everything back up and so
Barrett there is like

355
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:23,360
the scariest thing and I've never
thought about attack vector and probably

356
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:23,890
know

357
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:27,570
normal sister should think about attack
vector but if you had someone and that

358
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:29,740
was that suspicious or that you know
determined

359
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:34,090
you're in trouble this is one from last
year

360
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:37,940
Corey calemburg as you know over

361
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:41,050
who now have their own game called out
like book or

362
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:44,160
the show that the reference
implementation above the

363
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,570
if I bias had bugs in it which is
actually really nice visit finding

364
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:52,000
buyers bugs used to be like a really
tedious process with like special you

365
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,320
know

366
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,450
disassembling but now that all open
source made by Intel

367
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:58,510
and they showed that most people who
make

368
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:01,690
if I just copy and paste that reference
implementation change logo

369
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:05,750
so the same bug they found a reference
imitation that was never supposed to be

370
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:09,180
actually deploy they found in like
multiple if I buy

371
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:13,090
benders and then they can escalate from

372
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:17,050
user application with admin privileges
to system and remote which is more

373
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,350
privilege and a hypervisor

374
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:24,030
and so that was a on pretty s Carey
attacking sense that

375
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:27,380
rather than just doing a privilege
escalation from like you know and

376
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,140
Minister access to colonel access

377
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:33,410
they went all the way above everything
so I was a

378
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:36,540
scary attack some I work from

379
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:39,750
last year sure that you could use the
x86 hardware

380
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:43,510
to hide malware from of racism
protections an antivirus

381
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:48,040
so there's a shadow Walker rootkit on it
basically uses how the hardware is laid

382
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:48,480
out

383
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,640
for power efficiency in for Speed
purposes

384
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:56,510
that logically axes one unit but is
physically two separate components

385
00:20:56,510 --> 00:21:00,090
on and you can activate that to bypass

386
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:04,900
patch card or antivirus because it has a
different view of memory depending on if

387
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,130
you're executing at that address purses

388
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:12,020
I reading at that address so what does
it provides a split you have memory data

389
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,840
purses coats an antivirus thats

390
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:18,429
scanning address is getting your kernel
space will see everything as benign but

391
00:21:18,429 --> 00:21:25,429
if he actually jumped to that read no
code you're gonna go somewhere else

392
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:28,080
writes a little bit more background on
another attack

393
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:33,029
are so paging in virtual memory is a
protective feature a promise so

394
00:21:33,029 --> 00:21:36,490
the first coat injury first code that
can kind of start your computer you're

395
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:37,870
offering to surrender by us

396
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:41,499
can it gets control and then this kinda
feature

397
00:21:41,499 --> 00:21:45,100
virtual memory helps pretend to protect
your operating system from applications

398
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,070
and major breakout

399
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:50,309
before this came out like back in the
DOS days misbehaving application could

400
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,960
overwrite your kernel with no

401
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:55,940
problems unless you can access the page
tables you're locked out

402
00:21:55,940 --> 00:22:01,299
and services have an attack as well on
the goal was is how would you

403
00:22:01,299 --> 00:22:05,840
map in arbitrary physical memory and so
it's kinda this chick in the a problem

404
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,399
where

405
00:22:06,399 --> 00:22:10,970
I you wanna be able that modify the page
tables to map in the page tables in your

406
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:11,740
process

407
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:15,619
and you don't know how to do them as
your next page table so it's kinda like

408
00:22:15,619 --> 00:22:15,940
a

409
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:19,440
catch 22 or chicken before the egg
problem on

410
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,899
and so the use case you have some kernel
shell Cody found a up

411
00:22:22,899 --> 00:22:26,710
no buffer overflow attack against the
kernel you want to be able to

412
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:30,450
have get that's actually be able to
contact everything that might not be

413
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:32,220
mapped into that driver space

414
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:36,480
live memory forensics Setra you have
access but you're confined to an

415
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,850
operating system controlled

416
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:42,669
mappings on she can access the device
you can access the network card directly

417
00:22:42,669 --> 00:22:45,929
I to be able to say actual trade data
you're doing a

418
00:22:45,929 --> 00:22:49,700
memory stripping attack and we wanted to
do an OS independent way

419
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:54,909
so arm you know where that

420
00:22:54,909 --> 00:22:58,470
tables are in physical memory because
%uh the cr3 register stores that

421
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:02,649
that's the physical memory address not
the virtual dress and so you can't map

422
00:23:02,649 --> 00:23:03,639
those tables and

423
00:23:03,639 --> 00:23:06,850
without having the page tables already
mapped in which sound repetitive because

424
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:07,369
it is

425
00:23:07,369 --> 00:23:10,369
are so OS is usually have a hard coded
value

426
00:23:10,369 --> 00:23:13,999
so in Windows it's like seeing all zeros

427
00:23:13,999 --> 00:23:17,009
on and Linux just hasn't earned any map
so

428
00:23:17,009 --> 00:23:20,369
virtual dressing the same as physical
addresses but

429
00:23:20,369 --> 00:23:23,850
or specific attacks are are pretty lame
so we're gonna look at the architecture

430
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:27,220
on and see also don't know where your
car is executing the you can text

431
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:29,299
vegetables

432
00:23:29,299 --> 00:23:32,789
so to be able to to do this attack to be
able to

433
00:23:32,789 --> 00:23:37,380
on did the second show you you need to
control 32 bits a memory and known

434
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,549
physical location

435
00:23:38,549 --> 00:23:42,580
and that's the crux once you have thirty
two guests have access and non physical

436
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:43,490
location

437
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:47,360
you can then separate cursive mapping
back to the physical page tables

438
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,620
and then go through and modify one and
then switch everything back

439
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:55,130
are conveniently every device with PCI
Express

440
00:23:55,130 --> 00:24:00,070
has this its national architectural
feature in PCI Express called he can be

441
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:02,250
enhanced configuration access mechanism

442
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:05,590
so people have done driver development
tell you so

443
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:10,309
the CF eight CFC is probably a pretty
common set of poorly or dresses you're

444
00:24:10,309 --> 00:24:11,110
familiar with

445
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:14,890
that's how you configure device is a
this memoranda what you work on

446
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:18,630
turn off turn on this is power control
and so

447
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:22,880
PCI Express has much more configuration
information as he's a basic got much

448
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,440
more powerful and poorly I was
extraordinarily slow

449
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,500
so you too fast to access it

450
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,610
Sony cam shadows device configuration
space

451
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:34,720
into your physical memory that's on the
chipset so

452
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,590
now you can just access using memory
mapped a leisure access memory

453
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:42,580
and all the structures in tables are
there and the base address is stored in

454
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,530
your PC I

455
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:47,110
a in a registered you can read from Port
Vale so what we did

456
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:51,429
was are constructed a page rectory entry
that maps

457
00:24:51,429 --> 00:24:56,230
in the current OS page tables arms are
you see our three value and set that up

458
00:24:56,230 --> 00:25:00,780
we utilise pour les 02 inserted onto the
PCI device and then we trick

459
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:04,030
the CPU into thinking that it is
actually accessing

460
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:07,520
the page tables from memory when in fact
that you're talking to a device which

461
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:11,299
should never happen the CPU should never
be reading

462
00:25:11,299 --> 00:25:14,440
you know centric configuration
information offer the device

463
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:18,169
on and then you can determine the
physical location from that

464
00:25:18,169 --> 00:25:22,440
address and then you're all set so the
real question is Is

465
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:26,370
where do you get the 32-bit memory
because if you're just overwrite

466
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:27,870
something I'm PCI space

467
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:31,039
you might pressure system you might
destroy device or at least

468
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:35,320
have a crash and this is the best part

469
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:39,830
I was like where can i put this and so I
was reading through the entire manuals

470
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:42,899
as I'm want to do

471
00:25:42,899 --> 00:25:46,039
for a Canadian and

472
00:25:46,039 --> 00:25:49,429
shit you not they have a register called
scratchpad data

473
00:25:49,429 --> 00:25:54,210
and the description is this is for
random software you should has no impact

474
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:55,240
on the system

475
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:58,289
just to store things on USB to buy and
they have multiple these

476
00:25:58,289 --> 00:26:02,049
all over their devices on their memory
controller hub on their

477
00:26:02,049 --> 00:26:06,440
disc devices and see if 32 bits a
storage right on the memory controller

478
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,210
hub and so

479
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:11,880
device 0 function 0 and then he'll go to
math

480
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:16,940
changers here 3.2 PCI configuration
space

481
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:20,890
he scanned the real page directory for
MT entry you create a recursive 1 back

482
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:22,610
that you know what the address will be

483
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:27,419
and then in like 20 lines and assembly
as a lot like we are cashing Sophia to

484
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:28,030
do but

485
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:32,149
will skip all that on so then

486
00:26:32,149 --> 00:26:36,030
you know what what is this right so this
online caveats

487
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:40,289
need is PCI registers and requires rings
here on global pages

488
00:26:40,289 --> 00:26:45,080
a I was gonna present this and then I
heard back from Rodriguez who said well

489
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,880
you need ring 0 says not all that
exciting so cable

490
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:51,970
on just find a way to do it for me three
so has kinda I

491
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:55,620
what I did I'm so you can actually do it
from

492
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:58,929
bring three during 0 by using the hard
drive to DMA

493
00:26:58,929 --> 00:27:02,480
you can actually access physical memory
miss you have an i/o mm you

494
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,399
so the design flaws here you feature
creep rate so

495
00:27:06,399 --> 00:27:10,070
you have some kind of previous
architectural guarantee

496
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:13,140
you say this is you know kinda what this

497
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:18,470
product provides and then you have all
this is a new feature that I really need

498
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:22,250
and they provide more performance but it
violates our previous assumptions

499
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:25,340
this happen before

500
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:29,899
so the SMM cashing bug virtual machine
side channels except row where

501
00:27:29,899 --> 00:27:33,320
they come out with a new feature that
puts a new management bullet point on

502
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,059
their product

503
00:27:34,059 --> 00:27:38,230
we'd only fit one really liked 16 USA
secure once on a product she

504
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:42,000
but you can put other features on
there's many times as you want and so he

505
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,190
create new features

506
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:47,180
and you're gonna sell more product
rather than just saying security form

507
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:50,190
times really okay cool

508
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:56,710
so attackers are lazy

509
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:59,710
much like most of us in a sense that

510
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:02,840
their incentivize if they're out for
money

511
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:06,080
they want to do it it was investing a
little mad times possibles

512
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,330
there was a great talk by address right

513
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:12,600
yeah and a

514
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:18,050
he talked about attack that you know
from a technical black cap perspective

515
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:21,670
was or just a JavaScript bug but

516
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:24,970
from an attacker perspective that's
gonna make you tons money you can be

517
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:27,850
rich and living on your yacht you don't
care for people black I think

518
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:33,030
is your living Andrea so there on a ser
lazy there's incentivize by doing the

519
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:34,980
least amount to work for the largest
amount a pale

520
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:38,780
just like us if I get a job that pay me
ten million dollars an hour I would take

521
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:39,170
it

522
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:43,130
and just work for a few hours on and so

523
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:46,700
its how it's a lot easier to attack a
legacy service running under some

524
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:47,450
employees

525
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:51,530
thing that they set up by themselves
under outside your organizational

526
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:52,400
control

527
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,840
than a fully passion fire old server and
your you knock

528
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:59,510
so you know you have that

529
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:03,060
lockheed trademarked cyber kill chain

530
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:06,510
and you aim for a soft target first and
then you have it

531
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:09,720
and you for performing on the network
new pit latterly

532
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:14,000
miss may happen multiple times you can't
get closer and closer to whatever your

533
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,660
goal is

534
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:17,800
love organizations focus on your
perimeter defense

535
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:22,080
and so they can I have this this hard
exterior with the soft Hwy

536
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,780
I'm feeling and what they don't realize
is that vendors are already in there

537
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:30,700
and so a lot of time is much easier to
how a compromise and each fax solution

538
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,380
provider

539
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:35,910
and compromise all the people that they
provide ACT and that was I think they're

540
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:39,170
attack vector for target was the h-back
provider

541
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:43,290
had to have a direct line into their
system and it wasn't properly isolated

542
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:46,980
and so they were actually hacked by a
the AC the AC

543
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:51,570
and heater guy

544
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:54,280
and then once the imprimatur them
breaching I'm panicking over

545
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:57,320
because you know

546
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:01,480
basically your network is party your
trusted code base a lot of organizations

547
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,720
if you're on the network you can access
shared files you can access things and

548
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,080
so

549
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:09,020
just being on that network is kind of
authentication itself which

550
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:12,520
is not really what you want you want
actually you know have authentication

551
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,630
over all the devices are connecting to
your data

552
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:17,970
but instead you're just saying anything
i plug into this network

553
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:21,890
is automatically a indicated and so we
do user authentication perhaps

554
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:25,790
unnecessarily machine authentication so
that's where this whole market further

555
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:30,360
the pony plug express came from his if I
can break into someone's a

556
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:33,400
no office and drop this tiny little
device in there

557
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:36,590
now if indicate and i cant connect to it
over 3G or 4G

558
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:41,120
so you can I have your internet you have
your firewall you set up

559
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:45,000
and then you insider network if services
applications using machines they're all

560
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,380
kinda

561
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:50,230
trusted and say you see that and
Internet Explorer internet settings they

562
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:52,440
have the trust down to screen is happy

563
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:57,210
and basically all run ActiveX anything
from the network because thats

564
00:30:57,210 --> 00:31:02,100
that's fine your trusted zone: on

565
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:05,130
what if you could shift to the point
where

566
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:08,690
user machines are just as untrusted is
your home machine

567
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:12,990
so you see this when people move to the
cloud so Google laps for government

568
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:14,130
Google App Store

569
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:17,510
corporations if I'm logging into Gmail
for work

570
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:21,580
arm you know gmail trust my computer
just as much as the Trust's

571
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:25,320
another or at Pier and so are they have
two factor authentication you can really

572
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,320
consolidate

573
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:30,230
here date into one place which is going
to be a harder target more

574
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:34,310
a exciting target for sure but you can
then focus

575
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:38,360
on up protecting that rather than
protecting our entire organization

576
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:42,230
and so that's where you can get some
cost savings its

577
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:46,310
so obvious is the least privilege
principal you just applying it to your

578
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:48,520
network design and not just user
accounts

579
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:52,600
you're gonna shrink the trusted code
base by d privileging like someone's

580
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:55,180
random Bondi by its running on their
network

581
00:31:55,180 --> 00:32:00,230
corporate machine um and then you're
shrinking you know to only include

582
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:03,440
these few applications and actually host
at three percent your data

583
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:07,650
and then you know if I'm doing OS Anton
your its copier

584
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:11,140
your environment and I'm trying to arm

585
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:15,800
you'll figure out how I can break in if
I compromise your organization's office

586
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,830
network by

587
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:20,290
going out there and dropping USB keys on
your computer and and your

588
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:23,570
parking lot that's doing a lot less for
me

589
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:29,710
on I'm

590
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:32,870
and then last trust unknown entities as
well

591
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:36,970
lot of trust questions as cloud
providers and whatnot but

592
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:40,470
its hand without delay for it now

593
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:45,150
so the million dollar question

594
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:48,660
how you communicate the security can be
a value-add

595
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:52,910
or at least not just another cost I

596
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:57,560
so what you need an organization
standpoint you need a common language

597
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,960
will speak with folks as the keynote
said

598
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:03,430
you know you can only go to the board
and say hey is hardly attack

599
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:07,140
know it's a memory disclosure buggy and
this was going to happen there can

600
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:08,550
assist kinda say okay

601
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:11,840
whatever are you need to have some
language everyone can speak so that they

602
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,880
can bring in their

603
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,900
you know great wisdom from risk analysis

604
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:20,120
and then be able to kind of apply that
to this other two main

605
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:24,940
you want to have a really good holistic
view of threats

606
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:28,510
and who your adversary is are you being
directly targeted because

607
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:33,580
your company that people hate I'm sure
Monsanto has a different adversary then

608
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:37,040
mom-and-pop sure store that was hit by
picture frames

609
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:41,510
on and then he's some kinda metric to
track your progress

610
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:45,380
and then any return on investment and
then knowing when security

611
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:48,700
can should take a back seat you know the
the second stage in the back

612
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:52,300
you know have just be there behind the
business goals hand

613
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:57,230
say enough is enough

614
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:59,090
so you know

615
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:03,010
you I implement this less is more you
can stymie operations in or minimize

616
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:04,250
costs in the long run

617
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:09,409
why so this is a great have thing that
came from the keynote this morning is

618
00:34:09,409 --> 00:34:12,620
we know the 60 if security is pretty
poor but

619
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:16,990
who is that actually harming and I would
say you guys the most because

620
00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:21,190
as he showed today if you get breached
the company is in care like

621
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:24,510
was it wanna companies had like a two
hundred percent stock increase after

622
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:26,010
they got breach that was lucky

623
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:30,250
um so they're fine the customers they're
gonna grab a little bit name I have to

624
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:32,110
you know to nyquil charges your

625
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:35,899
change their credit card or have to call
their credit monitoring service on a

626
00:34:35,899 --> 00:34:36,679
while so

627
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:40,090
they're gonna grumble but you know
they're not gonna leave and then you're

628
00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:43,129
you're on in the dot-com looking for new
job but now you can say you have

629
00:34:43,129 --> 00:34:44,830
experience and send response

630
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:48,350
so

631
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:53,450
this is a very like selfish goal is why
you want to really think about

632
00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:56,639
I mean I'd be curious to do a
cost-benefit analysis of

633
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:00,050
an organization gets breached and that
hires mandiant to come and tell them it

634
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:02,770
was China and like how they cannot get
hacked again

635
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:06,600
versus just firing assist us they can
say they did and you nothing different

636
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:10,339
because it's not really showing that
much of a difference in their stock

637
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,790
price or their market share

638
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:16,470
and Spain man yet money at all it's just
like that's a casa there have to be

639
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:23,470
to to pare so to protect your
organization

640
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:27,900
who are you trying to fend against low
hanging fruit attacker so this

641
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:30,930
everyone should be out in this category
if you're getting

642
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:35,020
you know hit because you have one at the
top 25 passwords on your firewall remote

643
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:35,630
login

644
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:39,220
you deserve to be attacked like that's
that's terrible and so

645
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:42,290
as an automated attacker that's a script
kiddie

646
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:45,450
thats you know just someone who's
playing around like what is this tool

647
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:45,920
deal

648
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:50,820
on are you being compromised by everyday
thieves who are looking for profit and

649
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:53,620
don't really care where it's coming from
just like that example I gave the

650
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:55,080
financial from the gap reach

651
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:58,980
they would be happy with any company
with the UPS number and

652
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:02,990
every company has an EPS number release
in the US so they only care about your

653
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:04,140
company in particular

654
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:07,470
or are you looking at this you know
advanced

655
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:10,599
persist in targeted trade I would say
advanced targeted for and persistent

656
00:36:10,599 --> 00:36:10,960
threat

657
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,550
is looking at your company specifically
this might be corporate espionage

658
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:17,700
or it might just be someone with a
grudge over ex-employee

659
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:21,630
era someone with some political
aspirations

660
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:25,290
now be on their invested in exploitation

661
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:30,130
so this is not threaten Telligent sir
pen testing may have different goals

662
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:33,710
for intelligence goal is to make money
for the threat intelligence company

663
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:38,250
and pen testing is to fine sums answer
that the pen testing company

664
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:42,640
now they they want to find something and
I want to give you that reports their

665
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,770
goals in like be paid to write a report

666
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:49,390
whereas they're not necessarily lines up
with what all adversaries are looking

667
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:49,869
for

668
00:36:49,869 --> 00:36:52,490
and so they have slightly different
goals you want I think about your

669
00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:55,480
adversary in pen testing as part of that
you want to make sure that

670
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:59,630
know no one with an automated script can
compromise you but at the same time you

671
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:03,240
also want to think about what kind of
person will be running the script

672
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:08,270
in the real world and so are you one of
many or how deep their do stand out and

673
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:10,340
so that's like a really big one in the
sense that

674
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:14,080
if you're just another mom-and-pop
picture frame company

675
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:17,680
you know if I wanna really cotton
compromise a picture frame company

676
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:21,109
and you're really secure in someone
else's real estate here

677
00:37:21,109 --> 00:37:24,580
doesn't matter to me but if you are an
evil picture frame company

678
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:27,920
I'm gonna go for you I'm really no a
real you stand out

679
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:32,530
and then you know what motivates them
and how to shift their behavior so

680
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:36,650
if they're motivated by money how do you
just say at Aston cost to business

681
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:38,780
letting them have my UPS account that's
fine

682
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:41,940
as long as they don't break into you
know my account information

683
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:46,220
your organization is not monolithic this
is

684
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:51,640
segmentation so no having the same
security posture a premier bass

685
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,430
protection

686
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:55,869
for your entire organization when some
people are doing a shipping receiving

687
00:37:55,869 --> 00:37:57,230
and some people are doing

688
00:37:57,230 --> 00:38:01,670
and development R&D thats a waste my
right there and so

689
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:05,690
when I'm trying to advocate is like let
the people who have very little impact

690
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:06,740
get hacked

691
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:09,750
and just consider that your cost to
business forget cyber liability

692
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:10,550
insurance

693
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:14,740
very easy these days and then focus on
really like those crown jewels

694
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:18,839
at three percent your data and then you
are looking to research your competitors

695
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:19,599
to

696
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:24,880
air so is he running from a non-targeted
bear you one hour and the other guy

697
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,019
not the Bears long as you're above the
low hanging fruit threshold

698
00:38:28,019 --> 00:38:31,220
and also this is from a business
perspective

699
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:34,160
if you know that your competitors are
way worse than you in the honors come

700
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:37,119
knocking chase check out those guys
they're really awful and then let them

701
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:40,259
deal with the auditors are the
compliance and regulatory folks for

702
00:38:40,259 --> 00:38:43,509
years while you get up speed and
everything you know all

703
00:38:43,509 --> 00:38:50,509
set done you

704
00:38:51,489 --> 00:38:55,359
you really okay you can sell something
you cannot measure I should send that to

705
00:38:55,359 --> 00:38:57,579
you shouldn't sell something you cannot
measure or

706
00:38:57,579 --> 00:39:02,239
ethically on so they have to be
understandable that everyone is reading

707
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:03,029
them like a

708
00:39:03,029 --> 00:39:06,640
if I give you how many what KP eyes i
think is the term the user

709
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,970
how many patches you've set out in
deployed across your network

710
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:13,619
that's fantastic but was understand what
that actually means now that's going to

711
00:39:13,619 --> 00:39:14,309
impact me

712
00:39:14,309 --> 00:39:18,349
it's a pretty useless metric so I'm
kinda using

713
00:39:18,349 --> 00:39:22,759
this and it's not my creation but
information security debt is perfect for

714
00:39:22,759 --> 00:39:23,140
that

715
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:26,499
to use a similar model to translate you
technical details

716
00:39:26,499 --> 00:39:30,729
into a fiscal or risk model that you can
align your business goals

717
00:39:30,729 --> 00:39:33,769
and so you're there's for the business
schools and so this is kinda

718
00:39:33,769 --> 00:39:36,769
how we're gonna go about this is a

719
00:39:36,769 --> 00:39:39,769
little bit more difficult to quantify
but

720
00:39:39,769 --> 00:39:44,450
so is technical debt exactly cell you
know your devices are risks

721
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:49,469
remembering all those implicit vendors
you trust devices also have maintenance

722
00:39:49,469 --> 00:39:53,519
cost patching IT support lott monitoring
log data the people who are going to

723
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:57,589
look through Splunk are set up in your
your sock you'll see an image for your

724
00:39:57,589 --> 00:39:58,130
data

725
00:39:58,130 --> 00:40:02,150
because date is a liability on your
balance sheet if its breach

726
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:08,839
and i retyped at this so predict that
your costs and figure out

727
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:12,400
when a product day or with this approach
to security

728
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:16,400
be better over the long run even if it
costs a little bit more now

729
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,999
and then that's something that you
communicate two-year

730
00:40:19,999 --> 00:40:23,779
you know your organizational
stakeholders I and so you want to find a

731
00:40:23,779 --> 00:40:25,160
balance between security

732
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:28,690
usability slash support the business
goals because we have no information

733
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:30,109
security date you have

734
00:40:30,109 --> 00:40:34,809
no computers no people

735
00:40:34,809 --> 00:40:36,630
how much debt is too much too little

736
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:39,839
well you never want to invest more than
your data is worth minutes

737
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:43,650
that's just foolish but some people they
try to go for the 100 percent secure

738
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:47,979
which is really most cases not ever
worth it and

739
00:40:47,979 --> 00:40:51,880
you know would you rather save some more
and for SecDef or technical debt

740
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:55,609
to trade offer more business growth can
we be a little bit more aggressive and

741
00:40:55,609 --> 00:40:57,160
put more stuff out to market

742
00:40:57,160 --> 00:41:00,759
and offer a faster service if we cut
down on this but we're going to accept

743
00:41:00,759 --> 00:41:02,809
that we make it breached a little bit
quicker

744
00:41:02,809 --> 00:41:06,380
thats some decision is make and so

745
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:09,430
technical data grows at a fairly normal
rate so

746
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:12,829
people quit new software comes out or

747
00:41:12,829 --> 00:41:16,569
language is slowly dying become less
popular it's harder and harder to find a

748
00:41:16,569 --> 00:41:17,779
COBOL developer but

749
00:41:17,779 --> 00:41:22,009
nothing really fundamentally changes
that makes your technical decisions you

750
00:41:22,009 --> 00:41:23,029
made five years ago

751
00:41:23,029 --> 00:41:26,959
really change so information security
date you can think up like a variable

752
00:41:26,959 --> 00:41:27,789
rate mortgage

753
00:41:27,789 --> 00:41:32,249
so you might be fine one day and then
someone comes out with a zero-day that's

754
00:41:32,249 --> 00:41:33,519
already in an exploit kit

755
00:41:33,519 --> 00:41:38,109
or is already in a scanner now that's
being automated put out there that so if

756
00:41:38,109 --> 00:41:39,979
you are sauce is hardly came out

757
00:41:39,979 --> 00:41:43,009
Rob Graham was there standing within
like 20 minutes

758
00:41:43,009 --> 00:41:47,549
and I saw his access on my access log
and try and her shell shock rather

759
00:41:47,549 --> 00:41:51,989
and so that's something where using up
SSL was okay

760
00:41:51,989 --> 00:41:55,729
well we thought it was OK and Nelson is
really not OK

761
00:41:55,729 --> 00:41:58,859
and so that's kind of like we get this
variable rate spikes

762
00:41:58,859 --> 00:42:02,489
arm and then you know you have

763
00:42:02,489 --> 00:42:05,949
legacy Apple plight applications
appliances which also impact that if you

764
00:42:05,949 --> 00:42:07,779
can't get your log data into some

765
00:42:07,779 --> 00:42:11,900
Sameer some you know spunk based tool
and that's going to be a lot harder in a

766
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:13,009
lot more manual

767
00:42:13,009 --> 00:42:17,059
freed actually you know use that
information and inventors really quickly

768
00:42:17,059 --> 00:42:19,349
start patching like look at Android
phones I mean

769
00:42:19,349 --> 00:42:22,719
my phone was there s5 an already like I
don't get

770
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:25,799
fix something I'm still vulnerable to
the freak attack

771
00:42:25,799 --> 00:42:29,190
like and that was a fun it came out like
a year ago so

772
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:32,989
you know that's another benefit you know
another no risk you have is that your

773
00:42:32,989 --> 00:42:34,319
vendors going to stop

774
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:37,989
had the got through twice actually had
the MeeGo phone from Nakia

775
00:42:37,989 --> 00:42:42,839
and I bought it just they said oh yeah
we're sold to Microsoft now in russia

776
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:44,359
and the product on a sporting

777
00:42:44,359 --> 00:42:49,749
so I got no updates for that and stress
etc

778
00:42:49,749 --> 00:42:54,049
so

779
00:42:54,049 --> 00:42:58,700
now from these low-level tax a
sufficiently interment attacker who is

780
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:00,559
looking at you specifically

781
00:43:00,559 --> 00:43:04,160
or a nation-state capability if you're
the government up

782
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:08,009
they'll be able to find a way internet
work even if that means paying someone

783
00:43:08,009 --> 00:43:10,539
to get a job at your company and the
helpdesk

784
00:43:10,539 --> 00:43:14,119
and then you say I'll pay you double
what you make to do this mean that's

785
00:43:14,119 --> 00:43:18,299
not necessarily a model that you're
gonna be able to by a tool for Barracuda

786
00:43:18,299 --> 00:43:19,339
since Elvis

787
00:43:19,339 --> 00:43:24,049
you know somebody's attacks um and so
you do need a model your risk

788
00:43:24,049 --> 00:43:27,599
your adversary and then protect
accordingly and then focus

789
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:31,869
on what actually matters and what let
yourself get breach now like everything

790
00:43:31,869 --> 00:43:33,180
we do in life is

791
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:36,579
have no probabilistic like there's a

792
00:43:36,579 --> 00:43:40,670
non-zero chance that I fly to Singapore
next week you know get hit by a

793
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:43,430
Ukrainian or Russian missile and I will
die

794
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:47,789
that's not you know a certainty but I'm
so gonna get on that plane

795
00:43:47,789 --> 00:43:51,369
because I'm gonna drive enjoyment not
from the flight itself but

796
00:43:51,369 --> 00:43:55,769
from from the trip and so we need to
realize that being a hundred percent

797
00:43:55,769 --> 00:43:56,869
secure is

798
00:43:56,869 --> 00:44:00,220
now some really want nor do something
that we should ever really get to

799
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:05,019
just like you know for some learn about
probabilistic algorithms I was very

800
00:44:05,019 --> 00:44:07,480
frightened as a way this is math that
might not be right

801
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:11,339
how's that how is that working my my
life you and I realize while driving to

802
00:44:11,339 --> 00:44:13,789
class today was also probably Stickley
about i'd

803
00:44:13,789 --> 00:44:16,789
or you know something in a way in your
risk so

804
00:44:16,789 --> 00:44:21,989
there's a a YouTube video by the Lonely
Island the people who do I'm on a boat

805
00:44:21,989 --> 00:44:26,369
and it's called Yolo you ought to look
out and it's all about living your life

806
00:44:26,369 --> 00:44:27,539
with no risks

807
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:30,839
like over cooking your turkey to kill
someone lol and

808
00:44:30,839 --> 00:44:35,079
and so that's kind of like one way they
have the way we're trying to look at

809
00:44:35,079 --> 00:44:36,829
security issue a lookout

810
00:44:36,829 --> 00:44:41,029
rather than this is our life and our as
long as the business is thriving which

811
00:44:41,029 --> 00:44:45,039
we haven't really seen any examples have
it really taking an organization

812
00:44:45,039 --> 00:44:49,369
no let's let's live a little now

813
00:44:49,369 --> 00:44:52,509
in information security can provide a
return on investment the sense that

814
00:44:52,509 --> 00:44:54,739
you're my saving cost if you move your
security

815
00:44:54,739 --> 00:44:56,440
into the design phase

816
00:44:56,440 --> 00:45:00,130
like it develops approach it's going to
cost a lot less for security to be

817
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:04,170
have built-in rather than bolted on and
then measuring and tracking this

818
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:05,460
information security debt

819
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:09,079
least likely to show metric if you're
getting worse you're getting better

820
00:45:09,079 --> 00:45:12,940
and then you know you can kind of
compare vendors objectively

821
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:16,710
so with that open for questions about
pretty much anything

822
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:23,050
so thank you its

823
00:45:23,050 --> 00:45:28,210
up

824
00:45:28,210 --> 00:45:31,260
interesting

825
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:34,640
from happy

826
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:38,400
question up

827
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:42,099
all overshot okay I don't like her

828
00:45:42,099 --> 00:45:45,900
are the way

829
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:52,900
value question yeah haha

830
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:08,410
here

831
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:20,670
all

832
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:24,300
this is more a process that too on so
you can do this for Excel

833
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:27,310
or you could do it probably with a GRC
tool as well but

834
00:46:27,310 --> 00:46:30,960
I it's more about how you look
holistically to support your

835
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,730
organization rather than a specific to
all the years

836
00:46:33,730 --> 00:46:40,730
said

837
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:50,020
good

838
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:59,460
day

839
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:01,960
and so that's what I'm trying to
advocate for is putting

840
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:05,680
have boiling down the technical details
in this something that

841
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:09,069
and former board member or CIO could
then

842
00:47:09,069 --> 00:47:12,730
act upon and so they have a lot of
experience in their

843
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:17,420
like task to guide the business
inappropriate way using kinda risk-based

844
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:21,190
an assessment but they don't understand
the technology so this is basically just

845
00:47:21,190 --> 00:47:21,960
away

846
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:25,460
to kind of translate and hope that those
people who have an overview the entire

847
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:28,319
company there's a lotta risk our
information security risk

848
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:32,849
there's physical security there's the
power going out of here and I

849
00:47:32,849 --> 00:47:36,190
you know I'm different country or what
not and so there's a lotta wrist they

850
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:38,069
need to balance and they're the only
ones that

851
00:47:38,069 --> 00:47:41,890
have that oversight and so weird kinda
we tend to

852
00:47:41,890 --> 00:47:45,260
over you know say the sky is falling
with computer security

853
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:49,220
a lot of times you know that might not
be hatched a piece of the pie

854
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:52,760
when you look at it from overview and so
this is a way to kind of communicate

855
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:54,359
that up to the board members

856
00:47:54,359 --> 00:47:58,060
who are the ones are really have that
over source should really have that

857
00:47:58,060 --> 00:48:01,130
oversight across the entire business
because information security

858
00:48:01,130 --> 00:48:04,130
might not really be worth it I mean
we've shown that you know

859
00:48:04,130 --> 00:48:07,790
you get hacked in New double your stock
value the year two

860
00:48:07,790 --> 00:48:11,619
and so if that's what it really means
they might say all right we'll just pay

861
00:48:11,619 --> 00:48:12,760
a little bit for

862
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:16,470
cyber liability insurance if we install
fire I

863
00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:20,510
it'll save us twenty percent on that fee
and soldiers do that and then we're good

864
00:48:20,510 --> 00:48:24,829
and then they're done so that's kinda
you know that the decision is make the

865
00:48:24,829 --> 00:48:26,040
need to be informed of

866
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:29,040
what the risks are in a way that's not
necessarily like

867
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:33,220
a a a specific technical information
like

868
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:37,450
this product persons that product more
about the risks and rewards at this park

869
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:38,060
purses

870
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:43,170
for that one all right here we go

871
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:50,170
group

872
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:58,760
I think

873
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:01,670
the company's they're doing this right
perhaps

874
00:49:01,670 --> 00:49:06,250
are the worst examples of security so
organizations I find it

875
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:09,590
have very highly paid staff are very
specialized staff

876
00:49:09,590 --> 00:49:14,350
I say look at hospitals or law firms

877
00:49:14,350 --> 00:49:18,050
it's a bit we have very poor information
security because

878
00:49:18,050 --> 00:49:22,620
their doctors are paid so much that it's
very difficult for

879
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:26,650
someone them say you're going to use two
factor authentication your enough PR

880
00:49:26,650 --> 00:49:30,940
your patient is crashing need to order
drugs from the automated system

881
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:35,160
makeup artist okinawa's had a batteries
in the guys danube lot on your fingers

882
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:36,340
and when you gonna do so

883
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:39,660
they pushed back and so a lot of times
you see that were like oh we're going to

884
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:42,830
use this new application for iPhone our
new security program

885
00:49:42,830 --> 00:49:46,690
the doctor say know are always going to
cost me an extra ten thousand dollars a

886
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:47,250
week

887
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:50,760
to pay these people actually learn this
new thing and to use it and so they

888
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:52,850
actually a really good model in the
sense that

889
00:49:52,850 --> 00:49:56,630
and they're driven by their business and
so you see that a lot more words of

890
00:49:56,630 --> 00:49:58,610
sacrifice user experience

891
00:49:58,610 --> 00:50:03,230
like almost very very little when
they're you know very highly paid staff

892
00:50:03,230 --> 00:50:03,620
it's

893
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:07,090
not in the information security
perspective I don't think people use

894
00:50:07,090 --> 00:50:11,290
organizations are used is really
expensive tools and threat modeling and

895
00:50:11,290 --> 00:50:11,980
all that stuff

896
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:15,820
if it's going to impact their users when
their users are make where and when

897
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:16,160
they're

898
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:19,450
users are paying five hundred dollars an
hour trip figure out how this thing

899
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:20,010
works

900
00:50:20,010 --> 00:50:24,460
ball

901
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:29,810
be hid

902
00:50:29,810 --> 00:50:34,170
he's group

903
00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:38,910
his stop

904
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:42,760
and did

905
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:48,170
his words on

906
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:51,210
you want

907
00:50:51,210 --> 00:50:55,310
security me what choice me

908
00:50:55,310 --> 00:50:58,860
your choice I'll want

909
00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:02,190
lawyers when you all me

910
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:05,970
yes me all and

911
00:51:05,970 --> 00:51:10,960
word you up

912
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:15,880
and now was from the keynote again how
everyone switched to OSX

913
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:19,630
which I think even today still has WAY
worse security and then they compare but

914
00:51:19,630 --> 00:51:22,780
Windows version likely some point to own
it seems like our sex is always the

915
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:23,560
first one to go

916
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:27,630
like in bed just last release water
64-bit operating systems they have the

917
00:51:27,630 --> 00:51:28,140
full

918
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:32,530
SLR with and that's because a user
experience

919
00:51:32,530 --> 00:51:36,240
and with that something that we kinda we
need to be able to communicate with

920
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,090
people who do user experience

921
00:51:38,090 --> 00:51:42,630
and be able to kinda translate now the
technical goal so again you know that's

922
00:51:42,630 --> 00:51:46,220
that's exactly right where user
experience and usability is one of the

923
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:47,110
biggest problems

924
00:51:47,110 --> 00:51:50,360
not necessarily the really technical in
the weeds

925
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:56,880
technical challenges

926
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:01,989
and from all and and now they're
investing in security rate and so if you

927
00:52:01,989 --> 00:52:04,880
read their IOUs security guidelines for
their phones

928
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:09,609
its came out last february believe its
really really well let let you know

929
00:52:09,609 --> 00:52:13,549
laid out and very well thought out and
salsa public to other organizations can

930
00:52:13,549 --> 00:52:14,579
build on top of that

931
00:52:14,579 --> 00:52:18,430
but they focused on the usability to get
people to want to buy it first

932
00:52:18,430 --> 00:52:22,220
and then they kinda augmented the
security and so

933
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:25,619
that kind of coming back to factory if
you can get your staff to want to use

934
00:52:25,619 --> 00:52:26,299
that your

935
00:52:26,299 --> 00:52:29,339
your lawyers say I like to give me a
corporate black parents not going to use

936
00:52:29,339 --> 00:52:29,670
it

937
00:52:29,670 --> 00:52:33,470
this okay with you if you want because
we want you to be able to check your

938
00:52:33,470 --> 00:52:35,309
email respond to clients wherever you
are

939
00:52:35,309 --> 00:52:39,210
thank God like a

940
00:52:39,210 --> 00:52:43,539
feel on like

941
00:52:43,539 --> 00:52:44,039
okay
