1
00:00:00,269 --> 00:00:05,040
so very homework come to look Arcata
Tony and modal

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,349
genteel we r we're already making some
kind of jokes

3
00:00:08,349 --> 00:00:11,920
also last name add credit card if the
nickname because

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,339
I think the meaning of the last name is
like a being kind

5
00:00:15,339 --> 00:00:21,430
yeah tomorrow can't the gathered for
tomorrow kind I am

6
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:24,980
they will a give a talk politics

7
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:27,980
a by the ability and the Flex SDK
compiler

8
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:31,580
I am that boss as far as I just wrote

9
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:34,770
already a known in the past and

10
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:38,160
race up again now so

11
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,250
you're on stage to stop I

12
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:45,700
thanks I like a marijuana looks like a
private setting size for her

13
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:49,110
I mean just ask question and drop as if
you're a fan of

14
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:52,260
have montel Noah be more I

15
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,670
were very happy to be here I we were
looking for a conference

16
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:58,930
but when we you know were close though
the

17
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:03,609
you know releasing the details and then
I we wean so NAS history for troopers

18
00:01:03,609 --> 00:01:05,250
however happy day we manage

19
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:09,049
there was a lot of disclosure involved
in nine days research though

20
00:01:09,049 --> 00:01:12,340
was complicated to put all the pieces
together ever

21
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:15,350
really what we're happy to be here and
have a thing was

22
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:18,560
when was properly in and made I

23
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,000
so my name is Luca I need the security
team assessment team

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,549
idling Dean I at base in Mountain View
Calif

25
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:31,850
and that today here communities mauro
argentina has an obligation to consult a

26
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:36,520
I wouldn't mind that security I anytime
consulting com paying for his own band s

27
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,590
and security I am

28
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:42,680
despite the names you know the first
letter are the names Luca

29
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,829
and so the Al and I am we're not the
region Mario I am

30
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:51,210
what else I am I

31
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:54,450
of course I usual disclaimer I

32
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:58,100
I you know our company data and/or
stills hurts

33
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:01,450
%uh miss our on find a view

34
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:04,780
and yeah I'm goes I

35
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:08,479
so Creek agenda for today so weak I

36
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,790
corporate be no introduction on same
origin policy if you own web security

37
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:16,799
is probably always to you but otherwise
it's you know it's make sure that we are

38
00:02:16,799 --> 00:02:17,840
on the same page

39
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,670
and then a be no details around a
vulnerability analysis

40
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:25,400
um I their patch that the

41
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,909
a dub it really is and you know the
reversing around there and then

42
00:02:28,909 --> 00:02:33,390
probably the most interesting Pira I
would perform an internal I scan

43
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:37,560
for partisan ability um as you will see

44
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:43,150
I am E it was complicated and we we
discover festival are meaty then

45
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:47,040
later on it was patch reported by an
army was someone else

46
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,760
and so are we gonna see I'm all all this
course is

47
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:55,409
so I started I think it's it's natural
that every time

48
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:58,939
someone present a security conference
diesel West in a starting point

49
00:02:58,939 --> 00:03:02,609
and four oz was something like that I
you know 10 Haas

50
00:03:02,609 --> 00:03:07,040
and I want disclose who is cool %uh send
a message that they are saying well I be

51
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,319
sitting on a bar from mom

52
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:13,109
I'll I do something about that right and
the outer my reply well I've know about

53
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:15,299
you know prior life I have no life so

54
00:03:15,299 --> 00:03:20,069
what white onto you know when we start
using a bug and and and play around

55
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:23,540
and how we start playing and then you
know

56
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:27,109
one for some you know was fasting and
not a thing was working

57
00:03:27,109 --> 00:03:31,569
because he was using you know some test
case there were any patch buy adobe

58
00:03:31,569 --> 00:03:35,560
the other one was not and sell where
basically chopping all the time saying

59
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,690
get drunk you are

60
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:40,889
get them or yes it works aside may I was
is was by computing

61
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:46,180
I you know mind-blowing I'm in there is
something that I i cum on you

62
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:49,909
had to go cho et today and and and and
kinda my suggestion is

63
00:03:49,909 --> 00:03:53,709
on whenever you're working on something
and you get an idea

64
00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:57,669
just 90 da like taking a lot you know
not bad are at

65
00:03:57,669 --> 00:04:01,169
text file on your high systemic Google
Docs whatever

66
00:04:01,169 --> 00:04:04,319
II file you know very spying

67
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,859
I'm to basically no da but when I have
an idea

68
00:04:07,859 --> 00:04:12,199
and then obviously we all be easy but I
have time to investigate this anyway so

69
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:14,950
you can get back in we actually a

70
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:18,859
you know started to sing to a few mom
probably years ago and then

71
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:22,830
can we left everything and then a.m.
started again

72
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:27,440
recently so um that that's that's our
kid

73
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,520
answer quick introduction I am

74
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:35,310
so Adobe Flex air which is now a hatch
back so i dominated the

75
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:39,290
can't I could best tune to the Apache
foundation in 2011

76
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:42,729
it's an Open Source SDK for building as
we file

77
00:04:42,729 --> 00:04:46,780
cell you're probably familiar with he
knows we file you can be is going to be

78
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,150
less we file in two ways

79
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:51,690
can use pure ActionScript that's their
traditional way

80
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:55,940
at some point and I'll be realized that
at they needed to be and

81
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:59,419
account better frame or anything a
framework where you could basically

82
00:04:59,419 --> 00:05:00,590
specify

83
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:03,880
up magician through I XML

84
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,900
obeys files and an actual skinny for the
actual code

85
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:12,280
and so when you combine a sphinx and you
build using their Flex compiler

86
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:17,350
I you miss can obtain air file that can
be played by the same Adobe Flash Player

87
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:22,780
um so not out not all as the BS filed a
you would find on the internet

88
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:27,320
are flexibly cation iron by Moss
keynesian when they are

89
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:31,539
actual applications are not not just BDO
or you know and missions

90
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:38,539
most likely its gonna be a flex file I

91
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:43,090
yeah so I any interest in things which
is basically where where we started

92
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:44,750
looking and the other at this bank is
the

93
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:49,040
at some point at all be decided there it
would be interesting to have a

94
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:53,660
dynamic localization right so if you
have an application for defriend

95
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:58,420
languages a you know it would be
convenient to have a mechanized to have

96
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:02,760
as you can see on the ride a placeholder
for spicy crashed train for example in

97
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,690
this case for a label

98
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:07,060
and then have on day on day left side

99
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:11,120
I you know different property files the
biggest specify

100
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,050
and and named a new pair I'm so that you
can have basically different an

101
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:18,250
organization resources depending on the
language

102
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:22,510
I'm and so

103
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:26,130
to be a localization into flexibly
cation they are basically two ways

104
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:29,590
one is compile everything in as one only
defile

105
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:33,180
see we have a huge file all resources
every means they're

106
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:38,040
or on for obvious reason you to make
sure that you you know you can have as

107
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,780
smaller

108
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:42,580
files I you can extend application
without recompiling

109
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:46,160
everything from scratch they decided to
enable also

110
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,560
a dynamic localization so at there is a
specific component

111
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,200
that is that basically when you compile
s we file

112
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:58,540
they as the kid a compiler have wrapped
around your file a brief

113
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:02,010
I am some components and what it does is
it a source module

114
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:05,320
she's basically the yelled into décor

115
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:08,320
cormack in his to load a a prime-time

116
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:13,540
the composition resources I'm

117
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:18,330
the way you use at a data source mod
your ass for flash far so I can up on me

118
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:19,250
I wish a

119
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:23,450
flash a YouTube is gonna if you want to
pass arguments to flash file

120
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:28,530
use flashvars a so you basically have if
I'm eating too

121
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:32,050
for example an object I and then you
pass a value

122
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:35,100
and so if you pass a value chorus a
small you what else

123
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:38,660
you would be basically able to pass I am

124
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:39,310
as

125
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:42,310
and dynamic localization so in this case
we're passing

126
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:45,860
a you know English we file the factors
and the localization

127
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:49,500
and there's a small dose are is an
uncommon to break the lease of your

128
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:49,940
house

129
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:53,350
or resources and you probably know
already where we are going here

130
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:56,450
I

131
00:07:56,450 --> 00:08:00,690
quick quick slide on ass same origin
policy for the lobby

132
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:04,540
its slightly different than a
traditional salvaging polishing browsers

133
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:07,690
so a is example Robins AF

134
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:12,110
I i'm I have air as we filed on a
specific domain let's say he don't calm

135
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:16,700
a busy a dot com as we file can access
everything on a knock-on

136
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:20,720
on there is a the possibility to cross a
region interaction

137
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,180
and the way you do that is basically on
the second remaining to specify crosna

138
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,200
an XML file

139
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,880
Misskelley allowing on other file file
to you

140
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:33,790
accident or Sunday domain so oppression
will slow a

141
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:37,870
can access our stop on be dot com on the
phony

142
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:42,930
a you know you specify a they do Asian
demand in across the main file

143
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:48,290
om and one is pretty in pink is that

144
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:51,800
s on I you know i i flash file can

145
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,720
can send it should be any questions
allowed to send it should be request to

146
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,980
a sports guy website

147
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,440
on you physically get you know and

148
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,760
before the fall a the phone deal right
now you can send it should be depressed

149
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,170
the browser will have to give ya stay

150
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:09,200
cookies you would get back response a
cell

151
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,530
you're basically you know in control of
all

152
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:15,690
you know and try and tiring of
confession retrieve

153
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:22,010
I'm and if you're sharing web security
you probably remember a diff levels in a

154
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:22,610
flash

155
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:27,090
where basically videos to abuse and
Jason a mare p.m. point

156
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:30,540
to you some to be skinny reflect as we
file

157
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:34,180
in the in this case was an autonomic as
we file that would deal

158
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:38,930
I basic any a DNA checking so would
would send the requested a web site

159
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:42,030
and then retrieved and private data I am

160
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:45,410
USC a we will be basically using the
same

161
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:48,540
affect my cousin and his way in a sense
that up

162
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,730
you know we'll be sending request and
then

163
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:53,890
rushing responses that offers any
content data

164
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:57,820
on up into getting user on I guess

165
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:01,370
I did it's it's a it's very well-known
rob is the day if you will

166
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:05,120
if you upload their flash file a in on
your domain

167
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,690
on and it's not separated out whole from
your primary domain

168
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:11,760
and you know those are user supplies we
file

169
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,850
people can trigger cross escaped Inc %uh
you know that's not a surprise

170
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:19,480
and so people up Don you know use the
front counter measure

171
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,960
a sandbox the mains you know that's what
for example Google Docs

172
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:26,840
away user supply content goes to
completely from demands on

173
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:31,970
are forcing the you know download
through company's position and now

174
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:32,480
they're

175
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,780
other techniques I you'll need to take
care about

176
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:41,220
polyglot and parking lots I means filed
that I like a combination with a 5-4

177
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,460
from you know would be far

178
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:47,100
by be there I us you know where you had
to give I animated gif and that whatever

179
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,310
and and a jar file

180
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:54,300
on cell there has been a lot of research
on Sol polyglot filed for a sweet um

181
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:58,880
is just like a yeah genetic overview so
up

182
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,440
I we know that their web page can ask
blacks

183
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:07,560
ops 2 node resource more jobs there's a
small joke it can be a URL

184
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:13,040
so I mean it's you know it's easy into
managing that did you know what if

185
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,040
I try to load as we find from a
completely from the rain

186
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:19,270
cell that's what we did a back back to

187
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:23,720
I don't even remember you know how many
month ago I and the

188
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,940
or years ago probably and a.m. works

189
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:30,640
and so are you no big surprise was like
wow business seems like a very bad

190
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,510
things that happen

191
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:36,140
and then um yeah we need a we didn't
investigate for about that time

192
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:41,130
and at some point on when we started
studying in israel army t

193
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:44,320
we discover that out of the past eight
so I

194
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,930
we basically a find out today at all
bitterness the page

195
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:52,900
at patching to November 30 from

196
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:57,130
wage medically describe a very smart
thanks in this case was marked as across

197
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:59,330
it like universal across a skin thing
basically

198
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:02,800
I and we're going to details um

199
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:07,450
I know I i'm well when discovering our
media at that stage we didn't really

200
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:08,780
understand what was going on

201
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:14,250
I am and sell someone you know disclose
these things before before 12 so

202
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:17,630
I am props to whoever discover many and
LB

203
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:22,180
security team I am but I i find you know
we're very cute because

204
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:25,270
imagine you're doing a secure their
search I for sure you don't have time

205
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:26,270
gotta stop

206
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:30,160
I you understand there's something wrong
but you don't know exactly what's going

207
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:30,830
on

208
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:34,550
and then up some biases secure the visor
so the first thing to know is

209
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:37,670
you know getting today details and
trying to understand what's going on

210
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:40,830
I so we start against INR

211
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:44,180
the revitalize their sarge and so on

212
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:48,050
you know the example is you take as a
source mod URL

213
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:51,060
you specify and ask them how much we
file

214
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:56,440
and that DNA is your you ask the meeting
you know you lead the meeting low then

215
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,550
urged him out page

216
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:01,420
loath to source more George as a flash
car ion

217
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:06,180
and then as well as she disobeys gain

218
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,300
red mmm

219
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:12,230
leads to air is gonna same region policy
bypass I

220
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:16,160
so there are different expeditions an
area that we analyzed I am

221
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,370
a.m. day most interesting one

222
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:23,500
considering the current browser
implementation and Flash Player

223
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,970
again is that is there a bug and that's
the case so

224
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:30,339
and you know my work over disaster aid
is very interesting

225
00:13:30,339 --> 00:13:34,770
aspect and tell it with the latest
browser and latest Flash plugin

226
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:37,950
the most interesting moment he well I at
Aki's

227
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:42,310
the same region request forgery where
you basically can stash to be quest and

228
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:43,690
read entirely to content

229
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:47,500
up and I think that we investigate it
was about you I

230
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:51,589
addressing so what if you with a SoC
modern you control

231
00:13:51,589 --> 00:13:55,820
stinks right what if I'll you can create
fishing props

232
00:13:55,820 --> 00:14:00,200
or somehow trade you know misleading
warning by basically just changing tax

233
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:05,339
spacing and other things right as so
that there's also something that we we

234
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:07,279
we played a round bead and then

235
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:11,570
I December December December ability in
order freshen of Flash Player

236
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:14,899
was basically a universal across
escaping I

237
00:14:14,899 --> 00:14:18,130
because he was possible to pass the time
to from there

238
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:23,070
from the URL arm so 01 Sep back so if
you

239
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:26,690
if you load F clash file data from the
URL of the browser

240
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:30,020
the browser would basically
automatically create an HTML page

241
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:33,250
to buy their plate right where it's
basically loading an object

242
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:38,310
as we file and so on if everything is
campaign as a as you know has quite a

243
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:39,240
string by me there

244
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:44,140
basically gonna get I averaging five
belonging to that specific domain which

245
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:47,570
again that's the reason why leads to
across a scripting

246
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:50,790
on

247
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:53,940
in current version of of plaques

248
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:58,300
you cannot I Lord I saw small jewel from
the crash think

249
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:01,970
and so that's that's what breaks the
universe ask us a skating

250
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:05,560
and trust formed these things into
morass same origin

251
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:09,060
I you know request forgery counts thanks
I

252
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:12,959
we actually dunno if it's such a cute in
mouse Pandora Box I

253
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:16,720
again when we start investigating we we
analyze that on

254
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,089
on recent version that was the deal we
found on their

255
00:15:20,089 --> 00:15:24,680
out a center for our heart Dhabi a some
people complaining about you know the

256
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,350
bill stop and was not working

257
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:29,939
and they officially apply was the
child's we file

258
00:15:29,939 --> 00:15:33,850
I they are loath a long time sometimes
fail and it's a known bug

259
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:37,189
and it's not gonna be fixed I am at

260
00:15:37,189 --> 00:15:40,889
and sell dissolution has been skinny at

261
00:15:40,889 --> 00:15:44,860
specify other source mod US House within
an object so

262
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:49,930
in inside HTML um which again eight
minutes into the impact on the community

263
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:53,389
we have found a situation where
application are using custom bra purse

264
00:15:53,389 --> 00:15:57,029
and so you still gotta universe across
skating but thats something then and the

265
00:15:57,029 --> 00:15:58,540
opportunity really need to

266
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:03,029
a spend time on its own on

267
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:07,420
so I have hauled his attack on you know
same engine across 4G works

268
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:10,769
on the day is yet you let you know

269
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:14,269
you know that the victim I browse the
web site and then you basically

270
00:16:14,269 --> 00:16:17,519
force the user to load your arbitrator
source

271
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,470
and then these are source I which
inherits their

272
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:24,829
security domain of up there the target

273
00:16:24,829 --> 00:16:28,610
on fan then it should be crushed we have
cookies and everything

274
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:32,240
guess the data and potentially send back
did it out when the attacker

275
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,790
I'm would have been more details when we
have

276
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:39,189
is at how you're browsing the web
watching

277
00:16:39,189 --> 00:16:43,399
cap you know BDO or you know unique arts
whatever you like

278
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:48,089
and then you go to iron ghetto and
affordable side login

279
00:16:48,089 --> 00:16:51,449
and you're getting your stop at some
point you go to attack our site

280
00:16:51,449 --> 00:16:55,439
um man browsing the web it's been going
going through

281
00:16:55,439 --> 00:16:59,519
third party sites though 'em no big deal
here

282
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,579
I Bay a fireside well send you back an
HTML page

283
00:17:03,579 --> 00:17:06,730
which basically contains an object tag
that includes

284
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:10,730
the region of flash file that is on
hosted on: deplorable side

285
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:14,579
and their sophomore year which is Austin
on the attacker site so

286
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:19,260
I step 3: include available as we fight
is because the flash filing

287
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:22,510
get sparse then played by the browser I

288
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:25,160
data and start loading and then

289
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:28,340
because it's using this as macho it was
fats their

290
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:31,710
I and we try to fetch data source model
from day

291
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:35,540
doctor side but first things is
obviously checkin across the main

292
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:41,300
can the 10 most side flash file retrieve
resources from the talk aside side

293
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:46,350
I am a and so we r we are managing have
him here right

294
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:49,830
minutes it's asking for across the main
on get back your site so

295
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:53,270
I am we have basically specifying

296
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:57,190
you know at why card every domain is
allowed across the main tool not a

297
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:57,940
problem here

298
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:02,230
on add a flash fire gets downloaded a
Los

299
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:05,870
an accident but at this point I mean
it's a arbitrage oscar-winning

300
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:09,930
catskills getting inside a browser us so
we can fetch private data from the one

301
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:11,160
about side and on them

302
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,890
being for today at Tucker I

303
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:19,220
be more detail about the called I that
provoke on today we made

304
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:22,280
and that's a simple consider we disclose
to all website

305
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:28,130
on so on the pub to see the landing page
so this is a page and you would with

306
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:32,470
these it as a victim ride and cell are
the bottom just an object tag

307
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:36,330
where you'll see it again prime either a
flash flood per meter

308
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:39,930
would evaluate a source module that is
all set on ebook com

309
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:43,710
which is you know our conditions going
for fund attacker

310
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:47,220
and then %uh if you notice that is there

311
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:51,880
another URL I'm either call from me it's
a mess that thing so I may be

312
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,120
complicated but it basically nothing up
on meter

313
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,150
which is an argument of our lunches we
file

314
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:00,210
against enemy and why why we need that
on

315
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:03,700
I on the top of failed the test the HTML

316
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:07,310
you also have a tax area I we fare class
city

317
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:10,740
axe I as he was in a second is simply

318
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:14,930
at way for us to display the content on
the page again as approval content

319
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:18,810
you could replace that part way if and
other jobs can that sense

320
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:22,020
and information to a third party website
or whatever you want to do

321
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:25,110
I the bottom yet across the XML

322
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:27,539
I was the I access for I

323
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:34,539
on all sites and so do the genetic
payloads thought we build their

324
00:19:34,929 --> 00:19:38,809
a flash file packs filed there was
basically

325
00:19:38,809 --> 00:19:43,509
a.m. doing the actual logic opted get
talk you know what what you wanna do is

326
00:19:43,509 --> 00:19:43,769
a

327
00:19:43,769 --> 00:19:49,440
and as an attacker so on up there the
first heard the first thing that we

328
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,289
ion highlight it's been going to get
into your apartment or from

329
00:19:54,289 --> 00:19:57,389
from that it's possible to flash viable
and ADAS

330
00:19:57,389 --> 00:20:02,259
we wanna have an automatic way of saying
fetch the specific URL

331
00:20:02,259 --> 00:20:05,659
farmed a victim domain from there you
know target domain

332
00:20:05,659 --> 00:20:09,249
on so that we could reuse dispense water
what I'm and

333
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:12,629
and on the bottom which is probably most
urging part is I

334
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:16,570
after a you know be up this ashen skin
fetches the URL

335
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:19,799
again we cookin everything gets back the

336
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:24,489
response we want that said the content
that we retrieved from the target side

337
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:28,119
to back today attacks a.m. area that we
have so

338
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:33,259
well we're doing simply replacing well
adding a better two day element

339
00:20:33,259 --> 00:20:36,489
Wi Fi Deacs angered on am

340
00:20:36,489 --> 00:20:39,919
again at that point you could
potentially send to other third-party

341
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,309
you know you probably do something
different if you really want to explain

342
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:43,869
his fangs

343
00:20:43,869 --> 00:20:47,389
um term so we go we got done a damn I'll

344
00:20:47,389 --> 00:20:51,909
maybe before before we start with the
demo on is the following the clear a

345
00:20:51,909 --> 00:20:54,499
high level like if there's any question
now I think it's

346
00:20:54,499 --> 00:20:57,519
it's better to be sort out everything so
that after we can proceed with the day

347
00:20:57,519 --> 00:20:58,619
most in an hour thanks

348
00:20:58,619 --> 00:21:03,519
so far so good I okay

349
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:07,629
sonya so before proceeding we wanna show
you a brief them all

350
00:21:07,629 --> 00:21:12,090
in which actually we are trying to all
its a exploit

351
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:15,599
a CB 2010 461 testing amount

352
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:19,239
so actually up as a skill to have

353
00:21:19,239 --> 00:21:22,359
are ISA web application host on

354
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:26,169
Ely on example dot com which makes
carrey allows users to lobbying

355
00:21:26,169 --> 00:21:30,970
ans

356
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:33,550
yeah so miscommunication

357
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:37,050
allows users to lissy you are self
lights a

358
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:40,820
the commute flies in the car so
surprised

359
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:44,750
I obviously to concede a first name and
last name their mobile number

360
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:47,850
and they cancel change updating on
password

361
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:51,540
so actually as a concedes his hi
flexible occasion

362
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:55,370
a and it is I it iz

363
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:59,240
developed in a way that as a conceit is
possible to change deal

364
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:03,380
language so it makes so I by noting

365
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:07,740
up to Rs as model I at runtime so the
point here is that

366
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:11,580
is there any chance for a back at all
the same steel some prodding from

367
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:15,350
nation by exploiting the fund at the
supplication this for executions

368
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:18,820
wanna battle scene he 2011 2461 and

369
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:22,640
so let us assume that's I hasta meeting
to be easy to

370
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,550
before compass before concept webpage
hostile haven't gone

371
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:31,530
than as you can see medically I have a
doc on

372
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:34,770
is able to ask yourself how information
about you so it's just the first name

373
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:35,170
this

374
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:38,640
the second inning its mobile number and
the Antichrist a bespoke any

375
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,210
which is used for I changing his
password

376
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:45,530
so just to be clear I actually had
seized the

377
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:48,900
I HTML peach shows are

378
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:52,700
all the park works so the first thinks
that example up

379
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,980
the I mean to call makes I I'll a

380
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:59,320
MST a money LSAT winnable

381
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:02,320
35 which is flight reservation that
beats

382
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,750
ASCII two loads I and excel at a sudden

383
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:09,630
address is not in which is hostile
haven't gone and there's a lot to me

384
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:09,930
said

385
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:13,130
hey I guess request to beyond what beach

386
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:16,400
the page which contains some private
information on menus and

387
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,970
this and s obviously all-star acceptable
call

388
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:23,380
and a as you can see him Firebug

389
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:27,880
so actually are the S's Mobile

390
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:32,890
is loaded on I dot com does inquest told
the car bombing attacks on my heart

391
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:33,740
having those com

392
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:38,060
sings the quest is coming from example
dot com and they are

393
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:41,500
bureau missions as a model makes a
request to hold PHP

394
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:45,250
I in which it says and its actually it's
able to

395
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:48,950
a start some pro information about the
user's and a

396
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:52,190
uses which are looking so just to prove
that this

397
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:56,180
prefer constant really entertaining work
I can look out i can refresh the page

398
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:56,560
and

399
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:00,830
haven't gone and actually demolishes
automobile is upon Senate meeting

400
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:03,870
is not not be 0

401
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:10,870
so yeah 0 so at this point I ask why
interesting to

402
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:16,730
are to investigate to understand how
hard on the posh such issue in 2011 and

403
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:17,290
actually

404
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:20,570
up I W needs to take note in which are

405
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:23,640
hearing is a tool he reported

406
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:28,180
I'll developers can understand why don't
they Sui fires have my number not

407
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:32,280
and it also released at all wish
basically last one but if I whether you

408
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,940
asked we find some global

409
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:37,320
and it is also able to lissy up

410
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:43,090
to up pouch doubles we find a Swiss
fights we now need to recompile me up

411
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:46,560
but the crucial point is that it is
necessary to bash the

412
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:50,180
applications to protect users need a and
actually this is quite unusual

413
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:54,390
when dealing with flashbacks seen
Sweeney are we use to see that

414
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:57,780
Adobe usually freaks fixes up

415
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:01,070
security backs by Putian nerdiness I'll

416
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:04,190
in the Adobe Flash Player itself but in
this case

417
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:07,870
the the patch does not affect the Adobe
Flash Player

418
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:11,730
but instead of extreme abuse and this is
very interesting since abuse

419
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:14,890
this means that it is possible to
exploit are

420
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:18,890
levels we files a in forty password
brazzers

421
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:22,180
and with another special Adobe Flash
Player teens

422
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:24,980
durability is bashing

423
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:28,679
flex from recordings and martini I don't
push me a

424
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:34,090
I'll yeah as assays I actually have to
be provided a reliable tool training too

425
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:35,149
quickly identifying

426
00:25:35,149 --> 00:25:38,360
the whether you're Sui 5 someone will
not

427
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:41,649
and we I investigated such to

428
00:25:41,649 --> 00:25:44,649
not to wonder somehow the

429
00:25:44,649 --> 00:25:47,690
were parched process works up

430
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:51,710
so actually a week we r up

431
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:56,690
we were interesting I'll as a saint
although be passed as she should and

432
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:59,850
we try to pass I step occasions I mean

433
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:04,149
when I move Flex applications which one
bashed by using the official Adobe

434
00:26:04,149 --> 00:26:05,070
patched or

435
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:09,879
which I'll be honest units on techno and
by testing such

436
00:26:09,879 --> 00:26:14,259
a Flex application sweeney understood
that we figured out that addresses

437
00:26:14,259 --> 00:26:14,879
models

438
00:26:14,879 --> 00:26:17,929
drought he married Miss embeddings Sui
for you anymore

439
00:26:17,929 --> 00:26:22,350
in the case of past a Flex application
and this means that

440
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:26,240
it is not possible to exploit such issue
i in the case of

441
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,299
flexible a iced flexible occasions

442
00:26:29,299 --> 00:26:33,879
%uh live up of heart all these may look
very clear this point we needed to

443
00:26:33,879 --> 00:26:34,769
reverse the patch

444
00:26:34,769 --> 00:26:38,830
I know the 21 to make sure that we
really understand what's

445
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:42,299
what was going on scenes doing the first
that the first

446
00:26:42,299 --> 00:26:45,850
tests we were seeing some and see
inconsistencies

447
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:50,009
among the foreign nationals on the same
Flex application I mean

448
00:26:50,009 --> 00:26:53,350
are we were seeing that forty salsa a
flexible cation

449
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:56,820
was looking up Atlas we've model schools
to me

450
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:00,529
where some other swell not at actually
this was

451
00:27:00,529 --> 00:27:04,289
the expecting BM your as the first one

452
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:08,330
worse and web hubbell 2cd 2011 24 61

453
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:11,649
where the second one well not so

454
00:27:11,649 --> 00:27:15,080
I in order to lissy were we were

455
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:18,580
another 20 understand the CD %ah

456
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:20,260
a

457
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:23,130
which was the part in the Flex framework
which room up

458
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:26,920
a which leads home BBT we needed to

459
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:30,460
adopt a specific methodology which which
is showing a slight

460
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:34,990
so we took to two different versions
let's say two versions of the same place

461
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:37,110
a petition sampled the first one will
know more

462
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:41,140
to this issue the second one passed many
Adobe Buchtel that we've compiled the

463
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,500
202

464
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:46,460
as we files and we def them and once we
got

465
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:49,650
the freeway people to understand what
the networks are skeptical and

466
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:53,450
and much I mean are dishonest to hun Sen
up

467
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:58,040
once we identify the passion we are also
able to identified a bootable called

468
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:03,010
ice the patch was applied to actual skip
to the global action script called

469
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:07,650
yep so in the end we prove that's how I
put scenes together with security some

470
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:09,400
boxing at us was indeed correct

471
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:12,410
and I me less youth yeah

472
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:16,450
so that up as you can see a high missus

473
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:21,110
the same the part all the Flex framework
you wish to reliability

474
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:24,520
was hopping so wearability

475
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:28,230
a took place I in the load meddled

476
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:32,070
on the class movie looking for a by ear
see

477
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:36,180
the compiling Abu nobles we five we were
able to

478
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:39,330
you such source and basically

479
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:43,270
the shoe square CZ scenes up a

480
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:47,030
actually the up departments we file is
loading

481
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:50,290
the a child's we fire by setting a is

482
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:53,870
security don't secure domain to its
current to me and

483
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:57,730
the schools that the child's we finance
inheriting be

484
00:28:57,730 --> 00:29:01,740
security domain how the parents me for
this quite easy

485
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:06,110
are as you can see in the case by in the
case of have passed

486
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:11,070
refile I mean as we find which was
passed by using Adobe official bar stool

487
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:14,610
are actually up we can see that Adobe
patched

488
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:18,570
this issue by introducing a kind of are
always high school always course

489
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:19,190
completion

490
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:23,400
I wish mescaline does not allow to went
unbeaten

491
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:27,510
you branch and and this means that the
security to me i've

492
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:31,120
child 34 is no septal skewed to mingle
Q&A me know

493
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:31,760
department

494
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,800
fun and I mean to sis

495
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,890
the bus service this August but

496
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:41,440
I it goal is dust on the sandwich is the
point of the

497
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,690
Flex framework I wish D a

498
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:48,120
ActionScript code you know what actual
scapegoat was

499
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:54,670
a worse no

500
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:59,080
so okay from

501
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:04,810
policy from a say it is important to
note at this point that

502
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:08,640
arm I'll let's say developers

503
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,650
and us site administrators can protect
against such issue

504
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:17,830
and basically doughtery help shins the
first song is so sorry to recompile

505
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:19,840
nobles we find another subpar

506
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:24,170
Apache flex flex has the key by
including static libraries

507
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:29,460
and as we know that the letters version
of her but your Flex SDK

508
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:32,540
a it's not horrible such issue another

509
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:37,420
possibilities to posh T Mobile's we file
by using your BB official

510
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:40,710
Buchtel and this seems to be

511
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:43,710
quite reliable at least during our
experience

512
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:47,070
do you know what's best and well

513
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:50,260
the last the last option as: the by

514
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:53,540
is sexually to believe the when I was we
fires

515
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:57,100
if they are not used anymore are

516
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:01,630
well glass suggestions that you should
know he likes you across the Middle take

517
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:02,290
some of our

518
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:06,830
but its its a quite common security

519
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:10,550
I good practice

520
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:14,330
ohs so just to look up what we have we
have since

521
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:17,520
till now so we had to have a coup bug

522
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:21,270
but it turned out to be using your money
back so

523
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:26,370
CDT 2011 sick 24 61 was bashing the Flex

524
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:30,820
as the K but a is Cassie be exploiting

525
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:35,110
a 20 bash liberals in with the latest
version of Adobe Flash plugin

526
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:38,810
a not technically does somebody is
preclusion where

527
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:44,140
ever published and successful
exploitation also sheesh you move leads

528
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:44,650
who

529
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:48,780
matisse to managing I'll ceremony June
it was foggy

530
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:52,810
but also our costuming across site
content jacking

531
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:56,010
so that the stealing hands

532
00:31:56,010 --> 00:32:03,010
action for me a so

533
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:09,480
a so I despite the better question is is
there any chance to catch memorial will

534
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,000
flicker

535
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,110
cations after four years I mean yup

536
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:18,510
after four years since though we passed
such issue in 2011 so

537
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:23,510
a in order to reply to this question we
need to win a sale to meet will bring a

538
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:23,970
beaded

539
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:27,040
session process so first we needed to
identify a balloon

540
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:31,190
a when I was we filed by using a
protected from the mighty fashion in

541
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:32,160
order to do that

542
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:35,910
we needed to be the tall a was name yes
about 10 G

543
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:41,550
a we needed to house misconduct internet
appalled at that point

544
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:45,780
we used a and modified National Park
Angie

545
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:50,530
which was which was using selenium know
that I'll to meet a real well but also

546
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:54,870
to downloads we find a sweet JoJo stand
up to gonna talk to me

547
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:58,540
to follow them into process them and up
to 2500 they were

548
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:02,380
affordable not to so she should I was
really needs to

549
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:06,170
repeats us such operation multiple times
with multiple computers

550
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:09,480
for Haney see I

551
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:12,559
for any targets

552
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:16,690
the me 272 October so we have here

553
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:19,919
speed up to that point was like okay we
do we need to speed up

554
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:23,809
so for the about the

555
00:33:23,809 --> 00:33:26,999
let's say the first and second points
are we

556
00:33:26,999 --> 00:33:30,039
obviously need to lissy understands how

557
00:33:30,039 --> 00:33:33,600
to find a way to wanna say discriminate
among vulnerable to the files

558
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:37,369
and Nobles we files and are installed at
we wanted to

559
00:33:37,369 --> 00:33:40,440
focused on dat part which is wonderful
tool

560
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:44,259
which makes a has Wi Fi wanna more at
the score

561
00:33:44,259 --> 00:33:47,450
this is as as a portent before it is
lamentable

562
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:51,039
and modeling for class so what we need

563
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:55,480
we basically I analyze the ABC which is
the access key by schools

564
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:59,259
for I 10 below normal levels we fires

565
00:33:59,259 --> 00:34:02,639
is allowed us to SAE are

566
00:34:02,639 --> 00:34:05,799
to detect some part asking the

567
00:34:05,799 --> 00:34:08,869
ABC duties to disassemble Heckscher
scripps called

568
00:34:08,869 --> 00:34:13,750
a we each proceed to find the persons
hardy when ability

569
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:19,480
so once we got are be abc party pop
trance hitting the ABC

570
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:22,559
very bottom be there to which simple
tool it's a

571
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:26,220
country me assemble cold and tool

572
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:30,010
a to file some to find the spot on the

573
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:33,200
ABC so to

574
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,250
you would percent part Angie which is
the two

575
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:39,460
accustomed to we wrote to

576
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:43,020
which basically a law school I identify
whether I'll

577
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:46,750
whether a thank you once we finalize
winnable home not

578
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:50,790
to TV he 2011 but 2461 it is written in
Java

579
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:53,879
it is composed by just by a single jar
and

580
00:34:53,879 --> 00:34:58,349
it can be used as a commonly used to be
but also as a bar Pro Plus but it's kind

581
00:34:58,349 --> 00:34:58,780
of like

582
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:02,140
it obviously uses as we stomp

583
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:05,569
the other two created disassemble action
scripps

584
00:35:05,569 --> 00:35:08,930
disciple so to count re: the the elite

585
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:14,020
from the because it belonged up so what
one thing is that

586
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:18,240
if you're I wouldn't be surprised if you
go download the plugin

587
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:18,829
in AU

588
00:35:18,829 --> 00:35:23,319
use a curl and your you know bashful
scripting and download file and then use

589
00:35:23,319 --> 00:35:24,509
the common line or

590
00:35:24,509 --> 00:35:28,650
that only prober I actually wouldn't be
surprised by the end of the conference

591
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:30,059
you will actually find

592
00:35:30,059 --> 00:35:35,400
a formal file I mean you will see we
need a wide interns can but then there

593
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,279
are so many website

594
00:35:36,279 --> 00:35:40,630
out there so I am so

595
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:45,390
a display name we want to assure you
I'll established that more about us

596
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:48,529
about distal ans I'll

597
00:35:48,529 --> 00:35:51,779
a sickly this possible to use it as a
commonly utility

598
00:35:51,779 --> 00:35:55,579
so in this case back going to my local
webserver

599
00:35:55,579 --> 00:35:59,619
homes yet its

600
00:35:59,619 --> 00:36:03,269
basically can take as input as we file
ok I'll take a simple to

601
00:36:03,269 --> 00:36:06,359
to a directory containing multiples we
files

602
00:36:06,359 --> 00:36:10,309
and this case its was able to understand
the players wishing to order to use the

603
00:36:10,309 --> 00:36:11,869
Flex application used

604
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:15,309
in the first demo is wonderful tool such
issue actually

605
00:36:15,309 --> 00:36:19,299
so the Disick distal has a built on the
same whether the

606
00:36:19,299 --> 00:36:22,749
Flex application was compiled with an
old version of the STK

607
00:36:22,749 --> 00:36:26,579
and therefore is winnable or whether
itís

608
00:36:26,579 --> 00:36:30,769
it was passed by using the Adobe
official patch to all-weather into use

609
00:36:30,769 --> 00:36:34,349
it was combined a/c up original version

610
00:36:34,349 --> 00:36:38,199
of the Adobe Flex SDK whole

611
00:36:38,199 --> 00:36:42,619
party a party for assisting as the key
obviously the USS

612
00:36:42,619 --> 00:36:46,869
amadio in this case disease their
addresses on this call her

613
00:36:46,869 --> 00:36:50,150
at me han underscore US his team agent

614
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:53,979
present value and obviously it is not a
Flex application

615
00:36:53,979 --> 00:36:57,099
ahh your so

616
00:36:57,099 --> 00:37:04,099
you can also use it as or bar pool

617
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:07,020
busing SCANA planning so in this case
I'm setting

618
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:12,380
bahco as a local proxy so

619
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:15,490
this is coop actually indeed extender

620
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:18,520
up apollo 10g as being lobbied

621
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:22,900
I soon disabled intercepts

622
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:26,910
down come looking days to

623
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:30,960
web application we use them the first
demo I'll

624
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:35,300
yeah so I can switch to to the bar pro

625
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:38,310
and as you can see Park immediately

626
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:42,380
identified each issue and a I'll just
work

627
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:46,060
best Glee 0 the bar pro

628
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:49,070
buses Connor use the

629
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:52,690
looks for up a bus who looks for Bruno

630
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:57,160
for a Sui fires in the balls in your
browsing history

631
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:00,890
and if if visible time prime

632
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:04,430
from find someone this its a

633
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:07,860
bus assist them to the same the custom
in gym

634
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:11,020
which use actually part engine and

635
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:14,080
if they were on what do your petitions
considerable damn

636
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:17,270
about Mb and a little discomfort

637
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:20,920
just for the sake of completeness has
gone see

638
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:24,230
in the house five fields 5 I'll does

639
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:27,250
a candle lock about switch Rd we follow
us

640
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:31,710
which one analyzed by

641
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:33,090
by the

642
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:36,350
to the expansion and what else

643
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:39,770
0 yeah but looking on startup articles

644
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:43,750
0 before you can also see you want or
what was going on

645
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:49,130
yumm the same scanning process bomb

646
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:52,710
who wanted to proceed tweet which with
the presentation

647
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:55,720
so are

648
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:59,280
so between October and December 2004

649
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:03,880
Wisconsin a few interesting to me is for
detecting levels we fight

650
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:07,430
so it's kinda top 50 Alexa up

651
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:10,960
Adobe dot com and many sites running a
bug bounty program

652
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:16,180
and well %uh at the end of the day we
broke the gym tonight we therefore he is

653
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:16,730
old

654
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:19,990
when ability that was maybe never

655
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:24,930
are deeply investigated deeply so never
funny understand

656
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:28,890
and never surfaced so as you can see we
identified

657
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:31,950
a noble flexible occasions on

658
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:35,870
many hyperfine website as a casino
slight

659
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:39,590
but also many others which are not
reported

660
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:42,870
in this and a slight so cool

661
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:46,740
our so just to prove

662
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:50,120
just to make you %uh

663
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:53,460
understands so

664
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:57,610
a we just want two percent a a brief
demo and about

665
00:39:57,610 --> 00:40:01,010
wish we we brought a proof-of-concept

666
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:04,360
against I'll be dot kom I'll

667
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:08,400
and which we were trying to steer single
sign-on tokens

668
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:13,120
I'll in order to let a steal some
private information about us

669
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:18,330
use a switch are looking audible.com it
does have been using seat was botched by

670
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:21,890
Adobe a few few days ago

671
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:26,120
weeks probably weeks yeah so

672
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:31,310
in this case I'm like being with my
personal account on

673
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:35,740
Obama got on bicycle seemed us mara are

674
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:39,250
yeah

675
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:46,250
to this is my account

676
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:51,630
so at this point I I'm assuming that the
victim

677
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:56,869
yes us to to use it to my nieces web
page that these

678
00:40:56,869 --> 00:41:00,029
nearly past the post on I mean but calm

679
00:41:00,029 --> 00:41:04,529
then its me since the crucial concept
web page

680
00:41:04,529 --> 00:41:07,920
and as you can see your

681
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:13,400
so as you can see the by exploiting have
10 balls we file host on Adobe dot com

682
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,480
we were able to

683
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,880
assistance up rowing formations and
that's a very information about them

684
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,859
victim which use love being no we don't
go and

685
00:41:22,859 --> 00:41:25,960
such as its email use a

686
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:29,240
first name his a last name and these

687
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:32,559
moment number so the POC is quite
interesting

688
00:41:32,559 --> 00:41:36,109
scenes are as you can see

689
00:41:36,109 --> 00:41:39,940
its in this case basically

690
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:43,180
%uh money she is a resident model

691
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:46,499
which is host on heavy disco mixer for a
sleek westall

692
00:41:46,499 --> 00:41:49,519
oh that to me use up

693
00:41:49,519 --> 00:41:52,789
this domain and this domain

694
00:41:52,789 --> 00:41:55,819
actually selves some

695
00:41:55,819 --> 00:41:58,989
a single sign-on web services and

696
00:41:58,989 --> 00:42:04,470
policy %uh by making a request to add
this to mean is possible to steal

697
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:08,480
are single sign-on to me this happen and
single sign-on

698
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:12,690
at a single Saratoga and them be money
she says a lot to me to

699
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:16,289
sequin request second request to another
single sign-on to me

700
00:42:16,289 --> 00:42:19,940
bypassing the just want your talkin this

701
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:24,470
this request and as you can see

702
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:27,549
the response to this up to the second
question

703
00:42:27,549 --> 00:42:30,690
took the second up request

704
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:35,049
actually contains the information we
she's reporting to text area

705
00:42:35,049 --> 00:42:38,089
where you can see a which is called

706
00:42:38,089 --> 00:42:41,170
mixing victims neither so askew

707
00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:44,799
a diesel at this quite interesting to
note that

708
00:42:44,799 --> 00:42:48,070
the work process to work for concept

709
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:54,800
works scenes yeah so

710
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:58,000
be domains which are I

711
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,570
which are hosting the single sign-on web
services

712
00:43:01,570 --> 00:43:06,030
are reporting such cause to me don't
text him out so

713
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:10,090
they are defining a past with respect to
your bubble column

714
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:13,310
to me and these mean that this means
that

715
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:18,550
a 35 which are hostile not only dot com
can access also be

716
00:43:18,550 --> 00:43:23,720
which is fast on the settlement and the
system is online 21

717
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:26,940
befor concept works sings these we find
him

718
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:30,580
money just as a model he's noting the
booming

719
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:34,670
the excuse and most of the yellow dot
com but can still makes

720
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:38,170
make a request to so that two singles
and albums

721
00:43:38,170 --> 00:43:41,490
obviously I'll

722
00:43:41,490 --> 00:43:44,660
the same use for

723
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:47,870
seconds from single single single single
me

724
00:43:47,870 --> 00:43:54,870
so yeah

725
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:01,720
okay

726
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:06,720
okay so assay before we reported the
Swan ability to many high-profile

727
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:07,809
security mus

728
00:44:07,809 --> 00:44:11,000
up we provide a specific proof

729
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,359
specific proof of concept we also
provided the first national park Han Ji

730
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:18,589
and we hope to provide is I PDF we

731
00:44:18,589 --> 00:44:22,089
a all its all the details haha research

732
00:44:22,089 --> 00:44:25,799
anymore he tumbled party was him for

733
00:44:25,799 --> 00:44:30,029
on a potential disclosure indeed once we
reached

734
00:44:30,029 --> 00:44:33,710
a consensus we identified an appropiate

735
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:37,099
is crucially it is actually me and

736
00:44:37,099 --> 00:44:40,390
up I was me up there are many there are
still many more

737
00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:43,609
web sites but I'll hosting winnable flex

738
00:44:43,609 --> 00:44:48,980
applications so I was suggesting is just
to try to use I want to

739
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:53,109
apart ng2 identify these

740
00:44:53,109 --> 00:44:57,670
is global Flex applications to get in
touch with being bored secure teams

741
00:44:57,670 --> 00:45:01,970
to report them and two more well just be
pedicle

742
00:45:01,970 --> 00:45:06,099
and to be easier if you got a pen tester

743
00:45:06,099 --> 00:45:09,329
II guess it's gonna be you know

744
00:45:09,329 --> 00:45:12,509
three bucks for a for a few more weeks
and probably mom

745
00:45:12,509 --> 00:45:17,990
the planning on you know the reaction on
matter website again we really tried to

746
00:45:17,990 --> 00:45:18,859
do our best

747
00:45:18,859 --> 00:45:21,010
I

748
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:23,790
we 95 probably forty

749
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:27,830
more more like society well tonight if
I'd and see

750
00:45:27,830 --> 00:45:32,600
you know major CDM details he have
visibility over a lot of traffic

751
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:36,580
I unfortunately you need to patch every
single file

752
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:39,990
right the scenes I'll the patch is not
in there and the player

753
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:43,690
I'm it really requires everybody's going
web site on the war

754
00:45:43,690 --> 00:45:47,590
to make sure that they are not all sting
the flash files are compiled in one

755
00:45:47,590 --> 00:45:48,670
abortion so

756
00:45:48,670 --> 00:45:52,940
I'm I if I i mean lol

757
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:56,200
we really think it's the only way is is
is

758
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:59,440
community-driven approach where you know

759
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:02,490
we all go around trying to look for
these things

760
00:46:02,490 --> 00:46:06,700
a you know well awfully out or swinging
to Goodison check so

761
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:11,480
add that the overtime I know all
together will actually get to

762
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:16,530
a.m. to notify everyone I am if you are
all same one of i'll

763
00:46:16,530 --> 00:46:19,410
you basically have a say more like a
same region pie to bypass for your

764
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:20,040
website

765
