1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:03,360
so flowing on thank you very much

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,210
are hello everyone just the first
question from my site so

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:10,469
who has an SAP system in their company
running so

4
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:14,910
that looks coach was a penetration
tester

5
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,500
okay thanks a lot

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:22,640
so money was for the right amount on the
head of consulting up

7
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:28,990
virtual approach I'm an actor securities
a researcher in the SAP area since 2006

8
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:32,800
I'm call author of the book secure other
programming I'm also a trainer for

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,260
secure programming

10
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:38,770
arm you can book the trainings to invite
of university as an example

11
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:43,059
I have done frequent publication sign

12
00:00:43,059 --> 00:00:47,149
had also played in the past lot of
capture the flag contests are

13
00:00:47,149 --> 00:00:52,129
academic her capture the flag contests
with us over the top three places

14
00:00:52,129 --> 00:00:56,829
and Thomas because various confer tooth
comes to start

15
00:00:56,829 --> 00:01:00,510
yeah hi everyone I also work for a bit
of art

16
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:05,379
up I'm primarily a developer they also
do security research

17
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:08,670
and in the past I have done our I played

18
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:13,460
capture the flag contest like fat I've
also all and I some capture the flag

19
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:14,840
contests and my

20
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,509
our research interests other than that
are

21
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:23,030
programming languages a virtual machines
yeah I also %uh spoken various

22
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:23,759
conferences

23
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,820
so what's the agenda for today harm

24
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:32,040
I want to go backgrounds elaborate a
little bit

25
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,520
on what Mariano presented in 2007
because somethings

26
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:42,560
changed in November last year on them so
I i want to talk again on the horse

27
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,950
called back attacks

28
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,350
arm which you may know and I want to

29
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:51,869
elaborate on dot how you can really
explore with them and how you can really

30
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:52,750
play around

31
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:56,909
on so divs to present your heart
basically works

32
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:00,869
just the short introduction into that
cause I see that

33
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:04,420
most of the people are really the within
the SAP area

34
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,479
and then I was show

35
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,500
are we can actually do the exploitation
what's the one or both

36
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,840
fewer than the call back mechanism I
want you to understand the risks

37
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:19,610
are okay that's your and then I want to
talk about exploitation techniques

38
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:22,690
so that the people get an understanding
that this is not

39
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:27,800
something theoretic and then of course
of how you can actually mitigate

40
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:34,080
okay so what s ASAP RC

41
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:40,130
or RC stands for remote function call
it's basically the RPC equivalent

42
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:44,940
within the SAP landscape it's a
proprietary communication protocol

43
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:49,410
I it's you start the communication
between the SAP systems

44
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:54,300
so you can connect a j2ee engine for
example where the knob system and vice

45
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:54,970
versa

46
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:58,650
are if you do a double stay
consideration is also some sort of

47
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:04,340
up RC communication in between there are
some external service we have seeing

48
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:09,400
in not is not here anymore but which
have seen in the previous talk

49
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,920
I'm registering serve us we have also
seen that with the t-rex and sedation

50
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,000
a off to a pier are you can also hook on

51
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,299
that's a external service to the system
Starz

52
00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:24,739
don't this protocol is basically use to

53
00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:28,640
are that's a perform business critical
communication okay

54
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,810
I considering the

55
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:35,510
a text her face with the IRC protocol it
is in the way that

56
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:41,290
within eur/jpy 6 NECC six we have our
own 35,000 remote unable to function

57
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:42,170
modules

58
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:47,260
within the Solution Manager we have
27500 Mozart

59
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:50,890
that's quite lawsuit XO space and that
doesn't include

60
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:54,549
that say anything someone else puts on
top

61
00:03:54,549 --> 00:03:59,570
with custom code insulations their own
coding and such soft

62
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:03,140
third-party add-ons and so on

63
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:06,370
I'm not thinking about typical large

64
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:09,390
enterprise SAP landscape

65
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:12,770
then we have literary thousands

66
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:18,650
of RRC destinations are under stress the
nation's or

67
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:22,710
to use on there are basically three
different connection pipe steers the

68
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,180
standard RC client

69
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,800
I which I recently learned has the
official name of SAP NetWeaver

70
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,590
application server for up

71
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:35,420
RC climbed and then there's the
possibility of their adjusted external

72
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,760
Saba and you can also have an external

73
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:42,530
RRC clocked and all of these are used to
communicate

74
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:45,830
with the RRC so in short

75
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:50,180
so how does it look like up from a
technical point of you

76
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:53,950
so basically I can connect true systems
here I have a

77
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:58,480
example Solution Manager CISM and I have
a example ECC sick

78
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:02,550
ECC 6 yes p6 I'll

79
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:08,820
which is so configure test situ c66 you
can also run that's why it's two people

80
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:12,740
we will focus now on DRC protocol itself

81
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:16,250
so how does it work within the up stick

82
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:19,980
so let's think about the connection from
CSM

83
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:26,070
to see 66 whether or not it would look
like this

84
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:29,510
so you have cost function and then you
have your function name

85
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:33,510
and then you specify a destination

86
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:37,440
and up destination needs to be
configured within the

87
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,640
transection SM 59 so there you can
connect

88
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:45,550
target there you can connect configure
up connections

89
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:48,800
are for those connections there are
different

90
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,890
possibilities how to do authentication I
don't want to go into detail steer

91
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:59,750
if you look at Loche lets a cenar yes
you're very often end up with some

92
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,050
technical user names

93
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:05,540
or attorneys Cliff Lee with cross the
connection so

94
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:10,320
if you can connect to one system you may
also connect another system

95
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,610
but that's not too strong focus here
right so we have

96
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:17,000
hurt earlier and all those talks that
there are literally

97
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
many possibilities if you compromise one
system into half

98
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,030
use this and other systems but yet then
you can compromise the second system so

99
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:29,630
if I can compromise CS are most likely I
can also compromise

100
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:34,630
c66 okay

101
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:39,590
that what happened effed up connection
is not working like a dialect

102
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:43,320
right so it's not one way I can also do
our

103
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:48,780
connection back right so that what
change the things a little bit

104
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:51,830
so let's go into

105
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:57,240
at the details of dot arm the difference
euros

106
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,920
if I'm within c66 then I use the

107
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:06,940
destination back so if CS and I'll call
its

108
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:10,840
system or the destination c66

109
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,750
and the function zip business partner

110
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,750
then actually that function what Iran

111
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:21,120
and dysfunctional basically makes a call
back

112
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:27,410
to call soda to the system CSS but
that's a call back a tech

113
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:31,350
a Mariano the Houston all those men in
the middle attacks and

114
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:35,780
some Hall patch well after that
presentation

115
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:40,320
nothing really happen so let's let's
stick into the details

116
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:45,040
so it we have two same situation the
only difference here is maybe

117
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,700
that within CSM if we do that's that
connection

118
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:52,450
then we haven't checked against SRC a
but just basically

119
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:57,080
similar to DST coat check if you start
in transaction alerts

120
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:03,210
its just that in initial startup sick

121
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:06,380
which is quite fun so I have to
possibility if I'm

122
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:10,729
system one

123
00:08:10,729 --> 00:08:15,610
of hi connect to a system to one system
to actually can

124
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:18,910
also use functionality of my system

125
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:22,720
which

126
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:28,900
looks like this okay so now thinking
about how to exploit this

127
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:32,630
right so what can I do about

128
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:37,469
so the idea what do you to find
interesting function modules

129
00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:41,430
that most likely a high privileged use
up

130
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:47,209
is using so think about crouching
moderate somewhat

131
00:08:47,209 --> 00:08:51,810
work call from system one with the high
privilege because we somehow need to

132
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:52,589
suck on one

133
00:08:52,589 --> 00:08:56,339
dark src authorization check

134
00:08:56,339 --> 00:09:00,990
at least and when we think about that
song

135
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:04,860
one of the examples would be so we can
do connection test for

136
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:08,700
RRC connection so that's a plane example

137
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:12,880
which we were just showing no in a demo
Hall we can exploit

138
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:19,660
that so let's go for the real-life
example okay

139
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:24,910
so I'm as Fed has explained the idea is
to find a

140
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:28,000
RC enable functional that you can

141
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,450
count on that its going to be called
sooner or later

142
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:34,880
so arm the idea was to use

143
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,880
a function that's defined in the SAP
stand up

144
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:44,300
and I'll so

145
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:48,279
one of those functions that gets called
often is paying I'm

146
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:51,330
so for this demo

147
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:55,120
I will look into a system call c66 now

148
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,770
this system is I allowing a connection
from system call CSM

149
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:03,760
I want to get a user on the system
siesta so I have

150
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,779
SAP all permissions on c66 now let's try
what I can

151
00:10:07,779 --> 00:10:14,779
let's see what I can achieve

152
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:22,280
okay

153
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:28,680
chaos a challenge to a lot of me off SAR

154
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,990
you knock me off it's okay 0 sorry

155
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:37,570
here so I've

156
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:40,790
already prepared some cold I'm

157
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:44,459
to you now pressure oder

158
00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:47,730
Solution Manager configuration interface
the IDS if

159
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:51,600
the administrator clicks on the Test
Connection button

160
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,300
on what this does is it issues a pink
unfortunately the way the pain

161
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:00,490
is called prevents me from calling
something back so I have to look for

162
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:01,329
another function

163
00:11:01,329 --> 00:11:04,420
and another function as cold as a
solution managers call

164
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:07,899
function exists this is also defined in
the SAP standard

165
00:11:07,899 --> 00:11:14,899
so let's try to edit that function

166
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:29,250
sorry

167
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:36,070
here we are

168
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:42,339
now

169
00:11:42,339 --> 00:11:43,819
now

170
00:11:43,819 --> 00:11:46,889
okay I basically I'm enabling this

171
00:11:46,889 --> 00:11:51,120
cold and as you can see it the first
check I do a live

172
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,519
I'll check whether this is called from a
user called SMCs am

173
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:57,810
this is a service user used by the
Solution Manager

174
00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:00,959
and what I do it here is

175
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:05,410
I call another standard function called
bopping user-created

176
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:08,889
destination back and I create some

177
00:12:08,889 --> 00:12:13,149
new user and after that I assigned to
that user

178
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:16,720
the privilege SAP all and

179
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,019
I logged into a table so I see that it
was successful

180
00:12:20,019 --> 00:12:23,180
a I think federal talk a little about

181
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:27,100
how to edit cold in the SAP namespace if
you don't have a

182
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:31,949
development key for that but I do so I
can just

183
00:12:31,949 --> 00:12:36,749
use the standard it on activate the cold
and

184
00:12:36,749 --> 00:12:43,749
so left see if I can already login
siesta

185
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:53,870
our I guess so maybe you should kill the
1i her

186
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:57,580
either I'm it just painted by viacom job
or something

187
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:00,589
or I forgot to meet the user from the
previous day mall

188
00:13:00,589 --> 00:13:07,589
so maybe are this is why we do in life
to mostly have some fun are you going to

189
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:09,630
do later archaea

190
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:16,630
thanks

191
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:23,010
to should be gone so let's try again
hopefully I'm successful this time

192
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:27,310
up yeah it doesn't work

193
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:30,839
so now I wait for the see as I'm not
going to

194
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:37,839
try to look at my system I still
reachable so

195
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:44,430
that would be one way call I could
execute that functionality a

196
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:47,920
on let's say within the technical
landscape overview

197
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:54,470
I am so I can do here technical checks
and I can also check for DRC status as

198
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:55,250
you can see

199
00:13:55,250 --> 00:14:00,170
a HC lost called this a function and
what I'm going to do

200
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:05,610
I'm just executing it okay

201
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:12,450
now if I'm lucky I should be able to
look back at yeah

202
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:17,730
work together

203
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:21,410
okay prior and i cant I can look up my
user

204
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:27,800
on

205
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:32,550
South Hall so I can basically do
whatever I want account

206
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:36,459
if may be just another common if I don't
want to wait for some I'm into

207
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:39,930
paying my system I could try to find
another function like

208
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:42,940
hook into on one of the year

209
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:46,550
all the conditions that has to be met in
order for this to work is the

210
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,160
administrator that pains me

211
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,820
does need the permission to create new
users so

212
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:55,310
I have a discussion on dot so alright
well BR

213
00:14:55,310 --> 00:15:00,810
meaning for function module dot you what
like to exploit in order to ensure

214
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:04,170
that most likely the caught up with
accessing

215
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:11,170
you has high privileges

216
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:19,260
trip

217
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:23,430
quite as an example or I could think
about

218
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:27,460
function markets start to use which we
actually use within the exploit

219
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:32,690
so that our related to central use a
management as an example ought to pray

220
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:33,690
to use the so

221
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:38,410
when someone called Stop function it is
very likely that this user also will

222
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:39,180
have to

223
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:43,180
possibility to create he was a central
coast most like

224
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:46,910
okay arm

225
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:51,160
so the idea is basically here to get an
understanding

226
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:56,810
what kind of meaning for function I
would like to find and how I can read

227
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:57,560
exploiters

228
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:03,020
of course if I go for SAP all that's one
of the examples

229
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:08,180
but thinking about 35,000 mod youth

230
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:12,410
data remotely enabled and not all of
them contain authorization checks

231
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:16,440
on some of them in the past had also

232
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:22,140
let's say 10 days up with missing of the
authorization checks and 10 were

233
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:23,030
dispatched

234
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:27,160
on some also pets with the year a
switchable

235
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,200
I'll authorization framework

236
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,490
so it's kind of very likely

237
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:37,360
that you will find some function doctor
can really abuse

238
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:42,360
in order to do something nasty and we're
already seeing the previous talks

239
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,540
vendors logistics

240
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:49,640
H are so DIDS are

241
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:55,460
up yell you get the imagine I I have
also seen some some systems where SAP

242
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,610
itself says it

243
00:16:56,610 --> 00:17:00,960
it's mandatory trip RC connections
configured with SAP all

244
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:05,940
otherwise the modules are not running
properly with each other so in that case

245
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:09,000
from yeah well than obviously it's a no
brainer

246
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,819
so you need

247
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:15,659
some hard to understand what you can do
okay

248
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:18,889
so that's let's talk about a little bit
more

249
00:17:18,889 --> 00:17:25,559
what is the requirement for the attacker
so HC interest

250
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:29,570
modify PSAP standout right

251
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:33,929
so that's unlikely to happen production
except for the case the stuff we find

252
00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:36,620
one of those many wonder abilities that
are out there

253
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:42,250
but what every customer most likely also
has a

254
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:46,169
developing South right and within that
developing system

255
00:17:46,169 --> 00:17:49,730
most likely you will have some
developers so and by definition

256
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:52,789
those developers process the necessary
rights to

257
00:17:52,789 --> 00:17:57,269
develop cocked or

258
00:17:57,269 --> 00:18:01,250
what we have also seen on the talk of
NPR's is if you have some sort of

259
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:04,830
operating system command injection or if
you have to possibility

260
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:08,710
to be a basis guide then you can go

261
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:13,230
on the arm come online and from there
you can install transport if you can

262
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:14,740
install transports

263
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:18,629
you could use a X PRIZE an example to
execute your own cold water

264
00:18:18,629 --> 00:18:25,050
importing the transport

265
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:32,050
okay so as a result if that prerequisite
is given and the attackers malicious

266
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:36,760
he can basically

267
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:40,350
call any remote in a boat function
module

268
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:44,300
and calling system so CSM

269
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:48,370
of course as ever see is performed as an
authorization check

270
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:51,750
and we need to somehow grab a user

271
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:55,110
are so that we can yeah

272
00:18:55,110 --> 00:19:02,110
work with the escalator privileges

273
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:09,210
sale thinking about src star what's the
standard situation

274
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:12,690
without authorization Altec that
customers

275
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:17,920
so how many people

276
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:23,150
have start authorization object the site
well

277
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:27,270
not every customer every user I have
seen got

278
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:30,540
sometimes but what I see it never hurts

279
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:35,450
that's a if you get to a customer for
the first time as an assessment

280
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:39,970
on then you will have this situation
that at least the key users

281
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:43,290
well half src star so

282
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:47,750
at least does people who already have
many authorizations

283
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:52,630
they will have ducks necessary
authorization to basically caught

284
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:56,550
any are a CNA burt function so

285
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:59,860
that I can accused ataturk of course

286
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:04,220
we will also have many developers within
all systems

287
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:07,460
some maybe prom near Shaw

288
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:10,640
maybe some from offshore maybe some
extra notes

289
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,100
maybe somebody intro not so it's kind of
difficult took

290
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:17,400
to really control them and in case

291
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,800
rush just showed here most likely a
customer

292
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:26,020
were also have a solution manager and if
I have a solution manager most likely

293
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:28,690
systems will be connected to the
Solution Manager and also that

294
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:31,100
development system would be most likely
connected

295
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:36,110
to the solution it because somehow you
want to do system recommendations

296
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:40,240
so York want to get an understanding
what security patches who want to

297
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,080
install within your system so

298
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:47,220
in order to develop you need to
configure connection the

299
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:50,090
while then of course like

300
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:54,010
like we said earlier if we modify
something within the user management

301
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:59,160
then bisous the most likely way all you
can really exploited

302
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:03,480
on to real honest with you it really
depends on the target customer

303
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:07,870
yes ducks attack has to be Croft ok so
you need some sort of

304
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:11,640
expert lever arm were some sort of

305
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,950
in China know all holder landscape looks
like

306
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:19,180
thinking about a developer got developer

307
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:23,030
by definition has the possibility to
write his own about court

308
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:26,560
and by using it or by writing his own

309
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:30,940
up coach he can basically excess every
information within the system or you

310
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:31,590
could even

311
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:34,740
assigned himself SAP all so

312
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:38,860
he has all the information but I think
it's important to point out that while

313
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:43,940
usually you can review the developer
scope before you move it onto a

314
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:47,850
production system in this case you
usually don't because the system is

315
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:48,870
already connected

316
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:52,660
to the central management system so

317
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:57,710
the developer can run cold at doesn't
get checked by anyone no Social Security

318
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:59,720
check for example route between

319
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:06,720
development and 2a what not happen that
situation which one end up

320
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:14,830
another time in the POS system
compromise so hard to build the exploits

321
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:20,290
are we somehow need to modify and
enhance the standard of course tux

322
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:24,610
that maybe depending on some development
case and that baby also dependent on

323
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:26,260
some modification case

324
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:29,490
and such stuff %uh in the end we have
seen

325
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:34,150
utterly out the report our earth
underscore repair underscore sauce

326
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:39,320
that's quite similar to a custom coat
I'm just presenting which basically

327
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:42,930
allows you with those six lines through
modify

328
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:46,380
any up calling within the system's with
the

329
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:49,410
very few exceptions where you have

330
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:50,509
let's say that

331
00:22:50,509 --> 00:22:54,949
three programs trip cannot modify that
way where you have to use different

332
00:22:54,949 --> 00:22:55,639
techniques

333
00:22:55,639 --> 00:22:59,690
but for you function markets yes that
works

334
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:05,889
arm if you want to play around with the
functional arguments are you can also

335
00:23:05,889 --> 00:23:09,659
use a dose functions with I'll

336
00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:13,339
within the SAP standard so that
basically allow you to reach

337
00:23:13,339 --> 00:23:16,549
an arbitrary function module and also to
insert

338
00:23:16,549 --> 00:23:19,799
stop in the pasta had also been a the

339
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:23,669
zero-day vulnerability within the insert
function but

340
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:26,789
more your which has already being

341
00:23:26,789 --> 00:23:31,339
patched are and yes dose of course also

342
00:23:31,339 --> 00:23:34,829
remote enables soul know if you have a
user that has

343
00:23:34,829 --> 00:23:39,509
s developed with the REIT authorization
and you have src that gives you

344
00:23:39,509 --> 00:23:40,929
basically the informational

345
00:23:40,929 --> 00:23:44,099
so that you can shake for winner brill

346
00:23:44,099 --> 00:23:49,049
up function modules within the target
system

347
00:23:49,049 --> 00:23:53,079
right okay

348
00:23:53,079 --> 00:23:56,719
so what can you to abolish

349
00:23:56,719 --> 00:24:03,559
oil on there's an SAP notes are

350
00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:08,339
you can install I'm if you apply the fix

351
00:24:08,339 --> 00:24:12,389
you're not yet done so it's kind of
similar

352
00:24:12,389 --> 00:24:17,009
with the Gateway so you need some extra
Fort

353
00:24:17,009 --> 00:24:20,019
in order to to deal with it

354
00:24:20,019 --> 00:24:27,019
arm if you install the the note itself
then you will know to start in SM 59

355
00:24:27,589 --> 00:24:31,659
there's a slight change and you kept up
rep button and you want to get rid of

356
00:24:31,659 --> 00:24:32,749
the trip button

357
00:24:32,749 --> 00:24:37,579
but you don't only want to change it to
green but you also want to configure the

358
00:24:37,579 --> 00:24:38,569
system security

359
00:24:38,569 --> 00:24:43,250
so let's make the world a safer place

360
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:46,830
how can you do that sperm all you have
to pressure system

361
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:51,780
and up note was released in November
2000 14

362
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:56,090
arm just should also enable the security
of the clock

363
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:59,770
because there are some kind of the rents
that you 21 a track

364
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:04,770
are you should create so-called call
back white lists

365
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:08,150
which I would just show up on the next
flight how to do that

366
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:13,300
there's also the possibility when you do
custom coding to actually protect

367
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:18,300
yourself with custom coding if you make
a call to that function on your

368
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:22,960
before you call the remote function
model arm

369
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,090
you should make sure that within your
policy

370
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:31,420
I'll then you introduced profile para me
to call tech security method

371
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:35,870
does not equals 20 so that must be
forbidden

372
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:38,910
and then there's a great white paper
that

373
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:42,380
basically the scripps everything you
need to do that both

374
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:45,800
also released are which is also
mentioned and

375
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:50,700
on and a spotlight North still in the
service marketplace so if you go for

376
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:54,690
service SAP dot com slash security and
you look at the spotlight

377
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:59,210
still today and within the second I
think it's the second entry

378
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:02,390
you will it get that I rattling to that
paper

379
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:07,300
please make sure thought you'd to rate
that paper completely because it does

380
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,290
not only cover that were in our ability

381
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:14,620
but also how to deal with src stop and
such stuff so that's really a great

382
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:20,060
paper I can really really recommend so
there's a link

383
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:23,190
are you look at later on two flights are
also

384
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:26,300
that you can Kong

385
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:31,540
taken to the paper so how you deal with
those called a quite lists

386
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:34,580
like I said it's similar to the gate the
vulnerability

387
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:37,940
there's a lot going face there's a
simulation face

388
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:40,940
and then there's a goal I faces

389
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:44,050
well basically initially you say okay I
want to lock

390
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:47,290
every event I want to see all the scope
extent happening

391
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:51,540
then you maintain your first version
then you can go into the simulation also

392
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:51,990
that you

393
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:53,460
only see

394
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:56,460
the remaining pics that of let's say or
curing

395
00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:00,389
and once you see that you do have are
what set that basically metres

396
00:27:00,389 --> 00:27:04,089
the things you want to have ten you go
for the call I found this is controlled

397
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:05,419
by a pro for current

398
00:27:05,419 --> 00:27:11,009
arm I think the events within the
security audit flock

399
00:27:11,009 --> 00:27:14,029
art duri say

400
00:27:14,029 --> 00:27:18,200
and K so

401
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:24,039
that's basically it's here the reference
is also the paper from

402
00:27:24,039 --> 00:27:29,080
money on in 2007 so so it was really
presented its really on

403
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:32,609
old one durability here but

404
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:35,849
actually we need to to really raise if
so

405
00:27:35,849 --> 00:27:38,950
that finally SAP fix that point

406
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:43,969
but no you can secure your systems so

407
00:27:43,969 --> 00:27:50,969
that's it for today thanks a lot
question

408
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:01,210
space me

409
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:06,830
Joe that their text

410
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:09,780
basically or tire less K

411
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:14,380
is and all you

412
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:16,690
notice calm No

413
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:19,980
art year Solution Manager

414
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:23,800
long are will but it

415
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,740
mean

416
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:28,450
and over

417
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:32,330
whoever yes pass the

418
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:35,740
when the criminal mind set

419
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:41,410
yes yeah there but it's it's similar to
the one in our ability money on also

420
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:42,230
present its

421
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:46,770
the Gateway attack with the second floor
where rejection you start to exploit

422
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:47,530
systems

423
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:51,900
still there are so many systems out
there that are wonderful to that attack

424
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:55,460
so it's not all your fault implementing
to

425
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:59,040
security patch because future let's say
they don't want complete

426
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:02,430
turbidity and SAP don't want to that say
if

427
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:06,980
let's a have a disruption within the
Prost production so they always

428
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:10,310
give you all the tools to mitigate it
but

429
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:15,170
you must switch this on like an HP and
that's the part

430
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:20,400
many people don't to yeah

431
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:23,450
isn't there also way this

432
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:26,600
hi power

433
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:33,600
or look at all or I don't want to talk
about that

434
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:36,990
it the requirements s several

435
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:42,040
no its not SAP our think about the
central user administration as an

436
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:42,740
example

437
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:46,990
so there's one system that creates users
and another system and most likely it

438
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:47,830
would also be

439
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:52,090
possible to create users and the local
system if you have that technique

440
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:57,000
and if you're modify Dutch let's ASAP
standards

441
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,940
function that is called in that way then
you can be sure that within the central

442
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:02,680
user administration system

443
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:06,190
you will have to necessary authorization
rights and date

444
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:09,960
don't need to pee SAP all it's
sufficient rafter possibility

445
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:13,160
to create a new user if I think about

446
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:17,060
stuff that just related to making
payments

447
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:20,210
and such stuff then I can narrow it down

448
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:23,690
so it's not always necessary to have SAP
all

449
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:29,130
of course if I have a user a pet shop
that caught something way RFC and that

450
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:31,310
but shoppers running with SAP all

451
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:34,490
which is likely fight

452
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:40,950
I'm then I have all the necessary
authorizations so in reality

453
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:45,260
yes I can exploit then technique could
use our calls

454
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:48,530
where you would think that day off

455
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:52,100
only that's a working within the local
system

456
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:55,740
that's the idea behind so yes I will
find high privilege

457
00:30:55,740 --> 00:31:02,740
user cult any more questions

458
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:07,020
if not thank you guys and
