1
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:03,540
okay

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,799
a everyone had a great week this week so
for the

3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:10,830
troopers as blow me away the ipv6 %uh
Mindanao the last two days

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:14,000
the conference has been awesome for me
are appreciate

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,619
the RTR NWT min body me to be here
participate this minute goal for many

6
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:20,170
many years to come to germany

7
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:24,330
and attend troopers so my name is Paul
Kagame

8
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:28,560
from Hans well Obama morning raised a in
the southeast part of the US

9
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,910
up little bit about my background

10
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:36,489
I've gotta degrees in math computer
information systems

11
00:00:36,489 --> 00:00:40,239
security working on a third-degree

12
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:44,230
in systems management systems
engineering love the standard

13
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:46,920
certifications are one house on a Cisco
instructor

14
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,750
but technical background is a networking

15
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:55,149
primarily start out in systems
administration Windows Unix be amassed

16
00:00:55,149 --> 00:00:55,940
like many have you

17
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:59,260
and the No book from majority about lies

18
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:03,500
the twenty years i've been and I T has
been focused own routing and switching

19
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,150
start out in enterprise still spent a
great deal

20
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:12,080
love my time in enterprise networks but
also spent a great deal tommorrow is

21
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,530
in the telco service providers in
critical infrastructure

22
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:19,700
you till the skater things like that I'm
work for dianetics

23
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:23,570
were a 40-year-old aerospace company and
up

24
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:27,770
if you have any questions you wanna
after Virgil's to work on time there's

25
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:28,909
my contact info

26
00:01:28,909 --> 00:01:35,909
so okay I'm Roboto you know I got but
the slides are however very detailed I

27
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,430
have a lot of information on on boat
ride home

28
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:41,600
to read all the details those lies shall
provide you the slides

29
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,570
about a lot to detail in the slot so you
can look at 'em after the conference a

30
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:46,189
study room

31
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:49,450
if there's information in its interest a
few and also provide a great deal

32
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:50,630
references

33
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:54,640
for I learned what I'm presenting today
but so

34
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,740
in networking both

35
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:01,689
offense and defense cuz I played in I do
offense a

36
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:05,250
ethical penetration testing where I get
hired at

37
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,680
to going to test the security of
networks and

38
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:13,690
and implementing security of other
there's a big boredom

39
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:19,050
understanding about how the threat looks
at the network is so I'm gonna focus on

40
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:21,940
how the threat look at the network
infrastructure

41
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:26,090
everyone is little our conversation on
the importance the talk we're gonna have

42
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:28,420
two days about the network or
infrastructure

43
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:31,580
what if the bag as getting to the
routers and switches

44
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:35,480
what can they do where they can they do
to get into your enterprise routers or

45
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,020
switches

46
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:39,050
what can they do if they get into the
telecommunications company

47
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:42,750
routing switching serves about urs the
Clough

48
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:47,120
as everybody calls it I live and work in
the original cloud member when cloud

49
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,540
over busy all drawings

50
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:52,920
are but so we're going spent a great
deal time on that sir

51
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:58,910
when I'm out testing these know works do
an officer defense when I'm looking at

52
00:02:58,910 --> 00:02:59,840
how to

53
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,970
secure when I go in in big into

54
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:06,060
is the trust relationship there's a good
presentation yesterday

55
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,060
about trust relationships we won't
understand

56
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:13,810
those vendors what kinda remote bender
access into the networks

57
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:18,070
are do you have been durst like the was
made yesterday with target

58
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:23,100
is there a ok a bender reseller Supplier

59
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:27,050
that has remote access into that network
or the use and two factor authentication

60
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:28,810
one-time passwords

61
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:33,610
if they're the service provider who's
the billing system vendor

62
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:37,270
what kinda own my own bill paying system
do they have and what are those trust

63
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,090
relationships

64
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:41,620
they work their way from the internet
presence back into the core

65
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:44,080
infrastructure the more sensitive harder
the network

66
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,850
up what kinda remote access to the the
tech staff have

67
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:51,330
you know they're running a junior
persist go while Wayne

68
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:55,230
are brocade work-up network
infrastructure that have protocols

69
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:59,590
verdant very interested in the protocols
so that we can reverse engineer the

70
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:00,180
network

71
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:04,030
and understand the mindset in the
maturity

72
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:07,580
of the technical staff to build that
network because if you can get in

73
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:11,600
if you can get into the head the network
guy who built a network and understand

74
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,970
the technology they implemented

75
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:16,280
or same their use in DWDM whether
brutalizing

76
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,079
optical war is splitting it Landers

77
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:22,970
do they understand advanced technologies
like that IMO specifically

78
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:27,169
dinner in the bottom wanna call you out
to without but we really spend our time

79
00:04:27,169 --> 00:04:31,310
both offense and defense do deserve
maturity of thinking

80
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:35,229
understanding around the control plane
the man's were playing in the data plan

81
00:04:35,229 --> 00:04:37,629
is separating out those three services

82
00:04:37,629 --> 00:04:42,009
the control plane being how the
protocols that the device is used to

83
00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:43,270
communicate to each other

84
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:46,330
it in the management plan how those
devices are managed

85
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:51,250
then of course the data traffic which is
just the user traffic that a is using a

86
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,770
network infrastructure Bobst

87
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:57,599
%uh specifically go after the control
played a management plan

88
00:04:57,599 --> 00:05:00,849
and if I do a good job if I do my
homework

89
00:05:00,849 --> 00:05:03,940
we're were most the time were

90
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:08,909
very successful in goal getting into the
networks by where the measure plane in

91
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:09,949
the control plane

92
00:05:09,949 --> 00:05:13,719
trust relationships what we do is we
take all the information we gather the

93
00:05:13,719 --> 00:05:14,759
understanding we have

94
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:18,849
it will develop an attack Trey if you're
not familiar with the tag trees

95
00:05:18,849 --> 00:05:23,379
I third Bruce doctor Bruce Schneier has
a paper on attack trees it's very old

96
00:05:23,379 --> 00:05:24,729
paper I suggest you go

97
00:05:24,729 --> 00:05:28,949
read it and in and look at that

98
00:05:28,949 --> 00:05:32,620
im and a good tool for drawn-out attack
trees if you wanna go back and do this

99
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,009
in your professional practice

100
00:05:34,009 --> 00:05:37,190
is looking to call X mind it's free for
doin' mind mapping

101
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:40,529
so that you can go and roll out attack
trees and write a strategy

102
00:05:40,529 --> 00:05:44,759
how you believe the thread Rev a ser may
become manager networking if you don't

103
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:45,360
know there's a

104
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,849
a diverse group here today if you're
doing pen testing

105
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:51,949
look at how you might want to go after
the network that your

106
00:05:51,949 --> 00:05:57,139
under a legal contract to spill into
pursue in use at x-man tool to draw out

107
00:05:57,139 --> 00:06:00,310
the attack Trey which one

108
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:04,300
and what we've what we found within
these attack trees if we do a good job

109
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:09,469
do the Intel in building a strategy
would probably partly a packed the

110
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:13,069
network before your broken laptop but
more really or just go all-star

111
00:06:13,069 --> 00:06:16,440
put in our efforts in the defending in
mitigation

112
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,960
because he's attack trees are usually
pretty good based on the intelligence

113
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,680
that we gather

114
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:25,589
in the OC now mention we're going talk
about

115
00:06:25,589 --> 00:06:29,509
work in the bag as due to the routers
and switches in your enterprise in your

116
00:06:29,509 --> 00:06:31,340
service provider

117
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:34,310
what to get things kicked off we gotta
get into the router somehow

118
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:38,050
I one way that we might get into the
router

119
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:42,750
is there's a tool that you can download
a scrip code SNMP blow

120
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:46,760
it maybe you need to modify this new P
mail apps to

121
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:50,950
update i'm for the the equipment that
you have today for what's in the script

122
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:54,550
what happens with SNMP MIB what we can
do

123
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:59,050
is what we find in the industry
specifically in the enterprises

124
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:03,560
is there's a lack of understanding about
how to secure the management plan how

125
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,430
the devices are managed they may have
SNMP turndown

126
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:12,140
to good network monitoring they may have
access-list Don't Tell nervous a lot of

127
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,610
times they were not how

128
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:16,610
the anti spoofing it later to

129
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:19,860
in layer 3 from the from the perimeter

130
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,990
all the way into the edge network lock
down is

131
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:26,260
as surely as shown in the upper right
hand corner here

132
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:29,350
where we have distrusted devise and

133
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:33,360
think about trust devices so your HP
OpenView your solar wayans

134
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,880
I whatever no work you know open-air
mass

135
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,350
would be in your bottom I'm
headquartered there

136
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:43,460
in there's gonna be a trust relationship
to their router

137
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:46,790
it's in that box right above it appear
in right hand corner

138
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:50,210
in its in a may even have an

139
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:54,310
and access-list this specifies that only

140
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:59,390
that thats trusted device that's a open
any MS HP OpenView box

141
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:04,190
it's the only IP address the canticle
they can go in touch that S&P Miller

142
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:08,010
homemade device but our network guy in
this scenario

143
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:12,010
as he moves toward the premature the
network did not able man

144
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:16,200
anti spoofing measures from the from the
internal where'd all the way out to the

145
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:16,950
perimeter

146
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:21,480
and what we can do is we can use a tool
like a sleepy blue

147
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:26,830
because SAP users you TP pockets where
you can park for get you to spa QTP

148
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:28,250
packets down the wire

149
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:31,330
we're going to use SNMP but

150
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:36,160
S&P blow here too scripted a look at the
legal role our own tool with scampi

151
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:41,110
war some other two if we wanted to craft
room package mainland but we're going to

152
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:41,950
use this to cause its

153
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:43,979
this mass in need

154
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:46,809
we're going to spoof the SNMP

155
00:08:46,809 --> 00:08:49,879
the IP address

156
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:55,249
we're going to spend the IP address for
the network server and recall specify in

157
00:08:55,249 --> 00:08:56,110
this group

158
00:08:56,110 --> 00:09:00,350
the IP address for the router in because
we've been doing our homework on this

159
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:01,339
organization

160
00:09:01,339 --> 00:09:05,360
we're going develop a custom dictionary
with that organization

161
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,379
and all you had to do this custom
dictionary works

162
00:09:08,379 --> 00:09:11,980
you get in the head at the network are
you going to get into the social media

163
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,619
found a reason to start racked

164
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:16,629
he's in the Star Wars is in the Greek
mythology

165
00:09:16,629 --> 00:09:21,869
things of that nature develop a a a
custom dictionary for the organization

166
00:09:21,869 --> 00:09:24,999
impeded into the script enable run

167
00:09:24,999 --> 00:09:30,079
until it guesses the creek SAP community
stream when a Pond's the correct one

168
00:09:30,079 --> 00:09:34,899
it will download the router or switch is
configuration so that you can go in gray

169
00:09:34,899 --> 00:09:35,319
rather

170
00:09:35,319 --> 00:09:38,459
username passwords in a browning

171
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:42,119
information you get all the Intel that's
on their router

172
00:09:42,119 --> 00:09:44,739
in them because you know what you've
guessed the creek a sleepy community

173
00:09:44,739 --> 00:09:46,879
string then you can go a blow to New can
take

174
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:49,920
you've taken over the network abuse this

175
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,899
this works now

176
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:59,199
we've got into the enterprise router on
the internal network

177
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:03,610
now missus coca a drink Cisco kool aid
that's what I know so my examples are

178
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:04,619
gonna be around just give

179
00:10:04,619 --> 00:10:07,860
you can I take in these examples

180
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:11,399
for how you might use them some relief
for juniper brocade excedrin

181
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:14,850
appreciate future that information would
because thats looks at I'm

182
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:19,209
under the Cisco so that's where we're
going talk about the scenarios here

183
00:10:19,209 --> 00:10:23,040
on specially on the inner process will
be forced the soup Cisco specific for

184
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,049
broken into

185
00:10:24,049 --> 00:10:29,629
a layer 3 switch router instantly core
enterprise network

186
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:33,259
what can you do with that into work with
a lot of pain testings

187
00:10:33,259 --> 00:10:36,600
in their pop in boxes are running
Metasploit

188
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,819
you they get the techno music going

189
00:10:39,819 --> 00:10:43,100
began to blare their poppin shales let
the route with Metasploit

190
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:47,160
when those boxes are getting knocked
down left and right

191
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:51,600
the your router configs up on some kinda
router switch configs on a file server

192
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,740
get into a network guy has a computer

193
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,959
they log into the computer into the
router login to the switch to get

194
00:10:57,959 --> 00:10:58,920
screenshots

195
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,980
and that's as far as it goes drives me
nuts been there were gone

196
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:07,660
there's a whole lot you we can do with
those routers and switches because what

197
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:08,230
if

198
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:11,890
what if you've got access maybe you have
only read access through some

199
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:16,310
some web server you can onto
tractor-trailers who in you can only

200
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:18,680
refile so maybe you can read a router
switch compile

201
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:22,269
convict but tremendous blow out your
core impact your campus

202
00:11:22,269 --> 00:11:25,600
you don't have a day 0 ne those things
are working

203
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:32,290
but you have a router can pick workers
in things you could do the capability

204
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:35,350
with the Cisco routers their law you
guys know about doing the

205
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:39,310
you know the old cheesy Cain and Abel at
work out maybe the military-backed

206
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:42,360
week ago in use route maps

207
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,820
in and override the routing table for
example

208
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:50,630
instead of doing just the layer 2 inside
the Beale and

209
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:55,040
men in the military 1 I'll use route
mounts basically policy routing

210
00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:00,480
to override the routing table airport's
traffic to traverse the way we want to

211
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,079
based

212
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:04,500
own criteria that we specify use an
access control list

213
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,450
I like a firewall filter if you're not
familiar with them specify the traffic

214
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:09,610
that is a bit rich to us

215
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:14,250
override the routing table include and
then be able to do and layered remain in

216
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:14,800
the military

217
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,750
like in John B lands so that we can
influence the network

218
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:22,329
another thing that we might do is

219
00:12:22,329 --> 00:12:26,560
specify the traffic that is a bit rich
tourists Mike most

220
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,470
enterprise networks all than if
monitoring is in place so they got

221
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:31,459
security on them

222
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:35,649
a or whatever you know your favorite
vendor security solutions lot of its

223
00:12:35,649 --> 00:12:37,410
gonna be at the printer to the network

224
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:41,459
in we expect them to be looking maybe
they're doing egress filtering in their

225
00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:42,630
monitor egress

226
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:46,850
they got it going on this margus or what
but I use route mouse

227
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:51,089
to force traffic out a back door
connections the other 3g/4g modem

228
00:12:51,089 --> 00:12:55,079
then I at the same time

229
00:12:55,079 --> 00:12:58,290
if you if you're dealing with someone
its more advanced

230
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:01,610
if you have a more advanced Eva sir

231
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:06,220
it could be that they want to go and
modify your permit a router were your

232
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:09,390
were you might have a multiple internet
connections

233
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:13,940
is specified traffic that is a bit rich
to take a path out a specific service

234
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,800
provider were they may have more
influence

235
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:20,890
that's something else with you might do
typically involve an enterprise contest

236
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:24,900
our rules of engagement remember
typically I border force traffic out a

237
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,620
back door

238
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:28,710
or maybe do the late remained middle
because to do the

239
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:32,240
to do this scenario at the top we would
also have to how the service about her

240
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,220
under contract and B&B do in a ping test
against their

241
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:38,900
and it's usually not the case this is
something I want to think about

242
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:42,400
mob

243
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:46,020
mother scenario this is pretty old
school if you haven't seen this you need

244
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:49,400
to be aware of it because I love the pen
test teams are not aware that no one

245
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,480
uses defenders

246
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,620
to be aware this because the bad guys
they know about this

247
00:13:55,620 --> 00:14:00,490
you can take a if you've been in the
routing world very long

248
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:04,970
bike when I got in ball with routing we
had AppleTalk up here

249
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:08,710
six dead man had lapsed Xmas

250
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:12,710
man would buy me we had the ABC's

251
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:17,440
protocols regular network in if you were
to get traffic across a wide area

252
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,300
network you didn't wanna run every
routing protocol for

253
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,840
every for all for all the different
routed protocols

254
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,580
you could go and run it you can go on
building up in that wide area network it

255
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:28,950
all with GRE

256
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:32,680
with it so happens I just told you about
rat mouse where we can override the

257
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,600
routing table

258
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,570
in we can force traffic to traverse the
the path we wanted to

259
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:41,820
well we could go and build a GRE tunnel
if we have access to the router

260
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:45,620
build a gr8 all out to a router that we
own out on the internet somewhere

261
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:51,240
in the end user route maps forced the
traffic that is %uh ventures to us that

262
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,180
we define use an access list

263
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:57,150
just looks like dis like a bar will
filter force that traffic using the

264
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:58,030
route map

265
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:03,180
over the jury tonal out to the internet
and then we can sniff it

266
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:10,180
across the wide area network

267
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,180
if you're if you're not aware they're
securing the enterprise

268
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:16,950
in you're not aware of another
capability that's built into Cisco

269
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,960
you'll have to go to a heart on the
router

270
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:23,260
is you could use your span imports
traffic out you know it wouldn't work

271
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:26,910
love the enterprises I go into the
network guys are familiar with new span

272
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:30,900
where they can report nearing a local
switch in doing our Spain where they can

273
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:31,460
mirror

274
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:34,620
switch the switch whether the feature
called Dr span

275
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:37,640
where you can me route to an IP address

276
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:42,060
now if you have a B lawn that has got a
great deal a traffic this is public only

277
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:46,000
in at the Dumont bring your going to get
busted but you go to a network you find

278
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,950
yourself with access it's not real busy

279
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:53,250
you wanna pump your next bill traffic
you could use ER span

280
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:56,160
the switches and the third that their
Cisco shop they're gonna have the

281
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,070
feature set most likely on the switches

282
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:01,170
in you could due to go set up import
mere

283
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:05,440
usually are Spain in me route to an IP
address that you said about him say

284
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,590
maybe at Amazon

285
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:13,590
a out on the web in a capture traffic

286
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:22,150
something I I came across be many many
years ago

287
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:28,770
when I first got started in routing had
a big customer project where we were

288
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:33,100
do in a deal SW by sleeves as an AI had
the network a

289
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:36,890
as/400 with the IBM controllers the page
494 controllers

290
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:40,600
weird will there be room a green screen

291
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:45,860
terminals the remote sites they would go
back get aggregated back to an as/400 at

292
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,060
the circle hopes up

293
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:50,310
and so I had to go to learn this
technique I'll deal SW

294
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:53,800
or we could take bridge protocols like
nearby miles

295
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,210
s in a s deal see which is a serial
protocol

296
00:16:57,210 --> 00:17:00,660
the that the talks the router talks to

297
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:04,490
the the controller that enables the
green screen capability

298
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:08,030
that's a steal Supergirl week you to
learn to total that

299
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:12,850
using deal SW over an IP network and I
started digging into it and discovered

300
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:16,190
because it's bridging use it in the
bottom I'm term

301
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:21,100
turning on bridging well the RC's are
specified that they want they intend for

302
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,060
you to go on Usenet miles an S&I

303
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:26,520
but with the routers me know cross the
router gonna

304
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,680
return on bridging the rules or

305
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:34,440
if you turn on routing for the protocol
the protocols gone be routed

306
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,430
even if you turn on bridging its gotta
make a decision so

307
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:41,840
your fraternal routing for protocol it's
gonna be routed

308
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:46,400
if you turn on bridging n brown it the
protocols now routed it's gonna be

309
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,100
bridged

310
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:50,560
well here we go bridging turned also the
app he's gonna be routed in anything

311
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,300
else will be bridged and I discovered
you could

312
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:56,300
you can get out the v6 across the
network approved isn't allowed

313
00:17:56,300 --> 00:18:00,270
that I could get up BB 6 across a router
network using the list W

314
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:04,300
but was pretty cool my thing is that
what what I want you to stand as I

315
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,540
on of your watch though david Kerr doing
kung fu movies

316
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:11,570
a what are the lessons a what time more
the lessons

317
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:15,260
master con esta grasshopper David
Garrity

318
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,540
was you know there is a scenario where
they got robin is like what did you

319
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:19,450
learn is like

320
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:22,810
I learned to expect the unexpected I
want you

321
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:26,990
to learn to expect the unexpected nobody
will

322
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:30,740
wouldn't you read if you're up by and I
got a lot of making customers are still

323
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:31,380
have a

324
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:35,420
IBM their works they have this code
who's to say that someone would not get

325
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,400
into their routers

326
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,000
in bill the say do a deal SW Tomintoul
I'll their network

327
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,740
get do that egress filtering I can
guarantee you object

328
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:48,440
the next network a break into worse is
that the rules of engagement

329
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:51,980
to do this on a book deal SW tunnel
right out there farwell

330
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:56,660
they don't do egress filtering to show
how this guy were I think it'll be cool

331
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,660
my brakes lights

332
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:04,190
a up so our camera discovered the l2tp
b3 protocol because I do agree

333
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:09,040
because of the work we do with service
providers it what they'll 2tb v3 Porter

334
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:09,860
Cole does

335
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:14,720
is allows you to type a router in build
will be called a pseudowire

336
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,380
where you can log drag and drop a
logical wire from one

337
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:22,900
the land across a wide area network with
a richer profit wide area network or the

338
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:23,920
global Internet

339
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:27,720
in you can drag and drop a lot virtual

340
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:33,130
internet connection or crossed the clout
private cloud public cloud what have you

341
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:38,960
in connect a couple be lands but think
about that

342
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:43,010
think about all if somebody gets into
your enterprise router

343
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:48,410
you probably have the feature set if you
don't somebody has access to the router

344
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:52,010
ask yourself would you know if they

345
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:56,660
uploaded new code to get enable some %uh
the capabilities like

346
00:19:56,660 --> 00:20:00,590
the l2tp the three a smothers will talk
about do you have the configuration

347
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:01,280
monitoring

348
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,059
to know that the company was changed
that it was you know it wasn't just an

349
00:20:05,059 --> 00:20:09,140
accidental reboot there was a small
opens new code on the box

350
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:15,040
so we can go and enable this pseudowire
here this l2tp the three of them would

351
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,350
break into somebody's router

352
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:20,830
in think about all the layer to attacks
that you could do their

353
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:24,070
Urbanek a who is here a

354
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:27,790
earlier in the week that the ipv6 summit

355
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:31,320
he wrote a book own lands which secured
what hackers know about your network

356
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,290
that you don't

357
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:37,150
read that book is purely or to even when
he goes it shows you

358
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:42,260
but the bag as No in how to mitigate it
what all those layer 2 protocol attacks

359
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:45,870
we could possibly go do across the wide
area network

360
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:49,850
in everyone is looking for those attacks
all that movie

361
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:53,110
all the stuff that you might do the two
call your senior for example

362
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:56,150
you're looking for locally but what can
we do to cross the water in their work

363
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:57,690
which is connected to the lands

364
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:01,410
now

365
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:06,750
lawful intercept that's another feature
that may or may not be in your router's

366
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,450
it's gonna be in your router's if you're

367
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:15,340
in a service provider cloud environment
public cloud because the government is

368
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,350
going to need to be able when law
enforcement

369
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:21,809
needs to per dual art Apple someone it's
under

370
00:21:21,809 --> 00:21:25,150
suspicion in the US they will come

371
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:28,730
law enforcement will come to the telco
service provider with the warrant

372
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:31,929
is there we've gotta go and get this
information

373
00:21:31,929 --> 00:21:35,330
nope about the paperwork to show that
they've been to a judge

374
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:39,000
in there been authorized to do and IP
based wiretap

375
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,020
if they do not have the capability

376
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:46,169
in the public while the way and the
telecommunications clout

377
00:21:46,169 --> 00:21:49,380
is like a ten thousand dollar they fun

378
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:52,700
in the US I don't know what it is in
other parts of the world in US like ten

379
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,150
thousand dollar for today's

380
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:57,340
for every day that they cannot provide
this capability

381
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:02,160
if min the case over the Cisco routers

382
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:05,280
your other routers other network
infrastructures in the

383
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,669
public way in public good data center
cloud

384
00:22:08,669 --> 00:22:12,440
they're going how the surface structure
in place but this is 11 the

385
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:15,590
architects representation of how Cisco
does nears the references

386
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:19,299
and basically what will happen with
lawful intercept is the paperwork gets

387
00:22:19,299 --> 00:22:19,960
served

388
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:25,200
in there's communication that is a bit
rich to law enforcement is a

389
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,240
the be a.m. beer communicating a copy
other

390
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:32,620
all up a copy of that traffic is gonna
be going to

391
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:37,169
law enforcement all other traffic this
happening wind up getting for detail

392
00:22:37,169 --> 00:22:41,980
that's how it went into work what if

393
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:44,169
what if

394
00:22:44,169 --> 00:22:46,649
or someone breaks into your enterprise
router

395
00:22:46,649 --> 00:22:49,940
you got the memory you got the resources

396
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:55,700
maybe you had the feature set loaded on
your equipment why can I not turn their

397
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:58,899
own and use that for my purposes as a
way to sniff traffic

398
00:22:58,899 --> 00:23:02,460
across the water you know word and get a
copier the

399
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:05,929
your traffic yellow or orange it as
defenders

400
00:23:05,929 --> 00:23:09,610
it well if you're an enterprise
environment would you

401
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:13,409
would you detect that would you detect
somebody modifying configuring your

402
00:23:13,409 --> 00:23:14,399
router for you

403
00:23:14,399 --> 00:23:17,539
do you have a configuration management
in place is automated

404
00:23:17,539 --> 00:23:21,190
I'll Yvonne spoke just yesterday believe
was

405
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:25,779
a about automating security do you have
network monitoring and automation to

406
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:26,649
alert you

407
00:23:26,649 --> 00:23:30,330
when something happens that equipment is
someone was the golden able this

408
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:34,539
now what are they turned it all for you
didn't get notifications

409
00:23:34,539 --> 00:23:38,889
up at at these poor the network you
wanna get

410
00:23:38,889 --> 00:23:42,340
but I would with visualization and
instrumentation on your network so that

411
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:43,289
you can see

412
00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:46,929
new traffic patterns that are abnormal

413
00:23:46,929 --> 00:23:50,480
egress in in moving towards all in
Berkeley your network

414
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,220
the case somebody starts doing these
things and they start turning off your

415
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:55,239
ass a configuration management features

416
00:23:55,239 --> 00:23:59,879
you gotta have visibility lead layers it
on the network in case something like

417
00:23:59,879 --> 00:24:00,509
this has happened

418
00:24:00,509 --> 00:24:04,210
so there's no reason that we cannot go
on hike the router in turn around and do

419
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:05,109
the whole

420
00:24:05,109 --> 00:24:08,799
packet capture were were talking to

421
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:13,080
to the side so we need to be talking to
across a wide area network across the

422
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,129
Internet in a perfect copy of the senate

423
00:24:15,129 --> 00:24:22,129
to our system so that we can be. making
copies over

424
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:31,550
it this mood spurred this scenario
speaks to

425
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:35,570
much this is a busy charred you to look
at all linus but this one really speaks

426
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:37,700
that whole security by obscurity

427
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:41,070
how many times you go in the network's

428
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:45,190
is in in there is major bone abilities

429
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:48,910
that you discover may be doing the
internal testing but

430
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:53,630
but you're told well we have mitigation
there's architectural architecture

431
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:54,990
mitigations in place

432
00:24:54,990 --> 00:25:00,390
to certain very well here's how here's
while here's why a sad love these

433
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:05,210
problems we found are not getting fixed
with order to architecture mitigation

434
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:09,450
you can if the you gotta get outta the
box with are thinking we were testing

435
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:10,190
the system's

436
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:13,230
in this scenario here we have a

437
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:16,480
a cable company bed

438
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,850
over here on the Rotten they have a
heady and basically in the cable

439
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:20,440
industry

440
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:24,059
the Calder data center a heady and in
the telco world

441
00:25:24,059 --> 00:25:28,960
the call the central office over on the
right we have a cable company that has

442
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:34,470
a heady in where they have all their
computer network equipment in they've

443
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:35,480
outsourced

444
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:39,880
to a cloud provider the

445
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:43,050
IPTV the cable TV streams know they have
a

446
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:47,190
are up the poll the local or channels in
but all the digital IP

447
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:51,370
all the channels all the sports editor
they pulled from the upstream provider

448
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:52,490
who can do it cheaper

449
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:56,200
quicken easier in the stream that in
over a high-speed link

450
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:00,350
using multicast the provider since it
out not only one bourbon one customer

451
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,490
but numerous customers

452
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:04,500
it here at this local head in what they
done

453
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:08,890
is on the servers because the way
multicast works

454
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:12,470
there is its capability call rib Ripper
reverse path forwarding

455
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:17,610
were the multicast has 4 to be forded
out

456
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:20,960
to the home networks here

457
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,710
the servers here on the right are going
to pull a multicast stream from this

458
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:27,900
cloud provider appear in the upper left
hand corner

459
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:32,580
in poor those servers to push them all
to cast out that heady and router out

460
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:33,520
toward those homes

461
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:38,530
it's got the traffic is got to obey the
river's path four groups which is part

462
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:41,520
of their architecture mitigation because
what happens here with this

463
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:46,050
servers a lot times but a build these
networks you get something put in place

464
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:50,540
nobody touches it because they paid the
vendors a great deal of money to put it

465
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:51,230
in place

466
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:56,540
it doesn't get patched a dozen nobody
touches it until somebody dies

467
00:26:56,540 --> 00:27:00,820
retires or there's a whole nother reno
service upgrade with

468
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:04,690
we don't touch that mean gonna brayton a
great the enterprise but you don't touch

469
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:06,040
that part of the network

470
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:10,210
you know most people's cable TV right so
those are small boxes

471
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:13,600
the target don't get patched may be
small so where's boxes

472
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,020
with all the problems with the with the
without

473
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:20,300
a in there going form the river's path
for true

474
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:24,270
they're going how their default route
pointed back toward the cloud because

475
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:27,540
that's the only way that multicast
before the traffic out to the homes

476
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:31,150
is so they have an architectural
mitigation is somebody tries to go

477
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:35,070
a break into the network they can't get
a two-way connection so we test this

478
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:35,710
network

479
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:39,180
we break into the router we will win in
their head Ian

480
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:42,640
we can get there what do we do so what
we discover

481
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,690
is we can log into the router it will
start looking at the our table

482
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:50,960
we see all those host bike there in the
central locking in the heady in

483
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,850
all here on the right but week a pink
and we can I get a two-way

484
00:27:54,850 --> 00:27:58,400
connection which CEO these devices from
my head in router that we've hiked

485
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:02,320
turns out that you can enable Matt

486
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:06,610
you can set up Matt in even though the
default route

487
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:09,700
all those servers point back to the

488
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:13,430
the clout internal net in the router
will proxy the connections

489
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:16,590
so you can get a two-way connection and
then you can go on break out your

490
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:18,930
medicine Lord whatever tools you will
use

491
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:24,480
to go hit those systems again I goes
back to me have been configuration

492
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,210
monitoring

493
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:28,430
in locking down the management plane
because they do not like down the

494
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:31,060
management plane in the case with its
head in route we're able to take that

495
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:31,860
router over

496
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:37,770
pretty much anywhere are

497
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:43,790
were a plugin to test were OSPF has beer
run

498
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:48,799
always Pierre is any other protocol year
juror p

499
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:53,909
in the networks %uh plug into its always
a %eh European or spear for the internal

500
00:28:53,909 --> 00:28:54,460
routing

501
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:59,799
let you do do see some with real this
very rare but you do see sry about their

502
00:28:59,799 --> 00:29:04,039
in a very large source about a juicy
is-is but typically would you go see is

503
00:29:04,039 --> 00:29:05,729
%eh European OSPF

504
00:29:05,729 --> 00:29:09,299
in the enterprise space it never fails
for me

505
00:29:09,299 --> 00:29:12,690
that I've never see those protocols me
as a cure-all go do you pull up bar

506
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:13,950
sharp TCP down

507
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:18,059
you seem to be a multicast that Anwar
though there's not another router to

508
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:18,909
talk to you

509
00:29:18,909 --> 00:29:23,659
it's been spewed out there so all the
host can see that traffic

510
00:29:23,659 --> 00:29:27,119
know what's going on with OSPF

511
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:30,989
is how that works in case you're not
been two routers

512
00:29:30,989 --> 00:29:35,179
is with with those P ok we largely break
up the organization everywhere is PF

513
00:29:35,179 --> 00:29:36,440
network is going how

514
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:40,219
in area 0 if you have a really large
enterprise network

515
00:29:40,219 --> 00:29:43,539
you're going to break it up logically is
segmented with

516
00:29:43,539 --> 00:29:46,599
so bears but every areas got a touch
area 0

517
00:29:46,599 --> 00:29:49,669
in that helps us manage the routing you
keep the

518
00:29:49,669 --> 00:29:54,479
keep the routing table smaller we can do
aggregation about he addresses

519
00:29:54,479 --> 00:29:58,399
in the in goal there is to lower the CPU
load

520
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:01,649
Inc a special if you have links with her
misbehavin

521
00:30:01,649 --> 00:30:04,879
the routing tables will not be having to
retype lead all the time because you

522
00:30:04,879 --> 00:30:06,159
segment in the network all

523
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:09,539
so that's what's happening then you
gotta and with the call an autonomous

524
00:30:09,539 --> 00:30:13,039
system border router Naseby or the burn
the top left will talk to

525
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:18,149
your BGP your other providers all the
network and then the

526
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:21,409
the routers that power the different
areas together this culture

527
00:30:21,409 --> 00:30:24,899
area border routers when you go out from
areas your order one that would be your

528
00:30:24,899 --> 00:30:29,169
area border router but but what's going
to happen there's a mission your goal

529
00:30:29,169 --> 00:30:32,729
pull up bar shark undergo co.'s Pierre
Trudeau's he add your P

530
00:30:32,729 --> 00:30:35,899
too small to cast doubt their own them
out there in the land

531
00:30:35,899 --> 00:30:40,950
there is a huge opportunity

532
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:45,070
im every time I go into enterprise
network is running routing protocols

533
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:48,739
with uncertain if it's not a
small-medium business they got the

534
00:30:48,739 --> 00:30:51,960
routing protocols go in they have the
the turf pluck them out in the land then

535
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,139
they should even be there in most of the
cases

536
00:30:54,139 --> 00:30:57,000
and if if the

537
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,270
if they have a indication turned on that
indication is clear text even though in

538
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:02,600
the five is an option

539
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:07,170
there's a the no authentication clear
tech certification or md5

540
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:11,190
in the networks are always clear text or
no authentication

541
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:14,440
which enables a great deal a vector
years

542
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,900
they're just low hanging fruit for the
pen test team that comes in the test and

543
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:18,400
there were

544
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:24,110
the is so what can they do with that
both you could go and

545
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:29,360
go up by your router of the e-bay and a
fired-up older network

546
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:33,330
or go download some code in fired up in
GS in three

547
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:36,620
donna mills maybe if you have your

548
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:40,730
if you ever heard of the the Naval
Research Lab court ruled there's and I i

549
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:45,550
a tool called core that you can download
from the Naval Research Lab

550
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:48,910
the network simulator to basically fires
a bunch a qualquer routers

551
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:52,500
you could go in blow up with you know
real core

552
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:55,650
want to get this you could take a stand
that network emulator simulation

553
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:58,230
environment bothered up in a VM

554
00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:02,510
that you can download of their website
blow up a really big network really

555
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:03,960
complex nowhere

556
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:07,930
in start feeding routes into the network

557
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:11,350
and start introducing

558
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:15,030
interesting IP addresses into their
network you go let your imagination run

559
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:15,470
a

560
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:20,580
the IP addresses that you could go start
advertising introduced me to the network

561
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:25,050
mister shortened shown up in their logs
as as the source of the tax

562
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:28,670
maybe you do everybody wants to talk
about nation-state

563
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:32,610
wanna go in building the as a pseudo
network

564
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:35,870
in a virtual environment join their OSPF
domain

565
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:38,800
and make them think that they got a
nation-state a traditional routes into

566
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,560
their network

567
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:42,980
in filling up their logs your son or
local only in size

568
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:46,360
you're coming over there you know
committed over wireless your own

569
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:49,740
your local be land and I think they're
under

570
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:53,490
nation-state attack the

571
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:56,810
in out as a result of that you could
also because you can interact with the

572
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:57,640
OSPF

573
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:01,900
protocol that is the being dropped into
that stuff network into that the lamb

574
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:04,929
you can also do maintain a military X

575
00:33:04,929 --> 00:33:07,960
you could go in it you could introduce
many in the military possible

576
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:12,530
or you could just go win a I like a
router have a higher per for its

577
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:16,720
is your boobs which we a lower cost for
the routes

578
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,400
and maybe just drop it on drop it in the
bitbucket

579
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:24,070
and do a denial-of-service your limited
butter and upper right hand corner I've

580
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:26,750
got a bunch tools listed to give you
some ideas would

581
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:29,909
a so how easy it would be to do this

582
00:33:29,909 --> 00:33:36,909
BGP is anybody not heard about all the
BGP hijacking is going on

583
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:43,390
you there's a lot of accidental convicts
happening

584
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:46,539
I I would look at the

585
00:33:46,539 --> 00:33:50,610
I would look at the accidental configs
is if the traffic that's being

586
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:56,600
hijacked burden using BGP if it's
resulting in a denial service words

587
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,460
being dropped

588
00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:03,740
it's probably accidental if it's getting
hijacked an imported back out it's

589
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:06,260
probably a man in a mill is probably an
intentional tak

590
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:09,889
here's how we look with BGP

591
00:34:09,889 --> 00:34:13,190
you can you break up the network into a
Thomas's number you go

592
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:16,720
richer in europe you go to rock in the
US you go to Aaron

593
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:21,419
if you're in South America South Central
America care baby may go to lag Nick

594
00:34:21,419 --> 00:34:25,470
were in the asia-pacific you go to a

595
00:34:25,470 --> 00:34:28,550
a pretty tough to get that win but

596
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:32,080
you go to those organizations a handout
IP addresses they also hand out to be

597
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,330
GPAs numbers

598
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:37,330
the largely define an organization even
if you're not running BGP

599
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:41,679
whoever's running providing Internet
services for you is running BGP and

600
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,450
advertising your network drew addresses
that you are wrong

601
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:48,399
all your behalf out to the global
Internet you know someone

602
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:51,869
accidentally or has taken specific
interest in you

603
00:34:51,869 --> 00:34:55,609
there's an implicit trust relationship
across the global Internet

604
00:34:55,609 --> 00:34:58,830
somebody could start advertising your IP
space

605
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:02,010
as there's in DC over on the right the

606
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:05,369
green arrows were you have traffic that
is intense we talk to each other

607
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:09,800
also appear in the upper left-hand
corner a s5 start ever posner nets with

608
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,430
a kiss swing traffic over

609
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:16,170
they could influence traffic in certain
parts of the world to swing over to a

610
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:17,289
aspire

611
00:35:17,289 --> 00:35:21,539
and then they can go set up a global man
in the military against you

612
00:35:21,539 --> 00:35:26,289
the same in have the same our results as
you would if you were in the local be

613
00:35:26,289 --> 00:35:27,559
later running at work out

614
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:30,710
but on a global world from gooden a

615
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:34,250
accomplish that I have not seen the a US
number hijacking

616
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:38,430
combined with IP address hijacking but
that could happen as well worst but not

617
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:40,019
only hijack your IP addresses

618
00:35:40,019 --> 00:35:43,420
they introduce your a S number that's
directly possible

619
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:47,579
and what happens when is you know the
long locust IP prefixes gone when when

620
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:49,720
it comes to the router whoever's get the
most Pacific

621
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:53,519
our routes they're going to win now

622
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:57,259
be a some the people who are doing this
spammers

623
00:35:57,259 --> 00:36:00,369
there's lot others a a good paper says

624
00:36:00,369 --> 00:36:04,829
Cisco wrote one block south on Cisco's
website about how the spammers are

625
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:08,019
do BGP hijacking is an enterprises are

626
00:36:08,019 --> 00:36:11,869
are coming to drop your address space is
getting blacklisted work I'll spammers

627
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:13,920
are hijacking the space to introduce
email

628
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:20,180
you may have done nothing so

629
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:24,210
this is something that you enterprises
if you're a large enterprise we have a

630
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:26,980
lot to your network in your going in
polling private

631
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:31,970
network services from your upstream
provider you do like the MP last

632
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:37,410
type services whoever's doing this BGP
hijacking especially if you're an

633
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:40,549
international enterprise were you have
sites around the world

634
00:36:40,549 --> 00:36:44,720
it if if the BJP has been hijacked

635
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:48,930
understand that whoever he has access to
the BGP routers

636
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:53,309
they have access to the MPLS routers as
well a build those networks

637
00:36:53,309 --> 00:36:57,950
we sell routers about the size that door
a column B A farr's big breaking routers

638
00:36:57,950 --> 00:37:01,390
it was happening in your data center
where your

639
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:05,640
virtualize your servers is happening in
the cloud as well we're birch laws in

640
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,700
the routers were we

641
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:10,009
week or about the routers virtually with
the MPLS

642
00:37:10,009 --> 00:37:13,089
in cell and sell their router over and
over and over again

643
00:37:13,089 --> 00:37:18,099
in in one of the services that are
beyond that single router

644
00:37:18,099 --> 00:37:21,130
is BGP along with all the profit

645
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:27,670
in pls circuits here's what I want just
a news when the sales person comes and

646
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:28,369
talks to you

647
00:37:28,369 --> 00:37:29,970
they're going probably offer you

648
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:34,170
you're probably already bought and
imperialist BP and virtual private

649
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:34,900
network

650
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:39,000
many people believe an important that im
that BP in

651
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,200
implies encryption no

652
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:46,369
Bieber are our nomenclature are words
have been hijacked by the marketing

653
00:37:46,369 --> 00:37:47,040
people

654
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:51,020
your be land is a virtual private
network if you're old never been in

655
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:53,700
there working long enough X dot 25 at
the

656
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:57,240
airlines used to use a lot frame-relay

657
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:02,970
Atum that is all BP ends it's not
encrypt it into you go and apply

658
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:04,320
encryption to it

659
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:09,200
but we all going my love the in
enterprises

660
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:13,720
were sold in MPLS VPN and we we assume
that it's a go

661
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:17,349
in crib a connection but as for is the
furthest thing from the truth

662
00:38:17,349 --> 00:38:20,430
is a real person to go show you this in
more detail

663
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:23,780
so the appeal asked us to give an
overview if you're not familiar with the

664
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:24,520
MPLS

665
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:29,530
MPLS birds at layer 2.5 a deal with some
model

666
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:34,570
there's a share make it split between
the data link layer in the network layer

667
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:40,260
in you have labels is dead over you at
layer 2 you're doing switching based on

668
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:41,230
Mac addresses

669
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:45,010
any layer 3 you're forming based on IP
addresses will

670
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:49,730
with the MPLS were doing reporting based
on labels is so you have a VPN label you

671
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:51,260
have a traffic engineering label

672
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:55,400
what I want you to take away from this
chart is someone in the in the cloud in

673
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,440
the telco clout

674
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:00,589
starts doing this BGP hijacking your
running MPLS services across it

675
00:39:00,589 --> 00:39:05,000
I'm going to own layer 2.5

676
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:10,160
North everything if it's not encrypt it
the whole stack is your arm

677
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:13,260
whoever's doing its gonna be the
influence in read

678
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:17,000
your information now from a pick-up
stamp on a muggle read this peak at

679
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,869
review the slides will be available

680
00:39:18,869 --> 00:39:22,609
you know what you had to reference but
what I want you see here is a

681
00:39:22,609 --> 00:39:25,760
between the Ethernet frame in the IP
header

682
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:30,099
is we're the MPLS label has been
injected that's what I gots

683
00:39:30,099 --> 00:39:34,099
in the block their in New concede three
different MPLS labels

684
00:39:34,099 --> 00:39:36,839
you get the label

685
00:39:36,839 --> 00:39:40,640
where for the core infrastructure
stalking in the you got traffic engineer

686
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,999
traffic engineering labeling you also
have the

687
00:39:42,999 --> 00:39:49,999
MPLS VPN label represented their they
appeal as how does this all work

688
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:55,709
to get you educated about him pls which
you are

689
00:39:55,709 --> 00:39:58,779
but your the Turner Prize which research
about or may have not told you

690
00:39:58,779 --> 00:40:02,160
here's how the architecture's going to
work in the

691
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:06,009
in the core the know we're we have these
be a farce become Pino's

692
00:40:06,009 --> 00:40:09,670
were two speeds and these were 14
traffic as fast as we can

693
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:13,799
then at the edge we happy nodes provider
edge

694
00:40:13,799 --> 00:40:16,929
routers and the role does big

695
00:40:16,929 --> 00:40:21,049
big routers big juniper brocade Cisco
whatever your

696
00:40:21,049 --> 00:40:24,429
vendor kool aid is agar in those PE
routers

697
00:40:24,429 --> 00:40:28,119
the provider edge routers the crowd lots
a bitter faces that were there but

698
00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:28,400
they're

699
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:33,099
aggregating lotsa lotsa customers in and
it does provide a red routers at Werder

700
00:40:33,099 --> 00:40:34,140
BGP

701
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:38,809
is coming in your may be at your local
regional ISP that your ball

702
00:40:38,809 --> 00:40:42,160
pollen services from are your your

703
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:47,029
if your retail business all of your
retail offices are going maybe be that

704
00:40:47,029 --> 00:40:47,920
are due in MPLS

705
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:52,359
they're going to get aggregated to
provide a ridge routers in there now to

706
00:40:52,359 --> 00:40:53,049
the age

707
00:40:53,049 --> 00:40:58,039
you'd have your juror local BP ins in
with the MPLS you cannot duplicate IP

708
00:40:58,039 --> 00:41:01,039
addresses because their buyers will have
a BP and they're going to be

709
00:41:01,039 --> 00:41:05,029
segment of in and carved out in there
how their own

710
00:41:05,029 --> 00:41:08,029
virtual routing table on a p/e device

711
00:41:08,029 --> 00:41:11,729
everybody's gonna be segmented of it
what I want you to get here

712
00:41:11,729 --> 00:41:15,179
is your in hurting again going back to
that talk yesterday a brown trust

713
00:41:15,179 --> 00:41:19,119
relationships you're inheriting a trust
relationship with the clout

714
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:22,279
with the telco clout at that PE router

715
00:41:22,279 --> 00:41:25,769
you have to trust that guy is not gonna
factory your

716
00:41:25,769 --> 00:41:30,179
in accidentally introduce somebody
else's network into your networker your

717
00:41:30,179 --> 00:41:31,670
network into somebody else's

718
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:35,229
bleed routes asymmetrically or some at
Wrigley

719
00:41:35,229 --> 00:41:41,289
it that no work

720
00:41:41,289 --> 00:41:43,450
in in the only way to protect yourself

721
00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:47,720
there's that bombs they made their
encryption is your night been crypt in

722
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:48,430
your own traffic

723
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:51,970
in don't let the telco provider the
encryption and the appeal is BP in

724
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:55,349
Lee soho trust relationship there

725
00:41:55,349 --> 00:42:01,009
if to so here's what the router config
looks like if you haven't seen it before

726
00:42:01,009 --> 00:42:04,859
but this real quick I got to customer BP
is defined

727
00:42:04,859 --> 00:42:08,049
with the first the second one at the top
what's been new

728
00:42:08,049 --> 00:42:11,900
declared urs a row descriptor that's
where you're too fun

729
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:15,799
the reason that Rd their their route
description the to dove

730
00:42:15,799 --> 00:42:18,869
to identify the BPN with at birth

731
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:22,109
he then those route target statements
that is the policy

732
00:42:22,109 --> 00:42:27,930
you know it's going to told the router
would be paeans we want to bleed Ian

733
00:42:27,930 --> 00:42:31,700
we want to import the router what
important and the rest we want to export

734
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:32,160
oil

735
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:36,019
it could be that we only want the BP is
associated with our VPN

736
00:42:36,019 --> 00:42:39,759
but we could happen extra net b2b top
situation

737
00:42:39,759 --> 00:42:43,029
worry bring in another the other a

738
00:42:43,029 --> 00:42:47,430
MPLS network place a merger maybe others
to MPLS network said

739
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:51,579
bpm have been defined we could use those
brow target import-export

740
00:42:51,579 --> 00:42:54,619
to join to MPLS networks together they
were

741
00:42:54,619 --> 00:42:58,630
once pull the unique all it takes

742
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:02,589
for someone for another enterprise to
get their network

743
00:43:02,589 --> 00:43:06,250
into your network about bursa is the
network I

744
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:10,579
axe doing happen in those route
architects

745
00:43:10,579 --> 00:43:15,680
import-export statements for legal row a

746
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:19,500
so the only way you're going to protect
yourself is encryption

747
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:23,470
that's how fast does health a history in
pure profit MPLS networks will be

748
00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:24,069
breached

749
00:43:24,069 --> 00:43:30,619
but this is what it looks like from a
virtualization standpoint you know if

750
00:43:30,619 --> 00:43:33,390
you got to be moved from their prostate
points probably have routers

751
00:43:33,390 --> 00:43:36,200
you know working to get the global
routing table in the upper left-hand

752
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,490
corner and you're familiar with

753
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:41,599
you do your show up your Luco your
routes when the upper right hand corner

754
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:42,850
is

755
00:43:42,850 --> 00:43:46,930
were you see you have to show up here
elber in special about the BP image will

756
00:43:46,930 --> 00:43:48,740
look at the time case customary

757
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:52,390
or down the bottom we have to go on do
show up here Albert customer be

758
00:43:52,390 --> 00:43:56,070
so that we can it when we do that we see
three different

759
00:43:56,070 --> 00:43:59,420
unique routing tables world one router

760
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:03,150
three unique routing tables here we're
like ships in the night where the same

761
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:04,730
water but we don't see each other

762
00:44:04,730 --> 00:44:08,050
you have to do that import export to be
able to see each other

763
00:44:08,050 --> 00:44:12,500
now I showed you how that Owen clout
works for those P's

764
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:16,570
tied to the P devices back out appease
at the edge permanent

765
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:21,370
all how that how those labels get from
the age where your BP owners

766
00:44:21,370 --> 00:44:24,520
your appeals bpm has created is with BGP

767
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:28,230
and those route targets the policy is

768
00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:32,150
advertised across the what internal what
are your network at the service provider

769
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:35,200
using the extended community string in
BGP

770
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:39,330
and you can look at this offline you
have the slots this what you have there

771
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:40,120
for reference

772
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:45,720
CRP capper now this is a monolithic
architecture for service about it is is

773
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:46,270
that just

774
00:44:46,270 --> 00:44:51,160
a single search about our architecture
shown here reasonable reason I did the

775
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:54,520
or to say this is what you

776
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:59,990
you gotta the global Internet the search
about get their own Internet backbone

777
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:03,010
in the drop down to the search voters
MPLS network

778
00:45:03,010 --> 00:45:07,160
here then they have their Coast internal
customers

779
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:10,680
looking goal wrong if the if the router
got

780
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:15,370
goes rogue what it would have no he
starts working with a bag as being

781
00:45:15,370 --> 00:45:17,310
influenced by organized crime

782
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:21,570
what have you what can they do what if
the service but it gets hacked

783
00:45:21,570 --> 00:45:24,680
the search bar is get high I get the
phone calls when they get high

784
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:28,920
they get high trust me I get the calls
or you have to go respond they make the

785
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:31,860
same mistakes are happening in there
probably just don't talk about it

786
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:37,320
a so would like if they can easily like
I showed you

787
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:41,630
go in a change that BP incomplete do it
import-export

788
00:45:41,630 --> 00:45:45,380
introduced someone else was no work
maybe the

789
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:48,790
they are maybe they have an organization

790
00:45:48,790 --> 00:45:51,960
BPN network that they want to bring in
the network

791
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:53,650
work

792
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:56,950
showed you that local ownership that
your span a

793
00:45:56,950 --> 00:46:00,119
mirror in traffic out all those
techniques that we looked at in the

794
00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:01,499
first part the presentation

795
00:46:01,499 --> 00:46:06,200
could be done in the telco cloud with
your traffic so that they can sniff

796
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:06,930
trafico

797
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:11,269
or call your attention that I know in
the US

798
00:46:11,269 --> 00:46:14,470
this is this has happened in the US I
talk to someone

799
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:17,480
who had a private private

800
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:21,849
imperialist Virtual Private Network VPN

801
00:46:21,849 --> 00:46:25,559
that they were so province bpm right

802
00:46:25,559 --> 00:46:30,119
they found that there was traffic coming
from the

803
00:46:30,119 --> 00:46:33,910
im peerless network back out their
firewall

804
00:46:33,910 --> 00:46:39,420
from another country it ain't the one
you guys are thinking of

805
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:42,559
it was another but there is another
country come in

806
00:46:42,559 --> 00:46:47,180
in from their private MPLS network they
are really called it is they were

807
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:47,920
looking at their

808
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:50,920
egress their firewall logs in watching
the traffic deboer

809
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:54,680
they'd never thought I gotta MP /lesprom
network/. prather

810
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:59,859
with a good encryption no but I had to
ask you this is their prizes

811
00:46:59,859 --> 00:47:02,940
if someone does add to your network
would you know it

812
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:08,690
can you detect that egress so

813
00:47:08,690 --> 00:47:12,450
how will they take over the telco

814
00:47:12,450 --> 00:47:16,430
save this save the network I didn't go
bad how could you possibly get taken

815
00:47:16,430 --> 00:47:16,890
over

816
00:47:16,890 --> 00:47:20,180
well have me over the networks they sell
you are monitored managed network

817
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:20,749
services

818
00:47:20,749 --> 00:47:24,440
were the written by you know the the
caller CPE the customer per miss the bus

819
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:28,119
is located at the local side maybe to
retell

820
00:47:28,119 --> 00:47:31,150
office you know maybe is banking

821
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:35,710
Lego rather spread out everywhere I'll
you know

822
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:40,200
physical access rules if you got
physical access to that customer router

823
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:46,499
you get their due to you can if you can
break into their router if they do not

824
00:47:46,499 --> 00:47:48,650
help password recovery disabled

825
00:47:48,650 --> 00:47:54,140
you break into their router booted up in
the wrong monster do Password Recovery

826
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:58,180
you can pour the Configure undergone get
all the S&P the network management the

827
00:47:58,180 --> 00:47:59,460
trust relationships

828
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:03,950
all that cloud appear the circle back to
top were the brains of the operation for

829
00:48:03,950 --> 00:48:04,829
the telco is

830
00:48:04,829 --> 00:48:06,880
because they're providing you a lot cell

831
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:10,519
and service right all the trust
relationship all the keys to the kingdom

832
00:48:10,519 --> 00:48:12,000
all the good Intel

833
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,160
is in their router configure out there
the coast all at the hundred thousand

834
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:17,720
the customer sites

835
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:21,910
it is pointing back up there in all it
takes is some want to get a whole that

836
00:48:21,910 --> 00:48:22,609
equipment

837
00:48:22,609 --> 00:48:27,079
in their gonna know that there's a
reason I think I've thought about this a

838
00:48:27,079 --> 00:48:29,990
sly I'm picking up a customer because I
had a customer that

839
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:34,069
they had one telco network with one
frame relay provider

840
00:48:34,069 --> 00:48:38,119
there was a totally lot self-manage
their work they flipped over

841
00:48:38,119 --> 00:48:42,440
to a second telco and I built the second
network the first telco

842
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:45,539
abandon all the equipment in place
leaders wrote it off

843
00:48:45,539 --> 00:48:50,650
left it the project manager the business
the Microsoft Excel PowerPoint guy

844
00:48:50,650 --> 00:48:56,049
didn't that take into account the
exposure that he gay that ok Oh because

845
00:48:56,049 --> 00:48:58,250
he left all that equipment out there in
place

846
00:48:58,250 --> 00:49:01,809
with all the configuration information
my customers like to know

847
00:49:01,809 --> 00:49:05,220
reviews all the equipment we had new
password recovery getting all that

848
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:06,670
information so that's 11

849
00:49:06,670 --> 00:49:09,809
vector but the bad guys could end up
getting into the telco

850
00:49:09,809 --> 00:49:14,119
the total import be the telcos have the
same problems at the enterprise data

851
00:49:14,119 --> 00:49:17,319
just the way we are later

852
00:49:17,319 --> 00:49:21,680
they don't get exposed is much is a in
be don't like the enterprises do

853
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:25,089
with their make the same mistakes if you
can get into somebody could get into

854
00:49:25,089 --> 00:49:25,819
that network

855
00:49:25,819 --> 00:49:29,109
they could go in Traverse then I get
themselves embedded into the optical

856
00:49:29,109 --> 00:49:29,769
network

857
00:49:29,769 --> 00:49:32,960
the Metro Ethernet networking server
internet

858
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:36,730
what you get into the core network
management operations

859
00:49:36,730 --> 00:49:41,480
they have control everything it in the
whoever breaks into the network knows

860
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:42,180
what they're doing

861
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:48,460
nobody will ever know

862
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:51,509
when I started moving working on the %uh
this idea

863
00:49:51,509 --> 00:49:56,369
it was thinking about how BGP has been
hijacked and how that could be pivoted

864
00:49:56,369 --> 00:50:02,059
into MPLS attack this is the scenario I
was originally thinking of over the oven

865
00:50:02,059 --> 00:50:03,490
international enterprise

866
00:50:03,490 --> 00:50:07,029
were you have saved locations in the US
Europe

867
00:50:07,029 --> 00:50:11,259
Asia South America asia-pacific in

868
00:50:11,259 --> 00:50:15,869
you how the cells the telecommunications
person show up you decide you need a

869
00:50:15,869 --> 00:50:16,410
water

870
00:50:16,410 --> 00:50:20,549
you what area network the you know it's
called how your manufacture locations

871
00:50:20,549 --> 00:50:21,630
around the world together

872
00:50:21,630 --> 00:50:25,900
you go talk to talk XYZ vendor

873
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:29,789
the sales guys go show up and he was
gonna and they're going to lay out a map

874
00:50:29,789 --> 00:50:32,980
until you go we can get we can give you
circus will give you new pillows network

875
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:33,829
this global

876
00:50:33,829 --> 00:50:37,499
across the network you're going to get
one phone bill I'm gonna be your

877
00:50:37,499 --> 00:50:38,190
interface

878
00:50:38,190 --> 00:50:42,190
along with the girl you talk to I get
the commission check but they're not

879
00:50:42,190 --> 00:50:44,799
going to tell you about the trust
relationship

880
00:50:44,799 --> 00:50:49,130
that they have that you're inheriting
with all of their different pure

881
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:51,579
character just like BGP is peering

882
00:50:51,579 --> 00:50:55,940
to make the whole global internet work
EMP less for international employs BP is

883
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:56,640
being peer

884
00:50:56,640 --> 00:51:00,989
no single telco owns the local loop

885
00:51:00,989 --> 00:51:05,930
around the world in to get your local
loop se from the US to Europe to

886
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:09,819
Asia asia-pacific South America you're
gonna have to the girl I gotta work with

887
00:51:09,819 --> 00:51:11,099
lots of other telcos

888
00:51:11,099 --> 00:51:14,849
two billion they're gone appeared just
like the dude BGP the computer MPLS

889
00:51:14,849 --> 00:51:15,559
networks

890
00:51:15,559 --> 00:51:18,809
together in so now

891
00:51:18,809 --> 00:51:24,029
all it takes is one telco prevail in the
EMP last

892
00:51:24,029 --> 00:51:27,390
trust relationship to get compromised

893
00:51:27,390 --> 00:51:31,739
in take an interest in some traffic and
now you've now your compromise

894
00:51:31,739 --> 00:51:34,839
and look at the weather will all the
things we talked about the first part

895
00:51:34,839 --> 00:51:36,880
the presentation was sniffing traffic

896
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:41,589
during the main military barracks up
could you use the lawful intercept a

897
00:51:41,589 --> 00:51:43,410
copy traffic the year span

898
00:51:43,410 --> 00:51:47,180
all those things are possible now
anywhere in that chain if you're not

899
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:48,200
using encryption

900
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:52,400
who knows somebody is going to turn out
that they start doing

901
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:56,309
if they're sniffing if they're sniffing
you're never going no

902
00:51:56,309 --> 00:52:01,839
if they start missing your trafficker
redirected to rerouting it

903
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:04,690
the only way you're going know that
their rerouting your traffic is if you

904
00:52:04,690 --> 00:52:06,460
been mapping out the time delay

905
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:09,640
look at the TT okay you can break
physics there is time

906
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:13,819
between abandon their work in 20 years
autonomy people's monitoring the Tom

907
00:52:13,819 --> 00:52:14,289
DeLay

908
00:52:14,289 --> 00:52:19,029
a puppy packets but that but what you
mean by what you might detect if you're

909
00:52:19,029 --> 00:52:20,039
not using encryption

910
00:52:20,039 --> 00:52:24,729
is having routes injected into your
private MPLS network like this scenario

911
00:52:24,729 --> 00:52:28,650
just mention where my contact had
detected that happening to their network

912
00:52:28,650 --> 00:52:31,710
and I want you know this is enterprise
network secure by any appeal the

913
00:52:31,710 --> 00:52:32,309
circuits

914
00:52:32,309 --> 00:52:35,650
if someone in this clout

915
00:52:35,650 --> 00:52:41,859
join jury MPLS network would you detect
new routes being injected into your

916
00:52:41,859 --> 00:52:42,749
routing tables

917
00:52:42,749 --> 00:52:46,920
are you monitor your routes that are
being introduced in your network from

918
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:48,099
your MPLS when

919
00:52:48,099 --> 00:52:51,200
you got a lot that trust relationship
down

920
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:54,869
cause a monitoring on because you're not
looking

921
00:52:54,869 --> 00:52:58,489
muscle assume the does but when you go
home

922
00:52:58,489 --> 00:53:01,989
you wanna see it I probably assume
they've already been there and

923
00:53:01,989 --> 00:53:05,249
done it may because they may come back
later

924
00:53:05,249 --> 00:53:12,249
was paired or been in this business too
long so

925
00:53:13,309 --> 00:53:17,450
I'm not all bad news we can fix this we
have the technology

926
00:53:17,450 --> 00:53:20,989
would have had to make a concerted
effort to do it

927
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:25,269
to lock down like was spoken against the
way a lot these trust relationships down

928
00:53:25,269 --> 00:53:31,690
model are now working our assets I'll
recommend you start immediately

929
00:53:31,690 --> 00:53:36,329
monitoring your IP networks the IP
addresses that you have been allocated

930
00:53:36,329 --> 00:53:37,640
your public IP space

931
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:40,969
both IP version 4 and ipv6

932
00:53:40,969 --> 00:53:45,499
were gone moved out BB 6 a.m. as do Iran

933
00:53:45,499 --> 00:53:49,380
this new v6 rival start of monitoring
our prefixes for b6

934
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:53,729
let's go back and get her be four
addresses monitors thinking

935
00:53:53,729 --> 00:53:57,940
using in better than that

936
00:53:57,940 --> 00:54:01,450
you know everyone's talking about the
red Intel these days it's a bro hot

937
00:54:01,450 --> 00:54:04,839
topic monitor

938
00:54:04,839 --> 00:54:08,979
your peers monitor your competition's IP
prefixes

939
00:54:08,979 --> 00:54:13,160
monitor your suppliers IP prefixes

940
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:16,320
maybe your adversary whoever they are

941
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:20,800
whoever interested in your network if it
is if it's me know if it's a strategic

942
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,880
attack that you're about to become a
part of

943
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:26,170
maybe they hit the Supplier 1st

944
00:54:26,170 --> 00:54:30,810
or what are your peers but you're next
or maybe they've already hit you because

945
00:54:30,810 --> 00:54:32,960
you're mean monitor you didn't know they
got it done

946
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:36,829
and now they moved over to the other
guys are if you start monitoring

947
00:54:36,829 --> 00:54:40,410
you BGP you may be detected

948
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:44,730
there's a couple services you can use
pgp Mon

949
00:54:44,730 --> 00:54:46,609
a Diana

950
00:54:46,609 --> 00:54:52,349
the ball label releases by recently BYU
not on the Internet if you're if you're

951
00:54:52,349 --> 00:54:53,749
not be if you want if you go

952
00:54:53,749 --> 00:54:56,789
scripting skills you could go code your
own cooler the

953
00:54:56,789 --> 00:55:00,509
for you row servers on the Internet call
BGP Looking Glass servers

954
00:55:00,509 --> 00:55:04,999
where you can log in the routers and and
monitoring baseline performance if you

955
00:55:04,999 --> 00:55:06,869
have a mad scripting skills

956
00:55:06,869 --> 00:55:10,390
if you don't wanna pay for service

957
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:13,999
the new old you can go there's a cycle
BG play

958
00:55:13,999 --> 00:55:19,079
BG play I'll you can look at like the
last seven or ten days the

959
00:55:19,079 --> 00:55:24,549
routes to see what's been happening at
on the Internet for the MPLS

960
00:55:24,549 --> 00:55:28,249
use bpm

961
00:55:28,249 --> 00:55:31,720
you gotta go in using cryptid bpm

962
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:35,339
over the BP the MPLS VPN encrypt data
traffic at the age

963
00:55:35,339 --> 00:55:40,380
if you're going I'll source i'd get to
providers out how the telco build the

964
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:41,599
MPLS network

965
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:45,039
and i'd have a second bender

966
00:55:45,039 --> 00:55:48,739
Supplier problem performed the BPM
former

967
00:55:48,739 --> 00:55:51,640
the telcos go wanna sell you at all
because but how they get their

968
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:52,630
commission run

969
00:55:52,630 --> 00:55:55,869
but you wanna you want to have the

970
00:55:55,869 --> 00:55:58,980
somebody is separate from the Tokyo
provide the VPN

971
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:02,720
the encrypted VPN service in my personal
opinion because that hoe trust

972
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:05,180
relationship because of their router guy
goes bad

973
00:56:05,180 --> 00:56:09,930
are they get their network part so what
you got the PN

974
00:56:09,930 --> 00:56:14,680
the you are you sure bpm will be by log
into people's the peons all the time

975
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:18,279
a log and it's no big deal you get
credentials

976
00:56:18,279 --> 00:56:21,369
login over the VPN assisting cryptid
I'll

977
00:56:21,369 --> 00:56:24,839
what little what list to traffic nearby
stockman application

978
00:56:24,839 --> 00:56:29,029
by listening at the host for the network
as in the room we need to step it up her

979
00:56:29,029 --> 00:56:31,130
body was to be down the windows guys

980
00:56:31,130 --> 00:56:34,999
network as we need to step it up

981
00:56:34,999 --> 00:56:38,470
we've had the tools a lot longer in our
tools work and they're not as hard to

982
00:56:38,470 --> 00:56:39,259
put in place

983
00:56:39,259 --> 00:56:43,930
into next week as the application host
level this do what listening in lockdown

984
00:56:43,930 --> 00:56:44,739
layer 2

985
00:56:44,739 --> 00:56:48,569
this lockdown layer 3 lockdown most
trust relationships lockdown those

986
00:56:48,569 --> 00:56:49,650
routing protocols

987
00:56:49,650 --> 00:56:53,460
of the routes that we're having injected
into our network from the appeal is

988
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:54,150
carrier

989
00:56:54,150 --> 00:56:57,890
in not only lock it down but be
monitoring

990
00:56:57,890 --> 00:56:59,130
in watchin

991
00:56:59,130 --> 00:57:04,450
for the carrier to accidentally try to
send us route so we don't own

992
00:57:04,450 --> 00:57:09,130
and then that if something happens
triage it investigated

993
00:57:09,130 --> 00:57:12,240
in demand reason in

994
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:15,080
for these new routes that are not ours
come in and are trying to commit are

995
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:15,460
never

996
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:18,750
and monitor it had that baseline

997
00:57:18,750 --> 00:57:21,900
and used to them do two factor
authentication everywhere to not do a

998
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:23,020
one-time passwords

999
00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:27,460
if you're now use a one-time passwords
so your passwords are compromised

1000
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:32,200
now I did not come with up with all this
knowledge myself

1001
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:35,980
a study a great deal I suggest

1002
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:40,240
you to take the slides main really
detail so you can go and try to save you

1003
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:40,850
some reading

1004
00:57:40,850 --> 00:57:44,910
the ER NW goes to have done a great deal
a research in this

1005
00:57:44,910 --> 00:57:49,080
field Yvonne is one the top people in
the world as well

1006
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:52,530
are air 20 last week well

1007
00:57:52,530 --> 00:57:56,510
earlier in the week a mention his his
papers he's done a real good book on

1008
00:57:56,510 --> 00:57:58,330
ipv6 it also covers a

1009
00:57:58,330 --> 00:58:02,800
your pillows get look at his book up

1010
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:06,010
anyway of course I hope you know FX go
look at his stuff as well

1011
00:58:06,010 --> 00:58:09,460
up but then those are some good
references for you if you need to dig

1012
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:10,920
deeper into the subject

1013
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:14,540
and if I can do anything

1014
00:58:14,540 --> 00:58:20,870
a little on Twitter on some I'm not on
Twitter's when I'm sleeping

1015
00:58:20,870 --> 00:58:24,200
the number I'm in about water I

1016
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:28,490
so I if I can do anything to help you
please reach out to me I'm

1017
00:58:28,490 --> 00:58:32,100
I if I don't respond it's cuz I'm in the
air line somewhere but I will get back

1018
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:34,240
to you soon as I can get a good internet
connection

1019
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:39,250
I hope you get something out the talk I
read sincerely appreciate everyone

1020
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:42,620
but in a much talk in thank you again
for inviting me

1021
00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:49,620
sir been a major career gotem to come to
troopers made happen for me thank you

1022
00:58:56,849 --> 00:58:58,140
ok thank you

1023
00:58:58,140 --> 00:59:01,170
all my we Q&A

1024
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:04,720
hooker by minute OCR any questions

1025
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:09,849
Hill

1026
00:59:09,849 --> 00:59:13,609
thing the management world

1027
00:59:13,609 --> 00:59:19,799
who was it for the third the yet well

1028
00:59:19,799 --> 00:59:23,019
is I would go back to that date the

1029
00:59:23,019 --> 00:59:28,799
chart I would you know where most have a
specially in the enterprise space

1030
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:31,849
or under compliance and

1031
00:59:31,849 --> 00:59:36,890
like health care banking we're we're

1032
00:59:36,890 --> 00:59:39,980
under real regulatory requirements to be
to

1033
00:59:39,980 --> 00:59:43,509
how use encryption I would take
something as simple as this chart here

1034
00:59:43,509 --> 00:59:47,670
in use the business requirement to be
compliant a letdown

1035
00:59:47,670 --> 00:59:51,509
in show them MPLS no encryption

1036
00:59:51,509 --> 00:59:56,059
we're not compliant confidentiality

1037
00:59:56,059 --> 00:59:59,579
integrity availability if you're in the
skater utility

1038
00:59:59,579 --> 01:00:03,779
were more about availability if you're
in the healthcare banking your word

1039
01:00:03,779 --> 01:00:05,420
about confidentiality integrity

1040
01:00:05,420 --> 01:00:09,769
in without late usually allows nappy sec
with the MPLS

1041
01:00:09,769 --> 01:00:13,059
you do not how that confidentiality
integrity

1042
01:00:13,059 --> 01:00:17,019
and that's a business conversation they
understand compliance in the US we have

1043
01:00:17,019 --> 01:00:18,329
hip-hop for health care

1044
01:00:18,329 --> 01:00:21,549
you know gramley shocks for financials

1045
01:00:21,549 --> 01:00:25,829
I don't know with put the equipment is
in europe no parts world but I'm sure

1046
01:00:25,829 --> 01:00:26,549
you have the

1047
01:00:26,549 --> 01:00:29,900
especially in the enterprises not to as
well I would communicate just

1048
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:32,900
were non-compliant without doing this
and then

1049
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:36,130
if you don't want to compliance with the
conversations have in the US

1050
01:00:36,130 --> 01:00:39,489
we don't want to go and implement this
then the

1051
01:00:39,489 --> 01:00:43,670
would by insurers to you pay off all pay
off everybody when the consumers

1052
01:00:43,670 --> 01:00:46,849
minutes what happened with target and
Home Depot

1053
01:00:46,849 --> 01:00:51,069
rather just got a lot of insurers like K
should ensure check and make it all go

1054
01:00:51,069 --> 01:00:52,749
away stock price goes abroad

1055
01:00:52,749 --> 01:00:56,489
the made public question was

1056
01:00:56,489 --> 01:00:57,100
the

1057
01:00:57,100 --> 01:01:00,130
management will shoot the messenger why
