1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:04,110
started so how everybody

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:08,400
um cracks me up I to a bunch of
carjacking last couple years

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,719
mailing reverse engineer mainly come
from the security area

4
00:00:11,719 --> 00:00:15,190
I but I started a group called open
garages I am

5
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:19,369
which is kinda just so generous than
anything involving cars are

6
00:00:19,369 --> 00:00:23,199
permit elation acting that kinda stuff
that's a how the group is and that's how

7
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:24,800
let me into doing more and more

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,900
car research I am this particular talk
is going to be an intro

9
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:32,130
talk it's going to cover a lot of stuff
iron

10
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:36,660
but I'm not trying to be mainly focus on
CAN bus and we'll touch on some the

11
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:37,649
other areas

12
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:41,460
this is I'm right thanks dancing are
four-day course into

13
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:46,210
two hours home but the focus and every
relatively easy

14
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:49,530
as pretty large group I'm so I have a

15
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,840
actual instrument cluster here opposites
are groupie

16
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,020
we all play on it I have several
different ways that we can all work

17
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:57,070
together to

18
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:00,699
I am to campus reversing so don't worry

19
00:01:00,699 --> 00:01:03,800
but as my matter size the classical
we'll get through it

20
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,890
answer for I get this guy just amor

21
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:11,490
the bill the slides and the have images
I just told them I didn't sit around

22
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:12,630
Ryan pictures for

23
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:17,000
forty-something slide testing of the
Google Images and as wide as a mature

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,840
slut image

25
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,070
are and sell

26
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:25,509
I was kayaking it so it's a buncha
thanks so you know we have reverse a

27
00:01:25,509 --> 00:01:28,189
protocol such as fun things from the
focusing on today

28
00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:31,740
I am and what they do and you know why
would you do that

29
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,880
I'm performance Jennings really what's
been around a lot longer

30
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,990
people in montana cars for decades

31
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:43,939
and I'll indeed they do crucial stuff
that you're hearing now a bit scary

32
00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:45,220
thing is doing they've been doing

33
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:49,509
that one main differences the
performance tuners work in our little

34
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:55,100
circle and I am cannot they share foo
but it's kind of internal reform groups

35
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,340
and what not not as

36
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,390
open to bring up certain things

37
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:02,909
and what is because they're afraid of
being sued by Sir aftermarket people not

38
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:03,860
really the OEM's

39
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:06,869
much as aftermarket there's the whole
reasoning for that

40
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:08,450
and so

41
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:12,600
month is a try to get to its pretty far
more of her stuff us Tom of cations is

42
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,690
nothing I've seen a lot out so you know
adding lights if you want to

43
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:19,720
I just took a car hydraulics or perhaps
you want

44
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,420
you know whites the working to progress
and speeds and those are all types

45
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:27,460
reasons that go into it exploit
development that's again in my area

46
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:32,200
my category of stuff and that's working
from one the car hacking side of things

47
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,880
and kosher salt service and to yourself

48
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,830
I'll picture on cars that area I'm not
get it are

49
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:42,850
hmm said I ask %uh fixing the car I just
break from

50
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:48,530
so stars like quite a hacker car about
it this one a few

51
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:52,360
talks that idea of where I fashion
people after what why the

52
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,880
what I do that and you know it's

53
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:59,510
its probably fairly obvious to you guys
are being in the security

54
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:02,630
area like why research and find these
things

55
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:06,160
I think the reason I get this question
is because most people realize that

56
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:06,680
there's a

57
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,960
safety I'm concerned with packing the
car

58
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:14,000
and if there isn't really a standard for
that we don't really keep in part be

59
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,720
car seat the a checklists Michael to
security

60
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:22,130
a so you know for for me it's it's
really getting awareness on that figure

61
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:22,810
out from a

62
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:26,170
security perspective where we say in our
Privacy perspective

63
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:29,720
where we say I I think a a really good
group is

64
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:33,150
I am the Calgary I have house give a
quick talk crime

65
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:36,890
now quick intro for I'm a calorie stuff
you wouldn't be going to that

66
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:40,040
all right corner chair is might by User

67
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,190
one now truck at least flight

68
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:46,820
that him my previous I can cumshots

69
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:49,940
love but a little bit but I'm carries a
group of volunteers

70
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:54,500
working together because we care about
making things more secure

71
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,800
and where there are trust promoting
secure by designed by

72
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:02,030
raising awareness with law givers
lawmakers and benders

73
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:05,270
by having researchers like rake

74
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:08,580
find and expose and fix

75
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:11,790
vulnerabilities so we're trying to avoid
a

76
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:15,220
cyber dystopian future

77
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:18,800
where we have IPSS and AV and other

78
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:23,040
known to feel technologies as
illustrated earlier by a sec a potter's

79
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,030
in Kos in airplanes in trains and and so
on and

80
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:30,730
we are well represented by at this point
in the US

81
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:33,950
but we are few in Europe

82
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:37,900
and if you want to join peace reach out
sorry for a sales pitch

83
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:43,410
thank you that banks cost yeah I'm also

84
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:47,730
outnumber any but our group and I any
kind of help and that's that's what's

85
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:49,850
nice about that group is it's not all

86
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:53,080
tackle you don't have to be really good
at hacking cards have to be concerned

87
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:53,680
about it

88
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:59,470
I'm his poignant funny work that needs
to be done so what I'm not tax services

89
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:02,520
vehicles have a rather complex attack
surface saddam

90
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,660
being toughness line again we just all I
am

91
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:10,150
there's you know we have things like I'm
wireless sensors ninety payouts

92
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:14,440
which is like a actor tire pressure and
so that broadcasts well

93
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,580
there's internal stuff a lot times to
get ranked from

94
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:21,120
know how far away say may have like a
long distance communication so

95
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,400
are going and this may be a higher risk
than near-field are

96
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,820
you know inside the vehicle and all
these 10 cover

97
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:31,330
different areas of expertise to which
can make things are so difficult

98
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:34,540
I in no uncertain operating system stuff
is going to cover

99
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:37,920
all the car bases are nursing some wires
for the season can cover all

100
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:42,530
on so there's a lot to this um

101
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:45,930
we talk about this I think in the other
while Flacco the first I'll

102
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:49,540
keynote so you know lines of code in a
space shuttle us

103
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:52,600
are 1000 by summers someone is

104
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,990
3.4 million lines of code that car there

105
00:05:55,990 --> 00:06:00,270
sprout 27 knowing what occurred out a
lot more

106
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:04,570
code runs on a car I missed an excellent
sensors that are everywhere

107
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:09,010
ominous those pictures /a crazy picture
because the gas prices

108
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:12,360
sing-sing

109
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,760
unbelievable so does not cover

110
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:19,280
and so when things were going to use
today I S one in my favor

111
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,550
drivers for doing this type stuff and
it's a its

112
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:26,290
specifically lennox if you guys have
laptops he reflects on on

113
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:29,500
I am the recent things you can do we can
play along I

114
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:33,610
so psychic and when it does it runs in
the crowds car driver

115
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:37,120
and it will connect base here can I am

116
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,660
devices to a normal site so just like
you have no networking site that

117
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:46,650
you can now talk to can the same way I'm
probably somewhat close the same way

118
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:51,020
and so you to put forth a great things
in CA which issues aside command

119
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:54,430
I'm Wireshark would work on the car

120
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:57,850
and those kinds of things and I'm run
exe really nice very easy way

121
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:01,660
I to manipulate a stuff for can

122
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:05,330
if you if you don't really wanna run
save Lennox on we can do is

123
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:09,440
you guys have Michael Ennis gateway that
connects the car there's a piece cuts i

124
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,450
can't.

125
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:15,160
and just say I a demand that runs and it
has an interface

126
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:19,250
I can talk to other platforms this is
what I recommend

127
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:24,140
this is a good universal open source tor
the thing we're going also use for live

128
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,340
demos today is the icy simulator

129
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:29,960
this is a tool ever on the simulated

130
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,480
base what we have physically here more
last I am

131
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:37,070
the nice thing about the stool is that
well I

132
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:42,150
fair especially at the top as a best
speed turn signals and their store a lot

133
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:46,000
but you can randomize the code that uses
every time we play this

134
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,510
I'll make this method work as a game and
so you can reverse agenda can't I guess

135
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:51,550
to do those things

136
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:55,390
and you can give it a flag I am where

137
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:59,210
the next time you play it it choosing a
whole difference at the stuff Sonu can

138
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:01,830
change how difficult it is to locate on
the neck and

139
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:05,010
thinks it's a training tool on the way
it works is our separate pieces

140
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:09,370
the game kantor piece here talk to the
cameras yes percussion lessons on campus

141
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:12,520
and so we'll get to that to get some
play

142
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,480
deflection of a long

143
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:19,870
go ahead and grab it from get up but get
had a complex on the cracks I C sEM

144
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:23,100
desert rises and as well I am

145
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:26,230
but we're going to life and we can get
on protector that's fine

146
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:30,840
but if you want to go ahead and grab it
daily things are going to need

147
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:35,260
forward is iraqi by two you can grab the
STL to

148
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:38,430
still to NH and you can grab can you
tell us

149
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:44,290
those are the requirements for compiling
so up big

150
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:48,140
area of research from a security
perspective tends to be the infotainment

151
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:48,840
units

152
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:52,260
or IVIS I'm much just ask for and
vehicle

153
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:55,310
effort and and mainly because they have
all these other

154
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:58,510
functionalities to 20 so there to
connect to can

155
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:03,060
I some type I could be different bus but
that's usually can't there's new

156
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,610
Bluetooth WiFi saliva

157
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:08,580
attack surface is going to be this guy
and with the newer ones are

158
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:11,850
ferrying typical to what you have in a
rare PC

159
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:16,710
I'm you gonna have you know sometimes
and tear our platforms you have fun

160
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:20,860
i've seen like a federal MX up on effort
and before too sick from our

161
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:25,110
that one I when the season other one
this particular unit was outta my car

162
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:29,400
this was a Honda Civic 2009

163
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:33,050
and I'm can't remember actually a nap
system was like I

164
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:36,870
but I was running a Hitachi message for
processor which is the same rights and

165
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:37,580
Dreamcast

166
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:41,300
I was a little bit different but also
wanna see it was pretty easy to

167
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,510
to me doing hack and I basically use the

168
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:48,640
update map it to to do an epic nap it
would just be the method typically uses

169
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,650
to get map updates

170
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:53,230
also had system deals on it hand really
really simple check

171
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:56,500
to make sure your message that which was
an md5 hash so

172
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,620
you just massive than updating the five
hash stored in the same city

173
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:03,660
so they're not terribly hard to escape
respect to manipulate

174
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:07,600
and one shot on what you can do so if
you have certain vulnerabilities this is

175
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,660
where they're going to come in

176
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:12,060
and so what bus your cats who will
really matter

177
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:16,410
I'm you know how taking a radio part if
you were to get a wiring diagram

178
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:20,500
for your for nap system on this one's
for that unit actually

179
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:25,450
and you can see the number for pin their
scale I'm

180
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:29,650
so I can bust but it's it's it's similar
to cam and so you can tell right away

181
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:30,890
from a white background

182
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:34,280
this may take a target for you as if you
act with something on this reading

183
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,320
something on a system

184
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,710
at the very least go topic AI and K Line
is a

185
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:41,840
this case may be loath speed I am

186
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:45,420
as the sum I Tasha door locks and things
of that nature I am

187
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:49,210
but I've never is also when you're doing
this paper research

188
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:53,050
don't take for granted that the bus
you're honest and I think and do

189
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:57,490
such as a high-speed bus and say it does
braking or acceleration

190
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,920
and this is sailors because typically I
connected to

191
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:05,170
keep the door unlocked if you know the
protocol to sand

192
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:11,390
I am this grab your RSS link and Mike
McKenna town it was good I speak and but

193
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:12,150
you cannot

194
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:15,910
send it I like say a high-speed signal
is be signal

195
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:20,070
because they both go into the same ECU
unit it just how's it anyway

196
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:24,160
it shouldn't be on there but it works
just fine so you should def I tried

197
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,990
going on it's something new
entertainment centers

198
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:32,580
I am there certainly use guest OS is
little PM's

199
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:37,440
this is the now fears has this or not is
typically doesn't have an App Store

200
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,780
I'll never has like a cab system usually
running something like this

201
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:46,180
%uh screeching execute the a couple
things like apple green river's

202
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:49,220
them out the senate I'll donors such

203
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:52,260
community i object ID I I

204
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:55,589
but like seeing you may have to do I
thought some some the M type situations

205
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:56,070
and then

206
00:11:56,070 --> 00:12:00,860
again it may depend on what's running on
iOS and Android bassist on the lookout

207
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:04,210
requirements are there I am doesn't talk
to

208
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:07,760
and so has gateway not messages to know
so they can

209
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:13,060
its doesn't really matter you're in a VM

210
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:16,029
so this is a good picture have the bus
architectures

211
00:12:16,029 --> 00:12:19,430
on so you can see in this wine we have

212
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:22,760
a can which is connected in this case to

213
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,860
you know locks I am you can see Glenn

214
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:30,520
so lands over there like eating Piercy
stuff like that lends a comment on to an

215
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,820
eleven you don't get

216
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:35,020
expose normally to its sick with the
internal

217
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:38,709
wiring systems very very simple very low
spin I'm

218
00:12:38,709 --> 00:12:42,040
and then if you are high high-speed
lines like for multimedia

219
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:45,850
effort a mic have a spare map it and but
like a speaker system

220
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:48,970
I guess cases most I'm back the other
things

221
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:52,880
and so this we hear about now decker bus
segment

222
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,050
stopped looking reading any kind of car
security stuff

223
00:12:56,050 --> 00:13:00,070
I am this is using what they're talking
about you may be only on one of these

224
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:00,899
bus networks

225
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:05,589
up and so like for lenders because they
going controls on that song when

226
00:13:05,589 --> 00:13:09,140
just because an eye on your bus again
doesn't mean you can't control it

227
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:12,649
because typically what happens if you're
going to have your main brainer

228
00:13:12,649 --> 00:13:17,170
ECU as the market controls our you know
maybe that's the one since the lansing

229
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:18,640
analysis what the seats

230
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,690
I and maybe you're entertaining it isn't
on

231
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:24,990
that land I you're on candid back case

232
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:29,330
I oftentimes you can tell DC I can't
have my seat warmed up

233
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:32,480
and then it sends a message that lack
had it's not really a big

234
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,180
restriction because of times that's
where that partners

235
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:41,300
it's on the project cell but as I said
no but always haunt

236
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:44,650
is the why things were going good for
today went to its simple

237
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:49,380
rank go through I am the connectors on
your car ask him at the club until

238
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:52,490
up but later shred up of to the panel's

239
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:56,870
a car looking to the other other wires
was better margins the stuff on

240
00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:02,440
so can bus that's that's our focus for
that this is a relatively easy once the

241
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,130
one you're going to hear the most about

242
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:07,380
I'm one going to talks on car hacking
and what not

243
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:11,360
some nice to its pretty simple there's
different speeds

244
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,430
of Airbus's which typically a low-speed

245
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:18,500
maybe mid speed in a high-speed I and
the high-speed

246
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:22,490
me and is there I like 500 K maybe 1
a.m.

247
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:26,750
I'll and then low-speed it's like her
20k maybe maybe lower

248
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:30,940
I'll and typically on the segregation is
between these different campuses

249
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:35,870
is based on the importance up the signal
I'm so it's nice security segregation

250
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:36,620
it's more like

251
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:40,240
welcome your door locks were the current
temperature inside the car is in very

252
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,149
important that follows be bypassed

253
00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:45,709
but a car speed is important to
high-speed bus so if you're looking for

254
00:14:45,709 --> 00:14:46,779
certain signal

255
00:14:46,779 --> 00:14:50,589
it's important now you know what what
bus it might be on

256
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:55,320
now there's only a few cars that well
but all the signals on one bus

257
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,870
pasta I am but you know it's at that
spot

258
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:02,380
but there are they really go for
training I because it cuz about you know

259
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,080
says but if you look at me as if I'm

260
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:09,149
I'll and well that's too is I want to go
into the wiring system here

261
00:15:09,149 --> 00:15:12,410
I am so this injured DLC connector

262
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:16,560
I am it is of support on this guy

263
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:22,330
right here so this guy cares typically
under steering column answers during

264
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:24,279
commented on the right or left side

265
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:27,360
sometimes somewhere else but thats
weren't supposed to be a

266
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,420
if you have any kinda environmental
check

267
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:35,250
agency and that's what the two would
plug into and the two pens are used

268
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:38,690
are six and 14 and then as you can hi
Inc and low

269
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:41,770
hands up here we see the Kanye Inc lol

270
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:45,470
I am the way they're working as whenever
it becomes an hour

271
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:49,240
no wonder 0 they're going to separate
and I separate the same time

272
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:53,899
by goes up vote goes down double and
then as if you didn't know its

273
00:15:53,899 --> 00:15:57,779
on this where fun goes up lol doesn't
bad back at

274
00:15:57,779 --> 00:16:02,200
I am so I think this is it was a pair to
our system

275
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,800
the resting state is 2.5 bought some

276
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:10,310
very weird state and alan is up one vote
so it's very very easy to find

277
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:14,089
if you're looking at their car wiring
system EC two wires pressed together

278
00:16:14,089 --> 00:16:17,810
and you tested has averaging 2.5 both
that scare

279
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:21,230
I am and inside there like

280
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:25,320
this car thing sir is the green areas
arbitration ninety

281
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:29,600
everything has an ID don't have source
and destination addresses they just have

282
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:29,970
a

283
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:35,240
and ideas come like category ID I'm so
when a packet comes out

284
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:39,310
not only saying where it's going there
who even sent it it's just saying like

285
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:42,399
here's a number and maybe represents

286
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:46,959
things involving a door and that's up to
the manufacturer so what those numbers

287
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:47,649
mean

288
00:16:47,649 --> 00:16:53,110
and they can vary from make model and
you can hear scallop and and then the

289
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:54,270
next piece will be I'm

290
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:57,480
a try I think yellow on that

291
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:01,880
yeah the yellow is I am measure length a
bite switches up the fights

292
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:05,150
and this case is one that packet to
thread part and others

293
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:08,439
I the one bite at that that's a a pay
packet

294
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:13,870
has a length and has an ID that is
basically cannot shop they are suffering

295
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:14,970
just for control

296
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:20,569
so because I mention k-line here's
here's what kaelin looks like

297
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:24,150
very very similar it slower speed than
can I am

298
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:28,220
but and thunder from wires resigns right
next to it and

299
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:31,360
it has up to 7 mites and sewn on a
ladder system

300
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,660
so you're you're you can still see on
the aging so transferred on these

301
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:39,340
it's just going to be a little farm at
band camp most the tools that you can

302
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,460
use our candle

303
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:44,580
on Celestica scandal in which I also
mentioned

304
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:48,170
is here and there's a nice all chart why
did not update

305
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:52,429
Paris

306
00:17:52,429 --> 00:17:57,100
on so you know this that's pretty much
everything I think he is

307
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:00,130
and so every last bit here and the cost
goes up

308
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:05,620
pasaria iron and so you see I'm a better
using land simply because it's cheap to

309
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,140
install

310
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:09,790
you know they could've played like the
heating units on can they just don't

311
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:14,330
I encounter lambing is also dismayed by
pack it looks very similar

312
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:19,800
I'll the way it's kinda mashed on that
works a lot different and so

313
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:24,059
now that's an important thing as well so
this can bus I'm being that doesn't have

314
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:25,570
a sender or receiver

315
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:28,820
a buscar from our networking is very
similar to

316
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:31,860
a network up our bases everybody's acts

317
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:36,460
so not having us worser destination and
every by Sam Bass packets

318
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:39,960
I makes a very very easy to be where you
wanna be

319
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:44,750
and so from scary perspective that
Skyler people typically manipulate I

320
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,540
one thing you will have to compete
against is that the device that supposed

321
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:48,970
to be seen that signal still it's

322
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:53,100
absurd typically the way that works is
you just wanna be more chatty the Mac I

323
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,390
or talk directly after him to the better
way to do it

324
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:59,540
so he says owners its 60 miles per hour
you wanna write

325
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:03,110
good ninety you can away from the 616
Amelia I mean I'm

326
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:07,570
convicted of aggravated to ninety or you
just keeps yelling and as much as you

327
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:08,150
want

328
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:11,679
and then noticed militias 90 here just
one pack every so often I look white

329
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:12,179
noise

330
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:17,900
drop your heart also see you turn that
they're not going to look like

331
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:21,320
rj-45 Jack to be more like around barrel
factor

332
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:24,340
where little trying to find their I am

333
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:29,220
tremendous and and the Ethernet that
i've seen. typically what to do

334
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:32,880
is the can a pay packets are just
wrapped up into your GP

335
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,080
so thats differ from our networking that
may

336
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:41,980
be an easy way of doing things for you I
am the CAC to it I find the snipers are

337
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:42,500
not

338
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,780
as good for tomorrow we'll get into I an
imminent

339
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:49,090
I but yeah I kasich this hour's crush
the same way

340
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:55,020
so to get to the stop treatment center
for issue rdlc

341
00:19:55,020 --> 00:20:00,540
your OBD connector I sister diagnostic
connector here

342
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:03,710
that's a picture of a rapper called BB
old dirty bastard

343
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:08,210
back a shot now I and I have a tendency
to say

344
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:12,750
his acronym in Stat all the time her
home himself

345
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:16,050
if you hear me say Oh DB it's the same
thing i jus

346
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:19,880
say iraq on as a dime mas communications

347
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:24,160
are typically way to get a phone app
annual plugin like a little cheap dollar

348
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,770
to the underside of the car

349
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:28,820
I'll that's what this is going to use
and

350
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:32,530
we can manipulate the exact same thing
which is not going to use appropriate

351
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:33,360
protocol

352
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:38,780
and so this also runs on can Iran's lil
bit differently on Cameron can

353
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:42,840
and with this one works is it queries
the engine control unit

354
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:47,020
engine control unit is this guy right
here

355
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:50,030
it's kind of like the main brains other
vehicle

356
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:53,900
others many brains inside a vehicle
that's last the main like X the engine

357
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:58,190
and I'm gonna clear it now will get you
also echoed in the car RPM's

358
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:03,150
are you liking your you know then number
and so I can get that back to be an app

359
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:03,830
that's now

360
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:07,370
whitewater fuel intake and stuff like
that it's making a serious inquiries

361
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:10,750
the problem from a security perspective
is

362
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:13,870
that isn't really what the cars using

363
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:17,020
that's what it's saying it's using I'm
so there's a

364
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:20,960
real packet that says what speed is and
there's a real package should the fuel

365
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,900
are sacred to reacting to this is more
proof right now working like ass in ki

366
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:30,600
on services like you make query to it
and you know S&P wraps up to data

367
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,870
and send it to you I it's kinda for
read-only

368
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:38,310
I portion I you can write to the doesn't
flash capabilities performers purchase a

369
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:39,230
query system

370
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:44,519
I'll but the cracks the exact same two
wires

371
00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:47,929
the protocols a little more complicated
can but it runs on can

372
00:21:47,929 --> 00:21:51,490
some modified interpretation capped I am

373
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:55,080
has a stand-up I get

374
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:59,130
cell Harris isnt p and yes to see you

375
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:02,899
I universal diagnostic servicer
something about nature on

376
00:22:02,899 --> 00:22:06,720
and this is what the orbiting
communication sucked us and so way this

377
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,529
works is it'll go out no query

378
00:22:08,529 --> 00:22:13,740
I am your ECU and work but we can come
back is going to be

379
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:18,070
sometimes way more than some bites I'm
is it seven in this case because you're

380
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:21,639
using some bites for this particular
protocol I miss you gonna

381
00:22:21,639 --> 00:22:26,460
Chaminda and you have a a bigger return
it's a little hard to

382
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:30,179
to run and lacks I about an hour I am

383
00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:34,659
but you can see these packets in normal
can snipers as well

384
00:22:34,659 --> 00:22:37,299
they're just gonna be up to a whole
different just it's good to be aware

385
00:22:37,299 --> 00:22:38,070
that their

386
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:45,070
I so would deprive interpreting the same
can data

387
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,409
so here is a scan tool check Talaash
personal banker time

388
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:52,600
our on

389
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:56,340
so I this is this is base this guy hair
I am

390
00:22:56,340 --> 00:23:00,610
people into a car you get these at most
on our shops

391
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:04,769
I'll they will make a series a
communications

392
00:23:04,769 --> 00:23:08,440
over the OBD its primarily to

393
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:13,009
troubleshoot engine codes on and so

394
00:23:13,009 --> 00:23:17,480
you don't really need one at the start
of their color kind of nice

395
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:22,080
on but you can snap a home to witness
this is our

396
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,389
public unless you have one from the
manufacturer I

397
00:23:25,389 --> 00:23:28,710
so like yours in common though it's
these are the things that your Apple

398
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:29,649
news as well

399
00:23:29,649 --> 00:23:32,870
save my wire to I and you could say I
give me the Mail app

400
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:38,610
mill lab is your engine light you know
and then I can turn to me RPM's

401
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:42,000
and these are just p.m. near first bite
second by

402
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,500
on 09 and then for those who don't know
it's a vehicle identification number

403
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,590
I that's the thing up in your dashboard
that's also stored

404
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:52,879
in the CEO on so one way to tell

405
00:23:52,879 --> 00:23:57,259
I'll ok and yet we have you can just
query the car she makes her a number

406
00:23:57,259 --> 00:24:01,730
and that's iran has a plan to stop at on
so you can have what they call been

407
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:02,549
decoder

408
00:24:02,549 --> 00:24:06,220
on a basic looks at it goes okay with
this is this manufacturer this is this

409
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:06,899
year

410
00:24:06,899 --> 00:24:10,629
ex-senator a this candle to do it for
you and say this looks like in this case

411
00:24:10,629 --> 00:24:14,350
a Chevy Malibu as what this parts are
from and so it will say that

412
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:17,710
no bothered and i cant except I'm

413
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:21,870
but and so a DTC is a dynastic oh they
get set

414
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:25,389
and it's really just sound somebody to
come back to this we'll see

415
00:24:25,389 --> 00:24:29,299
if you have a scan to use the I am this
hand numbering system here

416
00:24:29,299 --> 00:24:35,210
and so this is how you interpret it it's
changing the powertrain chases body or

417
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:38,570
network out and generic tell and then
down

418
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:41,940
SAU be accessed at one wanna be many
factors specific

419
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:46,809
and then you have kinda category number
and then the next summer's are

420
00:24:46,809 --> 00:24:50,149
very specific to your make model and
year I am

421
00:24:50,149 --> 00:24:53,279
things in this one how this kinda lays
out

422
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:56,389
say contracts and this P years so it's
up

423
00:24:56,389 --> 00:24:58,220
powertrain issue of

424
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:01,530
ASI standard hearn in the few air
metering system

425
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:04,730
and the 43 in this case that must be o2
sensor circuit swell

426
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:08,460
to get those numbers without using a
scandal

427
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:11,830
and you can either ice number and a
Google sometimes or

428
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:14,990
you can I'm go to your automotive store
and look for

429
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:19,650
the matter attack books are about maybe
20 US dollars or something

430
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:23,900
I am and no use they have in the index
action just listed these codes

431
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:27,570
and he can just look them up up I wanna
make sure that they're

432
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:31,310
went just touch briefly on data
recordings from a privacy perspective

433
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:35,850
I'm so the issue will record the
separate stuff to do some freeze-frame

434
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:36,720
stuff

435
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,540
I am and it does airbag control or

436
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:44,670
record a lot more information I'll but I
suppose I do

437
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:48,840
a for short on time but it will do
things that

438
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:52,790
a little different on such as like I'll
and knows tho

439
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:56,750
of and the way to the person wear seat
position as high keeper in the car

440
00:25:56,750 --> 00:26:00,950
I am mainly for insurance purposes so
I'm from a

441
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:06,040
privacy perspective that's so
information that you may or may not be

442
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:06,750
comparable with

443
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:09,840
I am but they're there Atlanta

444
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:13,050
no bottom I don't think I'm going to de
Mel

445
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:16,130
the TTC just for time I am

446
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:19,630
if you work with them up like an

447
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:25,450
so let's grab that

448
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:28,930
suffered a number this is an ISO TP
request

449
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:32,370
I miss you excreted its

450
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:38,200
to take

451
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:42,080
at SAC its

452
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:48,520
it

453
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:55,520
us at a so the one thing I found I ask
the TP staff with arm

454
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,190
when x is it's not built into the can
utilities or the crowd axis yet

455
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:03,860
you have to go and get the source code
for 10 details and then

456
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:10,860
load on I said

457
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:24,260
the

458
00:27:38,369 --> 00:27:45,369
kept

459
00:27:53,820 --> 00:28:00,820
of chess

460
00:28:01,809 --> 00:28:06,980
so scandal also got this for you Tucson
Magnet especially at a on the

461
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:11,080
command line I want

462
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:15,920
that pic alright well

463
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:20,350
we wanted sonya so I come but is
especially to search your number system

464
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:21,500
and it will happen as

465
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:25,170
packet stop on Channel seven minutes a

466
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:29,850
is not such architectures an ASCII

467
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:33,309
hindered

468
00:28:33,309 --> 00:28:39,380
okay it's

469
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:43,840
so that the thing that's tricky about it
is a more

470
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:47,690
it you have to say have basically to try
one is open I

471
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:51,790
so I'm doing here this is this is the
command to request it

472
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:57,850
on the command line and so using i SAT
peace and

473
00:28:57,850 --> 00:29:01,799
up seventy yeah and senator

474
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:08,120
happy I'm I was asset EP kinda uses I
source and destination

475
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:11,679
if you i think it that way um it still
doesn't funneled into can

476
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:16,390
I can packets tough I suffer those two
things are there

477
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:20,610
the 09 in there too at issue are on

478
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:26,580
node and to is the her nine is the mod
and two is the request for the then

479
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:30,320
and then another terminal I know you
have to receive up

480
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:34,830
and so this is Jess the end you know
just the same thing

481
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:38,169
it's just gonna listen for sponse as you
get something like this

482
00:29:38,169 --> 00:29:43,500
you can kinda threat so this is like

483
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:46,980
ever hear Jourdan starting at the line
so injured

484
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:50,090
a things is morn a fight so that's a TP
thing all

485
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:53,120
and upon together and re someone Korea

486
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,240
and then if you want responses number
into Google

487
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,750
and hell he was initially arrested but
they kinda breaks down like that when

488
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:01,660
she was ginger 11 a.m.

489
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:05,970
XR set that is that support them

490
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:10,270
and decoded have lost ours

491
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:12,650
diesel it

492
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:19,650
X

493
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:30,380
page

494
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:41,560
us

495
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:50,060
all great up trial

496
00:30:56,899 --> 00:31:01,659
a even start sites great I'll try I have
never seen it all

497
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:05,200
ours decided like i you're done on

498
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:09,610
anti-religious tired handle

499
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:13,629
up yeah yeah that's right it's running

500
00:31:13,629 --> 00:31:16,879
another one now back cope so I'm

501
00:31:16,879 --> 00:31:20,990
what we'll do offer can bust up just get
a look at the campus packets

502
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:25,220
so I have

503
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:30,519
right now is let's back up at like I
have this device

504
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:33,600
right here a

505
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,840
in from this some using the USB

506
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:41,269
can it's around thanks sexy your sis is
relatively cheap

507
00:31:41,269 --> 00:31:44,610
I am and its not open source

508
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:48,470
that's from 8 devices but it is pretty
high speed

509
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:51,549
for can the nice thing about it is it
sure is up

510
00:31:51,549 --> 00:31:56,649
as I can devise moshe as a serial device
as a sector translation to it so this

511
00:31:56,649 --> 00:31:57,139
one

512
00:31:57,139 --> 00:32:02,529
as a straw USB does dusk and so you can
track to talk to I haven't had much

513
00:32:02,529 --> 00:32:03,950
props and 0 ones either

514
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:07,759
um electric apparently if you're going
to use

515
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:13,250
at fault are one from China I'm eyebrow

516
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:16,850
and the count like a little dogle kinda
like this guy on

517
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:22,429
the they're using them protocol they
don't work directly with bonsai pecan

518
00:32:22,429 --> 00:32:26,929
in so you have to use a caramel sniffer
for I'm

519
00:32:26,929 --> 00:32:30,630
but this guy's a nice one I think that
set the

520
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:34,460
talks disconnected

521
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:38,400
the so

522
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,500
it really just a little index as a cans
their device

523
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:47,270
and they need to set the scene I'll and
that honor a quick

524
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:52,000
so here to use IP link

525
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,690
and he's a bit rate so this particular
vehicles

526
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:59,620
campus runs at 500 K sky

527
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:03,169
tell a speedy use so

528
00:33:03,169 --> 00:33:09,090
a problem

529
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:10,710
to

530
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:16,330
back

531
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:19,940
out I'm not like them that's on a
sandbank so you should play a sniffer

532
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:23,460
into you have any port I like now

533
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:26,810
acting scar

534
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:31,200
alive demonize so anyway this are
suckers like touch right

535
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,570
had so we're seeing here is this is that
arbitration ID

536
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:38,740
r us talking about and then you have
your size

537
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:43,220
three bites a pet's on what times I've
most vehicles rushed this

538
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:47,390
always be eaten there's pat it out here
zeros are App Store sometimes a

539
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:51,150
I'll and so this this is the can

540
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:54,540
actually not much to it spars it bites
down

541
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:57,740
reverse engineering it's not too hard I
but this view

542
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:01,480
as you know this kind sucks aunts had

543
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:05,770
missus where you can use Wireshark this
is a good reason why you would want to

544
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:06,070
know

545
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:10,040
on is just too much data is flowing
through if you've ever used Wireshark on

546
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:10,700
what

547
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:13,770
takes into parts but I with the sector

548
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:17,490
and generate $1.4 them in a very fine

549
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:20,720
because it varies for each make and
model and even year

550
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:23,760
iron you can ride the sector

551
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,600
free trial version I rode away in my
shirt so when I wanna for

552
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,819
fusion you know and now I'm on again GM
Buick or whatever

553
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:34,690
and just had a changes that sector I'm
so it doesn't work very well I just

554
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:38,360
costly scrolls the way you really want
to do it is

555
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:42,610
group it by the arbitration ID in this
case came just as a cancer for

556
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:47,210
honest moshe chiles you ever were cash
reverses hearing one that third use a

557
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:49,280
reverse engineering this is how

558
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,490
don't do it I am and what just happened
there

559
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:55,830
is a group some by ID the buying

560
00:34:55,830 --> 00:35:00,360
that is ready to bite that are changing
I am the reason why disappeared

561
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:04,800
is because can packets for Ron at set
intervals for the most part

562
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,330
it seems like a heartbeat kinda DL
sometimes a trigger

563
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:11,680
I could or like the trigger on that was
that constantly playing and summer

564
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,410
sniffers

565
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:16,590
when they see the same packet happening
the same data ever going to just remove

566
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:17,510
it from your view

567
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:20,920
as you probably don't need rehearsing is
obviously not active

568
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:24,690
act on some this case one it's costly
changes whatever I D

569
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:26,700
128 138 Dr

570
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:29,700
but this is the way when reversing
you're gonna wanna do a

571
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,950
I'm gonna go through this actually doing
it

572
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:37,590
that books arafat

573
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:41,160
I'll yet you wanna go a kayak is a not
too bad one

574
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:44,520
this one is a sucky candy it's written
in Java runs on all platforms

575
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:47,930
has picked a screenshot account like
because I'll

576
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:51,580
we can do is we do for her out a piece
of

577
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:56,570
can you know this by offset I'll miss
running in this case GPS top you can

578
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:57,090
mark

579
00:35:57,090 --> 00:36:00,520
slatted the supplier to it will use
OpenStreetMap

580
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:03,550
and said he recorded in vehicle driving
that has

581
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:07,150
I'm watching LOST to going on and I can
bus

582
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:10,540
you gonna slap them over here you know
what I'm out for whatever

583
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:15,140
but it's also dials site that's if you
assume I heard Isles harassment cluster

584
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:18,910
all that it it supports is that the fine
what bite

585
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:23,040
does what and they can just remember so
it's a good you tell the open-source

586
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:26,330
so

587
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:30,660
whenever I do hackathons this seems the
Beeb main method are based comfortable

588
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:31,860
with I'll

589
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:34,950
1i is the first to tell you I was canned
up and that

590
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:38,460
don't everything one and ice is about it
is you can't dump

591
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:41,970
on whatever you're doing say fire ever
since chair

592
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:45,670
I think the process is that right door
locks I am

593
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:48,900
to you basically sake and Dom

594
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:52,570
dump it off I'll you want the car stop
it up

595
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:56,690
I am any play i dont back a the doors
are locked

596
00:36:56,690 --> 00:37:00,580
and it's a matter of if not then it's
probably under bus

597
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:03,680
I answered the door the lock great way
of packet

598
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:08,130
so the easiest method is to just delete
after the data and then play that apec

599
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:11,670
if it does I lock it to me other half
therapy

600
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:15,200
and not sure about I you how the packet
that unlocks it and then click the

601
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,730
button side at the fair which by that
was

602
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:20,040
I'm it's a pretty brain-dead method that
works fairly well

603
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,780
on what you're going to get a lot of
times doing that matters you're going to

604
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:24,090
get the Christmas tree a factor

605
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:27,710
as requester that means that all the
lights here with use a turn on

606
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:32,130
Blanton I some big deal I we're doing
this I guess is editor

607
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:35,560
more destructive map it but with can its

608
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,980
it's pretty resilient

609
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:40,530
I if you like really kind of the car
going this year is turn off the car

610
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:43,810
turned back on every sets everything are
a big deal

611
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:48,610
I'll I have seen has think a little
worse on occasion

612
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:53,220
I'm and that to worst case in this case
you have to disconnect the battery

613
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:56,720
I'll that that that happen on

614
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:01,720
justice Cup occasions I while in time
the car actually would turn off in with

615
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,600
the keys my hand

616
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:07,600
that was a little scary i havent again
it is this disc timing and

617
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:10,610
the thing is you may have opposing views
as to just because they're some capacity

618
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:11,380
stuff

619
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:15,500
I but for this or the other way as if
you're

620
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:19,090
done like in this case on that one cast
episode is only two

621
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:22,800
ID's are active because most part the
car removed I'm you wouldn't have to

622
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,320
snap at you cuz I bought

623
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,640
but on normal system we do the ICC I'm
taking I'll

624
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:30,730
reeled out drying and there is a lot
more packets yet sort through

625
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:34,970
are so this is a quick map it ok ok I
get this mother us

626
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:39,790
I but still cell

627
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:43,670
now ICC on the way it works again as you
have to have I'll

628
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:47,800
models fans running you have one for
your simulator

629
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:51,980
it a lot a I'll yeah and if you don't
have can set up there's a

630
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:54,870
shell script here for supper here
virtual can say they're really nice

631
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:56,070
feature sake can

632
00:38:56,070 --> 00:39:00,580
she don't I'll a heads up you don't
really unique and that the play law

633
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:04,720
just a fun X and they can do virtual
campus sellers

634
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:11,720
SAP I sometime be can 0 alright

635
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:20,260
and sprang up on so as TS request rwanda
has the controls and you basically just

636
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:21,040
how I now

637
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,110
a which bus stop on so

638
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:31,110
writes i mean sea like I've been like
that you know it's connected

639
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:36,650
and I have a area I and this guy works
for the keyboard or

640
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:40,040
I just on the a fine writer Brett
modified or

641
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:44,200
Sony Playstation 3 trailer I'll to a hot
start that one out

642
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:47,850
i'd like he's in the car better us

643
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:54,850
actors

644
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:03,920
specially selected on

645
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,740
yeah the force be back subtly working at
five so I'm

646
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:11,740
way or six are just like you would any
kinda game

647
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:15,130
com things he had no I we also have

648
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:19,810
door lock and unlock cell doors unlocked
elsa slightly take which door she want

649
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:20,410
to unlock

650
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:24,280
com the way these commander working as

651
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:27,740
you are lock unlock your downline
impress the other

652
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:31,430
I'll wait hold on to going what it's
like when the buttons

653
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:35,470
and then coming every returning turn
signals were so

654
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:39,310
I after looking at this 10 also play

655
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:43,330
background data solace to cancer

656
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:49,010
about on I HM get so this is closer to
what you get

657
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:52,140
real vehicle sarcastically have a lot
more data

658
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:59,140
I'm so we r on one guy showing a running
multiple

659
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:02,930
abs like this I mean it's great for a
simulation perspective but

660
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:06,140
I am you have to have the one that does
control highlighted

661
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:10,550
a cease-fire markings around cell

662
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:14,630
in this data somewhere is what we need
to reverse

663
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:17,980
hasn't challenge us as the first
challenge us over until

664
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:24,980
I'll is behind it said I can pack it all
up his act lik three door simultaneously

665
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:31,860
and I think for title to support
identify the stores

666
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:35,550
so were I'm gonna do here someone to
change

667
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:40,180
size at this screen a little bit set
fits:

668
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:47,180
that their its effect this

669
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:52,130
I'm trying to here and elsewhere as I'm
trying to these

670
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:57,390
can he stay the same spot and as a
foreign bank and information

671
00:41:57,390 --> 00:42:00,980
in competency that passer to I'll

672
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:04,540
as I think that I had it when you see i
SAT be running I'm

673
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:07,890
cat a it's just cycling it's just the

674
00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:10,890
Contreras packets going through I
Hartzell

675
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:14,230
let's go back to try our on this one was
door locks

676
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:18,220
perceiving for out which one does door
%ah

677
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:23,620
my cycle through unlocking and locking
all the doors

678
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:28,410
and tractor which packages and so are
looking for here

679
00:42:28,410 --> 00:42:32,160
room for one bite change I wanna ride or
so unlock

680
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:36,350
lock IOC ok

681
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:39,670
I tree think it is

682
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:43,600
a day

683
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:50,320
164 a there a lot

684
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:53,530
oxo or stance was heavy ass and the

685
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:57,010
AB up track time saw her

686
00:42:57,010 --> 00:43:00,030
Jeff I'm so now

687
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:04,090
a are also and 64

688
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:10,100
missing

689
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:15,730
fires again now look at this crack at it
other

690
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:21,030
on it are cell if this buyer hey right
back

691
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:28,030
house I'll homes

692
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:29,290
it

693
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:32,800
on yeah so we have to do we can use can
send

694
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:39,800
to send that package sand

695
00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:47,630
and so I these can send I'll really I do
it she said that the

696
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:51,490
saying I D iron and then your

697
00:43:51,490 --> 00:43:54,620
year bites all

698
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:57,940
to hear watch a salamander to see

699
00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:03,710
going to put this down I

700
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:07,880
so we're gonna ok that's how it works
until 10:00

701
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:10,910
I think they're tears

702
00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:14,450
okay so 10 doors unlocked past F

703
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:17,490
a lot there's nothing worse on

704
00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:21,070
real cars as well eyelash the database
in the background check from a Honda

705
00:44:21,070 --> 00:44:25,330
and so now for playing with us are I
just said that one

706
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:28,890
so a lot you know three or so what I

707
00:44:28,890 --> 00:44:32,100
ok again and

708
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:37,540
SCADA to three this time and seeing how
to see how they're just using

709
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:40,770
bits at a place to control which stores
actually getting a lot

710
00:44:40,770 --> 00:44:44,630
and is a pretty common Tom some time to
see it also provides use for trunk but

711
00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:47,690
not always of something be aware of a

712
00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:51,010
mean testing this so still

713
00:44:51,010 --> 00:44:55,400
and this one is a trigger to that so
that this one thing by CC meyers is

714
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:56,090
doing all

715
00:44:56,090 --> 00:45:00,580
the RPM's as a cop cycle I turning
little bit different and then the

716
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:04,530
I am the highest when you what happens
so let's do

717
00:45:04,530 --> 00:45:07,710
the turn signal are looking for late
elimination

718
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:14,270
scale back up this make a sensor but so
far

719
00:45:14,270 --> 00:45:18,940
and stuff okay so

720
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:25,069
that's their returning

721
00:45:25,069 --> 00:45:25,750
area

722
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:29,329
alright so that is the right turn signal

723
00:45:29,329 --> 00:45:33,020
so something should be alternating I'd
up also

724
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:39,020
whatever that's going green think it's

725
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:42,339
one-a-day and shine

726
00:45:42,339 --> 00:45:46,160
social interaction acts are you feeling
well and he seemed like an add-on

727
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,460
01 and if I go right going to

728
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:53,569
so what do you think I am ever do that

729
00:45:53,569 --> 00:45:57,660
or into account was the challenges
remedies hazard lights by the way

730
00:45:57,660 --> 00:46:00,760
I'm so try to fall want to hazard lights

731
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:04,450
and I'm so anything can be for Thai has
a late

732
00:46:04,450 --> 00:46:08,290
say effort

733
00:46:08,290 --> 00:46:15,290
right

734
00:46:17,630 --> 00:46:23,410
way

735
00:46:23,410 --> 00:46:27,619
now thing as a s I am capital to bring
out but

736
00:46:27,619 --> 00:46:31,100
it's going to have to be and I'll a

737
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:34,260
us cares a cool head flashlight what's
real quick

738
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:38,750
so if you are but the solu- you go to
control hazard lights

739
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:45,010
up and fast cash Visa norming are smart
group when we all have our laptops but

740
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:45,800
I'll be doing this

741
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:49,420
initially and so that the point here is
a great looking I had to make a loop

742
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:52,820
and if I make it typically at the speed
of a typical turn signal

743
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:56,880
up the next one as his RPM's

744
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:01,730
and so the RPM's the council Akai hurts
the hazards

745
00:47:01,730 --> 00:47:06,310
I'll is a makes that are like 120 or
something I i

746
00:47:06,310 --> 00:47:09,340
currently have it set to Kapow

747
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:12,600
at ninety I'm not actually forced the
backspace key camera

748
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:16,940
as a bike messenger right now I you cash
mccorvey what

749
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:20,470
by the famous the more complicated but
this particular a

750
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:23,490
example is that this is

751
00:47:23,490 --> 00:47:27,950
can be a little hard to find is always
talking and um

752
00:47:27,950 --> 00:47:34,950
you're going to have to be speed up
let's go ahead especially can't find it

753
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:46,480
so it's ok sorry same risk as I Harry
going up arms to hold it down for a

754
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:46,730
while

755
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:49,950
and so they're gonna speed is typically
two bites

756
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:53,190
not won by so look for mechanical and
backup

757
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:56,410
smart precision think I'm going down its
I'll

758
00:47:56,410 --> 00:48:00,400
see patient lying down I'm going to up
and seeing

759
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:04,880
accident I'll

760
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:08,020
yep to play for and so

761
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:11,320
I'll right after making a loop just for
time

762
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:14,670
but at are you do is you broadcasters to
about

763
00:48:14,670 --> 00:48:17,710
higher number there you wanna go faster
than the

764
00:48:17,710 --> 00:48:21,690
the actual cycle counter so for 244 as
quite right there

765
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:25,980
so like a point2 I can see just how if
at some point in all seconds

766
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:30,070
I am were crappy you look for that
particular signal and immediately said

767
00:48:30,070 --> 00:48:30,770
afterwards

768
00:48:30,770 --> 00:48:35,270
I'm that will prevent from flooding the
bus if you flood the bus too quickly

769
00:48:35,270 --> 00:48:39,000
and just see you don't put a delay in
Air coding just blasted

770
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:43,150
you can shut the engine down I think
will happen is angel go into limp mode

771
00:48:43,150 --> 00:48:47,190
which is like a 35 mile per hour kinda
ok we should grab a point that

772
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:51,340
should do this while driving I but it
didn't

773
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:54,410
and that's that's what would happen I'm
usually um

774
00:48:54,410 --> 00:48:58,030
I would never do that playback 1 the
white one relatively safe to do

775
00:48:58,030 --> 00:49:01,620
that's really when the car sitting there
if you're driving your plane back after

776
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:02,010
Dom

777
00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:05,220
that some really bad really really bad
idea

778
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:10,140
even in a rental car bad

779
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:13,040
scare you guys come back to it for

780
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:16,590
did mr okay call so

781
00:49:16,590 --> 00:49:20,440
the membranes is a CC your hair

782
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:24,040
I am dip a little more from Jack your
this guy was built

783
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:28,369
I'll from point parts of the Jaccard it
costs around well over 100 US dollars

784
00:49:28,369 --> 00:49:32,260
on this is the one that is they will
cost some money america's metal and

785
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:33,650
performance shares like to use it

786
00:49:33,650 --> 00:49:37,650
pretty much nobody buys the other parts
the security related parts the mobilizer

787
00:49:37,650 --> 00:49:39,020
body control module

788
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:42,820
know if I sense requester I'm so you can
get on really cheap

789
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:46,130
and put monies together and so

790
00:49:46,130 --> 00:49:50,359
engine control has pretty much is the
main brands like I mentioned

791
00:49:50,359 --> 00:49:53,590
at has your ban numbers at how to
control your speed

792
00:49:53,590 --> 00:49:56,780
all that stuff I'll other issues

793
00:49:56,780 --> 00:50:00,490
are you tired toobin model type stuff
like that the body control module

794
00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:04,420
on there's a bunch of different models
is a bunch different sensors

795
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:07,960
again getting anywhere on the wires on
wall digest see

796
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:11,400
access to stuff there and the nursing
wanna oftentimes

797
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:14,880
going between your body control and your
ECU the

798
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:18,890
as bus lines ok factors to that are not
expose to the OBD

799
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:23,210
I am PCA a line it's not expose as a
great one snap on

800
00:50:23,210 --> 00:50:26,490
I'm tests typically with a key
negotiations happened and stuff

801
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:29,770
so to build your own

802
00:50:29,770 --> 00:50:33,160
I am to Creekside go to the Jaccard I am

803
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:36,730
you might just go get the parts you're
going to get wiring diagrams

804
00:50:36,730 --> 00:50:40,980
I and a wiring diagram your pressure at
the pay for most likely

805
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:44,060
I'm but they're not too expensive I am

806
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:48,900
netscape online sites I think I to
please one cartel

807
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:52,010
Mitchell one and Mitchell line and I
think

808
00:50:52,010 --> 00:50:55,330
on things like 17 bucks or something
it's like I some

809
00:50:55,330 --> 00:50:59,730
as scription bank I but I basically just
cherokee d ass that are really easy to

810
00:50:59,730 --> 00:51:00,100
say

811
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:03,790
I'll yes poster but I keep on hand

812
00:51:03,790 --> 00:51:07,640
on and so I hear as what they have a
look like they're different than a

813
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:09,630
schematic you're looking in on a
schematic

814
00:51:09,630 --> 00:51:12,780
the broken down into their functionality

815
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:16,869
and what do you still not there there
the pretty nice also be a whole

816
00:51:16,869 --> 00:51:19,520
I may be five sheets on just your power

817
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:22,690
and I'll be a bunch on ground and the
year initially end up crying that's the

818
00:51:22,690 --> 00:51:24,430
first thing I start with the for al

819
00:51:24,430 --> 00:51:28,280
their electoral votes coming out which
ones the plug into pre CEO

820
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:32,430
bare minimum I mean you can't get by Pam
first test bench was simply just

821
00:51:32,430 --> 00:51:37,380
ECU and the connector um and that's
great I mean you get packets are making

822
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:38,810
drivers that works fine for that

823
00:51:38,810 --> 00:51:42,890
the promise I'll you go out the back you
know I control

824
00:51:42,890 --> 00:51:45,910
I'll for this particular guy

825
00:51:45,910 --> 00:51:48,930
I what I have to lecture capabilities
and that

826
00:51:48,930 --> 00:51:52,150
on for going for demo and for those its

827
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:55,990
you really have to look at but piece you
want to I am

828
00:51:55,990 --> 00:52:00,570
step and so like a cat I want to figure
out like the crankshaft position sensor

829
00:52:00,570 --> 00:52:04,440
I'm up for sliders affair which wires
and this case

830
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:07,990
I see that it's 10:27 on scene to

831
00:52:07,990 --> 00:52:12,350
300 readers our midterm is is both
possible that connects the crankshaft

832
00:52:12,350 --> 00:52:15,490
and then you can specify out that you
know it's

833
00:52:15,490 --> 00:52:19,000
hell yea we'll see you on c2 and c3
teachers and that all

834
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,010
and then you have to literally by fine

835
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:25,810
and 27 I am and that's that's on you
gonna break out

836
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:30,230
and I fear I am unfamiliar with some
unease

837
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:34,250
I just really with engulfed Wikipedia or
somewhere else a crankshaft work

838
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:40,410
and yankus at and then the

839
00:52:40,410 --> 00:52:46,210
I I have no idea what's going on just
like this where now

840
00:52:46,210 --> 00:52:51,720
uncut that analog by the top and assess
more traditional at the bottom and

841
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:52,290
various

842
00:52:52,290 --> 00:52:55,770
as that which one your car's going to
use on whether it's Mr

843
00:52:55,770 --> 00:52:59,370
are relatively simple to taking art we
know and simulate

844
00:52:59,370 --> 00:53:02,640
the signals r-ala or digital it's not a
big deal

845
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:07,080
the speed is just how quickly they go by
so you had a potentiometer

846
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:10,270
I have I see on the screen to happen
right here

847
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:14,840
I am at a pot tonight we know that
simply controls to delay

848
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:17,980
on that those pants at to the pressure
sensor

849
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:23,160
and I'll controlling or can sometimes be
the other ones I have said this this

850
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:24,450
particular yet here

851
00:53:24,450 --> 00:53:28,900
a setup that I am messes up on a

852
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:32,420
display you can control via mister potts
and

853
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:35,759
see if we can I'm russians watch and
dislike it so this is PIL

854
00:53:35,759 --> 00:53:38,769
and this one over here to read these are
just resistance is on adding

855
00:53:38,769 --> 00:53:42,599
and so a change the here you can see the
Dow is up

856
00:53:42,599 --> 00:53:47,150
there and then we can do temperature

857
00:53:47,150 --> 00:53:53,219
engine town area

858
00:53:53,219 --> 00:53:57,019
over and I am yeah

859
00:53:57,019 --> 00:54:02,859
so act so not happening here is
worsening and records the ECU

860
00:54:02,859 --> 00:54:07,579
and yes rick officers just listening on
a campus so it works just like

861
00:54:07,579 --> 00:54:11,150
yessss anywhere answer for for that I am

862
00:54:11,150 --> 00:54:17,539
I'm ask for help us with our lives by

863
00:54:17,539 --> 00:54:21,749
axo that's just normal can 0 a cancer

864
00:54:21,749 --> 00:54:24,759
RI sell its to

865
00:54:24,759 --> 00:54:28,869
I am stiff your first

866
00:54:28,869 --> 00:54:33,130
so throughout ice are changing and

867
00:54:33,130 --> 00:54:36,150
says the hair have just a few on there
we can see right away

868
00:54:36,150 --> 00:54:39,969
I like a new one popped up II act justly
it for that

869
00:54:39,969 --> 00:54:43,049
a rat rat for tech house drop it to

870
00:54:43,049 --> 00:54:46,269
no gas and so it goes down

871
00:54:46,269 --> 00:54:50,579
and there's no gas has three away 10
second by

872
00:54:50,579 --> 00:54:55,009
controls the gas I'll so

873
00:54:55,009 --> 00:55:01,460
Indo butts flood a plea to have
scriptures console

874
00:55:01,460 --> 00:55:03,590
are

875
00:55:03,590 --> 00:55:08,620
cells through 8 G

876
00:55:08,620 --> 00:55:15,120
activity time at

877
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:22,120
there

878
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:32,119
yeah that I should so I make sure that
this is

879
00:55:32,119 --> 00:55:35,349
actually nothing sorry on

880
00:55:35,349 --> 00:55:38,499
yeah 308 an organ activity of I sell

881
00:55:38,499 --> 00:55:41,710
here is just a shell script our season
can send

882
00:55:41,710 --> 00:55:44,769
sitting for one sec sought

883
00:55:44,769 --> 00:55:48,549
at fuel at

884
00:55:48,549 --> 00:55:54,999
quite how I separate device but we don't
know yet so that was a Sierra line can

885
00:55:54,999 --> 00:55:58,730
so as a three things are going to see
inside can you see there can

886
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:02,390
I so cannot see a line and then be
cameras virtual cat

887
00:56:02,390 --> 00:56:05,779
I am if you using a physical device are
you have SL

888
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:09,490
or can an S O just means a is a cheaper
devices

889
00:56:09,490 --> 00:56:13,049
serial that I guess I didn't have a
problem using

890
00:56:13,049 --> 00:56:17,009
ASSOCHAM um some flooding and but I'm
not seeing it

891
00:56:17,009 --> 00:56:22,359
go up that it well there goes your

892
00:56:22,359 --> 00:56:26,539
that was happening there is like because
I caravan to get the right Spain

893
00:56:26,539 --> 00:56:30,200
where the right kill and see if you want
to override it

894
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:34,700
again only better to listen and ascent
weird issues and a basic shell script

895
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:39,190
are controlling it on the vehicle a
reason and the exact same method

896
00:56:39,190 --> 00:56:43,749
that we would use I see some and it
works on a rock are

897
00:56:43,749 --> 00:56:46,849
ICC actually can't quite broadcaster can

898
00:56:46,849 --> 00:56:50,670
or recommended I am but that's always
been there

899
00:56:50,670 --> 00:56:54,589
I am for the point that if we want to do
some modifications weakening

900
00:56:54,589 --> 00:56:59,069
from national car game controller I'm
does have quite come apart at

901
00:56:59,069 --> 00:57:02,960
but it'll most likely happen so

902
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:08,029
now now I'm so Billy suspensions again
it's it's nice to have a month

903
00:57:08,029 --> 00:57:11,589
the workmen fired asses as a going on to
your garage or wherever

904
00:57:11,589 --> 00:57:16,279
I'll but you gotta tell how quickly it
is to identify these packets compare to

905
00:57:16,279 --> 00:57:18,660
IC sally has all the real can data

906
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:24,049
fine by as well I'll one method to do a
real card how limits on us of users

907
00:57:24,049 --> 00:57:27,609
for some the devices you don't care
about I'm just look at what his control

908
00:57:27,609 --> 00:57:28,069
what

909
00:57:28,069 --> 00:57:31,359
disconnected from your car elements from
the noise I'm

910
00:57:31,359 --> 00:57:35,140
it's the same are set up as a test bench
but especially really really quick

911
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:38,490
the certain signals you want to know
whatever the reason us

912
00:57:38,490 --> 00:57:42,020
I am you can base it just look at the
wiring diagram for what that

913
00:57:42,020 --> 00:57:45,520
wired is some like that saying aw and
check it out

914
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:49,400
and then you have an hour comic for one
car and takes

915
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:54,000
very low out I'm its

916
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,470
or go back to this guy okay at this

917
00:57:57,470 --> 00:58:00,980
at so

918
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:05,300
over I just like I said before I am is
just a group that

919
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:08,940
roy et Macon setup I

920
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:12,740
here if you're looking up at one area in
just 11 on

921
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:16,150
we have our Twitter account and its

922
00:58:16,150 --> 00:58:20,310
when I did this in Cincinnati Ohio it
was a lot of performance tuners and

923
00:58:20,310 --> 00:58:21,060
mechanics

924
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:24,490
I recent move to Seattle and their

925
00:58:24,490 --> 00:58:27,690
its charmelot a burning Man people so
it's a

926
00:58:27,690 --> 00:58:31,100
defender people I different ideas I'm

927
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:34,300
I haven't really been a group that that
primarily security

928
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:37,520
I'll by Detroit's hands on you and so
whatever you feel like doing

929
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:41,100
I'm should just go and start your own
they don't again cost anything

930
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:45,340
I recommand com you know there is I'm
gonna release it

931
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:48,400
prior an hour to there's a character she

932
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:52,700
I can design and playing with three
basic fill out what you wear congrats be

933
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:56,070
our past stuff you have there if there
is I'll

934
00:58:56,070 --> 00:59:00,580
parking available that kinda stuff we do
this in Cincinnati we didn't have obey

935
00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:04,250
I'm so you don't think don't think you
have to have my casual mechanic shop to

936
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:04,960
work on these

937
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:07,970
really just wanna set a time once a
month

938
00:59:07,970 --> 00:59:11,210
typically what I do we get together to
talk about you working on

939
00:59:11,210 --> 00:59:14,360
and then either para people or are you

940
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:17,600
owners have a reason that kinda have an
update a month you know kind is that

941
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:19,840
incentive to keep working on things
aside

942
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:24,120
I'll it was really really helpful I'm my
came to find other people

943
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:27,770
building this test bench from a purse I
don't want I am

944
00:59:27,770 --> 00:59:31,940
I was work at mechanic is again a
problem like we think Saturday and noon

945
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:36,090
Helen no worries at all I'm used to
working looking at SCA max life personal

946
00:59:36,090 --> 00:59:37,280
wiring diagram it

947
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:41,310
did not make any sense to missus book
well-off are scattered everywhere

948
00:59:41,310 --> 00:59:44,660
is like you know it's made sense later
like okay what you're working on your

949
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:46,830
napkin it hears only the larger care
about

950
00:59:46,830 --> 00:59:50,430
but I'm used to seeing it as a blown-out
completely new products are completely

951
00:59:50,430 --> 00:59:50,750
from

952
00:59:50,750 --> 00:59:54,630
possible dream I'm so you know it really
helped to go through that

953
00:59:54,630 --> 00:59:58,520
and really helped learning curve to
recommend i've seen also where people

954
00:59:58,520 --> 00:59:59,320
have done

955
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:02,350
no contract within that many online I'll

956
01:00:02,350 --> 01:00:05,840
in whatever works for you that doesn't
matter you should make an area

957
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:10,260
and you have a topic-specific for your
stop your car Sadies a motorcycle's

958
01:00:10,260 --> 01:00:13,660
spine till but it's good idea to create
one

959
01:00:13,660 --> 01:00:18,400
we have half a sandwich article

960
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:21,570
so I'm sick and I guess we we learn how
to

961
01:00:21,570 --> 01:00:25,570
I basically look what does what so ever
because of your controls

962
01:00:25,570 --> 01:00:29,000
whatever peace you're looking at and
that's great all om

963
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:33,500
and but i think thats not a big deal me
I see her maybe people knows exactly

964
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:34,740
what those are so

965
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:39,030
don't you know do that missed a couple I
figured out how to control your breaks

966
01:00:39,030 --> 01:00:41,340
by sending the message that controls
breaks cuz that

967
01:00:41,340 --> 01:00:46,360
pack Expo soco process what does here to
contact an OEM side at this back to

968
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:48,760
control your brakes beating nobody
controls

969
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:52,620
um though so you have information you
want it's twenty-five thousand dollars

970
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:53,500
but now though

971
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:57,690
possibility a I'll dealerships to buy it
when the main problems

972
01:00:57,690 --> 01:01:00,990
I'm with that had to stop this to
collect the troubleshooting

973
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:04,640
like a mom pop mechanic I mccaffery like
how that information

974
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:09,270
to because we create has says all year
power when I was working fine

975
01:01:09,270 --> 01:01:13,070
but obviously it's not I you really like
to know that state what's the packet

976
01:01:13,070 --> 01:01:14,270
that senate is enough

977
01:01:14,270 --> 01:01:18,200
you know cokie can delay some the sensor
side and you can see that the can

978
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:22,060
packets been set the controls the window
I'm is like going down you can

979
01:01:22,060 --> 01:01:27,170
quickly identified its cap I but because
it's 25 gram per make and model

980
01:01:27,170 --> 01:01:30,800
and if you work on more than one make
and model you're not going to afford

981
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:31,300
that

982
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:35,900
so mechanics in a reversal share this
opinion have that information as well

983
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:39,860
the current workaround i've seen is that
people will take

984
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:43,440
com some how about some cheaper devices

985
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:47,220
our the reverse engineered summer that
affirmation and then you can kinda

986
01:01:47,220 --> 01:01:50,270
message was that way so from a security
perspective

987
01:01:50,270 --> 01:01:54,000
what you need to do is this is only one
piece that you with an weaponize

988
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:58,700
so if you want to you know control the
brakes or control the steering

989
01:01:58,700 --> 01:02:01,720
I'm knowing how to do its that's your
first step but he

990
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:07,130
done anything yet you going on in the
next find and exploit and so

991
01:02:07,130 --> 01:02:11,880
the exploits will typically be I'll my
guess that the sexy ones

992
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:15,160
our wireless and so you can go after
telecom attics

993
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:18,289
where you can go after the effort a
minute most I'm I could be on star

994
01:02:18,289 --> 01:02:18,809
whatever

995
01:02:18,809 --> 01:02:23,380
I but that's we're gonna find a stop and
then you're going to put it into a

996
01:02:23,380 --> 01:02:26,500
Pakistan are popping up at times Costco

997
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:31,260
shelter forum by that's the thing that's
your payload as a severing been shower

998
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:32,569
whatever you open up

999
01:02:32,569 --> 01:02:36,359
whatever their driver devices and you
can write this bites to it and you don't

1000
01:02:36,359 --> 01:02:37,569
I put into a look

1001
01:02:37,569 --> 01:02:41,440
I'll thats that's the main key now

1002
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:46,240
as this is progressing you know we're
starting to get to a point where

1003
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:49,940
I there's least discussion on monitoring
the bus

1004
01:02:49,940 --> 01:02:53,500
getting more more I a

1005
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:57,079
kinda like a a baseline for what your
carcinoma talking at

1006
01:02:57,079 --> 01:03:00,920
so when something less just gets on your
vehicle and try to do something maybe

1007
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:01,950
you can identify

1008
01:03:01,950 --> 01:03:05,420
many can see that all this is different
than normal and you can have a red flag

1009
01:03:05,420 --> 01:03:09,839
whatever so I am I'll show you two are
rodents from me

1010
01:03:09,839 --> 01:03:13,529
I guess releasing here at troopers and
it will let you

1011
01:03:13,529 --> 01:03:18,380
identify the type a car your honor out
the name packets to it therefore

1012
01:03:18,380 --> 01:03:21,660
the things you don't want to because
that these parts are used in

1013
01:03:21,660 --> 01:03:25,940
a bunch of chemicals and you know that
the scene she sent on GGM some

1014
01:03:25,940 --> 01:03:30,099
that I on the navigation system I have a
season much pickup trucks

1015
01:03:30,099 --> 01:03:34,210
setting the packet you think is going to
race may not do it in the other vehicles

1016
01:03:34,210 --> 01:03:37,779
to really get a baseline any one method
of course is the query

1017
01:03:37,779 --> 01:03:41,049
the been number which we could do in
terms of riot

1018
01:03:41,049 --> 01:03:45,190
the right vehicle at by but I Jared
packets here ever to me is not going to

1019
01:03:45,190 --> 01:03:46,210
ask for the VIN number

1020
01:03:46,210 --> 01:03:50,510
on so you wonder passively sorrow talk
what's you up

1021
01:03:50,510 --> 01:03:53,680
I'll I don't think I actress life
support but I

1022
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:57,109
I can show it to you socio out is on

1023
01:03:57,109 --> 01:04:00,770
I get home I its also if you do Ruby

1024
01:04:00,770 --> 01:04:06,770
and you can just do a gem install for
CEO of and this is a passive fingerprint

1025
01:04:06,770 --> 01:04:07,880
what can I think there's

1026
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:13,170
I'll little-known fact is way before P
left was written which is that

1027
01:04:13,170 --> 01:04:16,279
passing a plan to offer networking I did
a perfect answer for that

1028
01:04:16,279 --> 01:04:20,769
sir kinda made sense that I would do it
for 10 and so I didn't so

1029
01:04:20,769 --> 01:04:25,039
what happens here is it will do all or

1030
01:04:25,039 --> 01:04:29,109
so doubtful to it on pressure to get

1031
01:04:29,109 --> 01:04:33,059
ok so better on this asap if I have so
still up so sorry to help

1032
01:04:33,059 --> 01:04:36,130
so it has some capabilities

1033
01:04:36,130 --> 01:04:39,769
up you can give it a lot file you can
get a live bus

1034
01:04:39,769 --> 01:04:44,180
I am and it will analyze other can
packet that honors the stores

1035
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:48,869
not the the party to have her exploit

1036
01:04:48,869 --> 01:04:51,880
this is what you do use before you
export your your vehicle going on

1037
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:52,450
targeting

1038
01:04:52,450 --> 01:04:55,730
and so this is going to take a sample
what's going on

1039
01:04:55,730 --> 01:04:59,720
how of the sea certain things on where
the signals that vehicle

1040
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:03,039
the same padding that kinda stuff and so
all

1041
01:05:03,039 --> 01:05:10,039
for this example we're going to get a
lot I'll iPod Touch for Honda

1042
01:05:10,319 --> 01:05:13,599
to custom get

1043
01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:17,809
and then I'm going all sad print status
cash issue I

1044
01:05:17,809 --> 01:05:21,170
by Miss decisions and its

1045
01:05:21,170 --> 01:05:27,249
about fathers have attack

1046
01:05:27,249 --> 01:05:34,249
and us

1047
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:39,920
I'll yes thank you access the sky is the
packets

1048
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:43,420
and then so

1049
01:05:43,420 --> 01:05:46,890
typically your output is simply just as
Jason right here

1050
01:05:46,890 --> 01:05:50,100
and I didn't give a fingerprint database
I

1051
01:05:50,100 --> 01:05:53,530
I did it can then I def by the make
model and year harry knew it

1052
01:05:53,530 --> 01:05:58,660
Antrim I'll but typically this is just a
generic one set your car and vehicle you

1053
01:05:58,660 --> 01:06:00,320
know this because when I look at

1054
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:06,000
I'll here's your comment ID's and then
your mandy is 17 seniors is your man in

1055
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:06,500
trouble

1056
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:10,450
that kind terms that by looking at your
packet payload count here

1057
01:06:10,450 --> 01:06:14,520
and then your I am arbitration I D

1058
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:18,580
and so you can kinda just by glancing at
this Cassie that okay law

1059
01:06:18,580 --> 01:06:22,290
this is this is a common on as a action
a with this

1060
01:06:22,290 --> 01:06:26,110
now sample size we had up by the next
one is

1061
01:06:26,110 --> 01:06:29,210
here I and this is really a unique

1062
01:06:29,210 --> 01:06:32,670
astaire Pratt so what you would do in
your explico

1063
01:06:32,670 --> 01:06:37,590
as you would for you broadcast anything
you would basically just snap I

1064
01:06:37,590 --> 01:06:41,630
fries go this man I D one air and you
just listen

1065
01:06:41,630 --> 01:06:45,220
farm fresh and a 17 C and you only have
to listen

1066
01:06:45,220 --> 01:06:49,810
for this law if you don't see it and
this amount I'm run on vehicle

1067
01:06:49,810 --> 01:06:54,250
two sacks out onto anything I'm or you
can listen for another one if you have

1068
01:06:54,250 --> 01:06:55,110
more than one payload

1069
01:06:55,110 --> 01:06:58,190
on and services really anyway

1070
01:06:58,190 --> 01:07:02,030
a I am secretly inside only jumping on
things

1071
01:07:02,030 --> 01:07:05,360
up this also has a kinda about

1072
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:09,900
an extra feature in the stall and it is

1073
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:13,500
hours a day here it's a spatter thing so

1074
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:16,930
I not terribly love hockey minutes at
Lee

1075
01:07:16,930 --> 01:07:20,620
but it basically has one parent thing
right now where you can get a drink and

1076
01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:21,240
a pattern

1077
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:24,490
its criminal intakes I think the
characters P

1078
01:07:24,490 --> 01:07:28,680
and B if you're looking for capital be
and its gonna represent

1079
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:33,630
on our of and liking given a pattern of
say like on off on off

1080
01:07:33,630 --> 01:07:37,030
on on of and then have a listen to a
live bus

1081
01:07:37,030 --> 01:07:40,820
and then likes it here try to reverse
engineer like door locks you were just

1082
01:07:40,820 --> 01:07:41,620
follow a pattern

1083
01:07:41,620 --> 01:07:45,079
lock/unlock lock/unlock lakh lakh lakh
online

1084
01:07:45,079 --> 01:07:47,920
credit at all hereto and his office by
of that

1085
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:51,809
just find it for you on the

1086
01:07:51,809 --> 01:07:55,609
ID laws keep working on that one to
wrapping that's your thing is so that's

1087
01:07:55,609 --> 01:07:57,480
probably a greater than less than semel

1088
01:07:57,480 --> 01:08:01,319
I am going and going like speed there's
a rapping biases are

1089
01:08:01,319 --> 01:08:04,559
you know going up on a certain kar on
the not the changes

1090
01:08:04,559 --> 01:08:08,440
and so there have a couple patterns and
I'll just make your life a lot easier if

1091
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:10,030
you don't have to cut things that happen

1092
01:08:10,030 --> 01:08:13,099
broadcast on you know they can allies
lhasa data

1093
01:08:13,099 --> 01:08:17,160
single time on real time and so can I
think ours is a

1094
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:20,299
fruit or you can just a gem install to
get I'll

1095
01:08:20,299 --> 01:08:25,390
clean the other projects and you what
that will help you with your

1096
01:08:25,390 --> 01:08:28,839
exploitation so I'll

1097
01:08:28,839 --> 01:08:32,150
what do some questions iron

1098
01:08:32,150 --> 01:08:39,150
a question so far that that

1099
01:08:43,510 --> 01:08:48,059
to

1100
01:08:48,059 --> 01:08:52,349
I so there was a question does the bus
protocols apply to all vehicles

1101
01:08:52,349 --> 01:08:55,859
yes so all vehicles have buses now
they're going to be

1102
01:08:55,859 --> 01:08:59,029
different types so there are always
there always will have can

1103
01:08:59,029 --> 01:09:02,059
I always have that I'm

1104
01:09:02,059 --> 01:09:05,429
only stability credo BB

1105
01:09:05,429 --> 01:09:08,659
that's a standard I'll they may not use
it

1106
01:09:08,659 --> 01:09:12,900
for all the communication but although
that might have it for like com

1107
01:09:12,900 --> 01:09:17,940
sisters queers and values other lines
like a line Twp

1108
01:09:17,940 --> 01:09:21,639
obscene hours maybe for going to her
other communication I'm third there's

1109
01:09:21,639 --> 01:09:23,349
some things you can look up and pick out
the

1110
01:09:23,349 --> 01:09:27,750
Stephen work on the same way with work
can but that's gonna very

1111
01:09:27,750 --> 01:09:30,929
I'm per year mile but cannell exist
there

1112
01:09:30,929 --> 01:09:34,199
OBD packets will exist on anything

1113
01:09:34,199 --> 01:09:40,059
pre much about the year two thousand um
there is some proprietary modes and kids

1114
01:09:40,059 --> 01:09:43,659
for certain make some manufacturers and
I'm you can get those

1115
01:09:43,659 --> 01:09:46,739
maybe through report saying I don't know
how I would work for you

1116
01:09:46,739 --> 01:09:50,190
typically that the method if that is too
I

1117
01:09:50,190 --> 01:09:53,469
get a tour a dealership for comment just
use

1118
01:09:53,469 --> 01:09:57,000
I have one here I Y connector I

1119
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:01,260
much started acting but they see plays
on that and house

1120
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:04,809
was often to pigtails and then your
personal from one and by there too on

1121
01:10:04,809 --> 01:10:05,320
the other

1122
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:12,320
record K

1123
01:10:12,350 --> 01:10:14,630
yes can design all of the vehicles

1124
01:10:14,630 --> 01:10:20,040
yes

1125
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:23,970
and national parks I'm so Heather parts
are shared across much

1126
01:10:23,970 --> 01:10:27,790
of thunders and what not to seeing you
again that's the reason I wanna

1127
01:10:27,790 --> 01:10:31,140
tak that tactile what the OP running on

1128
01:10:31,140 --> 01:10:34,390
on its is also hard to figure that out
when I didn't

1129
01:10:34,390 --> 01:10:38,080
my iMac's wait for their Dr effort and
stuff

1130
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:42,320
I'll I didn't know that at the time as
all psychologists offer Honda

1131
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:45,510
blah blah I found out it's not and then
I didn't know how to even tell

1132
01:10:45,510 --> 01:10:51,350
work all the sack you know area

1133
01:10:51,350 --> 01:10:55,500
and

1134
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:59,170
so this is the real aid various

1135
01:10:59,170 --> 01:11:04,060
by the wind up with entertainment a
system date but they are

1136
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:07,370
research to pick for Surgeon & yeah
there's a whole company as I got me a

1137
01:11:07,370 --> 01:11:08,130
couple really

1138
01:11:08,130 --> 01:11:12,090
I'm that like Green River and stop that
may come for just about anybody and

1139
01:11:12,090 --> 01:11:15,990
30 ish reviews are those all different
types some I liked the 1i had of it

1140
01:11:15,990 --> 01:11:18,660
seems like a line so if your vehicle
doesn't scale I'm

1141
01:11:18,660 --> 01:11:22,150
you wouldn't necessarily have that one
but sometimes it's just a jumper setting

1142
01:11:22,150 --> 01:11:26,080
have a connection is other ones is
that's how a particular one as

1143
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:33,080
thank you very much from other questions

1144
01:11:34,130 --> 01:11:38,470
then I'll ask a question I am someone I
know created the service five-star

1145
01:11:38,470 --> 01:11:40,760
improvement program for automotive
security

1146
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:44,950
yes am evidence capturing the
demonstration just did

1147
01:11:44,950 --> 01:11:47,850
now that you talked about the
weaponization what kinda evidence

1148
01:11:47,850 --> 01:11:48,500
capture

1149
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:52,800
would be present in this case if someone
was to be able to exploit your steering

1150
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:53,500
column

1151
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:56,990
or breaks in motion um what i've seen

1152
01:11:56,990 --> 01:12:00,570
just about I'm on that's that's

1153
01:12:00,570 --> 01:12:03,330
what that's won a big reasons the
covered exists right now it's kinda

1154
01:12:03,330 --> 01:12:04,870
bring up from scary perspective

1155
01:12:04,870 --> 01:12:08,430
on some of the shortcomings for things
um

1156
01:12:08,430 --> 01:12:11,610
and there's there's varying reasons for
different stuff

1157
01:12:11,610 --> 01:12:15,760
I from scrapers but we see things like
an I go oh my god that's the worse is I

1158
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:16,310
never

1159
01:12:16,310 --> 01:12:20,320
I'll but is it really isn't for what its
the point of this

1160
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:23,380
on its way to get messages they're very
quickly it's very

1161
01:12:23,380 --> 01:12:26,930
fault-tolerant on environmental issues
yes why the

1162
01:12:26,930 --> 01:12:30,320
yet the two wires that separate on their
the voltage

1163
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:34,000
you know so with the Camry group

1164
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:38,580
I am at Sonic on the key parts thereof
the five stars that we need better

1165
01:12:38,580 --> 01:12:42,150
methodologies acting when things happen
on Airbus but also

1166
01:12:42,150 --> 01:12:45,980
what is a good state on work what is
entertainment units

1167
01:12:45,980 --> 01:12:49,360
supposed to be at work where the %ah
supposed to look like on is there any

1168
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:51,280
way to tell that something has been
modified

1169
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:55,330
and Carly that really isn't airbag
control or has some stuff I am

1170
01:12:55,330 --> 01:13:00,490
but thats thats a against more about
crash data for freshers companies

1171
01:13:00,490 --> 01:13:03,610
um so yeah

1172
01:13:03,610 --> 01:13:07,180
had have to say like if you were to do
one is export your profit which is fine

1173
01:13:07,180 --> 01:13:11,260
but did depending on

1174
01:13:11,260 --> 01:13:15,150
on your car make and model there is
quite a lot of information being stored

1175
01:13:15,150 --> 01:13:16,530
on

1176
01:13:16,530 --> 01:13:18,920
your logic controller stir lotsa buses

1177
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:22,320
some years at least it can buses in our
biggest

1178
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:26,590
cars and FlexRay as well and we store a
lot of data and the controllers and you

1179
01:13:26,590 --> 01:13:29,960
need that for accident analysis in need
that for um

1180
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:33,550
insurance stuff and Saunders pretty much

1181
01:13:33,550 --> 01:13:36,750
do you think you'd find the I could now

1182
01:13:36,750 --> 01:13:41,060
if that's the case where where would you
I'm that he can I don't know if

1183
01:13:41,060 --> 01:13:43,920
I don't know exactly if you could find
the package but you could probably

1184
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:44,600
figure out

1185
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:47,820
wat went wrong so you might

1186
01:13:47,820 --> 01:13:51,110
see that certain data was not

1187
01:13:51,110 --> 01:13:56,150
as it was supposed to be yes I saw our
engineers will find contradictions

1188
01:13:56,150 --> 01:13:59,190
unusual with new models when they're out
you

1189
01:13:59,190 --> 01:14:02,810
if there's accidents happening you fly
out a team that analyzes the accident

1190
01:14:02,810 --> 01:14:04,140
and analyze the vehicle

1191
01:14:04,140 --> 01:14:07,680
so week we got into debt I mean the is
reverse engineering being done

1192
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:12,060
X that's our due diligence when we put
up new cars on the road the figure out

1193
01:14:12,060 --> 01:14:12,870
what went wrong

1194
01:14:12,870 --> 01:14:16,450
soda is some stuff being done I agree
with you totally that

1195
01:14:16,450 --> 01:14:20,480
I mean this is just the beginning but
vehicle

1196
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:23,830
makers or yams to quite a bit too

1197
01:14:23,830 --> 01:14:27,240
for safety reasons ya security but
safety

1198
01:14:27,240 --> 01:14:30,370
yeah is reliable to the yeah I found
from

1199
01:14:30,370 --> 01:14:34,720
doing these types the talks in with the
Calgary that on I'm sorry I thought has

1200
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:35,060
been

1201
01:14:35,060 --> 01:14:38,890
really responsibility there they're
actually really for you working on

1202
01:14:38,890 --> 01:14:39,890
securing the not

1203
01:14:39,890 --> 01:14:43,200
least my exposure has not been the type
like oh it's not an issue or nothing its

1204
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:43,510
just

1205
01:14:43,510 --> 01:14:46,820
typically though not as open iron to

1206
01:14:46,820 --> 01:14:51,400
just like in the fam researchers as say
like you know microsoftr how software

1207
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:52,030
vendor

1208
01:14:52,030 --> 01:14:55,440
that somebody that we are working on
things just the to network and learn

1209
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:56,790
silos on stuff

1210
01:14:56,790 --> 01:15:00,870
and you know I can mention there's data
on their not as most likely proprietary

1211
01:15:00,870 --> 01:15:05,370
how to create proprietary I'll and
researcher isn't going to be other just

1212
01:15:05,370 --> 01:15:09,180
tell you can definitely under I'll I was
like a scan tool

1213
01:15:09,180 --> 01:15:12,250
are making a buy at you know your car
dealership

1214
01:15:12,250 --> 01:15:15,700
repair place in just verify that
everything's cool on

1215
01:15:15,700 --> 01:15:18,800
and not be great enough we can get to
that point

1216
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:22,630
our lease weekend at some level just
check our own vehicles

1217
01:15:22,630 --> 01:15:24,770
determine what their status

1218
01:15:24,770 --> 01:15:27,940
so far we get there but again I think
it's like i said im starting safety

1219
01:15:27,940 --> 01:15:28,480
right now

1220
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:31,940
you know and that's great and sis I like
to a more scary

1221
01:15:31,940 --> 01:15:38,940
time into it out yeah I really like to
demos

1222
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:45,530
I'm and are you aware of any research
for attacks against can which do not

1223
01:15:45,530 --> 01:15:46,950
require the pluck

1224
01:15:46,950 --> 01:15:50,380
to plug in in order to inject data

1225
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:54,610
may be crossing from the Ivy I which can
be attacked by a Leslie

1226
01:15:54,610 --> 01:15:58,280
into the cam or doing some sort of
electronic

1227
01:15:58,280 --> 01:16:01,510
induction in the system yes

1228
01:16:01,510 --> 01:16:05,140
so there is a decent hour research on
that I am

1229
01:16:05,140 --> 01:16:09,700
where several cases I'm where you can do
things wirelessly and remotely

1230
01:16:09,700 --> 01:16:14,030
on the can through exports I my personal
resources eyes are on contract

1231
01:16:14,030 --> 01:16:17,280
for that so it's its honor and yeah I
think a lot of people's

1232
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:20,510
is that why aren't the only ones I can
think of that our public

1233
01:16:20,510 --> 01:16:24,590
I think University of Washington had
some stuff

1234
01:16:24,590 --> 01:16:28,250
where they talk about it when the whole
idea tell I'm but they did

1235
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:31,380
the dimension at the has been done as
well I'll

1236
01:16:31,380 --> 01:16:34,860
but yeah I can def I say you can do that

1237
01:16:34,860 --> 01:16:38,220
'em act like to

1238
01:16:38,220 --> 01:16:42,680
you'd only the dongle I like if I do a
demo account india always use one

1239
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:43,880
because the point

1240
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:47,440
isn't that car I only want my psycho
he's

1241
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:51,790
on a Toyota Prius and that's what he's
attacking therefore that the proper its

1242
01:16:51,790 --> 01:16:55,870
I'm you know it's always trying to just
do whereas hasta I want to the

1243
01:16:55,870 --> 01:16:59,360
the fear stocks always heard on one my
picture regardless

1244
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:03,590
because I want some have out I go he put
some good device on the car

1245
01:17:03,590 --> 01:17:06,890
that's what caused the problem and using
my name is that is what's causing the

1246
01:17:06,890 --> 01:17:07,290
problem

1247
01:17:07,290 --> 01:17:11,670
I it's the universe web doing it I'll
because had Taco always parking as long

1248
01:17:11,670 --> 01:17:12,900
as I know what acts at

1249
01:17:12,900 --> 01:17:16,220
on and so like I Wow I will use 'em

1250
01:17:16,220 --> 01:17:20,660
for my stuff but yeah don't you know am
i doing contract I don't obviously the

1251
01:17:20,660 --> 01:17:25,200
dongle for contract work

1252
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:28,980
i'ma questions to

1253
01:17:28,980 --> 01:17:33,090
up again

1254
01:17:33,090 --> 01:17:37,220
the car bus oh man I mean the core

1255
01:17:37,220 --> 01:17:41,330
car engine functions there might be a
different in the US

1256
01:17:41,330 --> 01:17:44,700
two bites for sports car settings or if
you do a chip joining

1257
01:17:44,700 --> 01:17:51,019
is that right yeah I'm going sports cars
are like way different than

1258
01:17:51,020 --> 01:17:54,700
thank our from coming in like a half can
stop but there's gonna be a lot more on

1259
01:17:54,700 --> 01:17:57,710
and for this a researcher probably going
to want to

1260
01:17:57,710 --> 01:18:01,610
ghetto a higher answer for on 100
multiple buses at a time

1261
01:18:01,610 --> 01:18:05,600
might simply show cheap stuff just
people get started I'm your balance a

1262
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:06,470
reagan

1263
01:18:06,470 --> 01:18:11,120
that means they use the range

1264
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:15,060
of this a by so do they use additional
buses

1265
01:18:15,060 --> 01:18:19,540
the well that it's still the

1266
01:18:19,540 --> 01:18:23,060
I've seen it's just been lots of campus
I'm work a whole lot of arm

1267
01:18:23,060 --> 01:18:28,330
racing yeah I don't acquire adult but
presently dislike for me a 100

1268
01:18:28,330 --> 01:18:31,790
let's kill it off just sports cuz you
can buy like like evolving over

1269
01:18:31,790 --> 01:18:35,550
yeah now they there's almost a sad thing
about the ones actually raise their kids

1270
01:18:35,550 --> 01:18:38,690
1 Ferrari or whatever so just affordable
sport

1271
01:18:38,690 --> 01:18:41,950
yeah I mean I V Chile said like they'll
prolly have can

1272
01:18:41,950 --> 01:18:45,460
I'm but they will prefer are most likely
not using at for their normal

1273
01:18:45,460 --> 01:18:46,800
practitioners and other another

1274
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:50,180
her a call but i wanna be when you get
to get till I'm

1275
01:18:50,180 --> 01:18:53,190
so it won't be nice I can cam and I'll
be something else

1276
01:18:53,190 --> 01:18:57,030
and as this is I said

1277
01:18:57,030 --> 01:19:04,030
engineering decision time it could be

1278
01:19:04,510 --> 01:19:05,790
to

1279
01:19:05,790 --> 01:19:10,380
and other questions alright

1280
01:19:10,380 --> 01:19:14,620
yeah I think out there and do this to
protect heart of so if you want that's

1281
01:19:14,620 --> 01:19:16,340
also I get how I have a I'm

1282
01:19:16,340 --> 01:19:20,110
another game where you can save money by
Mario Kart and as marquardt

1283
01:19:20,110 --> 01:19:24,680
pressure on the course I it's that I can
packets of ports controls and so

1284
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:28,300
at that we use this and now capture the
flag and I

1285
01:19:28,300 --> 01:19:31,650
x3 in atlanta and said all the flags
were based on what

1286
01:19:31,650 --> 01:19:35,410
yeah shits mushrooms and what
accelerates and what not and so

1287
01:19:35,410 --> 01:19:39,060
one person to have a game controller
driver allan here 30 May that figure out

1288
01:19:39,060 --> 01:19:43,280
the Packers turner's and for flags for
that's also tell on

1289
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:48,130
my coverage must be weird drama played
out onto its it's much easier than I see

1290
01:19:48,130 --> 01:19:51,219
them to the doesn't broadcast the other
that I can I see it up there but it's

1291
01:19:51,219 --> 01:19:54,550
it's just the packets being used by the
game controller turned the cam

1292
01:19:54,550 --> 01:19:59,050
I think that's it yes
