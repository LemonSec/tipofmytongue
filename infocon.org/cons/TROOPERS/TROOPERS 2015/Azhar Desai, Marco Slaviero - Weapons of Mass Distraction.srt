1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,250
the okay so I'm

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:07,220
let's go to the next talk and work %uh
Marcus love you know and

3
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:13,099
our society ever talk about firm for
puppetry and I bought save more because

4
00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:16,299
assault they have 211 slight so

5
00:00:16,299 --> 00:00:19,960
just hurry up police your a

6
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:23,830
thanks everyone don't worry muscular
pictures of cats so I gotta go through

7
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:24,289
them

8
00:00:24,289 --> 00:00:28,010
I'm pretty quickly a service for a bus
from thanks to you heard from her own

9
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:32,860
yesterday a me he also worked with us on
this but as an eye i'm gonna be

10
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:36,649
present in the stuff so out talkers on
sock puppetry

11
00:00:36,649 --> 00:00:40,809
up both as on her own have shaped since
we took those photos

12
00:00:40,809 --> 00:00:44,690
but mostly we work at things and we try
to work on

13
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:48,030
what we consider to be interesting
problems so

14
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:52,860
I am there's a guy called at someone and
we need to start is for the butt of a

15
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:53,570
broader look

16
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:57,379
tom was a guy who invented the term
network into neutrality at that point

17
00:00:57,379 --> 00:00:57,789
net

18
00:00:57,789 --> 00:01:02,550
neutrality over 10 years ago is a lawyer
in america he writes about

19
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:05,900
the intersection of technology and the
law

20
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:09,100
and in 2010 he wrote this book called
the master switch

21
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,159
a and the moss to switch was a
historical look

22
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,340
at how many types of technologies after
they've been invented

23
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:20,070
at some point this best of open and they
are

24
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:23,750
in support of freedom and exchange
information

25
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:27,000
and over time those technologies become
close and

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,829
basic examples there are TV radio

27
00:01:30,829 --> 00:01:35,390
a and the old one is a the telephone and

28
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:39,409
somewhat this progression the question
as well

29
00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:42,759
what's up what's going to happen over
the internet right so we've this is also

30
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:44,009
a new technology and

31
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:47,280
and has this thing absorb migrated into

32
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,670
the internet space and we've seen some
examples of this so in 2011 with

33
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:54,740
the the whole Arab Spring movement 'em
in

34
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:59,060
Egypt and in Libya by for those
countries cut taxes completed

35
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:02,299
the Internet when they're citizen
started talking about things that didn't

36
00:02:02,299 --> 00:02:02,860
like

37
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:06,310
I'm even lost in turkey there was the
blockage

38
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:10,750
all YouTube when a video was published
that was unfavorable

39
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:13,260
towards the government and so the stuff
is

40
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:17,549
happening but in truth ultimately how
much is cut access

41
00:02:17,549 --> 00:02:21,569
right to just have such a blunt saud
that to

42
00:02:21,569 --> 00:02:25,349
block people from from saying the things
that they think I want to say

43
00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:29,549
is immediately visible and people know
what it is that you're doing

44
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:33,060
and so there's alternative ways to do
this a

45
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,470
also in 2011 Tennessee it took a
slightly different approach they left

46
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:36,980
access

47
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:40,890
in place but this thought third fiddling
with the access

48
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:44,900
so what they were doing was collecting
credentials and Gmail Facebook

49
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:49,109
Yahoo and so on and so they wouldn't a
harvest credentials and from that use

50
00:02:49,109 --> 00:02:49,519
that

51
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,840
to target specific people but they
didn't simply just cut internet access

52
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,620
which was a which apps have made a lot
more news but it's not just in the Arab

53
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,170
Spring

54
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:02,209
it's not just in far-flung countries
also in 2011

55
00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:05,730
I'm in London the London riots a the
technology

56
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:09,040
use their with smartphones a man that
was used to track

57
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,340
a and arrest rioters so

58
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:15,530
the technology that was open can also be
used

59
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:18,690
for persecution a and so

60
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:23,290
we have decided that that's all all
technology the Internet is different

61
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:26,870
like what we know about the internet
what we think we know about the internet

62
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:30,250
is that is designed to router on
problems a

63
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,639
will leave the nuclear thing aside but
we think that

64
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:37,699
the Internet can router on issues and so
when it comes to censorship

65
00:03:37,699 --> 00:03:40,840
we're just going to router on censorship
a

66
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,780
and so even when government put methods
in place to try and control what saying

67
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,470
what people are saying they will retire
on that and one other

68
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:53,569
ways that if you talk to people they'll
suggest up to get through to her on

69
00:03:53,569 --> 00:03:56,970
is through user-generated content UGC

70
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:00,900
up and so the idea there is that when

71
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,609
a governments try and control and news
flow people can read tweet

72
00:04:04,609 --> 00:04:08,010
I'm someone's views on the ground people
can follow

73
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:11,949
on social media and they don't accept
the official view

74
00:04:11,949 --> 00:04:15,340
vacancy there are and so wanna be up

75
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:18,820
for me one other fine example the bus
was the the Russian soldier who

76
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,950
posted stuff on social media sites in
the ukraine

77
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,699
which had left his job location:

78
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:26,909
and the ukraine's you had an official
story coming out of a

79
00:04:26,909 --> 00:04:29,979
Russian media and there was a guy
posting

80
00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:35,139
pics on Twitter put him in the ukraine
so it is kinda veneers paradigm not

81
00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:36,650
completely but the side thereof

82
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:40,240
but democratize content is something
which were slow

83
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,509
tried to deal with personal plan to
understand

84
00:04:43,509 --> 00:04:47,539
and so if we look at it in terms of
censorship

85
00:04:47,539 --> 00:04:50,860
the question then becomes well how's it
going to be handled how to people who

86
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:51,879
want to control

87
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:54,990
what others are saying reading sharing
and discussing

88
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:58,039
how will they behave in I'm this world

89
00:04:58,039 --> 00:05:01,199
of UGC and site to look at that

90
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,000
let's take a step back because when it
comes to control the techniques a

91
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,849
well-worn

92
00:05:05,849 --> 00:05:09,819
and is nothing really that new under the
Sun control is nothing new

93
00:05:09,819 --> 00:05:13,199
it's not a new idea at all and so if we
start

94
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,240
if we frame this in terms of the sixties
in the US

95
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,330
where there were there was a absorber

96
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:22,520
movements against the Vietnam War and
other aspects but

97
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:26,550
I'm the the up or the student union

98
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:30,699
you a student movement in the US I'm one
of the ways that they were controlled

99
00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:32,810
was direct force but when that became

100
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:36,020
a like it's pretty blatant when people
are getting clubbed on the head

101
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:40,279
on in the newspapers I'm you can then
start to

102
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:43,669
change the way that those crowds are
perceived

103
00:05:43,669 --> 00:05:46,930
by having I'm other people there

104
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:50,050
both opposing them or acting with them
apparently

105
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:53,399
but at the same time I'm dragging their
course through the mud

106
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:58,159
so the side thereof rent across as one
which is well one and that a common

107
00:05:58,159 --> 00:05:58,990
technique for

108
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:02,740
control so if we return to that question
about how

109
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:05,770
censorship will be handled in the age
I've

110
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:09,449
for user-generated content we can look
to

111
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:13,169
one OVR industry or movement evens

112
00:06:13,169 --> 00:06:16,389
a well-known folks up

113
00:06:16,389 --> 00:06:20,509
errant shots when he was still with us
he wrote on the internet on boy

114
00:06:20,509 --> 00:06:24,800
that it's not how it's not only how
certain people

115
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,250
have a license to speak not everyone has
a license to speak

116
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:32,830
it's a question of who gets hurt to
everyone can speak with UGC

117
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:35,380
but if you can control yes

118
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:38,960
what has been said then you can control
effect

119
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,110
of user-generated content so it means
what we're worried about

120
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:47,940
to put it plainly is censorship 2.0

121
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:51,080
so in this world that UGC how censorship

122
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:55,450
been handled and we think this is a
profoundly important

123
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:59,580
topic which is why we spend some time on
that

124
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:03,520
and we spend some some time on this with
the assistance

125
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,890
of open Technology Fund one of the
reasons why

126
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:11,470
we think this is so bad is because with
tim was ideas

127
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:16,380
of DeMoss the switch it really does have
the potential to

128
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:20,090
to influence much control and this
particular kinda pack

129
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:23,970
Israeli attack against the human mind so

130
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:27,400
rent a crowd but in the age of the
Internet and in the age

131
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,750
of a UGC what those look like

132
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:35,950
and with not too much thought to arrive
at the notion of sock puppets and sock

133
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,020
puppets are

134
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:41,300
I'm for if you're not aware of the
definition this is one definition of a

135
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:41,910
sock puppet

136
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:45,760
but in essence it's just online
identities under the control

137
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:49,740
of alternative for of that party's and
they're used to push

138
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:53,080
certain people went and they can simply
be individual identities

139
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,280
or alternate identities or entire
coordinated

140
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:59,670
a mass movements armies of SOP

141
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:03,970
so we wanted to ask ourselves when we
started with this work

142
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:07,140
if we were some kinda evil corporation
or government

143
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:10,710
a how would we go about right so for
trying to understand how it might be

144
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:11,270
happening

145
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:16,910
we need to understand how we would do it
and so we had three questions that we

146
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:18,120
want to ask ourselves

147
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,210
so what can be done what will be done

148
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:25,300
and a what is being done not lost when
there's

149
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:29,370
particularly important as awesome as we
see it but in essence

150
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:33,060
the core of this work is we're going to
look at a bunch of different

151
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:37,710
methods a publishing UGC and what you're
trying to say is how can we

152
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:41,140
get more people to pay attention to what
we're saying

153
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:44,540
or alternatively how can we decrease the
importance

154
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:47,500
up something that we don't like how can
we make sure that other

155
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,709
far less likely to see a so that they
ought to approaches

156
00:08:50,709 --> 00:08:53,910
and we we try but the bus increase the
attention on something

157
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:56,910
if you like decrease the attention on
something

158
00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:01,370
but we don't like and very quickly and
perhaps this is one of the reasons why

159
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:03,110
you don't eat too much work in this area

160
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:06,110
I'm a problem you get is how do you
measure

161
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:09,470
efficacy how do you know if you're
actually making a difference

162
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:12,709
and terms of a increase in attention

163
00:09:12,709 --> 00:09:16,320
would decrease in attention because
there is so much content of that

164
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,520
it's really hard to say well we did
these things to clearly

165
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:23,320
'em and book peoples were talking about
what we

166
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:27,380
we wanted to promote or we try to
decrease the tension on this thing and

167
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,330
fewer people

168
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:31,649
were talking about it we must you know
does that mean we succeeded

169
00:09:31,649 --> 00:09:35,200
maybe maybe it's a Sunday night and
people on paying attention

170
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,339
or maybe they happen to be a public
holiday or an election somewhere else

171
00:09:39,339 --> 00:09:43,100
so both also carnations are quite ticket
to help

172
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:46,190
so we we thought would focus on

173
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:49,490
at least and tried to measure we have an
effect we've with autofocus on

174
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:54,110
fall sorry five main areas Sep I'm some
a-list polls reddit news site

175
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:58,410
and common systems a follow along like
there's some fun stuff in here

176
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:01,860
and if you're online in The Lost you
might have bumped into summer party that

177
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:05,380
just went to wear so other will take us

178
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:09,850
from male may mailing list so I'm sure
your

179
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:13,680
some you may be asking ourselves well by
mailing list

180
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,520
and there's only two reasons first but
my situation by the wanted for coming

181
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,529
off the presses that

182
00:10:19,529 --> 00:10:23,959
still interesting people using mailing
list I'm an activist Main St cost many

183
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:25,270
calling for a sec meanest

184
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:28,870
and the of course up a bit to standards
mailing list

185
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:32,140
where people the big question stanchion
musing

186
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:35,209
and the second season in many just
personal curiosity

187
00:10:35,209 --> 00:10:40,300
at Main St I really simple just emails
going to Main St to pass on to everyone

188
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:40,800
else

189
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,630
is there any space to play around and
see what we can do and make more less

190
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:45,089
people

191
00:10:45,089 --> 00:10:48,709
make people see things or Nazi think we
don't want them to do

192
00:10:48,709 --> 00:10:52,280
so but eventually want New Year is

193
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:56,530
10 the motor main st and had not to
mention make more people see it all

194
00:10:56,530 --> 00:11:01,930
make less people said and interject
refined me to find a way to measure how

195
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:02,650
people a

196
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:06,040
to measure how many people actually 90
so

197
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,500
we're taking a bus in major we just in
bed then click then click Send Email

198
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:13,670
I'm use that assumption a rough idea hun
people are are you know emails

199
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:17,620
is a question that comes but we have
done so in sending emails up

200
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:21,260
what she put in these emails up
typically

201
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:25,210
in the lazy guys get up well we just it
is still content from Eva out

202
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:29,140
have been fun the emails Cup in the
father but burst Cup in from wherever

203
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:33,350
and put them in but be making sure not
to make them too exciting time to be

204
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:33,910
knows

205
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:39,000
a roughly equal appeal so now first
experiment way want to do

206
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,950
is take a look and see can get more
people to renew most of it did you

207
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:47,000
is we'd send an email

208
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,330
and do nothing of this get a sense of
how many clicks the normal you know get

209
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:54,380
when we do nothing and then the second
time around

210
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:58,120
with send an email but this time we have
a whole lot about don't suck public

211
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:58,940
email accounts

212
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:02,620
I waiting on the side and when the mail
comes in

213
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:05,940
we followed up by sending holiday next
enough to make a long affect discussion

214
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:06,340
thread

215
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:09,500
and I email to it's really simple and
then

216
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,700
in in the main is archive you'll see
something like this nasa

217
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:16,260
initial email phone up by of a
conversation that that we've created

218
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:21,200
and there's no to this was actually
interesting so weepy dispensable time on

219
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,800
onto Main St VisionTek

220
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,710
and full disclosure and Boo is peaceful
baseline

221
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:29,870
controller email that typical some
number keeps you can get

222
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:34,940
and then the Green Bus are the kicks a
most get when we put up a pic discussion

223
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:35,220
said

224
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:38,860
so in general when you do this the pic
discussion to tend to draw more

225
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:39,850
attention to

226
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:44,140
to the things you sent to second spent
lunch eyes

227
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:48,190
okay with question that we can get more
people saying oh but can get less people

228
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:49,440
he subido want to see

229
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,940
maybe someone sent a really good idea
about a really good cond number

230
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:53,590
generator

231
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:57,520
and we just Khan had that going on in
our at the standard so

232
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:01,230
murdered if Nick spend again with
percent testing over to baseline

233
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:04,000
to get a baseline feel I make it happen

234
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,440
and then this time we send me not to be
followed up with a flood of new email

235
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,690
just got a whole new fits: me she can be
John out that tension

236
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:14,709
that this e-mail affect initially muguet

237
00:13:14,709 --> 00:13:20,139
so look something like that and the
effect the Spanish

238
00:13:20,139 --> 00:13:24,170
ain't name first to Jenny what happen is
just an email

239
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:27,399
and the funding the mother was followed
up a whole lot of

240
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:31,620
I expect fed but then get less attention
and the gym because people are

241
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:35,660
some waiting to all the other he knows
that he said but one really cool thing

242
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:36,649
happened

243
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:40,990
jeering doing online in this experiment
Tomoka promised you a picture

244
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:45,490
cats ever bring that up. now but what
are the wanna be suffering email

245
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:47,290
accounts we had was named uptake at

246
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:51,149
and essentially just send an email to
full disclosure which was

247
00:13:51,149 --> 00:13:55,949
copy and pasted from a pastebin paste
and whatever happens few days later

248
00:13:55,949 --> 00:14:01,589
and the same the same account the side
in a bun bo hue database as a security

249
00:14:01,589 --> 00:14:02,319
researcher

250
00:14:02,319 --> 00:14:07,180
so which is is for dinner I'm a little
bit funny that a cap it comes Q

251
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:07,980
researching

252
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:11,610
three days but it has been used but note
that when people are busy

253
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:15,630
echoing what evidence that just say and
it just for women trying to build up a

254
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:16,029
more

255
00:14:16,029 --> 00:14:20,980
real-world believable personas one of
quantum anus is that so we had these two

256
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,240
things we can do we can join attention
to an email

257
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:27,339
and we can distract attention email and
is more effective thing we can do is

258
00:14:27,339 --> 00:14:29,189
just to combine those two together

259
00:14:29,189 --> 00:14:33,350
so into an improved way to distract
attention from some think so

260
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:37,970
missing you know that we don't like and
then I mean it usual spot is defined up

261
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:38,959
a dollar Baxter

262
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:43,100
he must decide on attention but this
time he said just say no emailed

263
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:47,029
we also add take discussions and couple
those emails you know it too

264
00:14:47,029 --> 00:14:50,149
improve them on destruction that we get
and the nice thing is also that

265
00:14:50,149 --> 00:14:54,009
you can pay your juicy destruction
tentative time but in the end it to play

266
00:14:54,009 --> 00:14:55,689
more so whatever you wish to bring up

267
00:14:55,689 --> 00:15:00,829
and and to that i've ever work best at
it as a distraction

268
00:15:00,829 --> 00:15:05,639
so that s main st Jenny be seen on how
we can sort of

269
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:09,630
full attention of plywood emails and
wish I was on chemo so we want to see

270
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:13,160
annexing with a quick look at is online
polls

271
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:17,170
so it might take a look online pose that

272
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:20,179
this lease back teenage in his sights
such as Latin Palace

273
00:15:20,179 --> 00:15:23,259
al Jazeera and of course many random
blog is across the internet

274
00:15:23,259 --> 00:15:27,559
and the usual thing about paula is that
people see the results have been

275
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:30,649
so possible would try to manipulate and

276
00:15:30,649 --> 00:15:33,939
nationally this is a very very very
ancient tradition people have been

277
00:15:33,939 --> 00:15:35,480
manipulating poll since

278
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:39,129
a very long time ago under finest
examples were looking at was a

279
00:15:39,129 --> 00:15:42,529
and 1998 example for when the People
magazine ad

280
00:15:42,529 --> 00:15:46,689
the a most beautiful person paw and
United NC

281
00:15:46,689 --> 00:15:51,410
when he was in his prime is Titanic bank
got point 1000 boats

282
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:55,049
but being detained Hank the angry jump
hank angry chunk of

283
00:15:55,049 --> 00:15:58,049
got 250,000 and

284
00:15:58,049 --> 00:16:01,290
and I just set up an example just 2009

285
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:04,689
when have moved the bond of 4chan was a

286
00:16:04,689 --> 00:16:08,319
voted to be the world's most influential
person and of course

287
00:16:08,319 --> 00:16:12,589
icon mention this but I'd say they also
sparked marble cake also the game

288
00:16:12,589 --> 00:16:17,359
I'm on their and it is up so should you
expect this to be a South problem me

289
00:16:17,359 --> 00:16:19,910
know maybe they just a trade-off between
a difficult in sign up

290
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:26,299
person's money but this patient get and
but doesn't quite seem to

291
00:16:26,299 --> 00:16:30,230
so we thought we do is just take a
quickly get one or two and

292
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:34,709
do two things picking up champ are and
make that option being

293
00:16:34,709 --> 00:16:38,259
by and obviously large landslide margin
ordered more sucking

294
00:16:38,259 --> 00:16:42,100
and may have been my small margin so one
coming in you set up %ah services Paul

295
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:42,540
daddy

296
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:46,019
when we talk about it because it's owned
by every single money and poss

297
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:49,949
everybody and possibly the cat as well
and two be connected up

298
00:16:49,949 --> 00:16:53,119
we should mention be happy to post we
just bought a green bar

299
00:16:53,119 --> 00:16:56,230
now this is an exception exception
interview apollo

300
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:59,649
which %uh went much boats are simply
just a single Asian request

301
00:16:59,649 --> 00:17:03,539
from a single IP so millionaires any
nothing to this you can sit at home and

302
00:17:03,539 --> 00:17:04,319
do this from your

303
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,720
DSL connection I'm so we just take apart
like this

304
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:11,250
and kiss you not cursed at all how do
you respond again but better

305
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:14,939
by percent we can push it up to a to win
by a source Mona

306
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:18,689
touring to be the leading option by a
small margin and i'm looking as Bishop

307
00:17:18,689 --> 00:17:19,159
Tobin

308
00:17:19,159 --> 00:17:22,909
completely outright so in general Paz
have a PC is credible and

309
00:17:22,909 --> 00:17:26,600
button so so that's because I mean we
can def need them

310
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,960
them admit played some results next time
take a look at

311
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,559
is made it so

312
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:38,000
on I know from sorry discussions a.m. at
110 as I know a summit is there may be

313
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,280
some it is in the crowd

314
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,840
and she may know how it works but the
first and last pitched a QuickBooks

315
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,260
more for about one minute to just
essentially aside for

316
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:50,440
posting links and content and having
uses

317
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:54,460
banking by voting them coming on them
and the most popular post

318
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:59,510
I'll opium or permanently so bedded
divided golan of sub communities called

319
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:00,240
summits

320
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,490
and major any focus on a particular
topic on me you know something

321
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:09,210
and the range from the totally cine like
pictures a bird but on

322
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:12,440
to the most serious up

323
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:16,669
world news now people come to figure out
what's going on the world today

324
00:18:16,669 --> 00:18:21,440
soap we take a look at a summit and the
default ordering the QC

325
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,530
is something called the hot scoring a
song in a focus on

326
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:30,120
so that two factors involved in this in
this particular scoring the one is a

327
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:34,299
the number votes and I can get to that
settle up first minister Odom both

328
00:18:34,299 --> 00:18:38,610
and be age but across a new articles are
not showing up on public

329
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:41,780
am we want to do year is

330
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:45,429
have a summer thing bubbling time do
with making this some kind of polished

331
00:18:45,429 --> 00:18:50,990
going to take up things everyone to
promote but we aren't at the wanton

332
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:54,590
moat and will do this by uploading and
tankers many people thus it is possible

333
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:58,919
and that topic so we just want to hide
berry among people not seen an alarm to

334
00:18:58,919 --> 00:18:59,900
that with numbered

335
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:03,200
but before we can get panned minute have
a need some accounts

336
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,679
so you can sit down easy and using some
open web proxies and

337
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,890
may be solving the captured man yourself
and a day's work

338
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:14,860
K two hundred or so cards so week eight
if you look on sand

339
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:19,490
initially an outburst testing up housing
broken they didn't seem to be having the

340
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:21,460
effect that we wanted been moving within

341
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:24,610
so the interesting is that but it is
Kenya where

342
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:28,110
was he trying to stop people gain and
when the thing they do is

343
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:31,390
they tried to hide the effects are the

344
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:34,890
your initial votes from you so the have
things like but buzzing they don't show

345
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:36,070
the actual votes called

346
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:39,020
by the show's collapsed near that's
there

347
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:42,560
near the true scope so in yeshiva you
know whether your boat is actually had

348
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,590
an effect take inside and he discarded

349
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:49,190
and Prevention quickly learning how to
make your much better but it turns out

350
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:51,110
that wasn't so much a public bus

351
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:54,520
we just got up at the accountant said
okay well misuse them

352
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:58,430
and then she doesn't have a large effect
i'm looking for. so

353
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:02,680
aswan accounts a spa submitted its PDA
not carpenter

354
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:06,850
unpaid just by person you want and up
putting it so

355
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:10,600
annette sec I machine him which is AM
pacific summit

356
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:14,640
am beginning an article up because
there's not that many subscribers are

357
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,720
not that many people boating

358
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:19,910
numbers I have a smaller but but I lots
a bit like

359
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:24,010
world news up isn't enough appointed at
some small effect but it really is

360
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:25,610
enough to make the band pages because

361
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:29,160
the lot more people involved I mean
world news typically has about six

362
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,240
million subscribers

363
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:35,290
saw 50 bucks up pretty much a drop in
the ocean but on the other side

364
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:38,800
I objecting went right down the St so

365
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:42,190
December insane things that can happen
anytime but besides just knowing the

366
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:42,700
school

367
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:46,710
at the first to end things up quite
useful like you're trying to

368
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:50,090
complete remove an item from the you so

369
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:53,690
the one option is some sub in a second
pick in lot in a bit more cautious way

370
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:56,860
and that if not a committee checks if
you down both

371
00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:00,420
that article shunted completely off the
page and into moderation queue

372
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:04,210
when the summit Monday to and has to
prove it manually before

373
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:07,840
before it's visible again and it's
beautiful views when I get an article

374
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,580
just one again article quickly in and a
nice option is that

375
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:15,510
the user submited preference where says
don't show me any articles with a score

376
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:16,580
below a certain point

377
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:20,170
and if your votes not that article below
that's cool

378
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:23,750
that user will not never seen article
and that you you download

379
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:27,770
and they will never know that they never
saw the article so it's up

380
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:31,900
quite useful for the sort of thing my
head

381
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:35,970
shirt 130 downloading them they doing
less cynical trickle-down leading

382
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:40,100
I experiment by me my head do slightly
more not state board under any

383
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:43,780
but especially a more subtle version
down during the meeting was

384
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:47,420
we take an article and look at number up
but it had

385
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:50,870
and just on the as many with as many up
but at

386
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:54,890
and so when was nice but this his FB
could takes a bit

387
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:59,210
up but out targets post everyday like to
met

388
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:02,600
and continue trickle-down but the others
and

389
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:06,640
we have some progress in promoting what
we want people to see

390
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:11,220
time came back to the mess down don't
think so there's a reason why we have to

391
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,220
talk about that trickle-down dating was
because

392
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:16,300
initially ask the obvious question well
why don't we just take all the bus

393
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,760
vacated and just had them

394
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,360
foundered all the new post that come on
the summit something

395
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,840
that it seems that people should have
already done and she should have

396
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,180
Kelly be expecting so we began with the

397
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:33,490
up began with the world news and we just
kept but going

398
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:37,220
and almost immediately people start
Matusz that

399
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:40,270
to on you Perseus any attracted a whole
lotta

400
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:43,460
down dirt but then a things

401
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:46,590
this payment on Novamov delivered more
wilder

402
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:51,520
man we could have anticipated and on the
side in the post appeared saying hold on

403
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:56,130
month sub ita under attack everyone stay
calm yeah I can use a comma point

404
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:59,550
let's keep posting let's keep things
going and

405
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:02,970
the money is money rate this published a
post

406
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:06,660
me they said okay guys not happening we
can attack and

407
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:09,760
and that post eventually got about two
thousand comments

408
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,810
animistic uploaded all the way to the
top a turban page

409
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:15,970
entire visit site upset cause a little
bit of a stir

410
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:19,840
the same thing about this post at they
posted buzz that

411
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,590
it's all own words but when it's quite
clear funny

412
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:27,690
is that the monday tuesday konsi much
about what's going on tell me how much

413
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:28,510
visibility

414
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:33,380
among midday Mb even if they did and I
have any power to do anything

415
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:36,960
so in order anything actually done
inside many disturbing some the actual

416
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,800
site haven't

417
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:41,530
I'm a while that is all happening behind
the scenes up

418
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:45,040
the users under on the on that post for
but Mackey speculating

419
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:50,460
who is this so what is going on now who
could possibly be doing these disasters

420
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:50,930
things

421
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:54,590
and some other funny accusations were
that this must have been cute in but

422
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:58,110
some on one second that only

423
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:01,440
oneof the or the person being dumb but
except for per rushing past

424
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,220
wishes

425
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:06,030
I miss not having witnessed on burning
everything an accusation I just

426
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:10,450
it was innocent people recession was a
mocking intended to be taken seriously

427
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:15,200
and but one burka should point out that
depth there was a number other down they

428
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,710
can be case that apparently happened

429
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:20,390
earlier a a few months enya and
including one that happen on our

430
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:21,230
technology

431
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:23,820
and we had nothing to do with that
because people kept pointing things they

432
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,510
have no these must be the same people

433
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:29,620
at we had no idea who the other guys are
we were just a play monday via

434
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:33,559
estimate an issue to end the same thing
the same damn thing on a small it's a

435
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:34,380
bit netzer

436
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:37,450
and it miss Pasha was quite different

437
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:41,260
Service Inc moderate Isacc in the
essences

438
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:45,150
internet is by skills and the Kenyan I'd
anything yet okay the country what's

439
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:45,640
going on

440
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:49,140
they don't know enough to do to do to do
anything and they don't have outstanding

441
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:53,039
so no candidate admit talk about and the
summit and

442
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:57,870
that has been missing because the admin
to comment on this site so we can see

443
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:01,770
am how they previously game picking this
up and what are the cutest thing was

444
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:02,110
that

445
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:05,480
but again posted that they said okay
with anything about 20 bucks and would

446
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,260
disable those

447
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:10,049
up this is a stage we found by staying
because the

448
00:25:10,049 --> 00:25:13,679
yielded don't at least 50 but that it
and where the others said they not find

449
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:13,929
them

450
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:17,409
and the one on the funny thing is that
they said you know

451
00:25:17,409 --> 00:25:20,830
me everything to me that both but we can
tell them because that would you know

452
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:23,909
help the person running these but so
they just making a bit more clever

453
00:25:23,909 --> 00:25:27,990
but then they go and tell us in the
comments anyway so be

454
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:31,270
I'm sort of knew that some women
becoming effective the reason why

455
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:33,280
surprised us back to him

456
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:38,380
in my surprise that that they respond if
you have them as a ship in any venue any

457
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:39,500
easy to spot today

458
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:42,990
and this is many crude so we had hola
but

459
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:46,100
were voting in the same time that some
the sign up time

460
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:50,200
comment you know the Manhattans coming
back to named the guy who dis is well

461
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,230
billion fun known

462
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:55,559
open my box is that you can see in the
Internet use agent have a similar

463
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:59,900
and credit thingy the account for some
one dimensional then intact but the

464
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:00,490
distance I

465
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:03,549
intact without the use it tho that they
should stand up quite a bit

466
00:26:03,549 --> 00:26:07,039
but two months later and

467
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:12,090
been a change decided so they use to
show the Dundas and they no longer do it

468
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:12,770
anymore

469
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:16,130
that's an interesting because a

470
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:19,050
you can still down both articles but
this time

471
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:23,330
and uses both seen a donde today only
solve the problem love a dumb burning

472
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:27,020
it just means that you don't see them
play on sunny make a big fuss when they

473
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:27,780
see it happening

474
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:31,070
so it could be signed happening but
their net they had no indication

475
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:34,350
to check back at that point again late
in the talk about

476
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:38,110
having data available about what's
happening helps you able to detect

477
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:43,100
where whether something is going on that
you should do well but

478
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:46,110
the comeback to the more mission baby
did this but there's one

479
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:50,580
loss to Ashley with them she just
talking about is there no comment at

480
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:50,880
this

481
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,120
sup precise like made it and hacking use

482
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:57,190
is something notion of Commerce which
which is affecting the points that

483
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:58,120
measure how

484
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:01,810
and how much it contributes to the site
and now the pub and your contribution

485
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:05,710
and it's often spoken about in this
mythic way where people say that

486
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:09,140
you know that despite any come as a
result the incredible hard work

487
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:12,230
and you know much thoughtful much
thoughtful posting

488
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:17,230
so we took a quick look at at how could
go personas another cycle hack in use

489
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:20,720
just to see him you know does may take a
lot of hard work

490
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,800
and we had a hacking his account that
we've been running for about three years

491
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:27,190
and and posted thank the many many
thoughtful submissions

492
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:30,790
our stuff we put a really interesting
and that the washington any really

493
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:31,340
appreciate

494
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:35,080
but came they didn't because we only got
99 come up with I don't that right

495
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:38,540
first three years of waste and hard work
instead

496
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:42,850
or should have done was playing on a bit
more solo index was be

497
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:47,510
to get 10 line I can skip and what they
did was it just kept on a popular index

498
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:51,850
from popular blog and because new post
in eighty percent act and use

499
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:55,060
and the effect was astounded a VIN X 10
months

500
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:58,870
we go from 99 car points to 8,000 common
point

501
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:02,850
so clearly and

502
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:06,990
attend I'm I can skip as much but it
taste in good quality content men than

503
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:07,490
we do

504
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:11,350
at but in SF BST the end a bit

505
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:14,789
we've seen quite a bit about how we can

506
00:28:14,789 --> 00:28:17,830
shut this number option for shutting up
things that we don't want people to see

507
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:22,760
and promoting thing think at the world
should know about the texting want a

508
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:23,549
quick look at

509
00:28:23,549 --> 00:28:26,779
is new sites certain sites

510
00:28:26,779 --> 00:28:30,640
make and obvious target right people
come there have been used and what they

511
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,600
see is

512
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,890
for me based on how they make their
opinions what's going on in the world

513
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:38,279
and we have too much influence on
newspapers in a trial site

514
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:42,289
but that by up to %uh possum newspaper
web sites that we can't control

515
00:28:42,289 --> 00:28:46,950
cyclic look at many new site they often
have a panel such as this

516
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:50,350
shows D mostly country most popular
articles on them

517
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:55,380
and its in newspaper terms it's fun page
and above the fold such prominent

518
00:28:55,380 --> 00:29:01,450
and people at Mackey said question of
what others can mean curtains panel

519
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:06,899
up and I mean can get stuff on it I
noted ok Angus top of it shut them out

520
00:29:06,899 --> 00:29:11,429
and not have people see them so it was
cut off by taking a quick look at

521
00:29:11,429 --> 00:29:14,460
prominent African newspaper and

522
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:18,370
they're fun panel looks something like
this: so to most read this kind week

523
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:21,690
mister moshood articles and

524
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:25,860
kind week and it said banking is just
pages

525
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:31,539
but pay his AZ we can control that began
on W get competed in a loop from one box

526
00:29:31,539 --> 00:29:34,750
and eventually will end up doing is
suspending

527
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:39,350
punch the UN s I on think any do so just
shut off

528
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:42,510
any other articles that we should do
make it onto the site

529
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:45,529
in fact say stuff like that for several
days up to its

530
00:29:45,529 --> 00:29:49,240
until the other articles organically
good enough

531
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:52,240
text him to get back on

532
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,010
an acceptable it was though Wall Street
Journal today have a

533
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:59,210
last night he def in metric and days

534
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:02,309
miss is a sort of Commerce said metric a
few

535
00:30:02,309 --> 00:30:06,700
different ranking so they use make sure
our 30 percent from pageviews

536
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:10,940
up 20 percent Facebook shares been
absent for the shares continue my shares

537
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:12,789
and Kim said the number of comments that

538
00:30:12,789 --> 00:30:15,919
ice busca so paid used to it now do that
like

539
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:19,760
did and the PDSA up traditions

540
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:24,260
perhaps you can do that we had a couple
of a a couple to cast lying on

541
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:27,809
and passive come to mind that we can get
fifty percent control over

542
00:30:27,809 --> 00:30:30,850
that ranking the one interesting thing
though is that

543
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:33,990
but to the tradition content to date yet
tells you about

544
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:37,760
that the company keeps are issue link

545
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:41,570
a bum time turning to be shared is quite
easy to bump up

546
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:45,290
TV take a single could use a any
continuously treat the same link

547
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:49,500
that number keeps going up so you can
keep doing that as much as you want and

548
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,850
you keep inflating the number

549
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:53,940
mostly general just call that number and
bono

550
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:59,080
anything happen say out doing that
appeared about seven hours we could bump

551
00:30:59,080 --> 00:30:59,870
an article from

552
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:03,000
compete in the bottom all the way to the
top even though

553
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,030
and we can actually be diet coke at the
payload I got

554
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:09,700
up we could pump pump it up anyway and

555
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:13,050
thanks so take a look at what the New
York Times

556
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:16,250
so their penalties

557
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:19,550
most emailed but unlike

558
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:22,730
others am before we can play on this one
we need

559
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:26,150
me two cuts on the New York Times in I'm
kinda new time shot

560
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:29,630
you don't have to share articles so we
took a look at the account creation

561
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:30,320
process

562
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:34,660
and there wasn't any captures doing can
you know vacations obviously

563
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:38,330
very much made a few accounts
automatically and see what we can do

564
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:41,710
and in the end we end up getting on
30,000 account

565
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:46,559
and in order to do the mushing and

566
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:50,710
we could bumping article bombing but in
to bellicose it up

567
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:54,670
and the same thing about this is that
the

568
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:58,520
the in thing about this is that they
might dispense

569
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:02,770
quite a bit on their thereafter menus
getting apparatus

570
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:06,530
but bus other kicked in the first bus
this was very cheap

571
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:10,120
I mean we did that entire shipping blind
a fifty-cent

572
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:13,390
said

573
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:18,929
its quite a lot of fun and death of an
easy and cheap to midday

574
00:32:18,929 --> 00:32:22,420
what comment heart 'cause show up by
panicky on that most popular

575
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:26,380
and on a lot on website so the next
thing we'll take a look at

576
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:29,540
A's comment systems and Markel take us
away from their

577
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:31,390
Co

578
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:35,940
so I can read it becomes quite clear as
we get to the so get into this that

579
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:39,190
manipulating content is is easy

580
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:43,230
and one other places that people love to
post content on

581
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:48,660
is the the comments of all sorts of
sites discusses the comment system

582
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:53,100
its unlike you you've never come across
it I guess if you cross about JavaScript

583
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:56,590
you probably never seen a otherwise
everyone would have seen it

584
00:32:56,590 --> 00:33:01,380
there any brief a description for
discussing the reason people use it

585
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:05,300
is because you can take three lines of
JavaScript embed that on your page

586
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:09,640
and I've got an entire comment which it
that looks good is updated constantly it

587
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,220
does live feeds and saw

588
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:15,540
so it makes it really easy for content
owners insights to concentrate on what

589
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:17,400
they're good at which it may be
producing

590
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:21,390
up blog or board news of some kind and
then the left discuss handle

591
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:25,450
a the con the comment and their big bike
there

592
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:28,610
by big I mean sorta billion page views a
month kinda

593
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:31,690
big 'em I think it's three million

594
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:35,170
at the time what two million users were
signing up a month for them

595
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:38,960
so discuss the big play they're not the
only one other there are few others

596
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,320
a but you can see why its attractive to
people

597
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:46,380
so as I say it's used by blogs a
tumblers soccer mom blogs

598
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:50,100
up but it's also used by a bunch of
legitimate news organizations

599
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:53,400
we did this work lost up at the time CNN
Italian

600
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,830
and Al Jazeera with both discuss users
um

601
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:59,840
Bloomberg next leg next web in a bunch
of others

602
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,930
rely on discuss to handle

603
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:06,940
their comments and so this is really
interesting from

604
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:10,790
UTC perspective because when you in bed
comments on the site

605
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:14,790
what it means is that you control some
other content but you don't control the

606
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:15,690
entire message

607
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:19,890
um lot of the stuff on your page is
being produced by someone else obviously

608
00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:21,300
that's different from a Twitter feed

609
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:24,580
where someone's Twitter page its
entirety their own

610
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:28,480
this is and that there is a new story
that has some kind of

611
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,270
a built-in of them to steal trust but
part of it a

612
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:35,890
is the not this and someone to
graphically illustrate this for you

613
00:34:35,890 --> 00:34:36,520
that's a

614
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:40,810
a screen capture of an entire story of a
CNN dot com

615
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:45,280
and one long a screencap gonna flipped
on its side

616
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,600
the redline is where on the left inside

617
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:52,310
that's where CNN and their editors
control the content the right hand side

618
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:53,680
is where the internet

619
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:59,270
can put content onto a CNN page i'd and
you can see just visually that split is

620
00:34:59,270 --> 00:34:59,970
quite different

621
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:03,230
obviously you content for the up the
page gets more

622
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:07,670
attention but the reality is that most
the content doesn't come from CNN

623
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:14,280
at all comes from the Internet and so
when we were looking at discuss

624
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:18,260
again like these are these aren't you
the problems too Turkey's done to

625
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:22,640
I'm the question as well we won't
discuss users how easy is it to create

626
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,660
discuss users

627
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:27,410
and what I'm gonna show you with the the
next couple slides

628
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:31,100
is that the stuff is trivial ike it is
when I said struggle

629
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:35,610
I mean it's trivial we got one line bash
scripts that can give you 500 a conse-

630
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:39,590
in twenty-odd seconds I'm so

631
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:43,130
these are the script the point here is
not to say we can write horrible bass

632
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:44,310
the point here is that

633
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:48,390
when I said so online Bhaskar like is
genuinely a one-line Bastrop

634
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:52,440
I and so we've not got a whole bunch of
discuss users

635
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:55,530
that we can use to interact with the
site right so

636
00:35:55,530 --> 00:36:00,260
this is side that this video yesterday
are %uh the video was with CNN this is

637
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,170
what the Telegraph

638
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:05,470
what you've got there's a comment on a
story of global warming that's gotta 176

639
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:06,100
up votes

640
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:09,490
um and perhaps this is something that we
don't want

641
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:13,000
to get prominence we want to bury this
comment and there's another comment that

642
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,120
we won't and its place

643
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:17,650
so one-line bash script we run it for
thirteen seconds

644
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:21,580
a we're not gonna up boat another
comment that perhaps you want to push in

645
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:22,160
its place

646
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:25,620
on this one runs a little bit longer but
we apply I'm

647
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:28,790
in this case two hundred votes either
way and then

648
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:33,210
as you can imagine we refresh the page
the comment that your residence was

649
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:34,150
right at the bottom

650
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:37,550
kept so we push that all the way to the
bottom and now

651
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:41,220
I'm the comment that perhaps who want to
promote gets

652
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:45,870
inserted at that prominent position so
it is trivial to alter

653
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:49,060
or influence what people are saying on

654
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:52,830
a site like discuss up they they've got
issues

655
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:56,080
a when it comes to us a complete control

656
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,880
with baskets which seems crazy

657
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,230
like where other protection mechanism
the SES

658
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:06,190
what discussed does is they they need to
provide trusted place

659
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:09,310
where it is the place for people don't
feel like they're getting completely

660
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,370
manipulated when

661
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:14,740
when they have conversations so like
it's completely

662
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:18,370
ham part of what has made this cuz grows
the fact that their

663
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:21,470
that so few restrictions so you'd like
you can all

664
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:24,580
I P or user registration is and I P
limited a

665
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:28,150
you don't have to verify emails they are
some restrictions

666
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:31,850
if you act as a guest but as soon as
you've got a cookie then you can have

667
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:35,870
are 500 of thousands of users acting
from

668
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:39,250
on the same place and even if you've got
it. restrictions

669
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:42,360
we know that those can be bypassed with
a proxy list

670
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:45,410
which we did to discuss really has

671
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:49,930
a serious problems with us and we gonna
look at it life I as an alternative

672
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:54,470
commenting system I'm they provide
similar services to discuss

673
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:58,160
and as you can imagine fungible to the
same attacks

674
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,330
at the same kind of things a possible

675
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:05,100
in in life I so I like it really is

676
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:08,230
I'm had at the radius

677
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:11,620
just open right so this is live-fire and

678
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:17,790
us just pushing stuff to the top of life
I that's for promoting content

679
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:20,930
you can but stuff down to a move it

680
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:24,340
in an order in but there's also a
comment in systems are also often have

681
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:27,080
this notion of flagging content other a
spare time whereas

682
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:30,740
unsavory content whatever I'm and then
usually that will remove it completely

683
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:31,920
from

684
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:36,410
view until it enters a moderation queue
or something and that can happen

685
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:39,950
discussion life I handle that slightly
differently on the Scots have something

686
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:42,220
get put into moderation and then gets
allowed

687
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:46,060
you caught move it back into the market
moderation but live fire has

688
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:49,630
like basic bikes something can get
kicked a moderation queue

689
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:53,200
allowed and you can just flag again to
get back into to the moderation queue

690
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,400
I'm so they don't have any history to a

691
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,900
and then in terms of actual other bikes
live-fire

692
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:04,150
I'm cross of Christ forgery observed
they've got that bug

693
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:07,150
you you get a life I use it to hit your
website

694
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:09,150
you can still his life I tote

695
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:12,720
can and then post up on his behalf but
what makes

696
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,010
those thoughts about quite interesting
for what we're talking about when it

697
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:16,829
comes to

698
00:39:16,829 --> 00:39:21,470
censorship and and sock puppets is with
a bike like that

699
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:25,000
you can attract attention for life I
users have them come to your site

700
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,150
get access to the profiles and now you
can have a sock puppet

701
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:31,770
army which has a history which you
haven't had to book

702
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:36,010
I haven't had to worry about building up
so those thoughts a bug seem

703
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:39,609
a and they seem easily fixable

704
00:39:39,609 --> 00:39:43,760
but the their impact when they're not
fixed a it is fairly serious

705
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,369
in terms of what we talk about
withholding sock puppet on his and

706
00:39:47,369 --> 00:39:51,029
I'm not sure how long that was present
in live fire but it took us looking at

707
00:39:51,029 --> 00:39:52,039
sock puppets to

708
00:39:52,039 --> 00:39:55,819
point out that they were CSR affable it
seems a bit strange

709
00:39:55,819 --> 00:40:00,270
so that %uh scrapping the token that's
just posting stuff

710
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:03,270
on a user but we haven't seen so

711
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:07,020
common systems by cob kinda rush the
discussed up a little bit

712
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:10,180
because I'm gonna deal with that some on
%ah but up

713
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:14,640
both discussed and live fire up pretty
rotten when it comes to trust in what

714
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,230
you can see

715
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:18,520
and it's pretty clear that the content
that you do see on the site

716
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:22,180
'em in I well you'd have to be
suspicious

717
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:26,750
so we dealt a common systems and declare
success there

718
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:30,349
so in terms of those the three questions
that we often initially

719
00:40:30,349 --> 00:40:34,029
a what can be done what will be done and
what is being done

720
00:40:34,029 --> 00:40:38,109
the question then moves to all what is
being done can we find some puppets in

721
00:40:38,109 --> 00:40:39,420
the wild of people

722
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:42,950
doing this and like always we go to

723
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:47,339
history and the sucking up a bunch of
examples of us the 4chan Paul

724
00:40:47,339 --> 00:40:51,569
that we mentioned earlier there's a a
fairly long history of people

725
00:40:51,569 --> 00:40:52,740
manipulation read it

726
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:56,420
also use inside puppets in the early
days a bread it

727
00:40:56,420 --> 00:41:00,000
the reddit founders were posting content
under

728
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,819
fake identities to make it seem like
that the site had more

729
00:41:03,819 --> 00:41:07,809
support than it did I'm so growth
hacking of some kind if you look back

730
00:41:07,809 --> 00:41:11,289
a there's a fight called common dreams

731
00:41:11,289 --> 00:41:15,369
which is perhaps a little bit less known
up and basically they had

732
00:41:15,369 --> 00:41:19,180
a it was pretty machiavellian so they
had a guy posting

733
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:22,260
anti-semitic comments turned out that do

734
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:25,720
dude was a pro-israel guy who is
essentially trying to

735
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:29,620
make people think that the website was
anti-semitic and in response people

736
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,360
pulled funding from common dreams

737
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:35,970
up and so that's like a straight talk a
protector a bunch of a const pushing to

738
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:36,380
view

739
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:39,930
but in that instance and this is why
attribution becomes really hot

740
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:43,310
a Minnesota you can swap to a

741
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:46,210
what what people might be doing it and
in this case he wasn't gonna push a

742
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:46,950
Proview

743
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:50,640
he was trying to push a view that said
people don't actually want to be

744
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,630
associated with it

745
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:54,770
so those are the two things that we're
quite aware of what's up puppetry it's

746
00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:56,150
easy to promote stuff but

747
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:59,190
there's also the up approaches for
removing attention

748
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:03,130
again and and this isn't a pic on the
israeli but

749
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:06,210
the since the we spoke about stuff
getting flack

750
00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:09,620
I'm and this one is just too good to
miss this is from the idea

751
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:13,710
I'm twitter feed and they're basically
saying like if you don't like stuff like

752
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:14,600
this about

753
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:17,720
not up like don't like spam spam

754
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:20,890
if you don't like a comment then flagged
as spam

755
00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:24,630
because that just removes it from view
so both techniques are

756
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:29,360
are fairly common and or at least a are
understood in the snow and docs

757
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:33,150
there was mention of Chaitra group are
tough for the UK

758
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:36,650
I'm so sort of GCHQ crop

759
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:39,960
a and according to the docs be there
actively

760
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:44,680
manipulating online polls for the stuff
is happening so when we thought we were

761
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:45,530
gonna go look for

762
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:48,800
the one place given what we've seen is
that

763
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,760
discuss which we played with quite a bit
to that point

764
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:56,530
releasing to be ripe for picking I'm so
we went there to see if we could find

765
00:42:56,530 --> 00:43:00,190
armies and the initial evidence the
initial

766
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:03,770
I our initial search in seemed promising
right

767
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:07,720
so at the time CNN's Most Commented
story

768
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:12,550
this was the highest ranked comment on
their most commented story

769
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:16,590
and what you can see it's nonsensical
doesn't make any sense

770
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:21,550
right the to what this suggests to us is
that people are completely gaming the

771
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:22,040
system

772
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:27,020
and CNN was a an interesting example to
their six hundred guests poets

773
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:30,070
I'm and 46,000 comments

774
00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:32,199
on a story

775
00:43:32,199 --> 00:43:35,150
so our approach when it came to trying
to hunt

776
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:39,150
Dom be sock puppet on his Ortiz to
detect if they were there

777
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:42,709
was well let's take a controversial
topic a

778
00:43:42,709 --> 00:43:46,529
yep that's pretty controversial that'll
do within thoughts

779
00:43:46,529 --> 00:43:49,689
we need to find a news organization
that's gonna cover this topic

780
00:43:49,689 --> 00:43:52,799
a and those guys cover art in the

781
00:43:52,799 --> 00:43:56,349
a lot of detail and then

782
00:43:56,349 --> 00:44:00,910
what word is good al Jazeera's up well
we can use the discuss API that but a

783
00:44:00,910 --> 00:44:01,920
really nice API

784
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:06,390
weekend poll I am a list of all the
popular stories

785
00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:10,559
from the discuss a kite but that were
written on out there up

786
00:44:10,559 --> 00:44:13,989
a and then for each story um

787
00:44:13,989 --> 00:44:17,939
we poll user info for the users who
commented on most stories

788
00:44:17,939 --> 00:44:21,569
and then we want to try and see what
stories to users comment on

789
00:44:21,569 --> 00:44:24,589
we put that into big groff because big
data

790
00:44:24,589 --> 00:44:30,219
and what we get is a scatter plot that
actually be content with like before

791
00:44:30,219 --> 00:44:33,239
we get magic stuff just but there are
others and it never

792
00:44:33,239 --> 00:44:36,459
appear out of that so we tried a few
things

793
00:44:36,459 --> 00:44:39,689
to or three different ways to cut and
slice that particular data

794
00:44:39,689 --> 00:44:42,829
up and then took a step back

795
00:44:42,829 --> 00:44:46,089
and said actually comment on stories are
one way to

796
00:44:46,089 --> 00:44:49,519
add your voice to something but the
other way to affect

797
00:44:49,519 --> 00:44:53,089
actually the thing that we're looking at
is trying to impact whether or not

798
00:44:53,089 --> 00:44:54,479
people are seeing things

799
00:44:54,479 --> 00:44:58,170
not ever if we remember everyone has a
voice the question is who

800
00:44:58,170 --> 00:45:01,259
case to be heard commenting is just the
voice

801
00:45:01,259 --> 00:45:04,969
everyone has that who gets to be heard
is actually voting

802
00:45:04,969 --> 00:45:09,160
it's not commenting and so we decided to
start looking at voting patterns not on

803
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:13,089
comment impact and so we then
essentially poll

804
00:45:13,089 --> 00:45:16,259
a voting patterns and the metric that we
used

805
00:45:16,259 --> 00:45:19,459
a in this particular instance was the

806
00:45:19,459 --> 00:45:22,539
a Juve the voter commented on

807
00:45:22,539 --> 00:45:26,349
that the age of a photograph voted on a
given comment so we would take

808
00:45:26,349 --> 00:45:29,679
all the top stories for every story we
put it on

809
00:45:29,679 --> 00:45:32,880
all that pic comments that were place
for that story

810
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:36,249
and then for every comment we pulled on
all the users who voted for those

811
00:45:36,249 --> 00:45:36,869
comments

812
00:45:36,869 --> 00:45:39,969
as a No what you've got other the sub
people who vote

813
00:45:39,969 --> 00:45:43,099
on particular comment on a given story

814
00:45:43,099 --> 00:45:46,140
and we decided to look at the
registration times

815
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:49,309
of the voters a

816
00:45:49,309 --> 00:45:52,980
and in the final Potter this metric a
few following me so far

817
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:56,950
a is that we looked at the variation
between the voter age

818
00:45:56,950 --> 00:46:01,359
all voters on comments on a given story
essentially what we're trying to do here

819
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:04,450
is to say aha similar are

820
00:46:04,450 --> 00:46:07,770
the users who vote on a given story on
the comment on a given story

821
00:46:07,770 --> 00:46:11,710
and one way one proxy for that as well
ha some other creation ages

822
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:16,529
answer the variance that but you can do
other things you can try and compare

823
00:46:16,529 --> 00:46:20,750
update BIOS and names and all that kind
of stuff but voter age

824
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:26,109
is a reasonable one up for this and so
we get best each of the points

825
00:46:26,109 --> 00:46:27,180
represents

826
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:30,369
a story um and the variance about age

827
00:46:30,369 --> 00:46:33,630
on a story so this is a across Aljazeera

828
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:37,049
and you can see the variances a its it's
all over the place

829
00:46:37,049 --> 00:46:40,190
I'm and we thought would then focus
while actually what we're trying to do

830
00:46:40,190 --> 00:46:40,960
is to safety

831
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:45,250
if profiles a similar gonna have low
variance so let's zoom and then

832
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:48,809
on the bottom part of this and will pick
some others pointed round and you can

833
00:46:48,809 --> 00:46:49,319
see there's

834
00:46:49,319 --> 00:46:53,000
a number of stories but very low
variance it could be noise

835
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:57,309
but it's interesting they also had to a
minimum number of comments

836
00:46:57,309 --> 00:47:00,309
in them so it wasn't like to users on
this

837
00:47:00,309 --> 00:47:04,490
comment of voting on a story and so we
poll

838
00:47:04,490 --> 00:47:08,569
the voters for those comments and there
were a few things that stood up

839
00:47:08,569 --> 00:47:12,660
um just that first glance I'm with that
there was some patents so

840
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:16,109
41 mostly the accounts were registered
with an minutes of each other

841
00:47:16,109 --> 00:47:19,230
but they were happens within the
usernames the profile name switch to

842
00:47:19,230 --> 00:47:21,020
different and also in the email
addresses

843
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:24,740
we pull that data and what we can see
their

844
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:28,390
is a this is the last of the people who
vote

845
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:29,830
on

846
00:47:29,830 --> 00:47:32,859
comments within a given story and

847
00:47:32,859 --> 00:47:37,020
to suppress gone south of sauce ago
we're not seeing

848
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:40,400
I am at bay they start to look fairly
regular

849
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:45,160
but like it's not exactly commenting
back in my heart of hearts

850
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:49,060
I am expecting hawkeye 69 to appear
somewhere in that this because it's the

851
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:49,700
Internet

852
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:52,950
but that just before up

853
00:47:52,950 --> 00:47:56,490
the with four names that's not enough to
convince so we decided to keep but

854
00:47:56,490 --> 00:48:00,880
email addresses are a an interesting
aspect for discussed they're not a

855
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:01,980
requirement but

856
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:06,089
I'm you have to supply when it sign up
but they don't have to be verified

857
00:48:06,089 --> 00:48:10,180
so if we could get the email addresses
for those profiles that we looked at

858
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:13,230
then there was a possibility that they
might be patten's there

859
00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:16,250
but discuss doesn't give you the email
address the user that's a

860
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:20,650
private information a so we went looking

861
00:48:20,650 --> 00:48:25,040
I we found an unmarked attack that lets
you get the email address to discuss use

862
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:25,410
up

863
00:48:25,410 --> 00:48:29,210
son of a given random discuss use a you
control them

864
00:48:29,210 --> 00:48:32,810
and their private mailbox wanted to a
and looked a little

865
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:36,380
little bit further and found the inverse
a given someone email address

866
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:40,040
up your friends or your family or
whoever you could map that back to their

867
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:44,230
I've discussed use and I'm a both of
those are reported affects oh that's no

868
00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:45,080
longer possible

869
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:48,390
but we use them for our work and that
led us a lot

870
00:48:48,390 --> 00:48:51,910
email addresses for the sock puppets a

871
00:48:51,910 --> 00:48:55,480
and they had this very regular happened
as well first name surname

872
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:59,770
at Shemale the cop okay saw suspicion is
starting to grow

873
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:04,369
but the fires at the number puppets have
been fun seem smaller than we expected

874
00:49:04,369 --> 00:49:07,680
like it was 17 and we thought well if
you will if we were running a sock

875
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:08,380
puppet army

876
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:12,380
we wouldn't just do it with seventy up
so we thought we'd try and in numerous

877
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:15,660
and like there's a buncha text there but
the point here is that

878
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:21,080
discuss gives you a every users are
finding his idea it's just a counter

879
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:24,960
so we can take the use ID's a pic the
users that we know about the sock

880
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,119
puppets let me know about

881
00:49:26,119 --> 00:49:29,700
we just increase asserts pace a little
bit on either side others and we gonna

882
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,240
enumerate a bunch of users

883
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:35,040
for all the user that we download all
the information for which includes email

884
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:35,640
addresses

885
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:36,570
we then

886
00:49:36,570 --> 00:49:40,600
I am we then apply the the patent that
we already know about

887
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:44,800
and see which of them match that happen
so

888
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,830
top be pulled in for five thousand users
a

889
00:49:47,830 --> 00:49:51,260
we apply those falters a and what we've
got

890
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:54,800
was actually quite nicely faltered a

891
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:58,530
list abusers and they do start to look
very regular up

892
00:49:58,530 --> 00:50:04,900
like what's the packing up some
softening on a text that so

893
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:07,970
if you look at that list its ordered
right

894
00:50:07,970 --> 00:50:11,660
so the list looks like it's ordered a
and it looks like it's ordered by email

895
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:12,100
address

896
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:15,190
but it's not it's all about time
registration time

897
00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:19,250
and it's quite striking that its order
by registration time but

898
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:23,170
the names are alphabetical the email
address of a pedicure

899
00:50:23,170 --> 00:50:26,310
ordered so like that really does suggest
to us

900
00:50:26,310 --> 00:50:30,450
that not even suggest us like that
sought to become pretty clear

901
00:50:30,450 --> 00:50:37,450
that someone's got names but text and is
putting stuff other names top text

902
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:44,059
but just to convince a little bit more I
bus Crawford or the scatter plot is

903
00:50:44,059 --> 00:50:44,829
shown you

904
00:50:44,829 --> 00:50:48,049
a the delay between registration times

905
00:50:48,049 --> 00:50:51,869
up the spot so stop gets registered

906
00:50:51,869 --> 00:50:55,180
how long is it before the next one
analyst has registered and again you can

907
00:50:55,180 --> 00:50:55,619
see you

908
00:50:55,619 --> 00:51:00,150
it's very tightly constrained I'm and
effectively it's a Toronto asleep five

909
00:51:00,150 --> 00:51:00,910
seconds as

910
00:51:00,910 --> 00:51:05,579
and someone script so credit crackpots a
C-five create the next one

911
00:51:05,579 --> 00:51:10,099
a and so that's the majority of them
that the one that the top right also

912
00:51:10,099 --> 00:51:11,210
quite interesting for us

913
00:51:11,210 --> 00:51:14,640
up its above a sidebar but effectively

914
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:19,319
we had must at that point wanna be
registration events in the Middle

915
00:51:19,319 --> 00:51:22,729
so we sort of thought they were 10
seconds between those registration event

916
00:51:22,729 --> 00:51:25,999
but actually there was one at five
seconds in the middle that a halt at

917
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:27,410
that point had been picked up

918
00:51:27,410 --> 00:51:30,890
so we've got a bunch of attributes that
we a

919
00:51:30,890 --> 00:51:35,239
that we can falter these accounts on and

920
00:51:35,239 --> 00:51:38,799
discuss lets us what we can go a little
bit further

921
00:51:38,799 --> 00:51:42,700
because discuss then says well given
user names you can find out whether

922
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:46,039
actor but and this is where the the
puppet army stuff starts become

923
00:51:46,039 --> 00:51:50,599
quite active so for every user in that
sock puppet on me we polled on all the

924
00:51:50,599 --> 00:51:51,489
comments they made

925
00:51:51,489 --> 00:51:55,680
and we then crossed into this time the
graph makes a little bit more sense

926
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:59,390
a in total that post about
seven-and-a-half thousand comments

927
00:51:59,390 --> 00:52:03,710
our about 7,000 comments rather of which
five and a half thousand were posted

928
00:52:03,710 --> 00:52:07,880
to CNN it's a really active on CNN the
next one was

929
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:11,469
there were active on Al Jazeera with
about 1000 comment

930
00:52:11,469 --> 00:52:14,650
and then the next one the next biggest
ones to under comment so you can see

931
00:52:14,650 --> 00:52:15,039
this

932
00:52:15,039 --> 00:52:18,430
a sock puppet army is read your the
active

933
00:52:18,430 --> 00:52:22,609
in only two major places 'em and clearly
are

934
00:52:22,609 --> 00:52:26,130
are quite active the other thing that we
find quite interesting as this row on

935
00:52:26,130 --> 00:52:26,739
the bottom

936
00:52:26,739 --> 00:52:30,859
all profiles that up part that they've
been

937
00:52:30,859 --> 00:52:34,309
them at all the photos but they've never
been used a and so

938
00:52:34,309 --> 00:52:37,589
we can we can only guess at that point
either they're being held in reserve

939
00:52:37,589 --> 00:52:42,239
or they lost access to them because they
were just a cookie in the cookie got

940
00:52:42,239 --> 00:52:42,829
lost or

941
00:52:42,829 --> 00:52:46,619
got locked out whatever the case is up
but its a

942
00:52:46,619 --> 00:52:50,900
is sort of the the coordinated action
along the ones that were actually in use

943
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:51,480
is

944
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:54,780
for us quite interested okay

945
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:59,839
so as I said we can we can pull off the
comments made by the users

946
00:52:59,839 --> 00:53:03,460
and discuss had another bug at the time
which said that

947
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:08,140
if you mock to a profile is private you
could stop hold on the comments for

948
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:12,119
the private profiles actually private
profiles meant nothing a

949
00:53:12,119 --> 00:53:15,920
now they had a few issues as you can see
but what he did was he pulled out all

950
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:16,849
the user comments

951
00:53:16,849 --> 00:53:21,270
and again that starts because come quite
interesting so just six different users

952
00:53:21,270 --> 00:53:22,440
or post in the same

953
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:25,720
comment so this notion of duplicates
exists

954
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:30,089
within at least the the puppet army that
we saw but it's less than you expect

955
00:53:30,089 --> 00:53:35,300
Saba seven thousand above the seven
thousand on comments that they posted

956
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:38,589
the duplicates were in the order of

957
00:53:38,589 --> 00:53:42,369
1000 1500 there were lots have any
comments there was a lot of

958
00:53:42,369 --> 00:53:45,480
effort that went behind as Papa army

959
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:48,720
it wasn't a and the comments 2i

960
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:52,310
appeared to be reasonably written they
weren't they didn't look like they were

961
00:53:52,310 --> 00:53:53,060
the result

962
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:56,940
of I'm a text generator so team like
someone is putting a lot of effort into

963
00:53:56,940 --> 00:53:58,450
this crop is also

964
00:53:58,450 --> 00:54:03,470
a it's just kinda messy but it shows the
links between users

965
00:54:03,470 --> 00:54:06,500
and common sense trying to give you an
idea of

966
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:10,250
duplicate comment but there were a lot
of okay

967
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:13,700
so we've got that fall to we can see
that these guys

968
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:17,119
active on a the same places

969
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:20,150
a and like at this point we're pretty

970
00:54:20,150 --> 00:54:23,790
pretty convinced so this is for the
results of the house

971
00:54:23,790 --> 00:54:28,040
that particular pot army of sock puppet
army up to 190 60 them

972
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:31,750
they were active at the time when we at
the work to active had been active for

973
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:32,319
months

974
00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:35,819
7,000 comments I'm of which

975
00:54:35,819 --> 00:54:41,810
on an offer to pick up sup coming back
top picture of that CNN page and this is

976
00:54:41,810 --> 00:54:43,060
this is actually one other

977
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:46,540
the stories that we look set you
remember we flipped on the side

978
00:54:46,540 --> 00:54:50,690
that's where the dividing line is and
all of that

979
00:54:50,690 --> 00:54:54,230
has bought activity sock puppet activity
so this is

980
00:54:54,230 --> 00:54:57,770
the default this is the default a

981
00:54:57,770 --> 00:55:00,549
comment like this is not a strange order
anything

982
00:55:00,549 --> 00:55:04,160
up and Ike one analogy for this is what
if you control that much comment

983
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:07,369
and someone randomly schools dob they're
likely to land

984
00:55:07,369 --> 00:55:10,559
into one of your comments right that's
the knots lead for

985
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:13,709
a sock puppetry is it just pile them and
their

986
00:55:13,709 --> 00:55:17,429
and someone will see something that you
want them to see elect what are the

987
00:55:17,429 --> 00:55:18,469
other stats for that

988
00:55:18,469 --> 00:55:22,019
is all the top-level comments only four
percent were not

989
00:55:22,019 --> 00:55:25,829
sock puppet comment on that story for
CNN

990
00:55:25,829 --> 00:55:30,339
CNN's comments are pretty on and not by
us by

991
00:55:30,339 --> 00:55:33,630
someone else up for the question then
becomes a what are they saying what are

992
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:34,449
they trying to push

993
00:55:34,449 --> 00:55:37,999
I didn't skip that intentionally

994
00:55:37,999 --> 00:55:42,959
a it bears a few things that come out
and quite interesting the one is that

995
00:55:42,959 --> 00:55:47,189
the pews are consistent so we didn't
find instances of the puppets

996
00:55:47,189 --> 00:55:49,640
disagreeing with each other what that
suggests to us is that

997
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:53,229
there any I'll try to promote a message
rather than just cause havoc

998
00:55:53,229 --> 00:55:57,299
I'm the views of a multi-faceted so it's
not a

999
00:55:57,299 --> 00:56:00,939
on a single viewpoint just try to be
pushed so for example

1000
00:56:00,939 --> 00:56:04,529
up while they are pro palestine an anti
I sis

1001
00:56:04,529 --> 00:56:08,140
there also anti-obama right and Sabina

1002
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:12,019
been anti I sister not necessary
congruent with always been anti-obama

1003
00:56:12,019 --> 00:56:17,329
a or vice versa so Bell multifaceted
views that this group is trying

1004
00:56:17,329 --> 00:56:20,689
to push and so then

1005
00:56:20,689 --> 00:56:23,880
inevitable question is who is this and
this earth where we

1006
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:27,900
absolutely pull away and said no idea I
get anything in this field is pure

1007
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:28,559
speculation

1008
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:32,299
attribution is hot just when it comes to
network is activity

1009
00:56:32,299 --> 00:56:35,849
when it comes to what people are
actually writing um

1010
00:56:35,849 --> 00:56:39,259
thats that's a problem that we
introduction to Hospice of

1011
00:56:39,259 --> 00:56:44,069
at this point so there's a few ways out
of this we could shut down the puppet

1012
00:56:44,069 --> 00:56:44,529
army

1013
00:56:44,529 --> 00:56:49,029
rights are lots of their email addresses
went even register to you could register

1014
00:56:49,029 --> 00:56:52,170
man address behind the puppets I'm and
then

1015
00:56:52,170 --> 00:56:55,189
can access to but that seems like a lot
of work a

1016
00:56:55,189 --> 00:56:58,380
the one thought that comes out is that
discussions thought

1017
00:56:58,380 --> 00:57:02,679
limiting their API and limiting the
information that they publish in their

1018
00:57:02,679 --> 00:57:03,109
API

1019
00:57:03,109 --> 00:57:07,499
but we think is a bad idea you'll notice
that we found the thing on the site

1020
00:57:07,499 --> 00:57:11,779
all on the on the service that provides
us with the most information

1021
00:57:11,779 --> 00:57:13,890
rather does not provide you with
information

1022
00:57:13,890 --> 00:57:17,530
Asian and so you cannot locate talk
puppet armies usually on reddit

1023
00:57:17,530 --> 00:57:21,720
a and there's a bunch of examples for
that discussed gives you access to the

1024
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:22,230
data

1025
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:25,800
and that lets us who don't work that all
and who are doing this

1026
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:29,720
um in our own time we confine the puppet
arms

1027
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:33,660
so for us but that thing is important
but

1028
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:37,170
the new 52 taken a different approach
they're just facing our comments

1029
00:57:37,170 --> 00:57:40,810
for CNN los a phase-out comments
Jazeera's face top comments

1030
00:57:40,810 --> 00:57:44,330
on there's a bunch of sites Reuters is
moving away from its

1031
00:57:44,330 --> 00:57:49,680
a Rico it and and a few others so they
are not seen the value in having user

1032
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:51,010
comments because of

1033
00:57:51,010 --> 00:57:55,170
the influx of that so

1034
00:57:55,170 --> 00:57:58,950
let's just quickly summarize and have
come a full circle farm

1035
00:57:58,950 --> 00:58:02,160
making out and suck a ban on and finding
others

1036
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:06,020
finding finding others that make to take
the same shortcuts and worse than we do

1037
00:58:06,020 --> 00:58:10,350
I'm so without exception I'm and
assessments have just proven

1038
00:58:10,350 --> 00:58:14,590
absolutely should be able to manipulate
and within they work but not

1039
00:58:14,590 --> 00:58:18,890
because it's important day to be aware
that so that we can begin to build tools

1040
00:58:18,890 --> 00:58:19,750
to help deal with it

1041
00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:23,480
but just on that last point before we
begin building caught up do with it

1042
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:27,050
its it's worth noting met marker pointed
out as well

1043
00:58:27,050 --> 00:58:31,000
that having that data available at hand
and helps Katie

1044
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,100
and trying to figure out to if anything
suspicious gonna

1045
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:40,359
thank you the

1046
00:58:40,359 --> 00:58:43,819
tho

1047
00:58:43,819 --> 00:58:46,910
thanks very much higher I was think I
take one question

1048

1049
00:58:50,849 --> 00:58:53,940
on time

1050
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:58,989
to I'm back to 100 K am just just a
question how did you do your test birdie

1051
00:58:58,989 --> 00:58:59,900
