and thanks everyone for attending it's
an honor to be here

2
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:07,549
in and a unique in the only conference
that

3
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:11,040
holds that and a specific sabc cue track

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,710
so there are no there's no other Anissa
Kate the conference I disagree the

5
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:15,210
conference

6
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,890
with a specific sophisticated jack so
it's an honor to be here

7
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:22,090
actually we're gonna be holding another
presentation by the end so if you have

8
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:22,340
it

9
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:27,380
the chance I'll also invite you to to
attend that presentation to so

10
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:31,980
that start well this is the presentation

11
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,059
actually this is the the and template
that we have from marketing

12
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:39,969
this is something that we have been in
the space more interesting

13
00:00:39,969 --> 00:00:44,090
am thats I we we name the presentation

14
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:48,059
its cause stress except you will see why
wat

15
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:51,890
we have chosen that night so us for the
company

16
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:55,030
I work at an abscess on the city all I
at the nazis

17
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:58,129
am rather specialized

18
00:00:58,129 --> 00:01:02,079
on business-critical applications
security and focused

19
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,729
very specifically on SAP but also am

20
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:09,040
doing research on I'm working on other
products such as

21
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,960
Oracle as well am are the company was
founded in 2009

22
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,330
and since then we have been presenting
on different

23
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:19,830
IT security conferences a specific SAP
security conferences

24
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:23,830
so you might have seen some presentation
cell phone app sees

25
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:26,860
even here on trooper sorry in other
conferences as well

26
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:31,119
out for us and JP that's me

27
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,159
and my background this mainly on

28
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,060
penetration testing and doing whatever
it is research

29
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:40,960
so be before working specifically on SAP

30
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,579
down on SAP products and researching on
it if he did not he was doing

31
00:01:45,579 --> 00:01:49,079
like jam out penetration testing javelin
I read this research

32
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:53,500
and thats and where I came from right
from the technical side

33
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:57,350
answer ship yes a.m. okay a

34
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:00,979
we will have an abscess to obviously a
ride to begin a wealth

35
00:02:00,979 --> 00:02:04,289
and an one of the main developer of an
upstroke

36
00:02:04,289 --> 00:02:08,030
now I'm really focused on day on the
research

37
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:12,230
officer people so that's my mother thank
you

38
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:17,489
am busy agenda we will start talking
about their very specific brother

39
00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:22,319
developed by ASAP a maybe and many of
you will have it running

40
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,390
even though maybe some of you don't
actually know or are not aware of it

41
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:30,580
am we will talk about the different use
cases

42
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:33,950
so which at the actual use cases so that
shit products that are

43
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:38,670
you sing these on them the background
and we will talk to me to be there are

44
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:39,609
the architecture

45
00:02:39,609 --> 00:02:43,370
and which %uh the service is a part two
protocols how it's

46
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:47,190
and landscape is looking like how is
this 3 I'm on all that

47
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:50,680
then we'll talk about the attacks are
face discovery

48
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,880
how to got hurt anybody formation and
then in the end

49
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:58,650
how to actually see Rio business
information and then

50
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:02,390
drawing some conclusions accomplishments
are so

51
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:05,760
as a bee tee Rex this is the proud that
we are going to be talking about

52
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,850
anyone familiar with it at

53
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:13,030
NetWeaver and thereby search and be

54
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:16,160
and be W S and 80 S part are

55
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,200
content

56
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,239
my a.m. and knowledge management

57
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,459
while you may have the sprout still
running in the background

58
00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:27,810
even though you're not and 100 percent
sure that you have it right

59
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:31,950
so it's intervene in many scenarios so
when you

60
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:35,590
think about T-rex title when we first
heard about it

61
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:40,120
we saw it in customers right we do
penetration tests and we do assessment

62
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,500
I we start seeing different instances
that

63
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,120
and we we saw it worth direct right so

64
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,500
initially when we saw it with we think
about this

65
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,870
they say Diane tiny alright I thats

66
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:57,010
that's why they the name of the
presentation a

67
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:01,250
but actually T-rex stands for 633 well

68
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:04,810
on information extraction so basically
10 search engine

69
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:08,939
so it's it's nothing more than and then
shame that you

70
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:12,169
and send the information to it processes
state

71
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:15,969
on Yukon a query or search the
information on

72
00:04:15,969 --> 00:04:19,229
across the different basket so

73
00:04:19,229 --> 00:04:22,289
concept release if very simple to
understand right

74
00:04:22,289 --> 00:04:26,630
but the problem is that if we don't have
it properly implemented

75
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:31,960
well we might be exposing very sensitive
information so some

76
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,360
some interaction in terms of and rash on
sigh I'm

77
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,490
wanted us well it started with 70

78
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:43,110
and we will see some history in the next
light but right now it's 7.1

79
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:46,190
actually but she was 63 I'm

80
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:49,950
so you it's still maintain and you can
get at a time

81
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:53,210
and to to actually update this probe
because

82
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:57,690
I want you can be exposed to to when I
read this it's a stand-alone engine

83
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:01,440
its used by SAP NetWeaver actually in
some scenarios

84
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,180
I'm other products to eat ass a unique
see the

85
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:08,230
so if you're familiar with sabc stems
like

86
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:11,290
this this concept of see the Chinese
dance number

87
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:15,430
well this but this now the front its is
starring in a box

88
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:19,300
hey you will have a a unique see that
you will have his house number us well

89
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,340
that would write the services on the
port

90
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:25,730
it supports complex on the street in my
time in tonight meaning that

91
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:29,860
you may have a single East ass or you
may have seen running status of these

92
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:30,530
brought

93
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:34,020
interconnected and talking to each other

94
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:37,800
processing all the information from the
Francis task so it could be

95
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,390
a very complex landscape right we
focused the stock on on ass in going

96
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,080
stance

97
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:47,730
a.m. the fourth implementation but this
could be a very very complex

98
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:50,980
am well it good

99
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:55,010
it supports our time text mining so you
can do a lot of things are wrong text

100
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:55,400
right

101
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:00,480
its they mean and awards identification
on comp complex search

102
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,880
processor teen and you can do like text

103
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,930
on I don't text are like Boolean
operators

104
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:10,790
it's really strong a you can really do a
lot of things

105
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:14,250
and you can also send like %uh
structured data that document

106
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:18,090
and you have a for example their CV
harassing me

107
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:23,830
or name any PDF document to HTML
document senita T-rex it will process it

108
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:27,770
are you may have like a business object
write something that

109
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:31,460
you know its attributes you know how it
looks like you know what's in that in

110
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:31,840
there

111
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,450
on you just send you just say hey this
is how it looks like

112
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:38,610
start indexing and then I will start and

113
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:42,710
searching all over so some history

114
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:46,340
we really have challenges trying to
identify

115
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:50,650
when it start the if it was about that
was both ASAP or not

116
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:54,090
a.m. so we've got something from
Wikipedia

117
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:58,110
something from the documentation on a
apparently the first call that

118
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:00,420
everything worse and 1998

119
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,940
and this is important because when you
start looking to borrow

120
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:07,980
on your own the week you see when it
worse and develop or the sign

121
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:12,060
when it started it gives he'll at least
an idea

122
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:15,550
on on their roots right on the broad so
you can see

123
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:18,830
that there could be some issues maybe
not but

124
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:21,970
that gives you a good idea for some
trivia and I sing about the

125
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:26,080
that has called from the 80s up from the
90s you know that there is something

126
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:26,800
there for sure

127
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,990
hum the t-rex

128
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:35,330
and the first component in in 2000 so we
have some versions

129
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:38,530
and but they're then-us integrate into
the

130
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:42,280
basi rate or maybe you're familiar with
that hit something

131
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,800
a hardware-based you get a an an
appliance

132
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:50,230
that pass T-rex and inside and you can
have her and much

133
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:54,010
and I love appliances integrate them on
on you will have

134
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:57,610
day indexing and searching across the
different

135
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:01,300
air products right for example for a
piece of intelligence

136
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:05,100
am then this another probe that view

137
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:08,430
you will see other options as well it's
a

138
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:12,610
NetWare enterprise search for special
and 7.2 in 2008

139
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:16,100
right now the current version is 7.3 and
the t-rex

140
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:19,330
session if you want to implement one now
is 7.1

141
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:22,730
has a set bachelor 63 so

142
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:25,840
what's there is some for having this
kind of France right

143
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,900
so when we so thinking about it why
would you have that

144
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,260
an index or such action right and

145
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:36,770
while it's because you need to be able
to search

146
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:40,630
and to the complex such as across the
Big Data you have right so

147
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:45,510
if you have in attic insulation you will
have thousands of bees a subject

148
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:49,590
thousands of documents other information
that East

149
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:53,190
typically on the database right SAP
systems outdate every three min

150
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:56,660
so you have tables lots of them and you
have

151
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:00,420
keys like primary key secondary keys you
have some indexes

152
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:04,500
but to do like the this search s in the
database itself

153
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:09,250
that could take a long time I so it's
prohibit from prior

154
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:12,710
from a performance perspective that's
why a.m.

155
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:15,810
you need it said attention if you need
to the complex such as

156
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:19,450
I'm and that's why T-rex showed up

157
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:23,110
so this a comparison of how much it's a

158
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:26,760
changes right if you don't like the
search through the database are

159
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:30,030
dress attention I'm

160
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:34,420
yes I said thousands of Business Objects
document a lot of information

161
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:38,540
am be at this isn't any chance man
business processes

162
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:43,590
customer information vendor information
on other things that you might need to

163
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:47,390
to new cord to search through that in at
week for a way

164
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:50,770
in a quick fashion um

165
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:54,640
so that's why we need in excess that's a
solution from SAP

166
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,450
I'm we have the solution is a
stand-alone engine

167
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:03,100
its completely separated from the C span
so you you take lead up to the low

168
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,740
of indexing and searching processing the
document

169
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:10,600
all that low you take it away of the SAP
system itself

170
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:15,200
right I'm you put it in a stand-in Gina
anticipated cost

171
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,520
you may have say several of them and
that

172
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:22,050
that way you can escalate in terms of
more documents

173
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:25,070
Martin Texas on and I

174
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:29,660
foster such so

175
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:33,240
you might have seen these presentation
at the slight sorry

176
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,110
in other presentations this is very
common for us

177
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:40,630
but this is very interesting for me to
go

178
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:45,320
from the technical perspective that I i
come from from a technical work right

179
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:49,610
understanding come on execution on won't
have any tease buffer overflows

180
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:52,680
insecure Protocol services to

181
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:56,100
actually know that dose its services

182
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:59,470
those those systems are running business
processes therefore

183
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:03,310
any of those technical rarities on SAP
systems could

184
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:07,420
leave eventually to not only espionage

185
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:10,950
like getting all this information right
can read in the slide

186
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:14,240
summer bash shutting down the system I

187
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,250
a buffer overflow and insecure come on

188
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:21,029
things that could and shut down the
system and you you don't have the

189
00:11:21,029 --> 00:11:22,540
business process running anymore

190
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:26,310
are even fraud attacks modifying are
tampering with the business information

191
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,160
but

192
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,190
our focus now he said this kind of a

193
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,570
attacks right because what you can do it
maybe it

194
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:38,790
if you think about it you say hey yet
it's a set tension right

195
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:42,820
but what could go wrong it helps me do
things faster

196
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:47,029
it has me and be more efficient with
such a sweet treat some

197
00:11:47,029 --> 00:11:50,800
business processes but the thing is that
at

198
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,959
this extend my search engines actually

199
00:11:53,959 --> 00:11:56,980
indexing business information right so

200
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:00,450
this SAP systems are sending the bees as
data

201
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:03,459
to this attention on you have

202
00:12:03,459 --> 00:12:07,320
they are information that could be but
then she queried by someone knocks

203
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:11,620
if it's not properly implement so

204
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:15,120
so she's going to describe some of the
use cases or some other products

205
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,220
actually right now using T-rex

206
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:22,170
even though if you don't have that date
stand-alone installation you may have

207
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:23,520
some of these products as well

208
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:27,500
okay to to enter now

209
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:31,270
a death from they should have where we
can find

210
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:35,890
Europe's the first example eighties did
a search engine service

211
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:39,130
or unusually calm wanna is EDS process

212
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:41,260
and

213
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:44,010
it comes by default in every NetWeaver

214
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:48,010
so it allows you to calmly communicate
with direct

215
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:51,110
I'm performed the searches so

216
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:54,280
the the most basic example

217
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:57,810
is when you for example 02 that got too
much

218
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:01,900
transection and then you want to find
the customers

219
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:05,420
with letter T so

220
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:08,770
you all today feel you too you type T

221
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:14,340
star you best F-four at the moment you
you come in you we know

222
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:17,510
where you con sartre put these

223
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:21,310
sorry for the same but there's an option

224
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:24,320
where you can use these such engine
saris

225
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,540
and at the moment diffused the situation
said race

226
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,800
going to perform that's art within

227
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,680
day it'd be direct and you will receive
that the resort

228
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,750
so by default it'd be

229
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:41,580
house approximately 50 being subject

230
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:46,820
the air that you hit it that gives you
the possibility to index them

231
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:50,930
like Ben does got to mars okay for me to
us

232
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:54,430
am purchase or other stakeholders all
this

233
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:57,580
it kinda object I here by default

234
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:02,610
are you gonna index them a without an
ear for they then you can create the

235
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:03,500
only new kind of

236
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,510
indexes of new objects bye bye before
you come up

237
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:09,880
at least 50 investors shun Stas

238
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,060
underscore I mean you can configure the
search

239
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:18,139
engine

240
00:14:18,139 --> 00:14:21,540
this is on pace his new one that'd be
mentioned before

241
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:24,749
that we were and the price at if

242
00:14:24,749 --> 00:14:28,299
in this case they met with the press
eight

243
00:14:28,299 --> 00:14:31,769
he's a layer which is on top by this
such

244
00:14:31,769 --> 00:14:35,559
engine sirens so the main difference

245
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:38,879
with the previous one is that this
search and Cancer Res

246
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:42,279
I loath the I did you sir to assert

247
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:46,189
within a system and dust that system
this search

248
00:14:46,189 --> 00:14:50,129
and the race this sorry then they would
end up research I love to connect

249
00:14:50,129 --> 00:14:53,920
sewer systems SAP system and not to be
systems

250
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,389
to the concert a.m. window systems

251
00:14:58,389 --> 00:15:02,299
and to retain information for those
systems so hey this is the main

252
00:15:02,299 --> 00:15:02,929
difference

253
00:15:02,929 --> 00:15:06,899
and this is what we call on yes so if
you think about it

254
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:10,319
it's kind of a layer stock correlation
to the Pro tried

255
00:15:10,319 --> 00:15:13,589
so the most basic use case will be

256
00:15:13,589 --> 00:15:17,790
and then the previous one s yes that you
have the Business Objects

257
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:20,839
and the and the NetWeaver

258
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:24,019
or the AM a lot see them knows how to
map

259
00:15:24,019 --> 00:15:27,079
those Business Objects into the t-rex in
Texas

260
00:15:27,079 --> 00:15:30,929
so you can definitely go on index dose
but then you have

261
00:15:30,929 --> 00:15:35,160
also there and we had to buy such which
is some more enterprise-grade solution

262
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:39,069
but you can do and distributors searches
you can have

263
00:15:39,069 --> 00:15:42,399
non SAP systems as well so we turned out
better

264
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,149
or a more robust approach in terms of of
from China to write

265
00:15:46,149 --> 00:15:49,819
but it's still you seen s yes and then
eat

266
00:15:49,819 --> 00:15:54,029
also using T rex 11 example

267
00:15:54,029 --> 00:15:57,989
it the ACP knowledge warehouse is a
solution based on Dell up

268
00:15:57,989 --> 00:16:02,910
which lows to mine at information about
trainings materials

269
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:06,529
look at their and documents moneywise

270
00:16:06,529 --> 00:16:09,860
so a in the fuckin 80s using

271
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:13,579
T-rex for the search on all these kind
of the point

272
00:16:13,579 --> 00:16:16,629
animation all the examples the

273
00:16:16,629 --> 00:16:19,919
you can also find T-rex in some parts
are teachers

274
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:21,330
a.m.

275
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:25,030
but the pictures are you seem to know
them to look into I think there are

276
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:28,860
or cases but we just wanted to mention
this feel

277
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:32,590
just for you to know that did it is
going is being used

278
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:37,050
in God and in addition hey it's a it
really the best on this scenario that

279
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:37,700
you are in

280
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:42,710
right you may have parked out be a
business warehouse space in Galatians

281
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:46,170
you may have and the s yes they are

282
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:49,820
different scenarios depending on your
requirements that you may have

283
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:53,200
T-rex in the lower layer in the lowest
players

284
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:59,340
running and and supporting all the
searches Solis to the holiday that

285
00:16:59,340 --> 00:16:59,920
picture

286
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,840
of Europe's missus

287
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:07,670
the mass came up and he said the main
component

288
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:11,030
without name server: index error

289
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:15,910
cue cerebral process are a.m. for anyone
up one of the most important for us

290
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:19,370
we're going to see their they are he
said about the worst terror

291
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:22,880
and then the client a.m.

292
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,600
the one-time thing here is that this is
a compass architecture

293
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:31,040
and then and day they do.

294
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,120
this so component I don't you too

295
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,540
make them a need to eat it so

296
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:41,400
in a anything then this summer in
taurine understand along

297
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:45,270
implementation you we have this just
thinking about by you then you don't

298
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:45,810
have

299
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:49,210
for example one name said or so early
into for other

300
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:53,510
indifferent Coast and set up to process
orders so you can be 20

301
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:56,790
sorry so you can babe I'll ask their
though

302
00:17:56,790 --> 00:18:00,720
of their work so let's see

303
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,350
one by one

304
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:08,590
the first by the name senator for those
quotes email with NetWeaver

305
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:12,080
it it's enough to them message server

306
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,429
so it's I love to buy them on the
request for indexing

307
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:19,940
up for such as between different process
of

308
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:23,820
a in I'm index and indifference I'm

309
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:26,920
info it does so coordinates that their
application

310
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:30,070
and informational did apology so when
you are

311
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:34,740
in a single against us and found that
owning the a stance

312
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:38,380
it does I'm not a the same may make many
sense

313
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:45,380
but if useful when it is ne2d their
implementation

314
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:49,450
they will come one of the most important
component

315
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:52,710
they make for a which is the one in char

316
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:56,299
of actually indexing on information

317
00:18:56,299 --> 00:18:59,700
so they nerf herder

318
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:03,210
danger for the fifth information from
the process of then we're going to see

319
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:04,049
the process or

320
00:19:04,049 --> 00:19:07,559
by then the NFL in Texas on information

321
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:10,929
I'm from the searches or this

322
00:19:10,929 --> 00:19:14,370
indexes you concert by the text

323
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:17,820
or you're so concert by up to his for
example the

324
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:21,980
detail for of a document the data plan a
vacation

325
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:25,630
I know any add to that the common house
you can also

326
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:32,500
you see it for for such then the case
ever

327
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,620
us their name say if he does you tho

328
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:39,040
to use it as a cue to

329
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:42,049
from sever a.m.

330
00:19:42,049 --> 00:19:45,460
indexing doc so you don't you think you
set up a schedule

331
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:49,610
some tough but is some bull you want to

332
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:52,900
sk2 an index to index sometime

333
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:56,500
object like bend or cyano every one day

334
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,610
so so you use the queue server

335
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:03,070
to how about this a in-depth

336
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:08,080
index touched in in a correct order a.m.

337
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,370
mmm yes yes basically the key over there

338
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:14,929
the queue server allows you to NQ

339
00:20:14,929 --> 00:20:19,000
indexing process is so %um if you have
on your PC stem

340
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,720
but at least actually consuming the
t-rex you will have the Business Objects

341
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:28,019
being modified like continuously right
and you want to have those changes

342
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:31,240
in the t-rex therefore the skew sever is

343
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:36,299
gonna hold all day they thank you the
key there sorry the indexing process is

344
00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:40,080
of the Delta are all the changes to the
peace process

345
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:45,409
to the setups for and in the process of

346
00:20:45,409 --> 00:20:49,299
which is day are important component
because

347
00:20:49,299 --> 00:20:53,649
every time document is received by the
Duke server

348
00:20:53,649 --> 00:20:57,200
the processor is chertoff bus every war

349
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,679
of that document and then it

350
00:21:00,679 --> 00:21:03,929
it took a nice every war it stem East

351
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:07,440
is stem every war and then identify

352
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,850
the town which and then may flake

353
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:14,080
a it buzz information and then

354
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,159
it have the position of each wall

355
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:20,429
in in the document so in cuffs it does

356
00:21:20,429 --> 00:21:24,010
a really well and I cease of every
document and then

357
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:27,039
sense on information gleaned if they're
also the answer our

358
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:34,039
and then index on these a.m. what about
the purposes of us

359
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,940
I'm impressed the most investing

360
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:44,260
and they are Cicero and the Los Angeles
the two-component

361
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:48,260
I just to communicate with other systems
so when you are

362
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:51,970
went to coming in with an a book system
use the

363
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:54,990
RC server and where you want to go out
to another

364
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:58,340
system and Nana CB system or adult
system

365
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:01,770
I taken as use there were several

366
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:05,070
the manifesto is the is one speaks

367
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:08,169
are see protocol I don't know one HTTP

368
00:22:08,169 --> 00:22:12,600
I receives all day think I don't worry
for information

369
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:19,530
through XML so

370
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:22,940
me see where we're going to use they
will play and

371
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:27,299
and Adela blamed I want you know they
want to refer you to the CS

372
00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:31,169
it safe to have ABA's may only be used

373
00:22:31,169 --> 00:22:34,610
SAP internally cannot safely be used by
customers

374
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:37,909
or but not this text while farm

375
00:22:37,909 --> 00:22:39,220
in

376
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:42,659
in and you had a official-looking meant
that the command of SAP

377
00:22:42,659 --> 00:22:47,529
so so what does it mean it means that
you cannot build the product

378
00:22:47,529 --> 00:22:52,720
based on the safety ace right so you
cannot interact directly with the spare

379
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,039
we T-rex but use you need to use

380
00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:59,049
their body from china tea I do you have
for example s yes

381
00:22:59,049 --> 00:23:02,330
and all the rest of approx so the scene
to face

382
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:05,710
the the say APIs are they are

383
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:08,980
should not be consumed by any other pro
right but

384
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:12,169
you have them they are you have been
listening to a network you have

385
00:23:12,169 --> 00:23:18,210
interfaces or APIs that are and leasing
for requests so that's that's a

386
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:21,889
that's basically united to understand
how secure

387
00:23:21,889 --> 00:23:25,480
this both east and west implemented a
you need to know

388
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,960
and the asset to some of these questions
air for example

389
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,220
how the Gateway is a gateway secure
because we know that

390
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:36,340
the securing the gate with a challenging
tasks and and therefore

391
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:40,559
any to do up processing are to secure it
greater danger faces

392
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:44,320
I'm can anyone actually access to the
safe the ice

393
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,850
like if we r SAP customers can we

394
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:51,230
and make sure that no one he sexually
connected to these

395
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:57,980
tell it where we're at right on so that

396
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:04,590
so that see that the scenarios the first

397
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:07,820
thing that's and its ok I will do but

398
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:12,150
when I say this a white hair when I mean
that when we want to protect

399
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:15,420
our systems 22 thing attackers because

400
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:18,540
in his that the best way of protecting
us

401
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:21,650
because they ok we're going to there

402
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:24,970
who want to attack us so the first thing
is

403
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:29,700
to understand ho to find it you know
it's a it's era

404
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:33,200
so it very simple common of

405
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,570
and mock and the server

406
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:40,929
the port related to tear it ass

407
00:24:40,929 --> 00:24:44,750
any artist to be built in custody but
%uh for the part

408
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:48,480
he so i three the stock number: and a
number of the service

409
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,670
you can find here a the number

410
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:54,850
related to every component in this case
it sees

411
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:59,320
obviously a serious fight a stance so

412
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:03,920
anyone familiar with this pattern in
other products okay

413
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:07,990
so da a lap different SEP broke

414
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:11,920
are following these they say is fast
number bottom to

415
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:16,910
i lo anyone in style it different is
that is of the same probe

416
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:21,059
in there same physical Haas so

417
00:25:21,059 --> 00:25:24,860
we're going to use these HTTP Server

418
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:28,420
so we're going to to seek always eat it
behaves

419
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:33,910
and don't understand it and then also
we're going to use dirty Sarah through

420
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:34,540
the gateway

421
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:37,980
so

422
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:41,830
the zip code should work there

423
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:47,100
I don't see senator registers into this
to be a wait and then they see them

424
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:51,410
send request to that sever but they're

425
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:54,809
you call your food how the money supply
and which

426
00:25:54,809 --> 00:25:58,690
use in a good way comment to that the
right server so

427
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:02,240
will have a question here

428
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,529
this how any kind of authentication here
authorizations

429
00:26:05,529 --> 00:26:09,240
air and that's very very simple egos

430
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:13,269
this educational institution was here so

431
00:26:13,269 --> 00:26:16,779
if they gain weight is not properly
secure we don't

432
00:26:16,779 --> 00:26:20,190
we just can use it to rate left on a
cerrar

433
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:23,570
then we can see what can we do with it
and basically

434
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:28,019
in order to connect to SAP T-rex through
there are seen to face you need to know

435
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:31,779
there at the ATP name or I might be with
cheese

436
00:26:31,779 --> 00:26:34,960
and in a t-rex underscored this either

437
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,440
underscore that they they see they often
a t-rex he stands

438
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:41,690
I underscore the date of registration so
we pass

439
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:45,419
apart which is and some somehow Bible

440
00:26:45,419 --> 00:26:52,299
but once it's the fine he doesn't change
so it's it's fixed and look up

441
00:26:52,299 --> 00:26:57,429
day Joe IPA which is tough a simple

442
00:26:57,429 --> 00:27:00,769
like this you just need to perform
request with it

443
00:27:00,769 --> 00:27:05,679
to the HTTP Server bossed request we
debate with we that we

444
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:08,679
I have them at Baylor and they just that

445
00:27:08,679 --> 00:27:12,159
there response and do it

446
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:15,899
nado their authentication authorization
mechanism

447
00:27:15,899 --> 00:27:22,210
implemented here and I guess

448
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:25,430
okay it not out that's right

449
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:32,270
so they're going to show you some the
most because somebody has to show you

450
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:36,290
these are the things that we want to see
now first

451
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:39,590
Co to read using the job lame the cutest
Russian

452
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:42,650
hope to have they if I see them pop

453
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:46,740
where all the Nexus are located and then
we're going to get

454
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:50,060
all the indexes so well then it's and a
description of

455
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:54,580
every index I'm using day of play and
we're going to respond I some

456
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:58,300
Europe services on the performance of
them we're going to see

457
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:03,030
the operation of the other server which
is one of the other main component

458
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:06,300
and they're willing to wait timing
confirmation of

459
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:12,040
every index so so basically I asked this
hour

460
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:15,700
the friend de moss and we have some BDS
avoided

461
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:18,730
there they sure live they must first

462

465
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:34,710
slashed Europe's and then you've got e

466
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:38,480
a response in XML which is safe I don't
know request

467
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,400
to know that see hallways

468

00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:08,570
this the metro-east get deluxe version
and then

475
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:12,110
the location of the index era so that
you come

476
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:19,110
I for different in the traverse a and
the same request

tears 7 but wanna and their relation

480
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,809
53 which is the last one I think was
released

481
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:44,159
on november december re that's here her
was the first one

482
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:48,539
million digital version now that's cool
today

483
00:29:48,539 --> 00:29:52,140
in that spot the same request we just

484
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:57,870
change the metal basis get but we

485
00:29:57,870 --> 00:30:04,870
diving for location which is known are a
way of

486
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:12,160
thank you have

487
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:15,710
where it's located there on the Nexus

488
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:20,890
and if I system so then we're going to
see what can we do with all this

489
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:23,080
information oh well now we are in the
bar of

490
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:26,750
protruding antenna information and then
we're going to see whether

491
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:31,370
we can do whale we all that information
these another one

492
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:34,450
this is the third one getting

493
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:39,660
all indexes so in this case it again and
I'm your request

494
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:43,100
and the Middle East get all indices
index

495
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:48,060
thank you how

496
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:54,790
all the Nexus in this direct system I
just

497
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:58,410
and bass basically that the next time
that same formation

498
00:30:58,410 --> 00:31:01,590
that's kind of the name are they
identify our of

499
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:05,940
some star Usher information right the
index is the one that is going to be

500
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:06,600
holding

501
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:10,340
all the information that you have sent
and anything I

502
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:13,460
on indexed Wainwright USA

503
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:16,529
a different vendor customers but

504
00:31:16,529 --> 00:31:19,789
locations where okay we'll have Sarah
index is here

505
00:31:19,789 --> 00:31:24,250
so do what about you seen

506
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:27,309
Daam just using h2b

507
00:31:27,309 --> 00:31:31,880
just possibly with with an XML they were
going to see

508
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:35,309
now we're going to see the other case
which is you seemed a

509
00:31:35,309 --> 00:31:38,510
airplane which is

510
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:42,990
obviously RFC it was great

511
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:46,230
this this is a function call

512
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:49,880
and have the function which is developed
inside

513
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:54,230
their I don't see if the Nats ever
frontier so

514
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:58,320
cucumber from the function through the
airway

515
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:03,070
so which I'll their requirements before
performing this

516
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:10,070
function where the video

517
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:14,170
here we had a really hot we need AP

518
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:19,950
of the Gateway way they fought to gain
weight I hear

519
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:23,340
the TP in this case this is

520
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:26,930
that have been able to deliver activity
for this direct

521
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:30,130
there this season the system and then

522
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:35,900
to a date

523
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:38,980
I he whois how we use it does air

524
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:42,600
the desperation the first row tweet it
is safe

525
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:46,100
iface be quite a bit interface being
when you use

526
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:50,200
are to see you need variously there the
interface

527
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:54,190
which are they in part but I meet us
there it's proper to meet at the tables

528
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:57,429
so you need before executing their
departure

529
00:32:57,429 --> 00:33:01,070
so in the first place we are defining
dis I had this

530
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:04,610
doctor and we just executed

531
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:08,570
just take that we arm

532
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:13,370
how anything well we are you seeing you
some of war or claim that and just

533
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:13,830
talking

534
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:17,080
I mean in my speed iPods

535
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:20,919
there there is thought because it
incomes does in one row

536
00:33:20,919 --> 00:33:25,100
other night just running

537
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:28,350
his one-week up

538
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:32,640
work-up this elevation

539
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,940
this is their names Federer and they
look up

540
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:40,039
at the information about the memory the

541
00:33:40,039 --> 00:33:45,649
deposit this of Use for this review the
deceased is being that server

542
00:33:45,649 --> 00:33:48,750
which in the in this case is see 2
percent

543
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:53,080
Solis perform a search I see how it me
say

544
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:56,090
situation there famous such

545
00:33:56,090 --> 00:34:02,270
engine

546
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:06,370
I does looking for Press and Ryan

547
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:11,320
prop and now we can see it just

548
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:16,550
now least 2 percent alrighty then and
now he's

549
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:21,970
nineteen percent so easy if a whale seen
call it is working right now

550
00:34:21,970 --> 00:34:25,020
one day I am going to such and

551
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:28,090
Indus I I am working on the statistics

552
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:32,899
and icing coated working is it a second
base

553
00:34:32,899 --> 00:34:36,669
there underserved population

554
00:34:36,669 --> 00:34:40,119
this is another component which
basically issues

555
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:43,820
when you help another and a needed a
system

556
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:47,850
I use it 20 send emails to their

557
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:51,290
to the meter to see what's going on

558
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:54,399
and then to to check so a call and I'll

559
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:57,410
as a function here we use

560
00:34:57,410 --> 00:35:04,060
it in the same way us this one to the
same

561
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:09,249
and we executed

562
00:35:09,249 --> 00:35:15,050
me is this other guy meters

563
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:19,110
thank you how about this one to be set
on water they either so is going

564
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:22,220
sorry this in December all that said our

565
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:26,740
which is going to use of cooperation to
some emails the mice and other motor CBS

566
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:30,000
and im a subject without all the
information but

567
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,380
I think it was that Moss beautiful to
the show

568
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:38,200
but it basically it's showing Arlington
a population of the

569
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:44,850
I that's over

570
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:49,940
a hot one more I want us want to ask you
to pay attention to be eventually ended

571
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:50,400
in this

572
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:55,100
that's one this last BDO because here

573
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:59,500
we're going to show %uh named and to
show one in this means

574
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:02,930
that we're going to see all that they
can get information of that

575
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:06,780
index we're going to see the index ID

576
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:10,150
which is they won is right here

577
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:13,530
is wrote there in 10 it there and

578
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:16,760
how we get this eighty with a previous

579
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:19,760
it's an idea where you where we it

580
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,810
ordained it on the Nexus so there
without

581
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:27,500
all day these I description so that's
what example want to lead the katanas

582
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:30,890
and wake up day in detail the of got
tossed

583
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:34,930
so we we just need a that mean SAT and
we're going to see

584
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:38,850
this page on I did I would use supported
by the index

585
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:42,180
well it's a pity that index in which

586
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:46,530
index error we're going to see the
creation date:

587
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:53,530
of the AM me for what

588
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:58,700
vacation days of the AM in this
migration a

589
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:01,850
if it is political not if it is keeping
the content

590
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:06,120
insight if you can use it for 30 if he
did you guys for right

591
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:09,500
and a half myspace for the index

592
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:13,100
and then dip most importantly they want
to put up a rough on the

593
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:17,460
after it of that kingdom it means that
he it's going to show you

594
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:20,490
area to it all

595
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:24,220
that index for example you have got a
lot to help

596
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:28,010
the name of the customer that if the
customer on if you're talking about

597
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:29,040
saying so other

598
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:32,690
if price I don't be went to see which

599
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:39,690
a tribute we have for each index we
executed

600
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:44,880
i hook up they may say the missus

601
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,940
forgot my calls decibel

602
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:52,499
English this is a bit in these and the
host parents bought

603
00:37:52,499 --> 00:37:56,329
if I think is keeping it under wealth

604
00:37:56,329 --> 00:38:00,219
you fight the deeded faith-based I saw
the add to it

605
00:38:00,219 --> 00:38:03,709
and F want to hit the sack here because

606
00:38:03,709 --> 00:38:07,829
maybe we're going to use it later we
have here

607
00:38:07,829 --> 00:38:11,479
any subject to take %uh names up there

608
00:38:11,479 --> 00:38:14,749
they add to it if you'll have an SABC
time you guys see

609
00:38:14,749 --> 00:38:19,150
at a mean of the trial anyone familiar
with that and with those

610
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:24,749
attributes hair my number

611
00:38:24,749 --> 00:38:31,210

am how to connect ill T-rex and get

615
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:44,490
technical information night just and
maybe

616
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:47,700
which other indexes which are the
attributes of each

617
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:50,830
index I'm a what's this

618
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:54,650
Cebuano this gonna technical information
which yeah

619
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:58,300
you might think about it okay its
technical information I

620
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:01,750
it can make no harm right but then

621
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:05,740
you cannot ollie execute this kinda
functions but you can also

622
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:09,270
use it to send right it's a search
engine so you can search

623
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:12,490
and it rethought am so

624
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:16,110
its let's keep morning with their
presentation

625
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:20,600
I see which is that we are impact to the
business

626
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,830
on this and on this product right

627
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:27,210
so actually am

628
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:32,690
so sure our listed in the excess we can
see that the technical information on

629
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:35,750
are the all that say that information
that

630
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:39,220
we know it's the Politecnico but them

631
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:43,420
on the other hand we have a you service
you have

632
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:48,480
and access control you have GRC of that
I say shots of indication you have a lot

633
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,450
of barriers

634
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:53,910
right to access to what the business
information that's

635
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:57,320
the most important thing that you U Haul

636
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:00,670
within your SAP systems but then what
happens

637
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:05,300
do you think an attacker would try to
break all those barriers

638
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:09,490
in terms of and eventually to get into
the business information

639
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:13,960
well basically if there is an interface
that he can abuse

640
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:18,110
in order to get to the same information
then he will definitely

641
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:22,050
go that way so

642
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:25,470
now let's see a couple of and more

643
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:29,950
business-oriented their loss a

644
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:31,680
so the first Grand

645
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,820
what do you think is

646
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:40,640
more must more critical and customers
information to say this or other sport

647
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,110
is so the stove endorse

648
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:45,910
okay

649
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:50,450
its that's big one a.m. thats go for
purchase others

650
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:54,040
so here what we what we have a yes

651
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:58,080
someone accessing the purchase other
transaction and then

652
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:02,010
accessing the Diff'rent a information
that he's

653
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:06,320
they are right this is an authorized
user with the puppy dishes

654
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:09,890
he just has the authorization object
hopefully to do

655
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:13,180
on me what he needs to do which is that
there may be some other thing

656
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:16,700
and you can see that they items here

657
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:20,110
I am but then also

658
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:23,550
if you use the same interface

659
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:27,800
that we have been a talking to basically

660
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,910
what's possible a still beale some

661
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:34,110
quite like that which is a Sat
Wainwright you select

662
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:38,700
I are I'm on some attributes of one
specific index

663
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:42,760
the Seas Dane the ex of the information
on this is it the ideal

664
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:48,720
that purchase other and then if you do
that query

665
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:52,680
you will get basically the same results
right maybe it's not

666
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:55,910
all the information there but the
information that he's

667
00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:59,760
indexes is they are unavailable right
and

668
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,770
so you to see the ID day I Thames am

669
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:07,880
well its all they are on if we compare
against the day

670
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:11,130
there we have purchase or other it's
gonna be the same information right so

671
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:12,480
this is business information

672
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:16,040
this information that for some companies
might be

673
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:20,720
more critical of rather see three
defense if it's a bender a customer

674
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:25,710
formula there is a also adding that were
formulated it really depends on what the

675
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:26,360
neighbor

676
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:29,640
right are what you actually Knicks this
also

677
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:34,090
another index for am for example for
candidates

678
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:35,480
when you have a a

679
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:38,410
then the airport application to

680
00:42:38,410 --> 00:42:41,460
to sup me to a job right and

681
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:45,050
so you have died all indexes night day
the minimum wage

682
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:48,780
the maximum wage all the information on
you got cigarette that

683
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:52,540
information on so it's really really
sensitive it really depends on how you

684
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:55,940
classified information for some of you
may

685
00:42:55,940 --> 00:43:00,180
might make more sense for some others
mind might be more or less critical

686
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:03,400
but that's their right so

687
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:06,530
at this is I think another example

688
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:11,240
am we are you seeing no

689
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:14,830
yet purchase are there are spent plea
come going and

690
00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:18,930
we can I would say so there for example
and

691
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:22,090
if we move over it beats

692
00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:25,230
more we will see that

693
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:28,950
week we can see the sets are thus I we
can also see

694
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:33,369
the value right the actual by the office
so it's also index it

695
00:43:33,369 --> 00:43:38,190
I and it's this same that you will get
going

696
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:42,580
to let us talk show on accessing with
all the physician of shapes with all the

697
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:43,330
various

698
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:46,960
that occur with try to break hair but
this is just

699
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:50,950
and there right avail so

700
00:43:50,950 --> 00:43:55,840
we have to think about this because we
might think okay to technical component

701
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:56,970
it's helping me too

702
00:43:56,970 --> 00:44:00,020
do things faster maybe to search some
some

703
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:04,150
been subject some documents summing the
excess so that they really have that the

704
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:04,790
body or

705
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:09,280
ham and if we go to to the actual
transaction

706
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,390
you will see that this it's exactly the
same and

707
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:16,600
so going but we gots a you might think
it's a 10-yard component

708
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:21,450
I don't care about their it's not cover
on our policy since Aug

709
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:25,440
it's not of the our productive landscape
bypass

710
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:29,220
tech and business information that right
so we need to protect it

711
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:34,490
this same as we do with all the rest of
assistance

712
00:44:34,490 --> 00:44:38,190
I'm ok

713
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:41,700
so

714
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:45,730
how do we protect against this kind of
attacks right those are the interfaces

715
00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:46,819
that's how it works

716
00:44:46,819 --> 00:44:50,049
it's Eric C its ATP that's how

717
00:44:50,049 --> 00:44:55,160
and this was meant to work and these are
the APIs are being consumed by

718
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:58,299
all these different products right so

719
00:44:58,299 --> 00:45:02,410
what do you do first of all security
gateway we know it's done DJing

720
00:45:02,410 --> 00:45:05,940
but you need to restrict access to a
gateway especially the gate with that is

721
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:06,700
being used

722
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:10,980
by the city rec see stars are any T rex
is dance right

723
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:15,000
because the interface with air up is
going through the great way so we

724
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,109
definitely need to

725
00:45:16,109 --> 00:45:19,660
close breaking for and restrict who can
connect to that

726
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:23,000
ATP name on this ABC stands I while

727
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:27,500
its it's really complex but you
definitely need to do it implement SNC

728
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:31,450
that's possible and T-rex supports the
use of SNC so

729
00:45:31,450 --> 00:45:34,700
were really recommended because as you
saw

730
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:38,750
that's business information is flowing
through that RFC communication so

731
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:42,369
you definitely need to implement SNC and
used

732
00:45:42,369 --> 00:45:45,790
SSL or TLS for their web interface I

733
00:45:45,790 --> 00:45:49,369
again in order to increase the
communication are entered the traffic

734
00:45:49,369 --> 00:45:52,670
we need to implement a secure protocol
am

735
00:45:52,670 --> 00:45:57,530
we have had about the different today
the last attacks to TRS to SSO

736
00:45:57,530 --> 00:46:01,299
not only implemented but also
implemented in a secure way

737
00:46:01,299 --> 00:46:04,460
and with certificates with the proper
operations

738
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:09,020
and all that fit their access to the T T
rex ATP interface

739
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:12,109
it to all those systems are actually not

740
00:46:12,109 --> 00:46:16,180
that do not need to connect right that's
the same principle that we have

741
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:20,359
with sabc steps right we should keep our
systems

742
00:46:20,359 --> 00:46:23,619
isolated from they the uses that

743
00:46:23,619 --> 00:46:28,130
do not need to access that right so for
example with City Thunder combination so

744
00:46:28,130 --> 00:46:28,670
way to

745
00:46:28,670 --> 00:46:32,619
printer they the database for you need
to expose at

746
00:46:32,619 --> 00:46:34,820
Anfield tera where

747
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:38,030
I know the management console for
example am

748
00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:41,940
that there are a lot of different
services then use us are you seeing the

749
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:42,920
dispatcher

750
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:45,950
gateway the message server maybe ACM

751
00:46:45,950 --> 00:46:49,080
so follow the same principle restrict
access to

752
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:53,570
that service because I was we can be
exposing information and definitely keep

753
00:46:53,570 --> 00:46:56,590
T-rex updated we know that and that

754
00:46:56,590 --> 00:47:00,910
from a CBC stance as well from all the
rest of our products we need to

755
00:47:00,910 --> 00:47:04,060
keep eats also updated with the rest say
of

756
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:08,440
are asked so I'm

757
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:11,610
drawing some conclusions it's at

758
00:47:11,610 --> 00:47:14,900
search engine right it's a search engine
that allows us to

759
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:17,980
send information they are in the exit
process it

760
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:22,450
by we need to be aware that this could
be business information you may have

761
00:47:22,450 --> 00:47:23,860
other things right

762
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:27,820
this could maybe if you have it indexing
no great game from a song

763
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:31,030
that could be the case that's that's
fine by

764
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:35,350
if you have business information you
should definitely put a lot of effort

765
00:47:35,350 --> 00:47:36,690
into securing this

766
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:39,950
I'm yet because it could hold

767
00:47:39,950 --> 00:47:44,000
business information so by before
there's no authentication and give some

768
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,070
air protecting access to T-rex you need
to

769
00:47:48,070 --> 00:47:52,030
implement security around that need to
secure access you need to restrict

770
00:47:52,030 --> 00:47:52,770
access to

771
00:47:52,770 --> 00:47:56,860
those that are not of a nice 20 to
access to hear that brother

772
00:47:56,860 --> 00:48:00,930
include T-rex and with all the rest of
your

773
00:48:00,930 --> 00:48:03,960
SAP Proxxon USA class good because I waz

774
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:07,750
this Kong potentially go fishing
information there that could be

775
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:13,950
access tonya it's not just a
technicality them it's not just another

776
00:48:13,950 --> 00:48:18,860
component its something that may be
running on your landscape on you may

777
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:22,530
have so some rough Francis

778
00:48:22,530 --> 00:48:25,780
and in terms of air documentation on

779
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:28,810
there is documentation around
configuring

780
00:48:28,810 --> 00:48:33,610
SSL configuring SNC there is there are
security guys for t-rex

781
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:37,120
so I really recommend you to go there on

782
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:39,190
and take a look at their references sigh

783
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:46,190
and they guidelines on and make it
secure okay

784
00:48:46,329 --> 00:48:49,920
I think we have a nine minutes for
questions I'm

785
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:56,920
yep

786
00:48:58,830 --> 00:49:02,690
thank you for the great goal I just
missed missed the part when you connect

787
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:05,140
to the register server with the

788
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:08,430
TP name T-rex underscore sidd yeah

789
00:49:08,430 --> 00:49:12,559
and then there's the 14 digits they'd
stop yeah though that you obtain the

790
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:16,359
date stamp actually yet what thats they
they time

791
00:49:16,359 --> 00:49:20,089
is defined when you configure TRX with
their gateway

792
00:49:20,089 --> 00:49:24,240
right use at and applications call T-rex
I mean

793
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:28,529
once you define that then did the date
is a fine

794
00:49:28,529 --> 00:49:31,660
it's like the date when you configure
that right then how you get the

795
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:32,559
information

796
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:37,339
newfound if if sncc not implement the
you can sneak in at work

797
00:49:37,339 --> 00:49:41,539
if they gateway snot secure you can use
a gateway monitor or

798
00:49:41,539 --> 00:49:46,319
at what they are there are different
ways and the things I think it's not

799
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:47,059
changing

800
00:49:47,059 --> 00:49:50,500
so and you can even if brute force it

801
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:54,650
I it is 14 the digits so it might take

802
00:49:54,650 --> 00:49:59,559
it wise to eat a body today so you know
you know that format you can really

803
00:49:59,559 --> 00:50:03,559
make it night you you can yes restricted
to

804
00:50:03,559 --> 00:50:07,809
make me it's a last 3 yes I know right
center it's really a something that

805
00:50:07,809 --> 00:50:12,539
we know how it's it's a fine the notice
does understand how does atticus

806
00:50:12,539 --> 00:50:13,420
perspective so

807
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:20,420
thanks a lot thank you

808
00:50:21,110 --> 00:50:23,940
so you mentioned also the to theater the

809
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:27,460
communication or the the date has
flowing from T-rex

810
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:30,500
out to T rex 20 SS and did you

811
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:34,400
so two questions did you mean: Tony to T
rex also from T rex

812
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:38,460
and the second question is how actually
to fitters their building

813
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:39,970
to rule within

814
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:44,609
this SAP server or do we need additional
tools for that won't you got free trade

815
00:50:44,609 --> 00:50:46,589
with their firewall road for example I

816
00:50:46,589 --> 00:50:50,820
its you don't need to explore only the I
one in between you need to export

817
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:55,070
that service to to end-users hair like
like that the same way you don't need to

818
00:50:55,070 --> 00:50:55,849
expose others

819
00:50:55,849 --> 00:51:00,210
its services to end-users I for the
first question it's really complicated

820
00:51:00,210 --> 00:51:00,990
because

821
00:51:00,990 --> 00:51:04,400
it depends if it's a RFC interface

822
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:08,140
well we know that this this this kind of
communication had the Gateway

823
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:11,760
in the me though so first direct
registers in the Gateway

824
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:15,130
and then you get that day the queries at
the

825
00:51:15,130 --> 00:51:19,240
that's a from any other system SAP
system to the Gateway

826
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:22,770
that he say a register T-rex so it's

827
00:51:22,770 --> 00:51:26,450
always froing ASAP sisters to T rex

828
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:31,040
am and with the AM ATB interface all
sites always

829
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:34,710
that am but yet you have their
registration so

830
00:51:34,710 --> 00:51:38,800
that's the only I would say the only you
have another one which is when you

831
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:42,099
index and document actually T-rex

832
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:46,010
he's got into documents from the SAP
system so they scan or fax

833
00:51:46,010 --> 00:51:49,339
an exchange of a key am so this its

834
00:51:49,339 --> 00:51:53,010
it's a secure in that way but yes I said
flow

835
00:51:53,010 --> 00:52:00,010
going from the t-rex to their to the
SABC ok

836
00:52:02,830 --> 00:52:06,870
hi and there so I fix for I think that

837
00:52:06,870 --> 00:52:11,190
the issue here is that most of the calls
are on out indicate its own

838
00:52:11,190 --> 00:52:14,280
there something you can tutor to 24
enforce

839
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:17,480
authentication coelho we have not seen
any

840
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:21,580
ok jump to configure authentication so
that's that's the way it works

841
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:24,580
right from anti-trust standpoint that's
the way it works

842
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:28,000
actually you should not be connecting to
the last say

843
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,480
interface is right from my you said a
perfect you you should not be able to

844
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:36,590
to even talk to that service that's both
services so it's both

845
00:52:36,590 --> 00:52:39,620
a.m. you need to rest three have thank
you

846
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:42,930
you there are things that you can do for
complacency would definitely work

847
00:52:42,930 --> 00:52:44,790
restricted a web interface

848
00:52:44,790 --> 00:52:49,000
at with the HEB part you can secure a
traffic

849
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:53,770
but the access to the AM to the airport
should be definitely feel to it because

850
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:59,600
it's not indication

851
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:06,290
and your question

852
00:53:06,290 --> 00:53:08,380
okay thank you so much thank you
