1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:04,779
okay so were come back true but a lot of
talking the

2
00:00:04,779 --> 00:00:08,690
the Tekken research track and where come
back

3
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:12,150
Mariann motif are preventing I am

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:15,980
about analyzing bring this binary if
they are exploitable

5
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:19,250
and vulnerable at it's a kind of farm

6
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:24,199
I think I am maas thing so I think that
a lot of data that

7
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:27,769
a for of seventh so

8
00:00:27,769 --> 00:00:34,769
belief think introduction

9
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:41,110
the stomach from work now yeah

10
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:45,719
yeah %uh other thank you okay call

11
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:48,840
I hello everyone and thanks for helping
our talk

12
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,989
however have to be held talking about
the most 32

13
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:56,980
when of binaries oppressive of a talker
just heard right now because we discuss

14
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:57,449
our

15
00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:01,300
are problems in the development of that
project

16
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:05,860
are dealing with they to thats %uh

17
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:09,320
we argue toys Inc to evaluate when those
functions

18
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:13,659
in %uh fighters when this binaries to
see if there were a whole new level for

19
00:01:13,659 --> 00:01:14,720
exportation or not

20
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,939
down %uh set up an interesting project

21
00:01:18,939 --> 00:01:24,360
for a this occasional beta finance oslo
without oca

22
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,380
also have 3 Freddy vs walk into a bar

23
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:30,430
and left again just confined a table

24
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:33,929
alright

25
00:01:33,929 --> 00:01:37,420
I thought of various thanks a lot on

26
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:40,439
third i'm talking about the most are the
ones bunnies and if you look at the

27
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:40,929
picture

28
00:01:40,929 --> 00:01:44,329
the ball up there was not %uh is a there
for fun but I've

29
00:01:44,329 --> 00:01:47,579
the born from the Wall Street in New
York City

30
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:50,670
my name is marianne

31
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:54,979
on my cause because name is what they on
her lazy buser in his presentation

32
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:58,359
is a grievous wins prestigious I work
for a company

33
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:02,390
earning Seifert was basically brand
usually working on

34
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:05,439
defending ahh attacks

35
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,110
from networks defending a PFX to their

36
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:12,230
switched sides on the of Penticton
British

37
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:15,900
so I'm out there security research its
course Inc

38
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,030
and that's all for now a

39
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:23,829
alright so going to talking about

40
00:02:23,829 --> 00:02:27,549
when those box and exploit you might
have noticed

41
00:02:27,549 --> 00:02:31,400
Evans box are bus in tel recently have

42
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,730
become love attention me a good Logan
website from

43
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:38,430
and %uh a very reer loft by

44
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:41,849
media and also was a very good for us

45
00:02:41,849 --> 00:02:45,130
as researchers they get very good the
connotation because as people are very

46
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:45,720
interested

47
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,599
in the spot the research them off and
right blocks by them and read reports

48
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:50,970
and what happened

49
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:56,609
that a researcher from i think is from
United States Rhode a

50
00:02:56,609 --> 00:03:00,130
optical block a bother when Chuck on
their ability

51
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:04,549
my to put up honorably before now this
point

52
00:03:04,549 --> 00:03:07,660
I want to ask you I show up in here

53
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:11,169
last year at the choppers conference
C-one

54
00:03:11,169 --> 00:03:16,010
okay fun happen here as I might have you
seen our presentation last year

55
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:19,010
alright cuz we will refer to the

56
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:22,019
presentation couple finds I especially

57
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:25,049
I concerns when Chuck horribly so

58
00:03:25,049 --> 00:03:29,220
are the guy writing this blog thing Mike
my I agree

59
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:33,740
very much like Mike he sees probably
could but no matter how loud talker

60
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:36,440
bumper have it as your other blog which
we rather

61
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,570
began just because you're interested in
box so

62
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:42,700
going for his walk I F right a very
important

63
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,850
when you search for the love this %uh
this bike

64
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:49,170
you want but low but defined as Michael
kitten so

65
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:53,340
every time a shiner but when shop now
somewhere homes planned a kitten dies

66
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,900
reset okay looking at but we see to

67
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:00,400
a because they can reverse function in
an ESL

68
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,900
library are China hi Ana Calif um

69
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:08,350
was used to check out this one ability I
left without further

70
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:11,900
and find another picture showing this
asking job

71
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:15,390
where he mentions the function cryptic
or

72
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:19,739
object some your trip to could object I
remember function well

73
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:22,790
because are I do so it house

74
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:26,380
home to those for by like two or three
months so because connecticut option

75
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,180
something that way

76
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,960
recognized we've seen that before
cryptic object is a functional then we

77
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,690
talk about

78
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:38,440
last year so let me get back her
presentation from 2014 this one slide

79
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:42,930
or someplace like a stronger last year's
presentation and they fixed

80
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:46,790
the not on there so last year we talked
about

81
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:51,140
cryptic object as you can see there on
flight I am

82
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:54,550
a function been used in another function
named

83
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:58,120
dick alleged sequence you might also
want to

84
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:02,419
remember that function om this was
looking in the crypt

85
00:05:02,419 --> 00:05:06,130
Doha library and last year

86
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:10,560
we are comparing r2 operating systems
when someone's later comparing libras

87
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,950
to find missing I we call them safe ATI
Stream

88
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:17,120
were searching for are missing sainty
check

89
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,950
functions this case a list ring CZ age
link which

90
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:24,050
Texas input string it lengthens

91
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:27,370
string yes lot too short Orissa prepared
for you

92
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:31,360
%uh find fun stuff once was not good if
a man called because you don't hear

93
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:37,220
writer talking about this nursing okay
test a cryptic object wish we could use

94
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,639
are

95
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,960
for is now covered because it allows us
to pass a string

96
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,270
which could be too long and wouldn't say
there was a check for security

97
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:49,610
point of having a hot so I hear some
more flights weak

98
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:53,740
research this is Logan could get all um
which is used

99
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:57,250
summer plans on computer I on your in
the system

100
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:00,639
weary such a strong cities link we
recess to complete an object

101
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,870
I'll talk about the sanctions lot saw

102
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:07,470
we saw there is a problem with all
comped decode object

103
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:11,660
a could last like according to the the
condition makes up for the lost past

104
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:11,990
being

105
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:15,780
for their are an object to the cold
which is not checked properly

106
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:19,759
but looking at the crib the OJ

107
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,270
or we found the case we didn't find a
way to

108
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:26,639
exploit this so we kinda life are

109
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,789
drop the can find option to use a

110
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:32,990
now Mike or whoever wrote the

111
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:36,620
when Chuck proconsul but Ingles him much
on a

112
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:40,639
arm from the same function which doesn't
check

113
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,800
the the coop checked properly in another
location

114
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,340
and he are however other %uh proconsul

115
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:52,110
on the way to actually exploit up avoid

116
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:56,009
the following way so on another way to
access a through

117
00:06:56,009 --> 00:06:59,849
the as channel every they just said very
fine check

118
00:06:59,849 --> 00:07:02,960
clients verify message tonto get to
decode

119
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,280
thing in reverse in there is among copy

120
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,949
operation which for that

121
00:07:09,949 --> 00:07:13,340
missed check in because they could
object

122
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:17,550
which happens before going public %uh
has to be vulnerable to heap

123
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:21,590
of a commission for which

124
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:24,970
the exploit was actually able 2 X's

125
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:29,070
married to talking write access to
certain about Marie which

126
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:32,430
happen to be exploitable the swastika 30
nestle every

127
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:35,640
are Thomas R and

128
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:39,900
this is prolly the case why this was
such a famous

129
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:44,340
horribly the cup its proper mean some
market but

130
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,690
by now alright so there was a way to
call their body and

131
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:51,670
we thought we saw the used the laws we
have seen lost you know more like

132
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:55,010
I'll mike got or something really cool
we mister

133
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:58,230
we had like and part of such
vulnerabilities

134
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:02,150
only saw this and mister saw her
desperate as it

135
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:05,610
okay we have to do something about this
are

136
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:09,900
we had a lot of other candidates that
could eventually maybe low-risk

137
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:13,650
but we didn't find a way so re get
together again and

138
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:16,820
made a plan we have another idea so

139
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:21,830
there so I think the we we missed in
that case we have a personal flaw

140
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:25,070
within find a way to trigger it we have
to change something lol thank you

141
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:29,720
so we came up with this a plant
implemented new pool

142
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:34,680
which works a different basis or not the
kidney searching for missing say the PI

143
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,930
other trying to rate functions based on

144
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:41,000
attributes which could show us that this
other ticket function could be

145
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,520
vulnerable

146
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,520
and this

147
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,840
and Tyra idea that we've got yes

148
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:51,200
based um a hobby of muddy

149
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,840
yes mother in spare time is doing a

150
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:58,950
stock market does that tell you how we
came from stock market to

151
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:05,520
a vulnerability research okay so I
basically is she says I have a few of

152
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:05,930
these

153
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:09,480
one of them is dizzy with a market and
the second his day

154
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:14,600
it the stock market so but they figured
that that not so far from each other

155
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,120
and is that the thing that the between
this will feed Sunday said it how can I

156
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,180
use it dog is combined them and make
something good I don't

157
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:29,660
saw let's see so fast in the stock
market

158
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:32,740

159
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:37,500
got big leading on turned upside down
payment you but to stop

160
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:41,079
is some point you have to sell it you
may not see anything too high a price

161
00:09:41,079 --> 00:09:45,000
but senate before you lose everything
the same thing with a Zillow the market

162
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,639
let's say you find them on the ability
of under the old days

163
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:51,880
someone of value of X amount of money
you think it's not enough

164
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:55,779
you look for someone s again and again
but it will never be

165
00:09:55,779 --> 00:10:01,630
agreed to this percent bikes you man
who's dating again

166
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:05,440
you have to understand also known as the
a in the stock market

167
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,100
you can use or saw in 20 the market

168
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:12,579
if you want not selling time event
though

169
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:15,860
we've watched as he led a and you know
that in the same idea

170
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:19,860
again should always have a plan

171
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:23,850
you find a vulnerability what you wanna
do it how fast you gonna do it

172
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:27,870
the same with the stock market you wanna
buy a stock

173
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:31,310
when you when I said the stock a 1.2 put
a stop loss

174
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:35,180
you have to have a plan befall you
actually dead

175
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:38,230
and this is actually very important

176
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:41,500
actually one of them someone actually
ted

177
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:45,529
can actually fall in love with the stock
which mean that he by the stove because

178
00:10:45,529 --> 00:10:46,449
I love the company

179
00:10:46,449 --> 00:10:49,500
anyone ever said the stock it was well
done

180
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:53,860
because he just I think the company the
same thing with Zealand a letter to

181
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,579
develop a refund is Eli base

182
00:10:55,579 --> 00:10:59,990
is amazing the old days here about it so
much want to exploit everything was

183
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:00,550
great

184
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:05,040
but it to get a baby he actually care
about the court so much

185
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,040
that he cannot do nothing with it just
keep it in said

186
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,050
CF to remember this is not a Catholic
wedding

187
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:14,130
you find as you know that you're the
expert get a get out of it

188
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:16,220
said it

189
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:19,420
up are suing to stop

190
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:23,450
he does not go to bed by something you
know about us on a daily basis

191
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:26,840
you basically research what you know if
you're

192
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:30,600
expecting Windows you expect you is such
a Windows Linux

193
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,130
I O S annoyed invested time and what you
actually

194
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:39,460
what about the mucho they know about and
this is another one

195
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:44,780
basically stock markets if you are
always maintain can we think if you can

196
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,210
buy it or should buy

197
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:50,420
you can have a bite are so it does he
love his if you always think with a fine

198
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,640
with that not fine

199
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:55,900
you never even thought to find so you
see the same ideas upright

200
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:59,350
and this is exactly again

201
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:02,650
if you owe buy a stock

202
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:06,590
the idea said the stock if I miss the
old days

203
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:10,790
the idea to set as your day ended

204
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:13,860
everyone here that tied the stock market
know that there is a huge money

205
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:14,460
possession

206
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:18,730
which means that the big guys thank the
many per add the stock

207
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:21,960
to actually dissect what would be the
value of it

208
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:25,350
and how they do it because there's so
much money became basically

209
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:29,300
money for added value and the same thing
we did you know the market

210
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:33,390
the big guys should money government and
that is title but kantor

211
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:37,290
under the old days may have been a lot
of money and get information on it

212
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:41,510
and you can see it

213
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:45,810
find is still a day is as almost exactly
like actually having a stock

214
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:49,480
you have to evaluate you but the stock

215
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:52,660
neighborhood you know what will be the
venue you know and I don't want

216
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:56,530
another two months what is the market
the same thing with a few days

217
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:59,850
what is there viability which product

218
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:05,290
but it up loud appointees so this is
exactly what you should ask yourself

219
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:09,150
when painting and when actually doing
where's this at Irvine abilities

220
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:12,470
edit decade the stock

221
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:16,650
you can sell it same facilities ewbal
you find it

222
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:20,240
UK said it oh actually sometimes you can
actually

223
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,550
dead it with another developer and get
another 30 days

224
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:27,400
example a work that back into stocks you
buy the stock

225
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,350
begin with another guy you get another
one again

226
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:34,740
so how to value as the old days

227
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:39,130
someone basically in the stock market
it's called and I P O

228
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:43,210
before company go public they have this
game but I P aw

229
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:46,580
their of elite to is addressing these
apps make a bias

230
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:49,800
and then it's got to the market in

231
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:54,100
how do you value is your day is almost
the same basically you find as the old

232
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:54,440
days

233
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:58,200
now with the ban on the market how much
demand and all

234
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:02,140
willing to pay for it and how much you
willing to pay for it so the market he

235
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:02,730
said

236
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:06,730
divide you not the developer the more
popular nowadays

237
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:10,380
the more chance it would be hard to find
are dismayed thanks

238
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:14,020
the senate how high dividing will be
before it got to the market

239
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:17,380
inside

240
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:21,830
dating Sanu on a company and basically
it started

241
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:25,740
in into stocks so if you have inside
information

242
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:29,060
that didn't wanna bother does that a
company but somehow the company

243
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:32,250
when i buy another one on the ER is
pretty good

244
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:37,060
you actually have not aged other people
that have and this is easy for you to do

245
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:37,630
that I didn't

246
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:41,910
and actually get money out of it into
the lead the market

247
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:45,360
it's a you basically have access to the
source code

248
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,300
a specific company you walk in his
company in the justice of God

249
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:53,410
you can actually see the sauce audited

250
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:57,150
actually have advanced when other people

getting faster out

252
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:08,000
and get money out of it faster than
others by and said the same stock stock

253
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,090

260
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:34,760

268
00:15:58,239 --> 00:16:04,039
of course the higher price de día
weather-delayed

269
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:07,720
saw whenever stock there's few hours

270
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:12,499
Stock Exchange how they'll nuns on the
New York in Germany

271
00:16:12,499 --> 00:16:17,659

stocks you by Adele

272
00:16:17,659 --> 00:16:20,739
you said they'll well do you do this

273
00:16:20,739 --> 00:16:24,209
when you have a deal a day basically
have to option

274
00:16:24,209 --> 00:16:28,369
the white markets and the black market
the white market

275
00:16:28,369 --> 00:16:33,189

I defense people actually everyone to
buy their gonna bite

277
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:41,709
and basically make a special ed on are
there is the black market

278
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:44,859
which is much more money there and much
more

279
00:16:44,859 --> 00:16:50,319
upon a twenty to get into it how do you
know this

280
00:16:50,319 --> 00:16:54,279
so if you go to the white market you
don't need a boy or girl

281
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:57,499
everyone to lead most of the people have
died

283
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:05,069
said the stock for them all by just up
for them

284
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:09,059
misled the middleman between the client

285
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:12,179
and the stocks dissenting

286
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:16,350
with disabilities you'll find a zero-day
if you go to the white market

287
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:19,500
no need a mock-up sever but if

288
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,799
you but the black market you need
immediate endemic to meet him in

289
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:26,289
which actually take your Zealand a

290
00:17:26,289 --> 00:17:30,360
body weight and find a client willing to
pay the price

291
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:35,210
and cut Commission i'd of it them
exactly a private stock

292
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:38,559
apply also to build a the the Baucus

higher-priced

294
00:17:41,779 --> 00:17:45,850
possible

295
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:49,659
so what he said to go when you buy a
stock

296
00:17:49,659 --> 00:17:53,580
in office to find the company Microsoft
you can see up in facebook

297
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:57,279
I love that have basically steamboats
MSFT

298
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:01,519
AP and that's actually how you buy the
stock by the steamboat

299
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:05,130
you find the company so what is there to
block Sony

300
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:09,130
golfing on Windows functions

301
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:12,529
I love them have names these

302
00:18:12,529 --> 00:18:15,679
that course a month and you can stay

303
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,460
this actually an audit on the ability
API it was found in the past

304
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:23,149
somebody'd icid: a look when the name

305
00:18:23,149 --> 00:18:28,399
and then decide to go like the stock
market but Microsoft MSFT

306
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:32,440
ties had wish I will call this function
so I took no other

307
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:36,389
because he's like many populous a cue or

308
00:18:36,389 --> 00:18:40,429
so decide to take care what from the
name 3

309
00:18:40,429 --> 00:18:44,000
dick because internal quite a bit

310
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
so attack UK wat from this function

311
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,559
and that day that to see how many
function which is key what

312
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:55,009
I would if I didn't see them and then I
would be said that based on the key what

313
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:58,279
what the research something when you get
there

314
00:18:58,279 --> 00:19:03,259
company c'mon the first get the same
boat who you know you need to research

315
00:19:03,259 --> 00:19:06,299
the company and if it's OK you buy

316
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:09,340
same thing here I witnessed are the key
was

317
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:12,370
or the functional use keywords see which
one

318
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:17,070
indistinct something just by the for him
and basically research more the function

319
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:18,299
to see if it actually what

320
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:23,310
ok spoke about %ah not

321
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:26,510
heard no look very 12

322
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:31,640
by the stock market now call Aslam stand
more or less I got this idea

323
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:35,770
were Harvey gonna I'm be going I tried
to

324
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:39,710
alright functions like letter grade
stocks so

325
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:43,480
we came up where the system to find
vulnerabilities by

326
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:47,130
brain functions I think it's appropriate
time to has named evaluating below a

327
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:49,180
billion because %um cheap data and Ikes

328
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:52,320
so arm very probable

329
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,700
the toll called Wall Street ahh much
either another

330
00:19:55,700 --> 00:20:01,090
explain to you how it's works so I
mentioned we were working together

331
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:06,570
big data I'll we're not relying solely
on

332
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:10,230
different functions but tried to find
said indicators

333
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:13,440
Tim Crabbe a a binary which

334
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,600
does not necessarily big data like
Google

335
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,610
world called book for us it was pretty
big because

336
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:23,120
reuse those Kaleido base to her back the
tall

337
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,150
on your ending a bus collided more later

338
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:30,450
let me tell yes clyde is not %uh
suitable for anything that takes more

339
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:30,800
than

340
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:35,650
are five different samples of they don't
so the big data was over the phone

341
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:39,150
is shown together but stop with the
whole Big Data public

342
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:42,680
lead-up to the conclusion that like Big
Data is

343
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:46,420
not really the the thing when it here
but a

344
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:49,850
the appropriate ways of abusing the data
that we were

345
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:53,450
collecting let me tell you know what our
approach for the data

346
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:56,930
except for cycle a bill the text for a
cheap people

347
00:20:56,930 --> 00:21:01,320
because for once we didn't have big they
are a half a second

348
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:05,570
of of of a 1.5 with them have a suitable
database for reading the data

349
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:08,920
now with enough the right data and I'll
within half

350
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:13,000
the right measure how they to are the
right a concert was in that they had to

351
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:13,310
do

352
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:16,450
they don't mining or are large-scale
they are

353
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:20,120
analytics on are they to so we

354
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:25,720
a came up with simpler ideas a very
simple approach

355
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,720
that %uh explain to you is based on

356
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,850
five different steps to first uva is
finding a problem

357
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:35,280
with the problem you want to separate
vulnerable functions from

358
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,960
mumble novel functions the second step

359
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,410
after defying the problem was defined
attributes which would show us

360
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:45,590
discoverable functions I within our huge
set

361
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:49,809
it is a huge set so far as clay database
and what speed it up

362
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:53,690
and Armenia to find these attributes
which will help us

363
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:58,020
a find hunters we get as many attributes
as we could very fine

364
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:01,360
alright reviews with gathered to be a
civilian them

365
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,500
and then are cut down on that use a
really interesting for us

366
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,980
and then fine grain RR

367
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:11,360
results was not just producing
attributes but

368
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:15,400
shaping the beta on track gathering are

369
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,410
there from other sources and

370
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:22,610
trying to a really final problem to
something that we could XD

371
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:26,200
I know they'd up then as data analytics
if

372
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:31,510
by major we a place of magic now

373
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:34,690
well I'm gonna explain of magic that way

374
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:40,720
use for our data analytics with a simple
example oh my

375
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,799
let me show you %uh French

376
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:47,250
a column Frank the ship in the middle
the black sheep

377
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:50,440
is named Frank and we're not trying to
%uh

378
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:54,110
separate Frank from the rest of the ship
based on

379
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:59,110
data analytics okay so we have sent a
treasured before trying find black sheep

380
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:02,980
his thanks Frank on and tried to
separate him from the

381
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:06,559
white sheep so we stuck together at
reveals which entered with could use a

382
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:07,960
separate like black and white

383
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:11,049
haha bunch of them because

384
00:23:11,049 --> 00:23:14,970
compare the hailing of the sheep we
could compare sound over the fence sheep

385
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:17,980
we could compared colors me find out

386
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:21,570
someone work the heroic this for two
years because probably have all

387
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:26,240
the compelling we have like it very huge
a the us-based reduced

388
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,010
to the color those are the fine-grain we
find out when I have two callers

389
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:33,910
we don't need the end herself colors the
entire cost base to happen on it too

390
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:35,010
because I

391
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:38,710
like to watch it noriko up with the
magic which in this case will be a

392
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:39,520
simple query

393
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,920
if we consider they don't miss a price
of

394
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:47,930
with this message because separate Frank
from the other sheet okay

395
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:50,980
so much a bother much heavier than their

396
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:53,980
let's start with me approach

397
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:57,230
for beginning %uh

398
00:23:57,230 --> 00:24:01,200
working on the toll his third such a Reg
abuse which I they're called binary

399
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,480
education Inc i hella funny saying that
flight because

400
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,660
wrong

401
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:08,900
home so you might %uh maybe

402
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:12,130
know that just read the labels working
on a tradition

403
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:15,580
a lot usually Melbourne list and spend

404
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:19,120
sometime in addition lot more time
fighting the trolls

405
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,860
were after much addition so I like at
using

406
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:25,960
um I decided to dedicate the flights to
produce

407
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:30,850
and now Wade for people after come up
with complains again anyway

408
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:34,330
the very interesting research better his

409
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:37,760
so we're session for the Prince basis
which will be once

410
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,040
the function local space and be the
think the thing

411
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:44,290
%uh space what we found

412
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:47,660
the attributes this on the flight I
these are

413
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:51,710
already the sorry the ER yourself it
reveals how to find useful

414
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:55,890
which ones will be a suspicious mess
exploitable and a function same checks

415
00:24:55,890 --> 00:25:00,470
EC Vijay hits the headline kinda
function municipal functions

416
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:04,120
safety case missing noise all talk about
these shopping

417
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:07,700
interesting to notice is the hutch local

418
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:11,650
attributes actually contain information
that help us

419
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:15,090
I by the function without comparing it
to other functions

420
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:18,220
and yet to business began dating site
are

421
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:21,430
unused in comparison with other
functions

422
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:25,020
so would again like try to compare
different versions of functional between

423
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:25,790
a brain systems

424
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:32,050
to making use of these attributes
alright

425
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:36,280
so we can begin you might have noticed
last year

426
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:39,610
be published at all tool was written

427
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:42,980
very well in my opinion officially was
not

428
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:48,470
it was a python script are oh so the
fight this group this year

429
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:53,370
as again so the pipes goods I'll a

430
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:58,380
be use all our coding skills on this and
capital recently like last year

431
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:02,320
it's not the fastest to all s %uh

432
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:06,740
we could imagine so we start working all
the libraries

433
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:10,100
that we had left from last year what
role decompile

434
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:13,240
song first that we held the compound
libraries and

435
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:16,880
at some time so altogether we had all
the libraries and drivers which

436
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:22,310
gether following someone's aid and when
the 10 and the first up at the compile

437
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:22,680
them

438
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,910
to catalyse fast supportive at halftime

439
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:29,500
we had like dollar see coat so sick what

440
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:34,060
of these binaries to park them to the
database

441
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:38,300
became over simple there is the same to
get these files Rupert Sanders in our

442
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,180
escalate their with

443
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:43,990
and spend a lot of time on parsing party
I'll probably still the party tomorrow

444
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:47,220
marketing presence actually finished I
was just a working on the

445
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:51,090
automated the thing anyway we spend

446
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:55,280
a lot of time on the part in this year
again and the commission for a slut is

447
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,060
not useful

448
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:59,070
for see big data okay

449
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:02,530
anyway it was bloody yet her fight some
when Dustin

450
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:06,810
as leisure died on the way on you might
have noticed the king and Peter

451
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:11,310
version of Windows 10 as just another
busy time for the official Shin

452
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:14,940
I'm tired just anyway we got some
results

453
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:18,240
so we managed to grab all these missions
editors from

454
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,470
the binaries double no explain

455
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:25,250
what these attributes are useful for so
we find educated suspicion

456
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:28,410
special like the following keywords:

457
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:32,380
as more than just before and the
question is: so if you find any of these

458
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:33,060
keywords:

459
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:36,590
in the No function you can show you that
something interesting is happening the

460
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:39,220
function if you have like a low other
decode

461
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:43,320
for a copy all right probably some
interaction

462
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:46,300
or in some but some functions some
interaction with

463
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:50,270
memory of the computer they can read
this function as more interesting

464
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:53,900
than the others in your evaluation
process

465
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:57,120
said you find his something seems fishy

466
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,980
the second israel's exploitable on the
other side

467
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:05,480
arm there you're searching for split a
function within that function

468
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:09,620
25 the following keywords which
indicates that there's

469
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:12,900
some potentially exploitable functional
with Ian

470
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:16,720
that function so I was looking at

471
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,910
the the skiers from two sites once on
functioning no

472
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:25,250
and once on function call level research
for

473
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:28,520
society checks say checks in a sense of

474
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:33,180
are if you're a smaller no this is not
based on my

475
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:37,170
like of coding skills them searching for
such simple wrecked but

476
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:40,190
I want to keep it simple stupid the
point is

477
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:44,900
to trying up let me tell you we're still
fighting low false-positive

478
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:49,010
especially inside checks but if you
happen to search for

479
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:52,590
more complicated are more complex a
Rake's you hope

480
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:56,440
I have a lot of are call false positives
and with us

481
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:01,380
rates navajos make-ups we find all that
the false negatives for less of an issue

482
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:04,900
thank the false positives so we kept it
with us

483
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:08,720
simple regular expression for setting
for

484
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,830
said you guys again you shouldn't drop
what's

485
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:16,220
once proven useful and here is actually
follows

486
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:19,690
of safety classes are searching for with
save it does

487
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:24,370
this is probably not the best inge term
would be something like this said he

488
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:25,190
checking

489
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:28,380
API call something which

490
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:32,180
as ball the such face them to leverage
swish

491
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:35,930
when those provides for whens developers
which care about

492
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:40,650
they type conversions or string
operations to see if the values

493
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:45,210
which I use for polling a actions

494
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:48,540
often say the PI are actually protects
it have a man copy

495
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:52,850
you might wanna see before if the string
which you're copping slot too short

496
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:57,039
do use such gonna say they played before
that

497
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:59,330
these are interesting for us a

498
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:03,010
fantasize a their present and your side
after

499
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:06,530
not present so I was researching for
them to function local basis to see

500
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:07,190
their their

501
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:11,190
and then researching them are dipping
basis to see if there were present

502
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:14,350
in one of the phrases in to check and
are missing

503
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:17,890
in a and all their own your operating
system

504
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:21,270
to see if we could find a professional

505
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:24,570
patch I tried to

506
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:28,730
described or tried to sum up the
presentation of last year and industry

507
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:29,600
last under

508
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:33,940
own office or cell also if a function 11
when this thing has to save a PI

509
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:38,230
where the same function the same library
in another version has no say the PI

510
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:41,730
this indicates that something was at
their for me is a

511
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:45,200
david Kerr was at a and potentially in
the case that the older version for the

512
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:45,860
wonderful

513
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:49,590
pressuring Iran just the sites like this

514
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:52,950
works interesting a all the other way
around you can see if something was

515
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:54,860
missing and 170 in the state

516
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:58,360
om was aryan

517
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:02,100
joe says i cant to see if something's
missing when the 10 those later on

518
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:05,370
patched in Windows 8 but the patch loved
rolled out for winston

519
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:08,440
and same thing works for when the side
when the Sun

520
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:12,179
for sometimes the older version of
leverage touch not no one

521
00:31:12,179 --> 00:31:15,840
interest me which is also very useful to
know

522
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:20,440
inheriting fashions alright last against
you know someone come

523
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:23,450
a newness is probably also not good
English OVA

524
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:26,990
my brother some things like make
mistakes in English and I

525
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:31,360
very much stick to them so wickedness
unisex a pretty simple

526
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,750
me billiad if a functional sa at that

527
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:38,450
or was removed some functions present an
operating system hmm

528
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:42,640
they can leverage its valued with zero
and it is missing somewhere

529
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,600
which means it has been added or it has
been removed for some reason

530
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,700
and thriller with one here especially
interested

531
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:53,750
in the functions that were removed
because if something was removed it was

532
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:55,419
probably integrated somewhere else

533
00:31:55,419 --> 00:31:56,519
for a reason

534
00:31:56,519 --> 00:31:59,859
and because it was too much code there
because it was a slow or maybe didn't

535
00:31:59,859 --> 00:32:00,450
work right

536
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:04,029
alright so searching for the missing for
and

537
00:32:04,029 --> 00:32:08,259
like on the same thing this is all based
on comparing different versions of

538
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:08,820
functions

539
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:11,839
and there we take a some coat was at the
or

540
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:15,489
removed were figured out it's very
interesting only

541
00:32:15,489 --> 00:32:19,809
look at this when their small changes
now there's big part of colour

542
00:32:19,809 --> 00:32:23,429
our talk about this later alright these
are the attributes

543
00:32:23,429 --> 00:32:27,779
now toll itself love been talking about
all time now

544
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:31,200
requires either pro to work at the
actress the compiler

545
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,769
otherwise you won't get all the
beautiful sick old and across our pipe

546
00:32:35,769 --> 00:32:36,320
magic

547
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:40,549
which you finally get up it we present
and now it doesn't require in the sky

548
00:32:40,549 --> 00:32:42,489
brother I wouldn't recommend

549
00:32:42,489 --> 00:32:45,639
a using that all very much because
questions all-time

550
00:32:45,639 --> 00:32:49,239
but you can use left my brother to West
database

551
00:32:49,239 --> 00:32:52,450
%uh was being held i cant

552
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:55,929
Rev Maina for generating beautiful
officials have a show you later

553
00:32:55,929 --> 00:33:00,499
um we don't accept any liability for the
code works enough because we're not

554
00:33:00,499 --> 00:33:01,339
quite sure

555
00:33:01,339 --> 00:33:06,229
what else crash another slut brother
nanking actually doesn't crash

556
00:33:06,229 --> 00:33:09,469
pumping systems and if you want a choice
available

557
00:33:09,469 --> 00:33:12,820
on my get approval on the WTF

558
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:17,070
p L that's now I D %ah what the fuck
public

559
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:21,769
life this out especially for people last
year which I like

560
00:33:21,769 --> 00:33:25,499
are rating

561
00:33:25,499 --> 00:33:28,559
about Minot putting a license

562
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:31,899
on the Polish Republic so literally

563
00:33:31,899 --> 00:33:36,049
put the least restrictive license on the
car because I really don't care for

564
00:33:36,049 --> 00:33:36,529
people

565
00:33:36,529 --> 00:33:39,700
do with the top alright

566
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:42,820
gathered there now about findings

567
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:46,690
wouldn't fight okay so it how many
people you know this picture

568
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:50,149
I wanted for okay

569
00:33:50,149 --> 00:33:53,579
unspoiled something about playing so can
you at the other

570
00:33:53,579 --> 00:33:56,940
haven't seen it can you see anything on
the picture which you wouldn't expect

571
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:57,509
their

572
00:33:57,509 --> 00:34:03,980
much to say that the colors him i'm not
the best

573
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:06,800
interesting they can anyone see anything
in there

574
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:12,600
cockade yeah I'm voting for the coffee
bean

575
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:17,120
area let me lemme thinking this list
there's a man hidden in there

576
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:21,810
like based on the colors as you can see
very well here see now

577
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:24,960
as frank to

578
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:29,170
though there have there's a guy hidden
in there at like the Windows binaries

579
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:33,440
rides or all findings from some update
us or

580
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,710
arm altogether we parsed

581
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:41,290
all burr by a reason to their ways we
didn't default them but concentrated on

582
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:42,210
the drivers now

583
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:45,330
because some drivers we only have about
like

584
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:51,360
500 binaries a horse just a few exist in
operating systems

585
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:55,000
might make the difference the thing a
bit complicated

586
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,330
altogether we parsed eighteen million

587
00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:02,010
of the compiled co-op at lines at the
bar called

588
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:05,810
which is I'm quite a lot of other
collided with the bit too much

589
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:09,690
we found the bug man a 10 missing say
obvious where

590
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:15,550
about like 468 a local than one single
function that might be a very

591
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:17,690
interesting thanks much if not I i love
the

592
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:20,950
about the very interesting content other
Microsoft guy

593
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:24,780
had their for other the authors

594
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:28,250
play are also I am when the seven
there's a functional

595
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:31,620
the specific function using these
foreign 68

596
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:35,480
I cost 2s print F which i think is not

597
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:39,170
%uh quite the godiva southern designed
to put them in one question

598
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:42,360
but as much light on the sauce have a
calling

599
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:46,410
alright arm for libraries

600
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:49,550
altogether we the compiled wanted and

601
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:55,070
two million lines of coke polygon
database I was quite intense

602
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:59,540
but were finished now 102 extract a
potential vulnerabilities

603
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:03,390
all the struggles we found based on the
variation with it

604
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:06,520
are listed here in flight I wanted them
now but if you're already

605
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:10,290
nervous and don't want to be compiled
pars everything you could have a quick

606
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:11,210
look on these levers

607
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:15,290
and see if you find the stuff the wake
up good luck

608
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:19,870
a process in this house says we had a
big day that we couldn't get around

609
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:20,530
officials

610
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:23,870
and that he might remember from last
year I like colorful of so

611
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:27,180
had a dozen version of I'm going to
China

612
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:31,040
%ah financially so here you see a

613
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:36,220
of HX compared to exploit of home in the
seventh here's a version of Windows 8

614
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:41,220
has to russian Prime Minister
interesting was that the visuals

615
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:44,250
we didn't really get to any useful
conclusions

616
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:48,910
we compare these pictures highly

617
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:52,450
scientific and %uh figure out

618
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:56,080
the there's some animali in when the Sun

619
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:59,670
so if you look closely at these pictures
me a gray circles

620
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:03,480
indicated the same place because the
film didn't read

621
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:07,010
ungodly work on Robert miner but

622
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:10,370
you can put the spotlight on is rich in
up there

623
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:14,140
well put the question mark there's a lot
more functions 17

624
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:17,240
which are growing on this direction
which means there's more exploitable

625
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,510
from saint checks in there

626
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:23,230
then in wins then brings 10 much for me
personally was

627
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:27,470
interesting finding alright but back to
serious

628
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:32,050
I here's are we here's another

629
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:35,200
visualisation we pull other I compared
be

630
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:40,000
City OK for missing the same text and we
will be especially interested

631
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,210
in the safe API some missing and
functions where there's no sign the

632
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:43,980
strikes law

633
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:47,370
but just much more simple described with
roth

634
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:52,500
so try to derive rules from the findings
that we have a looking at are they to

635
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:55,450
in a senior at Midway

636
00:37:55,450 --> 00:38:00,080
so much a ultimate at all and came to
the following set forth

637
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:03,830
much luck who said well I don't want
read them of you know

638
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:07,110
but well we found out while looking at
the data what's up

639
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:10,350
its usually the little changes for the
Rangers thing

640
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:13,970
to watch in are cold so

641
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:17,500
for example if you're going to function
which F

642
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:22,040
one-sided check a freelance cold this is
much more interesting than the function

643
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,760
which all of a sudden has 20 lines

644
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,930
up call it's 81 it was calm or and 50
say it I said it

645
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:31,520
so are this with exploitable

646
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,650
if you have an exploitable and those
ones I check thats

647
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:38,730
interesting because usually takes to
play checks to see something's not too

648
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:39,870
big not too small

649
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:43,060
arm if you have

650
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:46,530
a safe API which is missing it is
interesting

651
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:49,770
if there's any other function cause
being added

652
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:52,910
in the policy you wouldn't want to look
at the function call con

653
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:56,330
of a specific never us was a question

654
00:38:56,330 --> 00:39:00,300
and sauce for so is the little changes
to have to concentrate on

655
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:03,780
and the following examples will show you
some

656
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:07,190
up the no change anyway we have another
problem

657
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:10,520
as you might remember the I come from
the beginning

658
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:13,730
we had like a potential vulnerabilities
are we knew there something

659
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:18,430
something lousy something fishy I'll
with didn't quite know though how to how

660
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:19,380
to access this

661
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:23,300
a vulnerability and save up searching
widened evaluates

662
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:26,570
that finding important enough to keep
searching for a way

663
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:30,760
to X are vulnerable function so you're
trying to find a way

664
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:35,220
to evaluate the excess boy if the
function by painting

665
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:38,590
car chase this is a beautiful

666
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:42,960
almost graphical orkut of the toll road
Chester

667
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,840
official as a function call today so we
feel our talk

668
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:50,200
a function a function ideas you can see
a pair

669
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:54,320
other little by little way can indicate
the functional you want to look at

670
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:58,060
and hola paint the tree to final ODI

671
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:01,710
exported functions from library which
are actually used

672
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:04,080
too cold out to the a to

673
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:08,440
this interesting question this years

674
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:12,230
a tree which is actually not through a
useful because it's just random

675
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:16,100
but you can see like are

676
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:19,960
on these leave no was eventually you
will find functions Witcher

677
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:23,530
fashion exported like this one process
control which is something

678
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:27,840
interesting many on they can go research
this function

679
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:32,240
it has called the mother function on
Samoa every and see if you can excesses

680
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:36,370
this function somehow for now if only
implemented

681
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:40,580
a levrie local tree generations from
don't look at interlibrary

682
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:45,080
calls which are potentially interesting
Highlanders for

683
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:49,710
the database you have snow some eschew
like a I'm the house must lead yes let's

684
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:50,040
kill

685
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:54,140
to query this function calls which could
appear in a light breeze

686
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:57,470
so the final every which is used to
actually

687
00:40:57,470 --> 00:41:01,250
excess your are function which is
interesting

688
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:04,260
to eventually get through the windows
software which

689
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:07,510
woods which could be used to exploit the
pop

690
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:11,400
alright picking cherries

691
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:14,890
now finally here findings on

692
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:18,430
how last we have an example here

693
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:22,900
and EMS EMS the OL way fun polling data

694
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:26,260
we saw there was a small change and

695
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:29,290
the lines the Compal cold as the only
see

696
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:33,550
we see there's an exploitable function
in their official explanation there

697
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:37,690
we see there was once a day P I'm
missing we see there's one thing to

698
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:38,070
check

699
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:41,170
at and his origins so there's definitely
something wrong there

700
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:44,240
and we can see that the function itself

701
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:49,280
healthy indicator me get and smell

702
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:53,390
there something arianna open the coach
and throughout this is

703
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:56,590
a very short call tree because this is
already

704
00:41:56,590 --> 00:42:02,570
the exported function I think yep

705
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:04,990
so hi we go to see

706
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:08,210
a love our coast and fauna

707
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:12,010
there's men copy in there the city
exploitable but we saw in the beta

708
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:15,530
there's me size well you which is used
for

709
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:19,720
the memory allocation he says well you
is once checked appear

710
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:23,160
if it's not bigger than the certain
values stored

711
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:27,280
in our demand for and is not

712
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,430
to initialize a pair in this through me
long

713
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:34,000
a line but as you can see there

714
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,840
it is apparently never checked it was
actually not too small

715
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:42,840
we look at this for a long time we're
not quite sure if this is a potential

716
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:46,990
underflow maybe if you find time to
spare time

717
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:51,450
look at it and if you find something
right allies blah to bother let us know

718
00:42:51,450 --> 00:42:55,880
if this was actually RFR right picking
our show is

719
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:59,740
there was %uh one more thing we found

720
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:03,310
that the sage Excel others I mention the
small changes so

721
00:43:03,310 --> 00:43:06,740
there's like exactly one thing the chase
which was

722
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:11,430
of suspicious just because the function
well then copy and because it's located

723
00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:12,380
in the user three

724
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:15,570
today all so interesting larry looking
at

725
00:43:15,570 --> 00:43:19,990
the cost me we find the very long
coaching which indicates the

726
00:43:19,990 --> 00:43:23,859
there's potentially a lot of different
way sexually excess this function

727
00:43:23,859 --> 00:43:29,400
which is good in the case joint
exploited has 0 it up close look

728
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:33,590
at the Cohen fell fun in the headline

729
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:36,680
interest exactly this so here

730
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:41,150
was a check added not actually Atlanta
called only the check

731
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:45,100
refined so on guild version the value 9

732
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:49,230
which is later on youth %um be ok %um
handle

733
00:43:49,230 --> 00:43:52,280
function is checked if it's bigger than
0

734
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:56,330
and then the new version I was more fun
checked arm

735
00:43:56,330 --> 00:44:00,260
which could indicator there something
wrong but what we found on later

736
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:03,740
is the winds eighty also and another
function

737
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:07,740
which I

738
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:10,460
could thank a

739
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:14,609
which thirsty security check in this
case so because I look at this one but I

740
00:44:14,609 --> 00:44:16,420
promise you you won't be able to

741
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:19,580
exploited made a alright

742
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:23,140
so this will take some pasta a history
member that guy

743
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:27,710
and the critical object at all he would
get back there so

744
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:31,800
we have a full going and try to evaluate
the cryptic about to begin

745
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:35,369
to see if election working and

746
00:44:35,369 --> 00:44:40,369
found out that weekend

747
00:44:40,369 --> 00:44:43,800
find the a other

748
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:47,040
a cost for this function: within yes
channel every

749
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:50,590
and follow-up in there we find exactly
the same function

750
00:44:50,590 --> 00:44:53,910
that my can you remember Mike when the
knobs block

751
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:58,550
but because second reverse saying this
in their we analyze the Khalsa can rest

752
00:44:58,550 --> 00:44:59,140
at the toll

753
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:04,050
the fun that we see changes and lines of
code apparent change in with HX

754
00:45:04,050 --> 00:45:07,440
member small tax for it to say a check
that

755
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:10,580
sophie loves could be interesting and

756
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:14,280
print the Kochi Atlanta here for the
cops and robbers who gets

757
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:18,050
check claimed brief a message don't love
by 2:30 verify

758
00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:22,140
and going back to Mikes block we see
that this is the second one

759
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:27,050
found he went to that the tests are
verify saw

760
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:30,520
there %uh he can actually excess the

761
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:34,270
deco second reverse function matched

762
00:45:34,270 --> 00:45:38,810
to use a certificates with

763
00:45:38,810 --> 00:45:42,619
almost that the the second show which

764
00:45:42,619 --> 00:45:46,830
should have been Didcot thats by the
decade second diverse functional

765
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:50,540
to actually chega the he PLO

766
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:54,900
Mayer Bologna for this is his pro
concert again thanks love Mike

767
00:45:54,900 --> 00:46:00,619
for percent in this beautiful on our
ability

768
00:46:00,619 --> 00:46:02,849
lol I for the motivation

769
00:46:02,849 --> 00:46:07,009
to get the project because doing this we
go back to our hunch

770
00:46:07,009 --> 00:46:11,019
interest decal that would be a six-month
figured out this also looks

771
00:46:11,019 --> 00:46:14,789
rather interesting how they'd always am
go back to

772
00:46:14,789 --> 00:46:18,979
tried to find a way to explain it still
which is now

773
00:46:18,979 --> 00:46:23,519
that the more that mothers gonna show
you to percent hallway

774
00:46:23,519 --> 00:46:27,539
are worked okay so

775
00:46:27,539 --> 00:46:30,969
one of the result from the door was this
function am

776
00:46:30,969 --> 00:46:34,949
as you can see on this claim decor at a
bar sequence

777
00:46:34,949 --> 00:46:39,539
for someone so festival on Oct is
received the name

778
00:46:39,539 --> 00:46:44,239
and thought that interesting the Deacon
was there but the four name is the cause

779
00:46:44,239 --> 00:46:45,279
at the boot sequence

780
00:46:45,279 --> 00:46:49,119
also some very interesting the next
thing I was looking about to see

781
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:52,880
actually if it exploited men not exploit
them in

782
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:56,229
and let them time to show now is the way

783
00:46:56,229 --> 00:46:59,849
the Fiat if something is expired event
and how

784
00:46:59,849 --> 00:47:03,779
so I would I have to decide the entire
process much as possible

785
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:07,839
in a Vega DDS so it would be any dent

786
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:11,069
taken kind so when I saw this function

787
00:47:11,069 --> 00:47:15,390
their first thing they were sentido can
I to get here call option

788
00:47:15,390 --> 00:47:18,400
biased that about how of law this
condition

789
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:22,119
I need to bring us something so I was
looking on this function

790
00:47:22,119 --> 00:47:28,420
perceived as anything interesting why
not differ airlines I saw

791
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:32,779
was ma'am copy which actually a very
basics

792
00:47:32,779 --> 00:47:36,779
C function for every developer is no
evasive min

793
00:47:36,779 --> 00:47:39,930
thing it's Kobe for May

794
00:47:39,930 --> 00:47:43,279
sauce to destination best on a site

795
00:47:43,279 --> 00:47:48,479
so if I can take a people have lost that
overflow whatever

796
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:51,539
I need to contort Desai's so I have to
check

797
00:47:51,539 --> 00:47:56,359
if there is any sent to check undersized
that he's getting supply

798
00:47:56,359 --> 00:47:59,489
two men copy so

799
00:47:59,489 --> 00:48:03,349
them in public victory Obama does as you
can see by the bush

800
00:48:03,349 --> 00:48:07,099
yes I is basically the sauce

801
00:48:07,099 --> 00:48:10,430
sauce boozed up a lot in the eye

802
00:48:10,430 --> 00:48:11,250
is the day is

803
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:14,780
this is the sauce and I don't want yes I
did destination

804
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:19,330
and basically this one EX is how long a

805
00:48:19,330 --> 00:48:22,640
how many bytes to copy for this
definition

806
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:26,840
and we can see easily bad this site is

807
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:30,060
is best on the function above this one

808
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:34,230
which is s talent this one

809
00:48:34,230 --> 00:48:37,910
and what does s talent Dec

810
00:48:37,910 --> 00:48:41,270
it taking s think and getting how long

811
00:48:41,270 --> 00:48:44,580
best thing is so basically they don't
value

812
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:47,660
gonna be EX and its gonna actually get

813
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:50,750
likely push in men copy but

814
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:54,100
there is no sent the check how long a

815
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:57,630
can this thing be so maybe this thing
can be very long

816
00:48:57,630 --> 00:49:00,800
we can all the flaw the destination
buffer

817
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:05,730
so the next step is to figure out what
is this thing

818
00:49:05,730 --> 00:49:10,050
all about and webcam for so though so
I'll

819
00:49:10,050 --> 00:49:13,810
you have to post call it a live oak and
you see it actually come

820
00:49:13,810 --> 00:49:17,260
form a function called caped

821
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:20,540
be caught object so the fasting

822
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:25,340
make sense to go is to figure out what
in this keep

823
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:28,980
object they got no so the only way to
figure out

824
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:33,100
is basically check and then so that's
what is a possible

825
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:40,100
than a function

826
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:47,360
committee what's going on right

827
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:51,470
okay so this is the Palm a bill of this
function

828
00:49:51,470 --> 00:49:56,070
what is interesting is basically to see
when

829
00:49:56,070 --> 00:49:59,680
this think is what is the what were the
same come

830
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:03,080
on this function so we go up go back we
see that

831
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:06,540
EDI EDI hardest thing

832
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:09,880
to st. arlen well yeah I come form

833
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:13,800
if you go up in this one PV stock

834
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:17,010
in for of this Palmetto to create

835
00:50:17,010 --> 00:50:20,540
the good function so I have to figure
out what is this

836
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:24,040
comic 2010 save up to them is it

837
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:27,560
and NSA be the stock in for

838
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:31,710
so I have to it what's going on so

839
00:50:31,710 --> 00:50:34,940
it's messy a point out though inkatha

840
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:38,060
stock talk to be decoded so this is the
return value

841
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:42,570
how they say it then value look like so
fast ahora

842
00:50:42,570 --> 00:50:45,700
its best on the first Palmetto

843
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:49,060
option this one

844
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:52,859
all this one so by knocking

845
00:50:52,859 --> 00:50:56,630
enhanced the first bomb idea is one

846
00:50:56,630 --> 00:51:02,780
and one is actually this one

847
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:09,780
so this is the one that accused the
president function so I pushed the issue

848
00:51:10,529 --> 00:51:13,609
that's how it's applied now

849
00:51:13,609 --> 00:51:17,859
22 what is twenty door see

850
00:51:17,859 --> 00:51:21,449
against Stony is

851
00:51:21,449 --> 00:51:26,730
with

852
00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:33,440
K

853
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:38,539
22 and end up in court that NDS so I'm
dying to expand its Tony on papa was

854
00:51:38,539 --> 00:51:41,970
how exactly are we gonna get it so than
10 if i do.

855
00:51:41,970 --> 00:51:45,869
is the best on the 22 and what is this
20 thought is based on a structural

856
00:51:45,869 --> 00:51:48,880
and thank you find a factual here easily

857
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:52,819
steam taking see

858
00:51:52,819 --> 00:51:57,589
this factual type basically a point out
though I did they find the stock to type

859
00:51:57,589 --> 00:52:04,589
this is all the consent form this okay

860
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:09,000
so now you see the list this is really
something I'm best

861
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,880
that actually can supply and affection
stoplight the number twenty 20

862
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:16,690
as you can see new 22 so I have to look

863
00:52:16,690 --> 00:52:23,029
what is 22 ND test

864
00:52:23,029 --> 00:52:26,400
okay so that twenty 20 is at EB ot

865
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:29,420
called the peaky CS achievement

866
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:32,880
and basically which means that day

867
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:36,430
a $10 value will be to stopped this Cape

868
00:52:36,430 --> 00:52:41,109
actually met so I click on this this is
the return value

869
00:52:41,109 --> 00:52:44,609
as you can see here is any

870
00:52:44,609 --> 00:52:48,140
what is this thing that has been a dead
end

871
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:51,440
in this stop shop this thing is

872
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:55,240
the first time the first Bella Bella
Vista which is

873
00:52:55,240 --> 00:53:00,220
PCs ed on Tuesday as you can see

874
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:04,349
so the return value is being hard in
this

875
00:53:04,349 --> 00:53:07,839
laptop anestachio have a bar Taylor

876
00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:11,140
to a stunning which is object ID now

877
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:15,549
the seems like there's no he meets how
long these ID can be

878
00:53:15,549 --> 00:53:18,980
so the idea is that we will eat n

879
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:24,089
this stock 20 but this function with a
very long day

880
00:53:24,089 --> 00:53:27,640
and he'd go to st. out and and all that
right

881
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:31,150
now the other questions you ask yourself
how do I

882
00:53:31,150 --> 00:53:34,190
actually bought of rain this function

883
00:53:34,190 --> 00:53:37,329
how do I get this ordered a day

884
00:53:37,329 --> 00:53:41,579
inside this so the first thing to know
is to figure out

885
00:53:41,579 --> 00:53:47,059
book on this function without you have
to tell you this

886
00:53:47,059 --> 00:53:50,210
have to come to this press in somehow
some

887
00:53:50,210 --> 00:53:53,210
in some complement the windows have to
come here

888
00:53:53,210 --> 00:53:56,880
who is this the first thing you know you
think the function

889
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:02,110
facing Penn

890
00:54:02,110 --> 00:54:05,860
and died 26 in anti like Billy

891
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:09,920
of Windows toys but Moyes gonna call

892
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:13,590
dysfunction why because if you go here

893
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:18,390
you see this is actually exported
function from these DNA

894
00:54:18,390 --> 00:54:22,100
so the first thing to do is to figure
out which application

895
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:26,100
Ohno the modern cordis exported function

896
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:29,180
and from Dell you can go up see

897
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:32,750
what is going on because DNN just there

898
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:38,500
but enough we need something Accord is
function to make it easier

899
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:42,040
as you can see it this actually the DNN

900
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:45,920
is came DNG and while I scanned the bail
systems

901
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:49,590
I don't find anymore don't well any
application

902
00:54:49,590 --> 00:54:53,940
but actually called this function so why
is this function

903
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:57,690
is there have to figure out how do I
think you're right I don't think it

904
00:54:57,690 --> 00:55:00,500
myself but I think the Caucasus less I
need someone to 38

905
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:04,880
which compliment in Windows clinger this
so what they did

906
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:08,810
I see okay it's not in the system32
non-college so what's going on

907
00:55:08,810 --> 00:55:14,420
so I decided to stash on is dead again
who call it

908
00:55:14,420 --> 00:55:18,880
so I figured out that when this

909
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:22,230
bien get tested I can see him

910
00:55:22,230 --> 00:55:25,520
it call where it is because

911
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:30,600
good because Etymotic once effect this
fax this name

912
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:33,880
and got another function which is
clipped

913
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:39,140
I just tell oh I D function so I have no
idea why this function actually no

914
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:42,390
when a second any to forget not heart
dysfunction

915
00:55:42,390 --> 00:55:48,920
going on so I think dysfunction

916
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:55,920
move in it

917
00:55:59,210 --> 00:56:06,210
its

918
00:56:10,170 --> 00:56:14,960
okay this is the condition on this
function it's actually very very simple

919
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:20,210
def accent yeah just a did because I P
meticulous function

920
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:24,269
and when someone want to pass

921
00:56:24,269 --> 00:56:28,230
something it with Tiger this function as
a call about

922
00:56:28,230 --> 00:56:32,670
and you can see him at that

923
00:56:32,670 --> 00:56:36,089
and how they and how does he know to go
dysfunction

924
00:56:36,089 --> 00:56:43,089
by another up object ID as you can see
him so basically

925
00:56:43,950 --> 00:56:48,140
there's another ID that someone with a
stoplight and they say the

926
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:53,210
we find a function what is this I D if
you go it's one of these permitting

927
00:56:53,210 --> 00:56:59,180
this one disease already you can see

928
00:56:59,180 --> 00:57:02,660
it's some sort of a number 2.5 that that
that

929
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:07,789
if something someone give this number to
add a function in the system

930
00:57:07,789 --> 00:57:11,170
eventually it would think about the
function so let's see

931
00:57:11,170 --> 00:57:17,009
what is this number as you can see him
the card

932
00:57:17,009 --> 00:57:20,049
at a boutique wines their number is

933
00:57:20,049 --> 00:57:23,430
team me pics

934
00:57:23,430 --> 00:57:28,140
this is the number one .3 but this is
like an object ID number

935
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:32,380
I D so the first thing I have to do now
taking this number

936
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:36,039
and thinking of going to Windows OS
systems actually

937
00:57:36,039 --> 00:57:39,740
use this number again because I cannot
find anything that you didn't

938
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:46,740
the official name so I just think his
number

939
00:57:47,089 --> 00:57:50,069
and you can see this search stopped
unified any DNN

940
00:57:50,069 --> 00:57:53,529
so my next thing is this this number

941
00:57:53,529 --> 00:57:58,019
this thing and I D which is mean that if
someone to play the same day

942
00:57:58,019 --> 00:58:02,189
eventually intraday go got a function
because the dentist date

943
00:58:02,189 --> 00:58:05,999
when the end was know that so the first
thing to go

944
00:58:05,999 --> 00:58:09,849
but he's not a someone must use this
number

945
00:58:09,849 --> 00:58:14,019
to be able to bring it why did slugging

946
00:58:14,019 --> 00:58:17,969
they don't have any question apostasy
welcome to say

947
00:58:17,969 --> 00:58:21,059
quite a soaking but it is

948
00:58:21,059 --> 00:58:24,059
again caveat

949
00:58:24,059 --> 00:58:28,449
PBHG let's wait a little longer and see
what moment a fine

950
00:58:28,449 --> 00:58:35,449
d

951
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:49,020
and

952
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:52,630
okay saw better not at the end and

953
00:58:52,630 --> 00:58:57,060
which actually he fell for the same day
busy and a

954
00:58:57,060 --> 00:59:00,660
is iiNet com it now they're

955
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:03,790
obvious thing to know is to open this
day

956
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:08,040
and open it see figure not what is going
to get a

957
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:12,990
so the first thing you know effect this
ID up and I don't the NN

958
00:59:12,990 --> 00:59:16,250
and do a search

959
00:59:16,250 --> 00:59:20,010
USS to figure out

960
00:59:20,010 --> 00:59:23,380
how well these DNA and you this I think

961
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:28,310
tracing pad now it's finish

962
00:59:28,310 --> 00:59:32,050
netday resort so this is well

963
00:59:32,050 --> 00:59:35,190
I know its communication DNA actually

964
00:59:35,190 --> 00:59:38,260
he fail the function by talking on this

965
00:59:38,260 --> 00:59:41,870
by this function we see here that's the
number

966
00:59:41,870 --> 00:59:46,130
which mean that accorded equal object
which eventually

967
00:59:46,130 --> 00:59:50,770
may figure I believe it did because I
don't see question that'll be a lead

968
00:59:50,770 --> 00:59:51,720
that was a the stealth

969
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:56,020
now then especially his how do I
actually trigger

970
00:59:56,020 --> 01:00:03,020
pale this God yeah

971
01:00:03,039 --> 01:00:06,799
think if at first computers dying I

972
01:00:06,799 --> 01:00:11,710
so basically we saw that this DNA

973
01:00:11,710 --> 01:00:15,499
have this on have died a and I think the
cosby I need to figure out fast

974
01:00:15,499 --> 01:00:18,869
well it's been called so it's been
called by

975
01:00:18,869 --> 01:00:22,369
this function and which one is being
called by

976
01:00:22,369 --> 01:00:26,529
the quad you can actually see so on

977
01:00:26,529 --> 01:00:30,029
by just by the name which product
actually use this function

978
01:00:30,029 --> 01:00:34,130
be caused by the door

979
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:37,519
at six it this is the class and there's
a good body

980
01:00:37,519 --> 01:00:41,339
cord dysfunction eventually someone they
got somebody some message

981
01:00:41,339 --> 01:00:48,280
which message you go up Nikon message

982
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:52,360
saw basically there is the message but
being the call that that eventually can

983
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:52,810
lead

984
01:00:52,810 --> 01:00:56,570
to the vehicle at about sequence the
question is which point out

985
01:00:56,570 --> 01:00:59,660
actually US be SDNN the

986
01:00:59,660 --> 01:01:03,960
easy way to find it is to sell the
system fine

987
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:07,830
music as you can see not think

988
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:14,830
best art but very basic if you actually
open

989
01:01:18,350 --> 01:01:22,450
if you're outlook only knows man and you
look again

990
01:01:22,450 --> 01:01:26,020
candidacy

991
01:01:26,020 --> 01:01:31,170
you can see its BC at

992
01:01:31,170 --> 01:01:36,330
outgrew actually you think is getting
nothing but actually use it

993
01:01:36,330 --> 01:01:40,680
yeah

994
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:47,329
I would do it again them a drug

995
01:01:47,329 --> 01:01:52,210
is person when I him

996
01:01:52,210 --> 01:01:56,750
fix it now it is a mess and no I don't

997
01:01:56,750 --> 01:02:03,119
a wreck of the

998
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:06,310
so they've so I know I know the product

999
01:02:06,310 --> 01:02:10,680
actually using his DNA and then I know I
did I'm

1000
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:15,099
be caught message it's basically best on
assigned

1001
01:02:15,099 --> 01:02:19,599
Inc a big message justification so that
day that

1002
01:02:19,599 --> 01:02:25,079
is basically if you don't care more
commands

1003
01:02:25,079 --> 01:02:29,410
killed

1004
01:02:29,410 --> 01:02:32,030
fastened to invest

1005
01:02:32,030 --> 01:02:35,390
famous security so basically bad day
this

1006
01:02:35,390 --> 01:02:38,849
if we won a Cup in a min which says
thank

1007
01:02:38,849 --> 01:02:41,910
NKP with specific to object ID

1008
01:02:41,910 --> 01:02:45,299
as we saw and Wednesday eventually

1009
01:02:45,299 --> 01:02:49,280
outlook return my picky Pasig andrew de
Gea

1010
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:53,369
the heap overflow so I don't have to
talk is basically

1011
01:02:53,369 --> 01:02:56,980
cuffed this kind of an odd animated

1012
01:02:56,980 --> 01:03:00,190
we def BCCI actually vote in it and then

1013
01:03:00,190 --> 01:03:03,440
we have a real one but it's a question
I'm going to sever

1014
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:07,450
in 127 is body possible you can see what
had happen now

1015
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:14,450
and that was being bad example thank you

1016
01:03:20,599 --> 01:03:22,160
there's any question show

1017
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:26,170
thing kinda ran out of time

1018
01:03:26,170 --> 01:03:30,220
this is a question I don't know either
now or later outside the

1019
01:03:30,220 --> 01:03:35,210
coffee bar 0 way I dress red

1020
01:03:35,210 --> 01:03:39,609
Bradford I our all Thai red curry

1021
01:03:39,609 --> 01:03:43,380
no first so

1022
01:03:43,380 --> 01:03:47,200
first of all I wanna say that the joke
you told

1023
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:50,800
at the beginning was really good a

1024
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:55,180
and then I wanted to ask so there was
like this you know when does this

1025
01:03:55,180 --> 01:03:58,780
not genuine message on

1026
01:03:58,780 --> 01:04:02,200
on on them on thus X

1027
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:06,109
cream so did you actually look for an
exploit in the binary the checks if

1028
01:04:06,109 --> 01:04:06,920
Windows

1029
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:12,319
generate because that could become a
useful call you

1030
01:04:12,319 --> 01:04:15,499
the did I mention that we looked at all
the binary stuff we put together a

1031
01:04:15,499 --> 01:04:16,089
hands-on

1032
01:04:16,089 --> 01:04:21,109
it funny college see need big data yeah
probably within plum

1033
01:04:21,109 --> 01:04:27,249
much allowed for more money list for I
can get you the results that you want

1034
01:04:27,249 --> 01:04:28,269
for dinner for

1035
01:04:28,269 --> 01:04:32,579
yeah I do okay a

1036
01:04:32,579 --> 01:04:37,599
a pic by it was very good thank you

1037
01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:44,599
thanks for acabo questions

1038
01:04:44,809 --> 01:04:47,520
okay so my remote it's thank you very
much
