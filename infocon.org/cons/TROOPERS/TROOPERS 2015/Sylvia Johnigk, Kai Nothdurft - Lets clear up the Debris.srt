77
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:40,410
and follow now it's possible it bitch
complicated because they've lost forces

78
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:41,370
to cooperate

79
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:44,849

00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:54,470
dollar per day if they don't am

83
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:58,169
properly and so they were forced to do
so a.m.

84
00:04:58,169 --> 00:05:01,639
so both hand-written espero no name and

85
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:05,840
but CSC and trade for officious up
providers of the NSA

86
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,949
and yeah he has to soft like this the
eighties but she's Potter

87
00:05:10,949 --> 00:05:14,210
just a few of them isn't a with

88
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:17,550
am are specially mentioned by name

89
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:23,370
in the league next year saw them well as
other on

90
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:26,690
last but not least you know a lot of
tech or scope to work directly

91
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:29,970
when telly the of of bylaw

92
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:33,970
for interception so and Germany we can
pay it

93
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:37,370
they did and tension close out to
Bella's

94
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:40,510
rise in the rising as the provide of

95
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:46,150
our Parliament so I don't think that the
severely

96
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:50,680
nice idea and also leveraged by a level
three is the

97
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,900
provide of our because internet note

98
00:05:53,900 --> 00:06:00,900
he ran from Fort online though

99
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:05,320
when you look at the snow on documents
you see several different thoughts of

100
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:05,730
the day

101
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:08,870
Andreas of compromised in

102
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:13,480
IT technology so products turnout
services and supply chains

103
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:17,270
most easy saw unknown Boehner matisse

104
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:21,040
or in taste tension known and businesses
and

105
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,270
back to us that with i'd in

106
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:28,780
goes a bit and deniability so then known
as maybe that

107
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:32,470
and cuddle ok is a fifty-page MK don't
talk this

108
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:35,500
attacked words which can be or not by

109
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,810
intelligence services is easy as like
with

110
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:42,680
who offered auto were he I order a
cuddle ok

111
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,620
am some of the IT products among people
aged

112
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:50,620
youngster shipment if you're auto
something

113
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:54,040
miss an Amazone you might be

114
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,140
unhappy because you become future a.m.

115
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:00,220
but you haven't bought out a.m.

116
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:03,370
the lists intentionally

117
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:07,740
introduced be cooked resistance okay

118
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:12,440
mention Sr and bovine is a and is a
program do you think this is a breaking

119
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:12,770
of

120
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:16,000
encryption and pre-cooked to like

121
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,080
a.m. are sepia follow and md5

122
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:23,080
do not possess Boylan corporal I as a
tix

123
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,280
so the question is ya how many

124
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:31,200
IT products and services from the US
companies are compromised

125
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,630
and and some historical

126
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:38,660
exclusion exit clear me excursion in
fashion site

127
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:41,660
do you remember in 1990

128
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:45,060
9 seventy very over to Anna's a key

129
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:49,790
and most probably you with to weakening
so Microsoft and tonic with two

130
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:50,510
functions

131
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:53,490
and also in 1999

132
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:58,160
M builders it has become known that
lordosis

133
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:03,610
there too backdoor in his software and

134
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:07,060
questions with who ordered and anybody
heard about

135
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:10,740
top out sheep ok

yeah it's and iPhone toys in hospital
under Section

137
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:19,080
so overall nearly we have been nearly to
a tale of

138
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,560
of tossed in almost everything you with

139
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,509
and

140
00:08:26,509 --> 00:08:31,080
yeah if you look at the and ketorolac

144
00:08:43,469 --> 00:08:47,300
was a bit with the customer hard disk on
Seagate

145

something best on the 22 a money played
it on the concall 11

146
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:57,430
militias and from there and also a
netbook at figment from Cisco

147
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:01,120
day HP hugh way am

148
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,660
Huneycutt netbooks a money paraded
products

149
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:10,220
of these companies are gonna be to end
is a exploits

150
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:14,899
that I mention indicate a rock there's
no evidence of active

151
00:09:14,899 --> 00:09:18,649
a.m. corporations from these companies
baseness a as high as

152
00:09:18,649 --> 00:09:22,480
been all the site and HP and Cisco

153
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:29,040
the wrong at first light so

154
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,310
in other dangerous aspect in the leaks
is the evidence

155
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:36,510
of an extensive and increasing as I just
don't

156
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:41,000
and increasing

157
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,079
and test because going military units

158
00:09:44,079 --> 00:09:48,290
of the internet for often def a.m.
military activities

159
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:52,470
so quantum and so it is a collection of
the wood exploit swept the cations

160
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:57,029
that designed all shops pockets this as
a

161
00:09:57,029 --> 00:10:01,820
and as a name for targeted attacks
against into the kids

162
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:05,010
Fox X's means performing social
engineering attacks

163
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:08,310
against adviser with of misuse

164
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:11,320
second early targets its

165
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:15,230
like admins or targeted systems

166
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:19,850
and and detain excess operation is and
as a hecka

167
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:22,900
unit dedicated to prepare into

168
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:27,150
conduct a.m. it takes and sis and unit

169
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:32,170
the oxen's and 1990 8 and the heifer

170
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:35,370
ya been 68

171
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:38,500
nine thousand baht so clever

172
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:41,690
that's complies system spankin

173
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:46,140
2011 and be think it is so hot standby

174
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:50,340
so i won army and

175
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:55,710
to him

176
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:59,040
on so the Mishnah intelligent

177
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:03,000
quiero tu framework although I S by and
for the event

178
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,000
President Obama but only 35 percent of
the budgets of the fight

179
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,280
against I was in saw

180
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:15,680
the next it was the biggest pot as

181
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,430
and economic a.m. espionage so

182
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:24,540
international financial institutions
like banks or insurance

183
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:28,670
identified this affect the highest
priority so

184
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:32,110
you know but that tension

185
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:35,390
with very am

186
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:41,030
but also employ and he does from
government opposition is this Angie oath

187
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:44,140
international organizations and M

188
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:47,710
United nations and the European Union
are

189
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:51,510
dust-up and so at ease a steam a
compromise

190
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:55,010
to read along and cooked it
communication

191
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:58,230
love into San Antonio covered the

192
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:03,950
in turn in for debut with of for Baines
to it for private per person easy and

193
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:07,900
stocking all for yeah stocking for
private interests

194
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:14,580
and a touch of the fees are has them
complaint

195
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:17,630
which he played a.m. quincy tradition is

196
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:20,920
call him it'd and affection activities
against

197
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:27,920
US citizen is there

198
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:31,770
saw

199
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:35,760
buys into in full well for
systematically

200
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,850
this information and propaganda is
intelligence services staley business

201
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:43,060
information about butts and bono 30s

202
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:46,120
influenced by intelligence services can

203
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:49,830
BS cannot fortified on misleading

204
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:53,730
define down or exhilarated

205
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:57,000
a.m. so we have

206
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,090
and new perspective on manhunt a porch
all

207
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:03,720
semantic we can report and

208
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:08,390
because of the lack of transparency
intelligence officers are difficult to

209
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:09,080
control

210
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:13,930
democratic control both misinformed up a
diet

211
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:18,970
and the when is a has also money paraded
financial transaction

212
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:23,690
and this two-cd too important in the
snow and you commence but both leaked

213
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:26,960
unintentionally buys a report of the

214
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:32,110
Obama Commission investigating
discovered overstep a poser

215
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:38,070
then to stop this practice and one thing
we have another talk later on

216
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:42,030
about some popping puppets and I think
this is also going in this direction

217
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:45,360
means so

218
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:50,130
the next partisan but does it mean for
the company's and former

219
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:53,230
sweats and

220
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:57,500
this opposition problems so

221
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:01,450
any company or three of can become a
target this valley Inc

222
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:04,540
impact all probability as a niece

223
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:08,910
this innovative products SBS many
picture of

224
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:12,800
security products and communication
technology even supply ass

225
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,110
and subcontractors of primary target can
come with

226
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:20,270
target a.m. so

227
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:25,040
by but spying and abeyance makes it
easier to identify people

228
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,540
especially knowledge and whites palm a
targeted

229
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:32,210
company as happens too big a calm

230
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:35,460
it was a admin who both

231
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:38,410
the thinking target so the social
engineer at the

232
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:41,920
at months of back home and then gotta
access to their networks

233
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:47,160
million yeah and me out to talk to gain
specific and useful information about

234
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,920
the sandwich it's

235
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:52,000
to perform advance social engineering
and

236
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,870
spear phishing attacks also black mayor

237
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:59,520
of loss to corroborate in Richards or
anti-age

238
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:03,529
organizations with potentially progestin
damage

239
00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:08,020
to hand over a.m.

240
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:11,270
or cop allege and

241
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:16,080
me to head over corporate or government
secrets order for us all to influence

242
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:21,460
and decision makers to cooperate and
particularly interesting objects are

243
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:25,440
hosting provider of cloud service
providers hot that manufactures

244
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,089
suffered enough admins this privilege
excess whites

245
00:15:29,089 --> 00:15:32,430
in

246
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:35,440
so we have a big challenge a.m. each
peach

247
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,720
a piece of the information must be
protected

248
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,560
but we have no MCQ communication

249
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,839
shiner left to do so

250
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:50,260
am so each

251
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:53,520
hominis piece of information is screened

252
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:57,500
and I S and several contains the risk of
a potential this

253
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,910
of and put into this and has to be
protected

254
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:04,180
internet all confidential business

255
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:08,880
communication is at Wisc because
economic and military

256
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:14,740
and would you get it is spewing ash even
climate content information of employees

257
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:18,330
is underway Kylie misuse of for talking
to takes

258
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:23,050
and social engineering Nick Muse in

259
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:26,230
meter data connection your location data

260
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:29,480
pinned a dog can review and question
information

261
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:34,170
says they are no conclusions on the
intensity

262
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:37,600
intensity and and nature of existing

263
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:42,030
public and business relationships

264
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:44,620
I'm so

265
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:47,740
every public Channahon biatch

266
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:51,100
telephone no bio said it was AP and so
on

267
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:54,340
is an observation cope with netbooks US

268
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:58,370
leased lines for Antonia and data
communication

269
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:02,230
from collaborating te course compromised

270
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:07,750
and user who were devices back to us and
not publish big news is an operating

271
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,620
systems and applications software

272
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:13,510
the two is better situation that no
trusted platform for and

273
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:17,600
kept chin exist anymore he also

274
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:22,650
delivers and manipulation of popular in
2010 on the

275
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:26,120
delivery wat and posh today partially

276
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:29,140
compromise them encryption technique %uh
week

277
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:33,750
computer systems even TPN hey if the
WISC

278
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:37,630
of baked was because most of them he was
an

279
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:41,810
close of their and strong exception if

280
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:45,780
body Houston just the minimum of a part
of communication

281
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:49,100
they are just so few highly

282
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:52,560
and youth X sections like

283
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:56,430
your no pgm or tr pollen and cook to
communication

284
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:59,700
with K

285
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,840
so we have to switch know you shit
statesman

286
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:10,050
attention nice and issuance human
important

287
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:12,300
you women's its decision from 100

288
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:16,250
mmm the complicated because

289
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:19,770
with Matthew muscle you

290
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:26,770
moment

291
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:34,620
K

292
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:40,130
so

293
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:44,750
I'm one thing we are talking about is
the threat of military usage

294
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:48,860
in and we think that this is really a

295
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:51,920
very big issue we have to look at I'm

296
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:55,100
even without facing really concrete

297
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:58,230
cyber warfare texts the already or

298
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:01,590
review have already faced some but the
its

299
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:05,490
just just the option to to use the
military things as

300
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:09,280
really have a serious threat for any of
this four dimensions of security

301
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,320
and I think confidentiality already
talked about with those is you not

302
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:17,080
the integrity of already talked about
with this manipulation things

303
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:21,050
am every ability is something about
someone that they

304
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:24,250
take tone systems maybe and
non-repudiation

305
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:28,160
this is really an interesting thing but
just think of the many relation of

306
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,020
Finance of

307
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:32,250
veteran the finance transactions or

308
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:36,040
just have in mind that you might wanna
blackmail someone you enter this pussy

309
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:41,110
and you drop some trout on it now and
you a poison the chain of custody in an

310
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,220
agreement the

311
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:47,440
process or so this is daily business of
secret services things to do so

312
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,990
okay am why

313
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:54,300
do we think that cyber weapons really a
big issue

314
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:58,879
cyber weapons or we can more column
exploits on my way whatever

315
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,950
I'm they need it undisclosed liabilities

316
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:06,410
course they need and because they're all
the names stuff is already known can be

317
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:07,930
fixed any pensions on

318
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:13,120
and a.m. was a useful in this building
on disclose when abilities ninety

319
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,950
products we already mentioned that also

320
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:18,890
so and all these things up of the
potential to bring the infrastructure

321
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:19,770
down or two

322
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:24,310
shut down the system %uh something the
switches off destroy it the

323
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:27,580
the there's another problem they can
discovered

324
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:31,900
and and exploited by everyone know not
everyone but any good Penders the press

325
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:35,420
something up that I'm and

326
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:38,510
so the come also in the hands of
non-governmental

327
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:45,210
criminals I'm we happen next problem
that private servers provide us

328
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:45,590
the

329
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:49,440
also takeovers terrain functions of the
state for

330
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,590
agencies like the NSA am

331
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:56,640
and maybe they wanna get some extra
money

332
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,940
those people or the employees are being
then they sell the things to

333
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:03,950
organized crime and if you remember
Stuxnet

334
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:07,420
that broke out by programming arrow in
the violence

335
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:11,280
so these things do not do keep in in in
a military usage

336
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:16,740
scenario but come true public and to our
normal things yes %uh maria's

337
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:19,900
military or tendon service knowledge
used for

338
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:23,510
maybe potential a text or you can use
projects already

339
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:27,480
does not remain exclusively in this
domains but it comes to public it

340
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:27,910
because

341
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:31,670
will be used by anyone um

342
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:35,530
we have other threats one is that US
companies

343
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:39,320
the are under pressure or the local
national all

344
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:43,330
and we had already seen national court
decisions against

345
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:47,170
for the to hand over there there person
their customer data

346
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:50,770
and we saw another decision this is
still ongoing in the second round I

347
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:51,260
think

348
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:56,700
against microsoft to hand over data and
one very important thing as a patriot

349
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:00,040
now I'm the Patriot Act the

350
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:04,580
has a a very specific players scored
National Security Letter and as a No

351
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:08,050
and this is really you what we call in

352
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:13,080
listening to anything to get order now
so uuuu forbid somebody to talk about

353
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:16,180
anything what happened there and they
come in they get today to offer

354
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,750
customers and so on and then

355
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:22,230
but what happened to mister nice guy
here this is the reason from love it

356
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:25,610
and he was lucky to have one of his
customers

357
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:29,820
with the name at what's known and then
they came now I'm

358
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:33,590
and he was you not even to contact his
lawyer for these things

359
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:36,760
and talk with them about happening on
okie should behave

360
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:40,340
when you look at your legal issues

361
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:43,910
as the contractor for other companies

362
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:47,600
you have to look at this Privacy
contracts now we have

363
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,660
the for for example if you wanna

364
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:54,360
for process some data and American
medicines the safe harbor agreements

365
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,400
I'm and they are still valid but

366
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:02,350
the a.m. for example if you have a
non-disclosure agreement with the US

367
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:02,930
companies

368
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:06,360
to you should look at this this is
really worth what it said

369
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:09,660
it s you in your paper actor you have a
chance when

370
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:13,770
and US government comes and say you have
turned over this data what about the Sun

371
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:18,290
now and I wanna go to deepen this micro
something

372
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:22,070
a wild boys Markus of going to court in
an

373
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:25,620
fighting respond because that's a
business model they have a data center

374
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:26,290
in Ireland

375
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:31,260
and the store European data personal
records of customers

376
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:37,000
and the problem is that the New York
Court wants them to hand it over for

377
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,070
for York's lawsuit in in in the US

378
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:44,070
and this which the be against a European

379
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:47,240
Union privacy law so they are in a
dilemma now now

380
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:50,420
and they hope that they can fix that but
that's not true

381
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:57,400
how it works I'm it is another thing I
can can can we trust on our own

382
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,990
authorities or is it more this another

383
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:03,480
but I'm as we think our

384
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:07,180
German government works in this things
remote server

385
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:11,690
positive for example they didn't react
on anything what

386
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:17,100
what the to go your with an ex that it
was passed

387
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:22,440
but a pin no not go past before okay

388
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,870
and sir yeah it's that them

389
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:29,460
but just when you look at the reactions
were they what he did when there came up

390
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:29,920
this

391
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:33,410
things to light snap there's no evidence
was noone there

392
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:36,740
the investigation committee in the
German parliament was hindered even

393
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:39,940
now and their now I don't do it is

394
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:43,290
that must be next like this

395
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:48,480
some we have seen cooperation of our
intelligence officers with the NSA

396
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,680
so upbeat and EU how it's going it's
part of the problem really

397
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:56,500
with long-term cooperation seen already
with all the Alice

398
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:59,320
the secret service since world war two

399
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:02,750
and a then there are the

400
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:06,360
agreements like swift agreement like
person to record a

401
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:09,990
flight agreement to hand over that and
the exchange today to

402
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:13,720
with these services: and we see the BND
cooperating with the end is a in several

403
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,270
levels

404
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:17,930
the there's a bidirectional data
exchange somebody

405
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:22,700
quoted stocks change for data that they
really exchange internationally between

406
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,930
how I have some you so you can you give
me some others

407
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:28,040
I'm they handed over the they have a

408
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:33,710
they sniffed on that the 86 note and
praying for and we have a joint venture

409
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:38,520
rumor for civilian space in but I bring
though they operate this together

410
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:41,790
just sit by seed Anna

411
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:45,170
we have the end as a dare complexes in
this is juicy them

412
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:48,760
dumbstruck and that was cool fun as the
German tax money really as a wee bit up

413
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,590
some some

414
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:53,740
rescue nassir stations here in Germany
just against the civil service

415
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:58,460
that's interest I'm and the B&D also
uses X the score

416
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:02,180
which was one of the two instruments
before and also of a possible short-run

417
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:02,970
supply list

418
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:07,960
I'm yeah German government wants to
become one of five riser amendment

419
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:11,940
am sub contractors and consultants of
the NSA

420
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:16,570
are also used but German government was
one popular example which is in a

421
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:18,520
discussion just CSC in a moment

422
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:22,140
so

423
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:26,440
and when we look at this mall and
undisclosed one ability problem

424
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:29,510
miss the Nystrom stopped going on %uh

425
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:33,060
so this is more or less a governmental
Trojan horse and its

426
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:36,270
talk tomorrow for lawful interception
open crib in traffic so

427
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:38,400
permanence for example

428
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,210
and the Constitutional Court Germany
called it

429
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:45,440
illegal in the way they used to stand
and made it a bill that

430
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,010
and the the problem really behind

431
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:52,630
all these things is that the wrists or
this is that the one abilities

432
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:57,450
that these two issues have to be
disclosed cannot fix them you cannot

433
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:01,279
the fix your home company-owned economy

434
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:05,120
their own citizens so you can publish

435
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:09,520
the problem but you have have to use it
and that's the same when you use them

436
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:13,809
for cyber weapons and military way like
the German armed forces is now trying

437
00:27:13,809 --> 00:27:16,960
and I'm yeah

438
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,110
we had some discussions about the meal
which is a German

439
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:23,440
initiative a project to to spread hours

440
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,559
good encryption for citizens and that
was just US layer

441
00:27:27,559 --> 00:27:30,940
based encryption as a transport Leah and
the

442
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:35,260
there is an option for entry encryption
and I think there's no discussion going

443
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,990
on to implement pgp on it

444
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:40,520
but it took really some years already
and not of critics

445
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:45,260
the because nearly use this and their
use already see the influence of the

446
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:49,610
the services of the security services
that that didn't really want the

447
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:51,659
citizens to communicate securely

448
00:27:51,659 --> 00:27:55,679
they wanna intercept these things and
the latest example is the recent

449
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:57,730
election of the trip to warning page

450
00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:00,840
we hope that already ended in in the
last century

451
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:04,039
and that it is coming up again like a
zombie

452
00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:07,919
and yeah you know it's installing back
doors for

453
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:11,570
the recovery key escrow in encryption
things or governmental issues

454
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:16,159
so let's go to the PSI

455
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:19,279
the so this is this is a German BSP

456
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:23,299
I'm the in authority I'm

457
00:28:23,299 --> 00:28:28,600
that is all or also you meant for
Falcons outings citizens and companies

458
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,909
that's why we're talking about here we
think that the vs

459
00:28:31,909 --> 00:28:35,770
he fails to protect really the company
it is not

460
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:40,240
independent it has a conflict of
interests as it has to follow the orders

461
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,610
of ministry up in a fast but belongs to

462
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:46,710
minute also exists for the interests of
the intelligence services in the same

463
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:47,240
house

464
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:51,070
and the there was

465
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:55,640
not solely so I think this week that the
BND also yeah it was yesterday

466
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:59,419
that the BND also worked on this top
story on a

467
00:28:59,419 --> 00:29:02,650
and helped to develop its untested so

468
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:07,230
this is the problem I meant Sony the
should protect people and they develop

469
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:07,700
our

470
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:12,700
now I'm and some members of the couple
Department of the India

471
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:16,190
wendover for the BSC

472
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:20,169
also so these are for for mommy and the
people's

473
00:29:20,169 --> 00:29:25,070
in parts and the BS report one yr
abilities from proven

474
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:30,409
yeltsin's yesterday we know why she am
and so and this is another question how

475
00:29:30,409 --> 00:29:33,919
far can we trust the cons I think the B
is your fucking trust certifications

476
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:35,299
they of our issue

477
00:29:35,299 --> 00:29:41,120
to someone you not gonna miss all the
smoke grenades this information

478
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,200
propaganda things

479
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,720
the as we mentioned intelligence service
the daily business

480
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:49,640
but what about the consultants working
for them what about the vendors and the

481
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,830
partners of the people

482
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:55,220
can we trust their recommendations can
we trust what they tell us

483
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:59,559
their search in study results we rely on
this really

484
00:29:59,559 --> 00:30:02,860
that might be cool financed by someone

485
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:09,860
suspicious I'm now what about
consignments of collaborating companies

486
00:30:09,909 --> 00:30:14,539
now just just think of this thing on the
NIST standards which were compromised

487
00:30:14,539 --> 00:30:15,159
and we can't

488
00:30:15,159 --> 00:30:18,200
and when one very special

489
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,250
friend of us is the mandiant report
there's already

490
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:24,909
the drone is is a an example for
attribution how we can

491
00:30:24,909 --> 00:30:28,210
find the the attack over Cybertech and

492
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:31,570
yeah it was already mentioned anything
some some

493
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:35,280
troopers ago as a as a template to blame
how to blame the Chinese

494
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:39,700
just if you wanna camouflage is a
Chinese Ateco you just look at this

495
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:44,000
and you know how to do it and two men
and a boat was fun at Presidio Rd

496
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,880
yeah so so

497
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,420
this is a lot of threats and then you
look at this I'm

498
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:55,670
I'm we have we have some things

499
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:58,970
how the intelligence services the X the

500
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:02,590
this is really nearly zero if they could
or

501
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:06,770
even political %uh journalistic juneau
them limitation what the

502
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:11,230
have our they they do not consider of
diplomatic problems that you are when

503
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:11,970
they act

504
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:15,270
the with Italy's even I think we release
may not

505
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:18,520
the advisories a.m.

506
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:21,840
they they do not interest and the

507
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,540
reputation of US companies they might
force to cooperate

508
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:30,020
%ah I'm they do not who is it aids the

509
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:33,500
to no good customer confidence or
violating even though their own

510
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,380
constitution

511
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:38,520
so no limitations at that place and what
isn't

512
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:42,230
the most daring me think is is this they
wanted all approach

513
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:45,840
so they want everything resist going on
the internet on some

514
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:49,700
companies on that works with whatever
and that means that they don't accept

515
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:52,150
secure throws and try to compromise
anything

516
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:56,710
and that means any information is a
potential sensitive one

517
00:31:56,710 --> 00:32:00,530
it has to be protected because it can be
misused for social engineering attacks

518
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:04,490
for looking profiles about means they
can attack and so on and so on

519
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:09,150
I'm yeah I'm most existing IT products
and technologies

520
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:12,300
a compromise somehow or there are
weaknesses in their

521
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:16,210
mmm we have vendors and service
providers cooperating

522
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:20,080
also problem we have no assistance from
our government

523
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:24,340
consultants research studies rely on

524
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:28,140
yes but now so after all

525
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:31,220
we have to consider that they are also
it takes on

526
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:35,890
on the hiring fruits so it's not just
this most things they do it anyways any

527
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:37,000
permitted to of course

528
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,120
but this anything what they can do

529
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:43,260
they will do is this is I wanted all
approach now

530
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:47,020
and so you have to think of if you
interesting enough in this I'm going to

531
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,910
think something is interesting enough to
F

532
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:53,420
the Met right so we also have to
consider paranoid scenarios

533
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:56,980
arm upcoming things that

534
00:32:56,980 --> 00:33:00,170
might be very theoretical in the moment
or very

535
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:03,430
very costed and support a causal

536
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:06,860
so

537
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:10,190
the let's go what what can we do about
all this

538
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:14,330
now from so when you look at all these
things is

539
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:18,690
same now it's hopeless we have no chance
to defend against these things

540
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:23,010
we have to give up the fight and we
think

541
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:27,500
yet we have a huge showmanship butts the
and there's no easy is up a lot of

542
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:27,950
course

543
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:31,050
but we should and according to restrict
phase

544
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:34,970
we have to do something I we have to the
mountains think and

545
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:39,070
what we think of is a long term or a
midterm ballistic and big investor

546
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:39,700
approach

547
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:43,720
so that's something else and you said
for the Microsoft thing you have to do

548
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,420
anymore

549
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:49,110
them and we we call it stop crying on
the rear rotor farine

550
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:52,560
those are reroute overall what we call
the

551
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:57,130
for my strategy is really based on close
of products the

552
00:33:57,130 --> 00:34:02,260
based on ever use the Internet as a nice
non-military zone where no battle

553
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:05,260
field is I think this is this is the
wrong way

554
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:09,370
so and that means that you might see the

555
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:13,720
write-off for decades have invests in
the wrong products and the wrong

556
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:14,470
directions

557
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:20,350
cop thing but you should do this as soon
as possible and as soon as as much as an

558
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:21,179
affordable

559
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:24,379
and you should look at your vendors and
suppliers

560
00:34:24,379 --> 00:34:28,330
as well as a depending pros says and
maybe you have to change some things

561
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:28,700
here

562
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:34,850
look at your outsourcing contracts
perhaps you should terminate the 10

563
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:35,389
yellow

564
00:34:35,389 --> 00:34:39,090
this and avoid black box

565
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:42,649
close all software solutions or products

566
00:34:42,649 --> 00:34:45,700
check them replace America possible

567
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:49,290
we have some new consequences we have to
to follow

568
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:53,120
so a media ski pack up the paragraph 11

569
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:57,610
assess you have a mandatory check of the
liability of your subcontractors

570
00:34:57,610 --> 00:35:01,660
so just check to the list of the
subcontractors if they cooperate

571
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:05,170
and think if they are still reliable in
this mean

572
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:08,490
so what is what is massive aliens and
supporting massive aliens for

573
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:12,180
for and intelligence service it's nearly
the the opposite of

574
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:15,300
for privacy really wants from you now
and

575
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:19,230
for mister providers and therefore any
outsourcing contracts the

576
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:22,190
has to be reviewed and probably
terminated if it's with the wrong person

577
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:24,930
and new contracts also risky

578
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:27,950
since their customers become a more
aware of this

579
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:31,260
the thing after the scandal so we really
realize this

580
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:35,600
the discussions and there's some privacy
activists mites

581
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,810
stocks on lawsuits against you if you
don't react

582
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:42,310
on these things and better education is
anything

583
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:46,210
nothing very good Anna privacy laws also

584
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:49,080
with the safe harbor thing which is
still valid and the moment but the

585
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,800
European Union Parliament

586
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,650
already discussed to end all this trade
agreements to and thus the

587
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:58,000
fly to a peasant agreements lift and
also say power

588
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,530
was no discussion and maybe the bases

589
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:06,150
is away then I'm I already mentioned as
Microsoft thing

590
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:12,080
I'm another thing as liability in
general not just in privacy way

591
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:16,310
when you do not choose a reliable
partner there might be other

592
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:20,420
if things that come into a liability
term

593
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:24,800
you can lose your crown jewels of course
in that may cause some some lawsuits

594
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,680
also

595
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,730
as for stock operations for example

596
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:32,140
there might be a fine and financial loss
lawsuits from from

597
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:36,880
showers and investors and the for our
company and also

598
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:41,240
many others we have special management
lab I L liabilities forests

599
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:44,880
from mistakes and failures and risk and
emergency management so if you don't

600
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,710
react and if you know better

601
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:50,570
then you have a problem liability and if
you know your

602
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:54,520
you are you a victim up a potential
victim of espionage and you have to do

603
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,120
something

604
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:59,370
and the very specific thing is

605
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:03,360
the liability for disturbance if you run
and critical

606
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:07,400
infrastructure that will be a very
interesting liability problem

607
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:12,090
so too I think week skip this because we
haven't done much damage should be think

608
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:15,680
that is totally stupid to build up with
German or is european internet or

609
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:16,290
something that

610
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:21,730
sup yeah but I think it's very simple if
you if you look at it

611
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:26,330
review yet multinational companies bf
this supply chains international

612
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:30,050
we cooperated in every other continents
so the stupid to

613
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:33,740
as you know and we need to talk about
what we can do

614
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:36,930
Beach them we can check and rework our

615
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:40,590
outsourcing guidelines and contracts for
example and

616
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:45,250
I think it's a good idea to include some
no spy clauses in these contracts

617
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:49,400
and to the Mons this also for
subcontractors and that

618
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:55,460
becomes very tricky am purchasing
department guidelines

619
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:58,700
why do not have a positive rating of
somebody who says

620
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:01,750
I do not cooperate with intelligence
services

621
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:05,220
that might be a plus a natural selection
of provide us

622
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:09,400
yeah careful choice of security products
and services

623
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:14,420
I'm yeah look at two hidden back doors
and and and

624
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:17,440
collaboration just just imagine you you
run in

625
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:21,650
the 90 s and this is not looking at
specific things

626
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:25,839
especially because they ever forced to
do so

627
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:30,089
I think we had some discussions on fire
yesterday Aurea II discussion

628
00:38:30,089 --> 00:38:33,280
yesterday in debt yes that's what I'm in

629
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:38,020
and wherever possible test the
effectiveness if the surrounds good

630
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:41,839
I'm also against the sophisticated
attacks

631
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:46,500
mean donde voy black box things and
close all solutions

632
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:50,849
another thing what you can do is going
to increase

633
00:38:50,849 --> 00:38:55,950
I'm we we face that there's no strict
segregation

634
00:38:55,950 --> 00:39:01,109
anymore between private life and
business life so you have a BYOD

635
00:39:01,109 --> 00:39:04,670
bring your own device scenarios 00

636
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:08,150
one another example is Facebook accounts
if you're

637
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:11,329
run business Facebook account somebody

638
00:39:11,329 --> 00:39:15,109
then you also use that for private
purposes because facebook allows only

639
00:39:15,109 --> 00:39:15,500
one

640
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:18,930
so if you are in Facebook for

641
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:24,510
from person for your company and then
you are also your private person there

642
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:27,589
so there's there's just one account for
this or privates

643
00:39:27,589 --> 00:39:31,810
calendars and and and business calendars
if

644
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:35,520
the people still have two separated once
and that's not all

645
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,640
the case the then they were synchronize
the state's

646
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:43,410
now so there are there's there's no
restrict a room

647
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:47,250
a strict line between these things
anymore

648
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:50,880
so what you need to do you have to
engage your employees

649
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,500
by their own personal and private
motivation on privacy and security

650
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:58,040
and raise their rounds on the risks of
private and secure behavior and the

651
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,390
public or in the private

652
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:02,540
to social networks or whatever and

653
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:07,470
and the also for their devices security
for the devices of your employees a

654
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:08,700
private devises

655
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:13,069
is the miss you give consultancy and
support for these things

656
00:40:13,069 --> 00:40:16,130
it said anyway for a company why don't
give

657
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:20,630
some regulations for how to secure
private equity firms or something about

658
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:22,150
I'm

659
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:26,859
if you use the BYOD this should be in
good idea anyway you

660
00:40:26,859 --> 00:40:30,270
I'm and and think of this folks s at the

661
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:34,700
spear phishing attacks against employees
so also just talking about how I'm

662
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,099
working for ions another

663
00:40:36,099 --> 00:40:39,510
and I'm doing this and this and this is
nice can be a respring you

664
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:43,829
and it can be reached the day or two
open to whatever your

665
00:40:43,829 --> 00:40:47,660
that happens then and the nothing teach
them to encrypt

666
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:51,660
as it's quite is simple you know the
crypto party

667
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:57,359
to movement so we started already to
make a purple party

668
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:02,000
corporate parties in our company just
service and part of that is normal I T

669
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,329
education program and the Texas of
course Jeffrey software

670
00:41:06,329 --> 00:41:10,369
in or at least open source products
which is not the same

671
00:41:10,369 --> 00:41:14,160
when I'm talking about free software I
mean richest or months to finish in free

672
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,500
is the meaning of freedom

673
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:18,670
not a free beer and there's no free
lunch

674
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:22,470
and that leads the to the thing you
should support

675
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:26,030
if you can free software projects with
Mani

676
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:29,930
now especially if you use them 44 pretty
good things

677
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:33,869
like encryption so a you should finance
called audits

678
00:41:33,869 --> 00:41:37,730
and quality reviews on on these products
I'm

679
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:42,170
and if you develop close of the might be
a good idea to release it at that

680
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:45,450
gets that gets better now for the public

681
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:49,210
fee some back find us I like to build us

682
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:53,640
know your company developers to publish
them fermentation and free

683
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:57,510
licenses I replaced no source wherever
possible

684
00:41:57,510 --> 00:42:01,859
and we had a lot of discussion about the
hot be back and yes it's the stupid

685
00:42:01,859 --> 00:42:03,950
thing and it's really really really bit

686
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:07,960
but we think that it's it's morning
sample it that

687
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:12,390
open source really works because the
back find this movie founded

688
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:16,599
texted now so in that was possible
because they could look into a coat

689
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:21,519
how many problems do we haven't lost
souls products when you have these in

690
00:42:21,519 --> 00:42:22,510
open source things

691
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:26,240
now I

692
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:29,579
go over this I'm encryption as the

693
00:42:29,579 --> 00:42:34,039
cure-all silver bullets arm I'm

694
00:42:34,039 --> 00:42:38,470
at once known said that strong cripple
still works that's nice

695
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:42,119
and that's why I N is a has this big
bull run program to

696
00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:45,420
outbreak on these things butts I'm

697
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:49,200
there are some recovery in some products
you have to skip of

698
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,349
and nothing is you should use

699
00:42:52,349 --> 00:42:55,359
strong cryptographic possible not just
in the

700
00:42:55,359 --> 00:43:01,430
I wrist scenarios I'm any replication
you have should be

701
00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:05,660
security Anna you should use perfect
forward secrecy always think I don't

702
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:06,779
have to mention it here but

703
00:43:06,779 --> 00:43:10,500
and it should be d-fort for anything why

704
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:14,029
it makes this they wanted all approach
difficulty

705
00:43:14,029 --> 00:43:17,980
they have to look more and they have to
spend more resources on breaking all the

706
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:18,430
stuff

707
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:22,039
and so they might over see also the
important things that they can

708
00:43:22,039 --> 00:43:25,660
concentrate on on the other way so why
not

709
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:28,910
have Nena you make night in any company
with the

710
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:32,680
pre-configured s my more pgp installed
on it

711
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:37,039
and ready to use for every customer
every ad hoc

712
00:43:37,039 --> 00:43:41,789
this contrarian cryptids from so you
know it's the that

713
00:43:41,789 --> 00:43:46,490
them now and also demand and offer

714
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:48,859
encryption communication

715
00:43:48,859 --> 00:43:51,770
options whatever to your partners to
your customers

716
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:54,940
so make the

717
00:43:54,940 --> 00:44:00,710
I want it all approach more difficult
for the NSA one problem really be faces

718
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:03,119
that we do not have really trust its

719
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:07,280
encrypting and decrypting devices
anymore when we look at all these things

720
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,720
we just mentioned you some but this is
really a problem

721
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:14,579
you have to work on I think there's
another talk from from banish the

722
00:44:14,579 --> 00:44:15,160
compound

723
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:18,750
the about the secure hardware maybe
we've

724
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:22,089
find something there Anna

725
00:44:22,089 --> 00:44:26,020
using Rhys noon yeah

726
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:30,180
this this a normal things you should do
anyway segregation the Central Asian

727
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:35,230
as Asian redundancies I think that's
it's quite obvious that the

728
00:44:35,230 --> 00:44:39,250
reduces the risks if somebody comes in
it's not that easy to

729
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:43,630
that the whole network is owned and so
on an you have better control its on on

730
00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:45,180
your network boundaries

731
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:48,349
you have the robustness against a.m.

732
00:44:48,349 --> 00:44:52,390
perhaps even a cyber warfare tech and
isolationists

733
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:56,280
thing widely mentioned this year because
it's the opposite of what

734
00:44:56,280 --> 00:45:00,480
some management's to really in the
moment so for

735
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:04,260
security people it's clear but today we
have to tell the messages

736
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:09,390
necessary in still this is something

737
00:45:09,390 --> 00:45:12,890
be caught it advanced paranoia
procedures

738
00:45:12,890 --> 00:45:16,089
so if you accompany you with the

739
00:45:16,089 --> 00:45:19,460
on this on this Obama list with a high
priority so we are not high priority

740
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:21,299
with just seconds high-priority

741
00:45:21,299 --> 00:45:24,460
if you're a military unit what you
produce arms

742
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:29,510
then your more interesting but if you're
Finance Institute if your insurance or

743
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:30,400
something like that

744
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:34,470
then you're in the second highest
priority list already and

745
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:37,799
for the protection of your very very
crowned roads

746
00:45:37,799 --> 00:45:41,599
you should look at these things expect
also the unexpected

747
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:45,049
so this is what I meant the mites

748
00:45:45,049 --> 00:45:49,210
get some sophisticated attacks this is
theoretical no its not theoretical

749
00:45:49,210 --> 00:45:53,410
they might use it it's important am

750
00:45:53,410 --> 00:45:57,210
the shipping problem you are some
software they open the box

751
00:45:57,210 --> 00:46:01,190
and they put in some sniffers in perhaps
you should mask

752
00:46:01,190 --> 00:46:04,790
a radio delivery lines I don't know the
possible

753
00:46:04,790 --> 00:46:08,650
to go to a third party in TA order that
for me but don't mention that it's from

754
00:46:08,650 --> 00:46:09,040
be

755
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:13,770
trusted provider party baby without red
carpet man of my company

756
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:17,680
you %um interesting I'm

757
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:21,200
but remember they have traction and they
can re

758
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:24,650
the you locate any order over any credit
card of

759
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:28,260
in that there was a company kind of this
company okay so these routers going to

760
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:29,030
this company

761
00:46:29,030 --> 00:46:34,240
just many played a bit and another
challenge

762
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:39,490
is conspirator if business meeting so if
you wanna plan a merger and acquisition

763
00:46:39,490 --> 00:46:43,000
you wanna by another company or you get
bought by another company and there's

764
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:43,940
some some

765
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:47,500
organizational things the in place and

766
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:51,250
the well the booking for this conference
before this meeting the

767
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:54,790
hotel reservation this is interesting
how you do that

768
00:46:54,790 --> 00:47:00,089
without using your company accounts for
this and maybe you should book a private

769
00:47:00,089 --> 00:47:01,329
holiday you

770
00:47:01,329 --> 00:47:05,980
trip to the same whatever exotic
location we also the other person's life

771
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:06,329
to

772
00:47:06,329 --> 00:47:09,569
I'm and yeah

773
00:47:09,569 --> 00:47:14,290
just managing Outlook calendars or are
these these commanders

774
00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:18,780
over across the company's and and doing
this in a cryptid way

775
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:23,290
or at sending the invitations to improve
chances already a change a thing

776
00:47:23,290 --> 00:47:28,150
and just to with uses to refer this to
avoid the metadata

777
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:31,190
in so this is really paranoid 13

778
00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:34,380
that but I heard that there was a
company doing this

779
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:37,430
datacom yet to come yeah okay I'm

780
00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:40,700
so again I mean look at this priorities

781
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:45,550
of course start with a quick wins stop
now to change your IT security is pretty

782
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:46,770
in the right direction

783
00:47:46,770 --> 00:47:51,319
to what's free and open software only a

784
00:47:51,319 --> 00:47:55,300
had crowded further funding for and
companies fund the development of secure

785
00:47:55,300 --> 00:48:00,400
open source solutions and platforms and
there's another thing

786
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:04,569
nothing we can't fix that just on a
technical way but we need pressure on

787
00:48:04,569 --> 00:48:05,329
politics

788
00:48:05,329 --> 00:48:08,490
so you should ally as this

789
00:48:08,490 --> 00:48:12,510
company isn't as private persons with
associations in the civil society

790
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:14,910
against this massive Agency Inc

791
00:48:14,910 --> 00:48:19,020
and against cyber warfare and of
intelligence services in our internet

792
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:23,280
because we use at all and that's why we
had some earlier

793
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:26,530
to is funding from the fifth campaign
really wants a running

794
00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:30,599
the cyber peace campaign and we're
trying to work on the politician

795
00:48:30,599 --> 00:48:33,940
political pressure against all these
things yeah

796
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:38,670
so we come to a last letter opener yeah
so I said is it hopeless

797
00:48:38,670 --> 00:48:42,630
those who fights can lose those who do
not fight have already lost

798
00:48:42,630 --> 00:48:43,220
thank you for your attention
