1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:05,210
RI it things and often introduction I
gotta admit

2
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:10,139
um I don't have to full title on him
know the full title on HIA

3
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:13,660
arm it was really long and this lights

4
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:17,410
as an aside we like compiled and several
night shift at least the

5
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:22,300
the finishing touch um and it's really
really difficult to get this

6
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:23,330
presentation now

7
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:26,859
especially since in the morning um there
was already told the Cape

8
00:00:26,859 --> 00:00:31,289
in the keynote um is this the best we
can do about security and then the last

9
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:32,270
light of the

10
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:36,170
a talk before media %uh it was like a
kinetic I will find

11
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:40,920
his way into your network anyways %uh
it's kind of difficult to talk now about

12
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,399
appliance us that I suppose to protect
you from

13
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,039
exactly that I'll but it will still try
to do my very best

14
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:51,890
at least two a may use this as input
when you're discussing

15
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:56,190
are with your executive level about
certain aspects of your security

16
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:56,940
architecture

17
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,300
alright before I start the talk

18
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,300
up big things to a lot of persons
without

19
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:07,549
arm those persons this presentation
would not have been possible

20
00:01:07,549 --> 00:01:11,140
I'm not going to name all of them both
%uh this is the second reference to the

21
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:13,280
introduction in the mornings and is that
the

22
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,470
great team at the NW alike %um W friends

23
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:19,689
on year end without those it would not
have been possible

24
00:01:19,689 --> 00:01:22,830
arm alright coming back

25
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:26,560
to the presentation the tightly
valuating day PTR mom

26
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,880
I mean you basically have a good idea
what products we are referring to

27
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,799
when you're saying a PTR maw um however
I want to stop the presentation

28
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:38,860
with a different picture the an x-ray
have a foot

29
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:42,350
to be more precise um my broken foot

30
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:45,780
arm I broke my foot roughly two years
ago

31
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,950
arm and since I'm

32
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:52,200
quite an active guy and it's difficult
for me to relax sometimes

33
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,479
which I also know but myself so said
they didn't have the chance to do very

34
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:56,990
much

35
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:00,049
and I like to exercise I did some
research

36
00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:04,340
back-burner okay I was my exercising
routines to like gold

37
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:08,080
appropriate sister something that I
could do to improve like exercising

38
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,610
anything

39
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:13,370
site did some research on that and a
coffee find a lot of great solutions and

40
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:14,010
the Internet

41
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:17,180
and you will try to improve your book
out without you

42
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:20,390
you can get you can achieve results you
don't even think %uh possible

43
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,400
are even in 12 weeks um

44
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,709
and the nice thing is you can achieve
that

45
00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:29,760
coming up youth give Colo

46
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,650
that's so that's kinda the point yeah

47
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:38,410
thanks for pointing that out minimum I
thought yep

48
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:43,360
so and he does 12 weeks I mean there are
also some shock us that you can take for

49
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,400
example there is a mix

50
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,620
extremely powerful exercises like a
squat bicep shoulder press combination

51
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:52,170
which basically I think like one or two
of those come

52
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:55,950
native exercises and you're done right
oh that's all the really nice

53
00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:00,120
and of course since you have such
extremely complex and effective

54
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,079
exercises

55
00:03:01,079 --> 00:03:05,180
um can reduce your workout times we only
have to work out five minutes

56
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:08,910
arm and you're done with your work I'll

57
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:13,389
achieve your perfect body in like 14
days %uh if you just follow those

58
00:03:13,389 --> 00:03:17,130
great advice to be found on the other
web sites arm

59
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:20,769
and then again because um everybody
tells UK

60
00:03:20,769 --> 00:03:25,329
on when exercising only 50 percent of
your success is determined by exercising

61
00:03:25,329 --> 00:03:26,880
in fifty percent by a diet

62
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,160
other people other reach material about
that

63
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,620
and luckily every cuz you're there a
cheat days in your diet so

64
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:37,060
the other can get around like this so
you have a lot of cheap days but just in

65
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,849
like having a good diet

66
00:03:38,849 --> 00:03:42,310
other day taking care of so

67
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:45,880
arm when all those like statements

68
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:51,069
arm to pretty funny to us I want because
I mean there are a lot of

69
00:03:51,069 --> 00:03:54,299
Pat comparisons out there however on

70
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:58,419
this is not present basically not the
point I gonna ask you questions I gonna

71
00:03:58,419 --> 00:03:59,459
ask you some questions

72
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:03,610
during the presentation um so I'm not
going to ask you love

73
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:07,690
you have added some stuff like that a
homage it is you have on

74
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:11,860
however I am look at some other stuff if
you look into that but this meant of

75
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:15,660
security appliances and stuff their
appliances out that %uh providing

76
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:18,340
defenses before vulnerabilities are
discovered

77
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:21,430
I mean to

78
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:24,500
mister laughing here but how many of you

79
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,890
are having a checkpoint IPS plate and
their environment

80
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:32,920
but in the basement I

81
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:36,100
go when I i'm really would not believe
that if nobody is raising the ante

82
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:36,740
evident

83
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:40,460
maybe oh you're not really sure I mean I
did not ask you about it she

84
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:43,480
day so you could at least be honest %um
arm

85
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:47,270
i'm looking in the basement on the show
on you okay

86
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:51,840
I'm however this is the technology to be
seeing a lot of environment so

87
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,940
even though people on some %uh do not
believe that you can get like go

88
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:59,020
gonna be big and black in of weeks
however the

89
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:03,150
seem to believe in that stuff arm there
is more stuff I didn't find anything to

90
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:05,890
highlight here because basically the
whole paragraph is like it's

91
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:08,930
complete protection everything so

92
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:12,210
I'm if we don't get an at hand here then

93
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:15,570
on actually don't believe you as a

94
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:19,470
mcafee endpoint protection in the
environment so okay thank you

95
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:23,170
four of five hands that something and
then

96
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:27,100
coming to be closer to like the call of
this talk we have products that

97
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,900
calm but today's advanced persistent
threats I mean the other

98
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:34,190
the wind on HIA um was a

99
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:37,840
II product in the environment one to
okay

100
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:42,240
in this book almost as much as me AP
that would be a we had ratio but still

101
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,310
home I gotta leave you alone and a so

102
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:49,560
um this is also like to the main topic
of the presentation what are we gonna

103
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,550
looking into you

104
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:54,660
and something called APT protection
there are a lot of times out there like

105
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,270
advance to next next generation method
detection

106
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:01,550
but this is the time we gonna use a PT
protection um

107
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:04,750
in order to look into that because need
to see you

108
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:08,520
but protection means the plan easy one
and i was actually very happy

109
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,760
when I look this one up because the
definition that we find here

110
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,170
the state of being kept from hom this
like a really nice definition

111
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:19,100
are for someone who's all involved in a
lot of risk management our project but

112
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:19,940
of course I mean

113
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:23,340
for protection is not important on to be
fine however

114
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:26,340
some honey to the smooth transition to
be able to speak about

115
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:30,290
a different definition APT I'm pretty
sure

116
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:34,620
all of you have heard the term APT are
and I don't like to use the storm

117
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:39,910
especially on like arm and project
context it's actually kind of like a

118
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:43,660
lame at the NW to use that water and for
the faint I could have helped

119
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:47,420
attack or something like that however
since it's about a PT protection

120
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:52,470
I gonna use it so of people have talked
about a PT what it is and British you

121
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:53,390
all of you have a

122
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:57,600
somewhat of an understanding arm other
Rodrigo I think two years ago

123
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,430
translate this nicely into the
asian-pacific threat um

124
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:04,320
in his keynote which is totally
unrelated to the picture i jus got a

125
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:04,860
slight

126
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:09,030
arm however if you're looking at the
time APT

127
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:12,530
just to be completely essence for
advanced persistent threat

128
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:15,650
there's a definition from 2010

129
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:19,480
actually rather for Mom semi-formal
former one by

130
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:23,040
Richard a place which who's now a fight
I actually am

131
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:27,470
as well as a lump in the morning however
he provided this definition what apts

132
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:30,670
some that once transform but the

133
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:33,930
adversary can operate the full spectrum
of computer intrusion

134
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:38,180
basically they do whatever they want
they don't lose and use any particular

135
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,290
intrusion technique

136
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:42,300
the use anything that helps them to

137
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:45,600
are fulfill their goals are reached a
course persistent

138
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,710
means that the advisory is not an
opportune opportunistic

139
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:52,360
intruder so they're not just script
kiddies was getting a network of looking

140
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,220
around a little bit

141
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:57,440
the actually want to access your data
they on a mission and a one-stop if

142
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,850
like the first attempt does not work are

143
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:05,220
then threat this is a again someone
being involved in this management

144
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,010
modernize

145
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:09,250
definition from you however I the fun in
that

146
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:13,080
that means that about the reason not a
peace of mind this coat this definition

147
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,860
is particularly relevant for us

148
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:19,550
on also by the way the term APT year
according to bed miss both

149
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:22,900
point by the US Air Force and not by
Mandy and

150
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:26,300
I'm as many other think some

151
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:30,110
arm but I have this

152
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:33,700
threat definition in mind that means
that the advisory is not a peace of mind

153
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:34,390
this coat

154
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:37,430
there's a very interesting first
deduction

155
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:40,479
so if we if we translate all of this
year and local

156
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,750
one on basic sentence it means

157
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:47,080
ATT is human to take us with a certain
level of skills

158
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,100
arm but I'm not automated malware

159
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,340
but about that what it comes down to

160
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:56,480
some the first interesting observations
via

161
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,570
is actually but it's an interesting
assumption

162
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:03,220
to think you can prevent a threat which
is not caused by automated software

163
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,700
using automated software

164
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:09,220
but as might only be my first impression
however I was not alone with this

165
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,020
impression

166
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:13,890
I just gonna leave that he M arm I think
like us for

167
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:18,720
a series of a very large environment you
can be able to say something like that

168
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,600
I like the statement was of course I
could to make the point of the talk to

169
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:22,850
you

170
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:28,400
so arm but it was a

171
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,730
first introductory definition of APT

172
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:35,310
and what you're talking about some what
the actual goal of the talk

173
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:38,850
yes as we are we want to evaluate
weather does

174
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:42,430
behavior based method detection
solutions you see fit right to

175
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:45,800
about to tame term a bttm arm

176
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:50,010
a suitable to protect your environment
from typical threats that we see out

177
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:50,350
there

178
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:54,720
and in the cost of doing so we have
caused all the one true

179
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,210
provide you something inside on the
internal of those are

180
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:02,400
behavior-based analysis solutions are
because

181
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,990
our impression like really is the
marketing works

182
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:09,290
everyone is buying this to protect
themselves from APT

183
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:12,950
are however nobody really understands
workers things are doing

184
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:16,709
minimum bitterly thank you

185
00:10:16,709 --> 00:10:20,319
have been arm so

186
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:23,550
everybody everybody it's buying those
boxers

187
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:26,569
nobody understands what's going on
inside so

188
00:10:26,569 --> 00:10:29,790
we will look a little bit into does
boxes and what they can actually be

189
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:30,589
provide

190
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:34,930
in doing so are we have to look into
several APT scenarios

191
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:38,519
from model the somehow we derive

192
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:42,170
attack patterns but we use no scenarios
and

193
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:45,930
some primitives based a on those and
then of course

194
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:49,420
be evaluated okay how do those solutions
work

195
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:52,420
against those threats now to

196
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:55,819
him

197
00:10:55,819 --> 00:10:59,310
him working

198
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:04,550
alright in doing so in order to define a
PT year

199
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:08,959
we try to have a look at the most
relevant APT scenarios of the last

200
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:09,509
year's

201
00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:13,910
and by doing so of course we had some
are experience from customer contacts

202
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:15,110
when we analyze some

203
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:18,970
incidence auto spell like fought during
the last two years

204
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:22,759
and we looked into incident reports that
the available

205
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:27,139
from companies are that we like exposed
to very prominent cases

206
00:11:27,139 --> 00:11:30,259
APT and of course we all the taken to
calling

207
00:11:30,259 --> 00:11:33,649
up but other researchers say what
typical a text look like

208
00:11:33,649 --> 00:11:37,000
so what we saw

209
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,899
in the cause of the incidents like in a
very very basic genetic level

210
00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:44,779
is that it was in the tech and into not
and this attack um

211
00:11:44,779 --> 00:11:48,060
compromised so some crappy that
application in the DNC

212
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:53,160
so with a single injection know them
command execution of whatever what

213
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:56,509
just the remote memory compromise
whatever you think someone could find

214
00:11:56,509 --> 00:11:56,850
out

215
00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:01,540
the basically never compromising like a
classic latte cusub and the DNC im

216
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:05,300
and then this is a maybe one of the more
interesting points

217
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:08,920
even though this is also not new to dump
credentials on both of us

218
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,279
and use those credentials to spread
through a network

219
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:15,589
eventually they although

220
00:12:15,589 --> 00:12:18,899
got a hold of a domain administrator
account and from that point on

221
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:22,290
basically was game over that I was
actually the typical

222
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:26,260
pet on that we saw in four incidents
that we analyzed up during the last two

223
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:26,750
years

224
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:30,879
all incidents have like roughly that
PETA

225
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:32,879
so this is so the stuff we saw

226
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:37,999
in the last two years NBN try to look
into incident reports the published by

227
00:12:37,999 --> 00:12:38,949
the company's

228
00:12:38,949 --> 00:12:42,519
who had major data breaches in the last
three years

229
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:46,360
so first we started okay we want to look
at the reports of the last three years

230
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,399
which had more than 10 million preach
data records

231
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:53,079
um and we look into those those who was
a

232
00:12:53,079 --> 00:12:57,119
list of roughly 20 preachers and out of
those trendy preachers and I was really

233
00:12:57,119 --> 00:12:58,550
surprised by that fact

234
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:02,160
there were only two would technically
simple incident reports available

235
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:07,509
so basically actually able does all like
the channel news about that Otago it was

236
00:13:07,509 --> 00:13:09,480
breached or another company was breached

237
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,209
on everybody's playing it on oh no we
won't release technical details yet

238
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,959
because we still investigating

239
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:18,509
and then of the two or three months of
course nobody is so taking care about

240
00:13:18,509 --> 00:13:20,079
this incident reports anymore

241
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,679
so that's why actually only for two of
those incidents

242
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:27,869
a technical details are available so we
did decided okay let's look around a

243
00:13:27,869 --> 00:13:28,839
little bit for them

244
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:32,499
so we looked at February 2015 there were
39

245
00:13:32,499 --> 00:13:36,920
incidents that we saw on that were a
somewhat come up by then you saw

246
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:40,079
some arm a press release us

247
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:43,379
and out of those one more technical
analysis was available

248
00:13:43,379 --> 00:13:46,720
then be widened up a little bit be
reduced the

249
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,860
the scope of the arm the number of
bridge records

250
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:54,179
and the phone three more technical
analysis that where Baylor analysis that

251
00:13:54,179 --> 00:13:55,179
where available

252
00:13:55,179 --> 00:13:59,350
um the other focused like the more
prominent cases such as LinkedIn

253
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:03,119
else not chat had snow and all that
stuff so

254
00:14:03,119 --> 00:14:06,499
um out of dole's

255
00:14:06,499 --> 00:14:10,600
actually did JP Morgan case home to a
smaller incidents

256
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:15,049
and many other much smaller incidents
actually also follow to text in that we

257
00:14:15,049 --> 00:14:15,740
saw above

258
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:20,350
the compromise to sell at a DNC and then
spread through the network

259
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:23,779
basically still compromising a crappy
bet that that you have running some were

260
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:24,269
still

261
00:14:24,269 --> 00:14:27,509
relevant application relevant take
effect of

262
00:14:27,509 --> 00:14:31,350
and then the rest some more that way I
am

263
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:34,519
arm victims of spearfishing so

264
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:37,990
um this is also what many and described
in the infamous

265
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:39,980
APT one reporter report

266
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:44,740
and what on other TV are described in
forty-four combat the spread some

267
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:45,500
typical

268
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:49,180
a technic toss for example of course you
get a email

269
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:52,660
and in that you know this either linked
to on an attached PDF

270
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:55,940
or office document even though directly
and execute the file

271
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:59,870
so this is also the typical stuff that
other see out there the basically be the

272
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:01,090
second scenario

273
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:05,870
where r the Ateco sent an email to beat
them in the network comes credentials

274
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,890
and from them on it's basically the same
idea

275
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:11,520
I mean this is nothing new I'm telling
you he a the interesting part is that

276
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:15,080
most of the stuff that we're still
seeing falls into those two categories

277
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:20,240
some we're looking into those categories
and breaking goes down a little bit

278
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,740
I'm become up with the following a tech
face of course first you have to

279
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:27,950
infect um the victim or the victim
network

280
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:32,090
in a first step you can do that either
by attacking a user

281
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:35,920
so send any other e-mail are doing a
water hauling a tech all

282
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,660
you can compromise the solving the DMZ
so that's the two options that we

283
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,040
actually seeing out there

284
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,420
and it comes down to that the next step

285
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:48,740
is to persist this one is very closely
related to the first step of infections

286
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:51,460
open for example if you receive a
malicious PDF

287
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:55,230
I that's not the whole payload in that
typically does like a a drop although to

288
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:55,810
India

289
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:59,860
the downloads a binary and persists that
onto the victim system

290
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:03,600
but this is the second stage and at that
stage

291
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,820
is to look the system access everything
you can get

292
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:11,260
and extract interesting data so
basically bring it out of them

293
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:14,940
company network and than the last up
once it did all of this

294
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:18,060
you want to spread through the network
assist the last up

295
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:21,170
on like thumping credentials and using
does

296
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:25,080
to infect other PCs are systems

297
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:28,830
soem when we want to

298
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:32,020
detect those a text thats which are
basically part

299
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:35,930
all the described deputies in ariels
attack scenarios

300
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:39,860
on that we derive from the steps before
all there are a lot of been the salt

301
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:40,320
them

302
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,770
um the promise you okay dis APT stuff
that we're having here we can detect

303
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:45,270
that

304
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:48,930
there are a lot of members out them
argue that just some of them

305
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:52,120
at least two from my perspective from a
perception

306
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:55,510
the most prominent ones arm we did not
look at

307
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:59,390
all of those they also have some
different arm

308
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:03,140
focus the no some of them but we had

309
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:07,980
experience with high and Seascale in
actually quite some customer project I

310
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:08,470
mean

311
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:12,230
now let's say during the last mmm a to
16-month

312
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:16,230
a lot of customers for asking us okay
just to broach products they are like

313
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:17,250
promising us

314
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:20,450
um the Beacon have a I'm

315
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:24,280
realistic APT protection that protects
us from exactly the stuff that we are

316
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,140
still failing

317
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:29,340
out to defend against like spearfishing
and all that stuff the compromises our

318
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,240
network so what do you think about those

319
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:34,790
so been the cause of several customer
requests and project

320
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:38,920
um projects we actually im give a quite
some experience with those

321
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:43,620
so arm as I said up

322
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:47,710
those products available in many
customer environments um

323
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:51,540
we only have experience with those to
whom so but the line saying this only

324
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,610
apply to fire II in Seascale up

325
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:56,690
and the typical deployment that we see
in

326
00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:02,190
is to don't you have like a a proxy
deployed to all that you feel that the

327
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:03,060
mail traffic

328
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:06,160
of the environment s4c scale-up

329
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,470
um the BEP analysis I think it's too
though the product they offerings are

330
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:11,350
the only

331
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:15,390
offer to inspect your traffic so they
offering you a proxy service proxy as a

332
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:16,570
service and the clout

333
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:20,290
um and the inspector up traffic arm

334
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:24,010
as for of I have a lot more product
sales of like network

335
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:28,870
um intrusion detection for your internal
network and stuff like that but

336
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:32,700
um be made to look at those so arm

337
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,760
when we look at those deployment
scenarios that

338
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,890
bet traffic and email traffic is inspect
that we actually need to ask us

339
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:43,310
okay well the stuff %um the control of
the be detect that

340
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:47,920
but the summer base compromises they
probably would be difficult to detect

341
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,070
been based on the I could picture that
we see

342
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:54,000
if the pox in traffic is inspected all
the major traffic is inspected the

343
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,110
probably doesn't hurt you or someone is
compromising about application

344
00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:02,180
at least are for a typical deployments
that BC

345
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:05,640
if we're talking about use on file-based
Tex cause I mean that's what they are

346
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,330
made for

347
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:09,440
someone just downloading a file from the
internet um

348
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,350
maybe some Java blood office document
PDF document %uh they are supposed to

349
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:18,740
analyze start and tell you whether it's
militias rb9

350
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:24,800
so again of course I will come back to
that later thereof like a lot more lots

351
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,770
of Morong

352
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:29,550
interesting five former such as why a
shark farts a peek at fires

353
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:33,240
of Photoshop files on sup media files

354
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,830
like I've you'll see her like huge
history of fun their abilities

355
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:40,010
so their own other interesting five from
us that one can look at

356
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:43,580
especially when you have like the target
that focus in mind

357
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:47,660
on even I don't might be interesting
target to exploit when you're looking at

358
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,130
the

359
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:51,390
I at the corec victim so

360
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:54,840
on if you're looking at the

361
00:19:54,840 --> 00:20:00,800
use a file-based infection what other a
tech primitives that we need to look for

362
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,070
if we on APT protection solutions so
that's basically what we broke it down

363
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:04,730
to

364
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:08,000
are if a file is opened we wanna see you
have a all

365
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,690
there's a memory compromise happening
arm whether there is a slut by passing

366
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:13,660
in place to

367
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:16,690
basically like a rock trains all
expected voting

368
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:22,610
arm whether there are some interesting
ways to load an external IP arrium

369
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:28,030
a lot of like movie samples out there
don't load libraries the traditional way

370
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:31,800
whether this keeps paying in place and
like the first

371
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:36,310
um transition to the persistence face is
to download for the files

372
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:40,170
that is a basic leader tech primitives
in the infection face

373
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:45,080
than a PT protection solution with me to
look out for been touring the but

374
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,210
persistence face

375
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:50,360
what is happening them for example a
binary I execute herbalist

376
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:53,500
download ultra-safe somewhere on the
hard drive

377
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:58,010
um those binaries might be picked it
might be the bug detection and I

378
00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:01,840
obfuscation arm be available then maybe

379
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,950
additional users are created even though
that's quite noisy

380
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:08,610
I love I would not want to have
additional users on my systems

381
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:11,680
they might be open network ports for a
bike show

382
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:15,010
there might be something written two of
the run

383
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:18,450
they might be the special bypassing
mechanisms for hooking

384
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:22,440
and of course there are stalling
mechanisms in modern nowhere which

385
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:26,550
actually talking exactly does a PT
protection solutions for example

386
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:29,950
I mean a slew I will cover that later
how they actually work

387
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:33,490
arm which is also not too surprised them
in their behavior based

388
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:37,390
made another solution so if you look at
them and the binary for five minutes

389
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:41,200
and nothing happens um that's basically
good sign right

390
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,470
but if the member waits for five minutes
or basically waits for a certain event

391
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,310
llego

392
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:50,560
left click of a mouse um such an
analysis solution

393
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,800
would have a hard time actually
observing the behavior

394
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,900
so however if the persistence

395
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:00,300
thing work we would need to look out for
all the front

396
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:05,440
on file excess that could happen so for
example if Windows credentials are dumb

397
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,220
which was really liked one of the main
compromise steps that we saw

398
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:13,470
are in all the incidents weather like
made a pass what's our access to browse

399
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:16,430
a passport history to might be some
instant messaging in place

400
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:20,230
and may be looking more at the private
sectors on banking information that

401
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:21,270
might be accessed by

402
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:25,900
some online banking two wheels and of
course on what we actually also

403
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:29,750
there might be some networks living in
place awesome traffic redirection

404
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:33,360
like adding additional entries to the
hosts file or something like that but

405
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,260
this is all malicious activity in

406
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:38,300
that such an APT protection could ups of

407
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:42,630
are from our perspective the next step
is to exit rate they term

408
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:47,290
um there is like a variety of ways
available how you can do with that

409
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:51,030
arm based on alarm deployment scenario
that we had

410
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:55,670
that review looked at the clock sea bass
solution was of costs on the possible to

411
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:57,700
evaluate the detection rate for

412
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:01,070
other exfiltration message methods but
however like

413
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:04,880
its GDP base exfiltration still
something that one might want to look at

414
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,640
and that definitely needs to be detected
by I'm

415
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,260
oxy based APT solution so the last face

416
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:16,390
spreading through the net through a
network what is happening here

417
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:20,090
um basically you want to compromise mall
hosts

418
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:23,130
through the network you can do that is a
either using

419
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:26,390
the same on additional infection
technique all

420
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:27,990
you use your don't we know

421
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:32,020
credential and thats what be
unfortunately saw most of the time

422
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:35,940
in the past and what other happened up
according to some

423
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:39,010
incident reports so um

424
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:42,470
we will not cover this in this
presentation sons of call some

425
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:45,700
party base solution is only like limited
inside and what

426
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:49,070
it happening inside of your network so
will not cover this

427
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:54,200
in this presentation so let's look a
little bit in the different detection

428
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,610
methods that behalf

429
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:59,270
the basically im um we had to

430
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:03,570
the wretched the the regular season kill
us officers that we have experience with

431
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:07,080
including the behavior based analysis
and

432
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:11,210
we had a fire I appliance to peer
performed most of all it s

433
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:14,520
at an all out like actually very Fido
standoff cost whether like

434
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:18,290
sufficiently recent Russian like all
that they tell but it has

435
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:22,690
some those were deployed in the lab
environment something like that

436
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:26,700
of course we have a fight I deployed and
proxy mode in our own network

437
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:30,360
and for the tests of the Seascale am
solution

438
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:34,120
I'll be used to arts use get up proxy as
a service solution

439
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:39,690
but hosted somewhere by sea scallop in
order to evaluate does

440
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:43,100
on we need to know how those art
solutions detect

441
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:46,280
malicious files basically what they do

442
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:49,950
arm they execute binary in a sandbox
environment

443
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:53,250
and tried to apps of

444
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:57,160
wats art the binary is doing autumn
whatever the file though

445
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:00,380
the militia stylist doing this can be
done

446
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:03,410
either like in the operating system of
the sandbox

447
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:06,929
are typical method crip hooking

448
00:25:06,929 --> 00:25:10,330
whether it's like a input table based or
in line based or

449
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:14,860
on what about you can deploy a registry
for the driver so terrible

450
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:18,429
lot of different ways to implement like
a meta-analysis sandbox

451
00:25:18,429 --> 00:25:21,690
are in the operating system second way
with be

452
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:26,650
to emulate either the binary onto the
like the whole operating system

453
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:30,120
on that this executed in all on

454
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:33,360
this way to like not one of the more
recent ways its muscle machine

455
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,270
introspection so basically you

456
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:39,500
huge leverage the hypervisor some are in
order to gain insight

457
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:43,370
arm the operating system what's going on
in there

458
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:47,250
are they're electing two main approaches
available from our perspective

459
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:50,380
I was either the BMX tripping all the
pit

460
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:53,840
PPT based approach I won't go into
detail

461
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,700
arm into does detection method because
fall like that your evaluation that we

462
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,210
did

463
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:02,890
it's not too important to you within the
one to evaluate okay

464
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:07,740
dust this method provide better results
when monitoring the well mail rather

465
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:08,030
than

466
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:11,160
this method we actually wanted to
provide some real-world

467
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:14,540
um feedback okay what can those
solutions deliver

468
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:18,100
and what up can they not deliver so

469
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:23,830
arm when be execute that the binary in
the sandbox we get something called

470
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:29,040
an execution trace what I call an
execution trace so it's basically

471
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:33,169
list of all the system activity in that
what what sorts of by the

472
00:26:33,169 --> 00:26:37,080
from the member so for example system
'cause registry access

473
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:40,460
network activity files that were created
at

474
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:43,910
which is basically all come up a system
calls of API caught

475
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:47,210
on but basically got a pretty good idea
what the motive us doing

476
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:51,660
on the other like a a pick-up file that
you can download and look into zapata

477
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,650
mobile was transferring over the network

478
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:56,919
on and all that stuff so you basically
look at the mill well

479
00:26:56,919 --> 00:27:00,620
are like it did in the traditional
dynamic analysis mode

480
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:05,650
you were looking with API monito lost by
a shark with the Rochester monitor so

481
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:07,220
the system it on a tooth we'd

482
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:10,350
arm at them lol and

483
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:13,470
try to determine what the Midwest doing
so that's what

484
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:17,440
those solutions are doing in an
automated way arm

485
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,700
SL reset only valuations goal was

486
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:24,510
not on the quality of detection methods
but the emulation of hooking

487
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:27,760
in sped up %uh this is not what we
wanted to look

488
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:31,450
at we also did not like to run the mass
testing of samples

489
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:34,800
like home okay with download those like
five million

490
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:38,870
a member samples and the one solution
detected like eighty-five percent and

491
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:42,260
the other one detective eighty-three
percent so that's also not the focus

492
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:45,290
you also did not focus on performance
hiya

493
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:48,720
we were interested in providing your
feedback

494
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,180
arm how those solutions actually book so
they

495
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:55,940
detect stuff the motorways doing but
then you get like a

496
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:59,880
from a trace of system calls and network
activity but what that's the does that

497
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,720
actually mean

498
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,380
I mean there is still some
interpretation necessary on this not

499
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:04,630
like

500
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:07,880
one single action that was performed on
a system and you can say okay this

501
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,390
binary is clearly militias

502
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:12,430
because it created the file militia
stops

503
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:15,690
XE that's just not possible so

504
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:19,630
all of those solutions some have to
derive your estates

505
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:23,160
what is a typical member 5 doing and

506
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:26,840
how are we detecting this in the
execution trace so for example if we

507
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:27,220
have

508
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:30,880
this registry access and this network
activity and

509
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,610
we detect that arm like keep spraying in
the binary

510
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:39,280
then its malicious so we need to
understand how does solutions

511
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:42,950
are putting the pieces together on how
they are arm

512
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:46,610
deciding what's malicious and what's not
malicious so

513
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:51,840
um we created like a handful stempel's
which was basically actually enough to

514
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,210
give us a pretty good insight

515
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:56,470
on on what the different solutions but
doing

516
00:28:56,470 --> 00:29:01,870
some up first of all we have like three
PDF documents that were Houston

517
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:05,000
okay we'll give you second to take
pictures here

518
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,020
um there were three PDF documents that
were actually used

519
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:12,950
in APT it takes on those were right

520
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:16,000
rather old on but we actually use this

521
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,230
aside some kind of a bass lines
basically they use keep spraying that

522
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:23,040
up trains in them and they try to
download a binary from the internet

523
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:26,150
that they then way about to execute on
the system

524
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:29,800
so the next one was from 2014

525
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:33,110
it was actually our buffer overflow in
by a shark

526
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:36,510
which could be triggered by opening a
certain pick-up file

527
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:40,430
um which was the buffer overflow and was
opening a bike show

528
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:41,110
this one will

529
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:45,179
us straight from Metasploit this is also
one of the PDF documents

530
00:29:45,179 --> 00:29:50,040
at No I was I was wrong in STP cat 5 but
it still straight from a dust cloud

531
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:53,179
another Metasploit thing was a No

532
00:29:53,179 --> 00:29:56,770
Microsoft Office exploit an RTF document
are

533
00:29:56,770 --> 00:30:02,230
again a bind show Ben we had one of the
latest

534
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:05,710
are exploits of the flash player that
the test at on

535
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:08,820
just since it's not like a traditional
file-based thing that the download and

536
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,070
execute them but

537
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:13,679
somehow automatically executed in the
problems of so it was awesome adult

538
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:16,690
Metasploit module reciting the reverse
shell

539
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:21,590
arm then again another Metasploit module
and this is the interesting one here

540
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:25,570
one of the more recent I'll attacks
against Acrobat Reader

541
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:29,020
from 2013 also opening a bind show

542
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:32,870
all in another in a different world may
also like just opened a

543
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:37,530
coke then where the Photoshop file base
overflow

544
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:42,370
also opening on the calculator from 2012

545
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:46,160
so those were like were rather typical
examples

546
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:50,130
and since the solutions actually peace

547
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:54,150
absorbing the behaviour are it is
difficult to develop

548
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:57,830
something custom yeah I mean you would
need like a a zero they again so the

549
00:30:57,830 --> 00:31:00,290
most recent Acrobat Reader version

550
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:04,380
in order to actually see whether they
are able to dictate x0 they attacks

551
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:08,290
on however we will see are how this
worked out so far

552
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:12,760
arm then when it comes more to the
persistence

553
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:16,040
step are in the in the attack process

554
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:19,690
we created some binary state created the
use on the local system

555
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:23,460
just so regulate the I call arm to
create to use on the system

556
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:27,240
then we ought to try to arm no transfer
all

557
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:31,130
some alarm me to bring it up payloads
others like straight from a dust cloud

558
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:31,900
just to see

559
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:36,880
how to solutions would react to that
then of course we had some more

560
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:41,470
custom Colt arm the from our perspective
most suited to evaluate

561
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:45,899
a hotel solutions are working so for
example we had a

562
00:31:45,899 --> 00:31:49,490
custom any cuts clone which was used to
dump Windows credentials

563
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:54,200
on then we had a very simple our utility
that was just

564
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:57,789
adding a binary to the through windows
are all to run

565
00:31:57,789 --> 00:32:02,159
then we had a for the bus and the bus
downloading a Python script

566
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:06,990
and writing that one to autorun then we
had a fire that was reading that the

567
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:08,039
backup some file

568
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:11,120
on posting it to an HTTP so a bomb

569
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:15,019
and we actually had a a powershell
script that was a keylogger

570
00:32:15,019 --> 00:32:18,860
and all the posts that the lock keys to
a central so I want

571
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:22,080
um and we had a custom rear of show

572
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:26,710
not from me just like this time arm
because really wanted to see how they

573
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:27,860
were doing without

574
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:32,630
then um this is not really fitting in
here very well

575
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:37,190
since its so no like basically the
capability to detect command and control

576
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:37,899
traffic

577
00:32:37,899 --> 00:32:42,980
because both Lexus Kayla and fire I also
saying OK we ought to detect various

578
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:45,139
kinds of command and control traffic

579
00:32:45,139 --> 00:32:48,450
so we decided okay we can at least give
that a very basic try

580
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:52,760
I've to claim so we can evaluate that
some

581
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:56,610
here's the tricky part in the Ville
evaluation of this

582
00:32:56,610 --> 00:33:00,130
if yes the typical summer service for at
least for the

583
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:04,080
fight I books they of our dedicated know
that missus books

584
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,210
vacant upload samples and they get
analized

585
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:10,820
so you get a basically a a meta-analysis
report

586
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:13,980
about the binary that you just upload
however

587
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:17,630
if you have to typical box in your butt
environment

588
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:20,980
on that is running in proxy mode
although this on

589
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:24,320
I analyzing the attachments to come in

590
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:29,250
come in via email um is really difficult
because fight I only did take

591
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:33,139
only tells you what is to take that so
if something is not showing up as

592
00:33:33,139 --> 00:33:33,870
malicious

593
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:38,799
others like really difficult to see a
kid most if I i working properly

594
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:42,860
well that's just not detector or what is
the particular reason that we don't have

595
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:45,110
enough not yet in the web interface now

596
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:51,110
so um basically had to do this in a
black box assessment since we did

597
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:54,450
not X is to let the sauce called some
internal documentation

598
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:56,320
so we drive which to

599
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:00,769
put together like a a solid a statement
about the combat capabilities of those

600
00:34:00,769 --> 00:34:01,509
solutions

601
00:34:01,509 --> 00:34:06,230
on without on be a member just making
speculations

602
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:09,329
and not having reliable our results so

603
00:34:09,329 --> 00:34:12,720
fortify I what we did as you can see him
um

604
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:16,280
the work autos the relevant time to work
out a means a binary im

605
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:21,119
that is about to be processed in a
sandbox so if you download a file

606
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:25,500
and 10 seconds after that you see that
there's a work on a running

607
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:29,199
you know a good this fight was just
passed to analysis

608
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:32,780
we have cause I was isolated that that
we have a dedicated notebook

609
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:37,000
the beach just use Juno on to download
files and not do anything else

610
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,879
are was as a linux-based as it was no
pic wrong most likely would have on a

611
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:44,599
Mac or something like that um

612
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:48,010
so basically just approach to be used in
order to analyze stuff

613
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:52,220
when it comes to cease get up it's
actually really nice because it tells

614
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:53,950
you what is sensed analysis

615
00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:57,690
and what it doesn't even look at all so

616
00:34:57,690 --> 00:35:01,500
here we had some more insights and and
and what was detected or not but this

617
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,950
also only holds true

618
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:07,140
for files if the would be like an
embedded flash file

619
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:11,119
it sorry more difficult of a command and
control traffic and other doesn't tell

620
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:11,680
you

621
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:15,810
on across we didn't we did not detect
that are not classify it as militias

622
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:18,950
just a somewhat difficult to do so

623
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:22,300
when looking at that both solutions

624
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:25,579
of I like a very very distinct a process
of analysis

625
00:35:25,579 --> 00:35:29,230
so fast the fall on the intercept the
five in the back traffic

626
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:32,270
and then they have a built-in AV
Solutions I'll

627
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:36,010
just traditional signature-based
anti-virus um

628
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:40,099
if the Tigers militias of closets are
classified as malicious

629
00:35:40,099 --> 00:35:43,329
if not we go on to check the file type

630
00:35:43,329 --> 00:35:47,910
so do we have a known if I type that we
can analyze this is an Execute above

631
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:49,599
file it as a PDF document

632
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:52,670
is this anything that we support for
another sis

633
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:57,750
if not I mean doesn't mean that it's
been nine but from the attack a

634
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:59,510
perspective that's where you wanna go

635
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:03,180
you don't want the send pics to analyze
that because that means I get nothing

636
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:07,380
can be detected here

637
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:11,130
it's the file type that we can analyze
deposit over to the behavior-based

638
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:15,290
analysis I was somewhat difficult to
find I can for that so that's a hamster

639
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:15,850
in the

640
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:19,090
and the little wheel on just to make
this motley up

641
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:22,790
and then a behavior-based analyst
analysis of cost to its okay that's a

642
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:23,660
malicious file

643
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:27,680
audits not a malicious file so that's
the basic options that we have

644
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,970
it can be detected by and it but
anti-virus solution

645
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:34,460
all it can be detected by the behavior
based analysis

646
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:38,630
and of cause if we can determine that
it's always interesting to see whether

647
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:39,810
it was handed

648
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:43,780
to the behavior based analysis at all so
we see whether it was analyzed

649
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:47,610
so %uh let's have a look at the results
so far

650
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:51,540
so I gonna make those like a little bit
faster those are like actually a pretty

651
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:52,710
samples from

652
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:56,980
two to three years ago so of course all
of those by the tech that

653
00:36:56,980 --> 00:37:01,050
are funnily enough they will all hand
that to the behavior-based

654
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:05,140
analysis solution but they detect that
those as malicious

655
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:09,830
so when it comes to pick up following up
though

656
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:13,330
first interesting result not analyzed at
all

657
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:18,840
so they don't support the analysis of
pick-up fights arm

658
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:23,130
this is let me not too surprising none
of the men this is claiming that

659
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:27,710
that they analyze copycat fires but from
all perspectives

660
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:31,290
if you have are attack earlier this

661
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:36,010
putting some fr into getting into your
network and you want to target

662
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:40,410
network administrators from my
perspective it would not be as such a

663
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:41,780
crazy idea to

664
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:45,090
create a spoof male that has a pick-up
file attached

665
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:48,880
like oh I was running into some problems
with the network is a network pump could

666
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:49,860
you have a look at that

667
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:54,760
on I would think that's the bed at the
Technic to on its not analyze but those

668
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,820
solutions at all

669
00:37:55,820 --> 00:38:00,110
then what do we have here we have an RTF
I

670
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:03,280
for just the plane fire that the slum

671
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,330
open by some kind of at the top um

672
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:10,380
fly I detect that this and the
behavior-based way old by the way was I

673
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:11,440
was wrong on

674
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:15,010
the bus of course are like at the end
anti-virus engine that detective that

675
00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:15,550
sorry

676
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:21,290
I am but a in this case RTF I was not
analyzed

677
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:24,380
um but however some hi I detect that
this

678
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:27,500
by the behavior based solution so are
that although

679
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:30,540
think about that for a second we have
like a

680
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:33,970
Metasploit module from 2014 and fire

681
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:37,240
I needs to behavior based analysis and
shin in order to detect that

682
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:41,240
at other kind of an interesting
statement I mean I needed to be able the

683
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:44,630
disable the Windows Security Essentials
downloading does are

684
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:49,510
think that's a pretty strong statement
here so

685
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:52,510
um another interesting thing

686
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:56,030
Flash Player 5 2014

687
00:38:56,030 --> 00:39:01,350
was not analyzed by fire I it was
detected by the anti-virus engine of

688
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:01,970
Cisco

689
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:05,130
next one Metasploit PDF

690
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:08,820
2013 both

691
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:11,950
of those solutions have to give it to
the behavior behavioral

692
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:15,570
another solution but then they also
detected both like

693
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:20,860
and are in state though on so they did
not like you feel like you're completely

694
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:23,470
wrecked exclamation mark that this is
totally militias

695
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:26,720
but but they detected it done

696
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:30,340
with the Photoshop file they also did
not analyze start

697
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:34,930
for the shop home might be like a a
personal thing

698
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:38,410
I would think it's less likely that
Photoshop files Houston pick-up fights

699
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:40,080
but again that might be a personal thing

700
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:43,350
there are probably some users in your
network that use Photoshop

701
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:48,920
so when we're looking at all the
persistence mechanisms

702
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:52,290
now here's the interesting part so

703
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:55,710
one of the user's downloads and execute
a book from the internet

704
00:39:55,710 --> 00:40:01,070
thus trying to create a local user
account would you like that in your

705
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:01,750
network

706
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:06,400
okay yes no questions to an audience is
always bad who would like that in his

707
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,260
to network okay

708
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:13,450
none of you at this this time I
formulated that the right way

709
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:16,570
you want it the other way on who would
not like that in the network

710
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:20,260
and you exchange a

711
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:26,290
summer should download that from the
internet

712
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:27,010
that's

713
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:31,290
okay I agree from that's a valid point

714
00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:35,740
arm I V mister I Q okay um this like one
case

715
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:42,550
arm does that apply to all of the office
use a song up

716
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:45,840
this is actually very it

717
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:50,010
what it boils down to this a slut
probably in ninety five percent of the

718
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:50,700
cases

719
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:54,300
something that you don't want but how is
the solution

720
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:57,410
how is it supposed to tell about on

721
00:40:57,410 --> 00:41:01,050
this was actually like part of the
conclusion that I want to make on

722
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:04,280
because it's like impel impossible to
tell banisters legitimate and when is it

723
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:04,880
not

724
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:09,530
arm I will also be surprised to
interested to see statistics how of miss

725
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:12,550
someone downloading a binary from the
internet that is adding user

726
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:15,560
on a whole lot

727
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:20,670
the I think that's not a good thing to
do and actually be used my this very

728
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:23,070
binary and several penetration tests are

729
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:27,600
in order to get to access to a system so
at least we can say this is like a bill

730
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,680
at the technique to a

731
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:33,560
sorry coming up

732
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:36,880
okay but so

733
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:41,110
what a bf we have some element of blood
samples and this is where I'm

734
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:45,320
actually a bit cautious here several
Metasploit so the the me to bring the

735
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:45,890
stuff

736
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:50,320
um was not analyzed not detected by the
fire II

737
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:53,330
I would be really surprised if that were
true so

738
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:56,720
um this might be something I'll

739
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:00,340
we did not completely understand the
fire solutions or something like that

740
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:03,990
um however we got from a customer
context that they experienced at one

741
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:04,490
time

742
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:08,820
and the response from fire I was all of
us accidentally whitelisted internally

743
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:15,230
um however I have gone put this like in
a transparent mode I don't want to use

744
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:16,070
this as a lake

745
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:19,810
hot statement that fires not able to
detect media Preet I would be

746
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:23,040
too surprised and shocked by that on

747
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,190
however sees go to detect that that with
anti-virus are

748
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:29,430
engine some what do we have

749
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:32,650
something that does credentials

750
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:37,040
interesting thing detect that by the
behavior based analysis solution

751
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:41,000
so this stuff stumping Windows
credentials

752
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,320
do you have any idea why

753
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:47,880
this other stuff was detected by the
behaviour any guess

754
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:51,140
I'm enough cuz it's obvious because it
doesn't mean those credentials however

755
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:52,010
despite Maria

756
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:57,280
requires my a common plan parameter so
it was detected because it was showing

757
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:00,160
suspicious suspicious activity but not
doing anything

758
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,470
so that's why was detected here arm

759
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:06,740
we will we will come back to that later

760
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:10,630
so um when it comes to the persistence
mechanism

761
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:13,880
writing stuff to autorun um

762
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:17,180
Seascale actually does too writing
something to autorun

763
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:21,660
and downloading something in writing it
to order on detected it using anti-virus

764
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:22,390
solution

765
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:27,870
much was like really interesting on but
then again fight I gave touch

766
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:33,300
into the on analysis paid your best
analysis solution and said okay that's

767
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:34,190
not malicious

768
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:38,860
and again same thing applies their up
probably like actually owes a lot of

769
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:39,980
into the problem a

770
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:43,130
meh on programs out there arm

771
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:46,580
that are using this functionality is
less difficult to do but

772
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:49,810
when we come to the next one a binary in
that

773
00:43:49,810 --> 00:43:54,280
is stumping the back up some file and
posting it by HTTP

774
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:57,640
arm to the Internet I was both

775
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:01,110
sent into the behavior based analysis
solution but now

776
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:05,290
that's not malicious here is a very
difficult

777
00:44:05,290 --> 00:44:09,890
the tele y however this is like other
another part of the conclusion

778
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:13,700
and this will be a long one of the next
slide still solutions are really good

779
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:17,660
arm in detecting like the company to
take part of but once you start using

780
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:18,510
only

781
00:44:18,510 --> 00:44:22,390
a single a tech primitives arm

782
00:44:22,390 --> 00:44:25,850
very good arm chance to get through

783
00:44:25,850 --> 00:44:31,510
so hope this is actually wrong are not
as a slight mistake sorry for that none

784
00:44:31,510 --> 00:44:32,470
of the solutions

785
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:35,720
are actually a are looks partial files

786
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:39,600
the partial five just not analyzed um

787
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:44,049
I'm there are some limitations on the No
systems in order to

788
00:44:44,049 --> 00:44:48,219
no 'em execute PowerShell scripts from
untrusted salsas

789
00:44:48,219 --> 00:44:52,650
are but a how ever life you're targeting
administrators were probably working

790
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:56,199
a lot with PowerShell scripts arm

791
00:44:56,199 --> 00:44:59,920
at might be always an interesting attack
path to look into especially if you like

792
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:00,819
a properly

793
00:45:00,819 --> 00:45:04,529
engine yet social social engineering
email and

794
00:45:04,529 --> 00:45:08,410
what this binary assuming I was looking
your keystrokes and posting it to us all

795
00:45:08,410 --> 00:45:13,109
arm but basically it wasn't analyzed on

796
00:45:13,109 --> 00:45:16,539
and i think im did anyone attend the
book for Polish overhead Gus

797
00:45:16,539 --> 00:45:19,599
pretty sure you saw nasty stuff that you
can do with partial

798
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:22,660
on basically you can use the whole
Windows API from there

799
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:26,529
so I'll be good to go to do anything
alright

800
00:45:26,529 --> 00:45:30,890
burn up me to bring the reverse HTTP
traffic was much was the only thing that

801
00:45:30,890 --> 00:45:33,269
we tested for command and control
traffic

802
00:45:33,269 --> 00:45:36,420
years is that okay come under control
traffic but is that basically

803
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:39,359
transferring data so we felt okay we do
something well known

804
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:43,160
I was detected by fire I but
unfortunately not by Seascale

805
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:47,689
on other or something that surprised us
but

806
00:45:47,689 --> 00:45:50,819
mom I would you want to detect something
that comes from it just light

807
00:45:50,819 --> 00:45:54,660
then how r custom

808
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:57,929
are reversed show both had to send this

809
00:45:57,929 --> 00:46:01,219
into behavior-based analysis which is a
good by

810
00:46:01,219 --> 00:46:05,829
sign for a lot with to be honest and
fire I detected this to be malicious

811
00:46:05,829 --> 00:46:09,140
um Seascale however slight nope

812
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:12,160
that's not malicious so

813
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:16,420
basically when the like one you'd slight
where we see all the results next to

814
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:17,009
each other

815
00:46:17,009 --> 00:46:20,670
um but some observations that I also
want to make here

816
00:46:20,670 --> 00:46:23,959
they're up sudden attack primitive out
there that can

817
00:46:23,959 --> 00:46:27,569
definitely you be used by and take a
creating issues on the local system

818
00:46:27,569 --> 00:46:31,189
posting certain date up to some Southern
the Internet

819
00:46:31,189 --> 00:46:34,819
but they just do not resemble the
company to take part

820
00:46:34,819 --> 00:46:39,229
file is downloaded credentials are done
to all over binary is

821
00:46:39,229 --> 00:46:42,920
loaded through to exploit and written to
disk then something X

822
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:47,130
is accessed and then X would rate at so
when it comes to this complete a tech

823
00:46:47,130 --> 00:46:48,920
park those solutions

824
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:52,479
but probably detect that stuff if you
give it into the sent box

825
00:46:52,479 --> 00:46:56,660
then they would probably detect this
whole complete a tech park

826
00:46:56,660 --> 00:47:00,550
but the new US different a tech
primitives on

827
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:04,360
in order to stay under the radar and
there's a very good chance that it won't

828
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:06,090
be detected by the solutions

829
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:10,720
but this is like one fast conclusion
here however I'll

830
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,980
arm in the week 12 like percent that in
the

831
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:19,970
in a neutral way arm and like my just
tell you okay what are those solutions

832
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:21,530
capable to do and what not

833
00:47:21,530 --> 00:47:25,790
it would not be an extra troopers talk
on if you would not have a generic

834
00:47:25,790 --> 00:47:27,540
bypass possibility for that stuff

835
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:30,840
so if you remember this PDF document

836
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:34,610
it was to document the PDF document
generated with Metasploit

837
00:47:34,610 --> 00:47:38,500
that was detected by both solutions arm

838
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:41,850
basically it was behavior-based by fire
I am was like

839
00:47:41,850 --> 00:47:45,240
orange and sees get us that ok 87
percent

840
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:48,450
suspicious which is OK

841
00:47:48,450 --> 00:47:52,590
if you coming back to like the complete
a tech path this PDF document

842
00:47:52,590 --> 00:47:55,820
and exploit on was executed

843
00:47:55,820 --> 00:47:58,900
okay we don't see that here but both of
them detected heap spraying

844
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:02,400
and then %uh something is happening on
the system

845
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:06,580
in this case rebirth show pops up it was
not to complete the tech path

846
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:10,270
drawn the products perspective so that
exploit

847
00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:13,860
was like successful something was
happening but the something that was

848
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:15,210
happening was not

849
00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:18,700
the typical load up that would like get
the actual payload

850
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:21,770
in order to make that thing persistent
was just

851
00:48:21,770 --> 00:48:27,030
opening a reverse show so no file was
downloaded no 5 was written to operon

852
00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:30,560
something like that so that's the stuff
that you would need in order to come

853
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:34,630
are to become like a rat up to a hundred
percent a lot

854
00:48:34,630 --> 00:48:37,830
some I took this PDF document

855
00:48:37,830 --> 00:48:41,329
because I still working in like arm

856
00:48:41,329 --> 00:48:44,829
Acrobat Reader versions that are like
are sufficiently

857
00:48:44,829 --> 00:48:50,069
um recent sufficient enough to see that
in some corporate environments and

858
00:48:50,069 --> 00:48:55,230
what we did it's basically create a
small exe file that just let go on

859
00:48:55,230 --> 00:49:00,730
and execute a book on Kevin a Terps this
file with the PDF document

860
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:04,109
which generates nother PDF document

861
00:49:04,109 --> 00:49:08,609
so windows will open this as a PDF
because I still open a stuff

862
00:49:08,609 --> 00:49:11,670
purely based on the file extension
however

863
00:49:11,670 --> 00:49:16,039
what both solutions are doing de cero
way to look at the head on that's about

864
00:49:16,039 --> 00:49:17,030
the PE file

865
00:49:17,030 --> 00:49:20,619
so we handed over to the behavior
analysis and

866
00:49:20,619 --> 00:49:25,950
we will analyze that as an execute a
bill and as we can see

867
00:49:25,950 --> 00:49:30,819
that's a completely B-nine file because
it's not executed as a PDF document

868
00:49:30,819 --> 00:49:34,099
so you can see it in the screenshots of
course all those

869
00:49:34,099 --> 00:49:37,690
are solution provides screenshot so you
can see that an exe file

870
00:49:37,690 --> 00:49:41,450
and execute a bolus copied are to the
sent box and then executed

871
00:49:41,450 --> 00:49:46,660
and it's the same result on feiyr I but
others like basically once in every

872
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:51,130
bypass a mechanism for also solutions
and that's basically all that only thing

873
00:49:51,130 --> 00:49:52,170
be really looked at

874
00:49:52,170 --> 00:49:55,190
because we are more interested in
providing you some inside

875
00:49:55,190 --> 00:49:59,529
but those solutions can do and what they
can't do some

876
00:49:59,529 --> 00:50:03,410
arm some conclusions arm

877
00:50:03,410 --> 00:50:07,849
what does detect that I already talked a
little bit about that

878
00:50:07,849 --> 00:50:11,190
the solutions were pretty good at like
detecting the complete a tech path

879
00:50:11,190 --> 00:50:15,190
as I called it exploit this happening
something is downloaded in some things

880
00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:15,730
written

881
00:50:15,730 --> 00:50:20,089
to all the run mechanism all I think the
important

882
00:50:20,089 --> 00:50:23,250
step at least from the estimations to be
got here is

883
00:50:23,250 --> 00:50:26,270
that they need to be an exploit and the
binary needs to be downloaded and the

884
00:50:26,270 --> 00:50:27,890
binary needs to be executed

885
00:50:27,890 --> 00:50:31,640
that's actually what those solutions are
like really specialized in detecting and

886
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:33,990
arm

887
00:50:33,990 --> 00:50:37,490
as the company to take part exfiltration
was ordered Metasploit

888
00:50:37,490 --> 00:50:40,520
madame interpreter traffic was detected
arm

889
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:44,730
so that might be detectable traditional
member behavior

890
00:50:44,730 --> 00:50:48,290
is also detected like writing to all the
run some of the

891
00:50:48,290 --> 00:50:52,980
Seascale at least thought it was a good
idea to not let applications right stuff

892
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:54,460
to our to order on

893
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:59,730
and but we also need to keep in mind
half the deployment scenario in mind

894
00:50:59,730 --> 00:51:03,750
fifty percent of the apts in areas that
we looked at

895
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:08,730
when not based on this this user base
infection at all

896
00:51:08,730 --> 00:51:13,710
so if you have to stuff deployed in a in
a in a proxy way I inspecting your email

897
00:51:13,710 --> 00:51:14,400
traffic

898
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:17,670
you will not get fifty percent of the
stuff that's going on

899
00:51:17,670 --> 00:51:20,960
like I compromising some crappy that
application

900
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:25,000
arm and then hopping through your
network from there not saying here you

901
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,900
should buy replication five what's okay

902
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:30,569
just to make sure so those

903
00:51:30,569 --> 00:51:33,650
things on the other not really
context-aware as was that like

904
00:51:33,650 --> 00:51:37,309
might be a perfectly valid to work that
is creating and that is

905
00:51:37,309 --> 00:51:41,960
additional use i Kant but mine on my
regular users downloading

906
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:45,069
this binary from the internet I don't
think it's a good idea that this binary

907
00:51:45,069 --> 00:51:47,390
should create a user account on your
system

908
00:51:47,390 --> 00:51:51,890
so there's like no context awareness um

909
00:51:51,890 --> 00:51:55,210
so somewhat concluding that can

910
00:51:55,210 --> 00:51:58,670
compliment your traditional anti-virus
solutions but

911
00:51:58,670 --> 00:52:01,799
what a surprise it's not a silver pilot
I don't think anyone

912
00:52:01,799 --> 00:52:05,599
of you expect that that but we hope we
can provide you some results along

913
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:08,710
if you have to I Q about that internally
but

914
00:52:08,710 --> 00:52:12,880
from our perspective the most relevant
pine and this is where I can come back

915
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,170
to my exercising story from the
beginning

916
00:52:15,170 --> 00:52:19,829
I once you look behind all the marketing
slights and what the different solutions

917
00:52:19,829 --> 00:52:20,780
can do for you

918
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:24,069
it comes down to dis a pic some
exercises

919
00:52:24,069 --> 00:52:27,829
that you have good shit technique with
him that you have like operational

920
00:52:27,829 --> 00:52:28,710
experience with

921
00:52:28,710 --> 00:52:32,990
and just progress those to some small
compliment stuff on the site and it

922
00:52:32,990 --> 00:52:33,450
works

923
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:36,950
so um other quoting like Alex

924
00:52:36,950 --> 00:52:40,619
Alex Thomas from his keynote build your
solutions don't buy them

925
00:52:40,619 --> 00:52:46,180
if you buy them make sure that you are
implement the supporting process

926
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:50,660
like um all those nice solutions on talk
it had one in the

927
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:55,099
infamous breach um other solutions do
not help if no one is looking at the

928
00:52:55,099 --> 00:52:57,740
lots nobody's is working with the
results

929
00:52:57,740 --> 00:53:02,720
this is all like some some universal
truth on that we always share again W

930
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:07,460
and going well with this on you should
definitely evaluate the benefit of like

931
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:07,819
a

932
00:53:07,819 --> 00:53:11,990
100 K perscription per year for like
this advanced threat intelligence feet

933
00:53:11,990 --> 00:53:16,900
that does not think that posting to them
5-2 a southern the internet as malicious

934
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:21,140
up losses an additional person that this
just reading your cock fights or

935
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:22,039
something like that

936
00:53:22,039 --> 00:53:27,569
so this was basically my conclusion on
those APT protection solutions

937
00:53:27,569 --> 00:53:31,150
arm any questions for that yeah

938
00:53:31,150 --> 00:53:38,080
for

939
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:45,080
yeah

940
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:03,530
I mean the moon IFE never seen such a
deployment

941
00:54:03,530 --> 00:54:07,810
basically I'm in FY I based on the
product part for your day of our

942
00:54:07,810 --> 00:54:11,730
solutions to do that they can inspect
the traffic email traffic in the nose

943
00:54:11,730 --> 00:54:12,570
like the network

944
00:54:12,570 --> 00:54:16,190
intrusion detection system whose
particular Monday monitoring the chasm

945
00:54:16,190 --> 00:54:17,060
BXs

946
00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:22,850
up

947
00:54:22,850 --> 00:54:26,070
okay matzah that's an additional problem

948
00:54:26,070 --> 00:54:30,630
agree on that um big problem is also
does

949
00:54:30,630 --> 00:54:34,000
solutions might be able to provide you
some benefit now that you know what they

950
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:34,740
are doing

951
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:38,140
the big problem is also like the
marketing stuff behind that they promise

952
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:40,490
like complete APTN 0 they detection

953
00:54:40,490 --> 00:54:45,520
and that promise just can't hold true in
this is not a surprise for you

954
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:48,530
but now you have some data to back that
yes

955
00:54:48,530 --> 00:54:54,340
no we did not be actually have some

956
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:58,430
we have so as some ideas for that but we
did not do that yet since our focus was

957
00:54:58,430 --> 00:55:01,320
not on by passing but on understanding
how to stuff works

958
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:05,320
used no

959
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:09,650
we did not we had mainly at like those
like the commercial players in mind and

960
00:55:09,650 --> 00:55:13,460
since it was custom a project-based
experience for FY and Seascale up

961
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:17,120
it's like difficult to find all the
different deployments yeah

962
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:20,330
peek at interests

963
00:55:20,330 --> 00:55:24,670
all it was like straight from adult
blood

964
00:55:24,670 --> 00:55:30,650
is up

965
00:55:30,650 --> 00:55:36,130
all arm

966
00:55:36,130 --> 00:55:40,249
does actually good question I would need
to look into more detail see is what you

967
00:55:40,249 --> 00:55:43,400
mean by that you can send the network
packet and by a strike sniffs that and

968
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:44,200
then crush us

969
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:48,289
um up

970
00:55:48,289 --> 00:55:51,880
okay arm

971
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:55,609
I'm not sure what this exploit was
actually doing but there are like both

972
00:55:55,609 --> 00:55:56,430
wasn't up there

973
00:55:56,430 --> 00:56:02,369
yeah yes

974
00:56:02,369 --> 00:56:07,690
who'll

975
00:56:07,690 --> 00:56:14,089
said ok im

976
00:56:14,089 --> 00:56:17,869
I am I'm not aware that we are not using
that so that's all this on our own and

977
00:56:17,869 --> 00:56:18,259
the

978
00:56:18,259 --> 00:56:22,569
I haven't got that from custom us um if
the person agrees I can introduce you to

979
00:56:22,569 --> 00:56:23,479
some 12

980
00:56:23,479 --> 00:56:30,479
way exchange with on but we haven't got
something like that okay
