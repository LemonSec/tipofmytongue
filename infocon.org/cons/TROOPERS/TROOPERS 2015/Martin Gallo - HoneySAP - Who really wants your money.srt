7
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:27,480
honey but for SAP services so

00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,290
at Dutch and I will be I quick
introduction on the CBS would be

9
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:33,460
security what I

10
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:37,520
thing needs their car and and 3 the
landscape

11
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:43,719
area in a CBC stems I quick introduction
on hottie but I'm fine I will introduce

12
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:47,140
and the honey sup I Dept pro-child to

13
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:51,870
for will be the NDS I'm finishing with
some the mosque talking about some of

14
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:52,850
the challenges

15
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:54,850
I have been

16
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:58,560
while working on peace on also a call
for contributions

17
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,730
on some conclusions so for

18
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:06,000
if death anyone that doesn't know what
SEBS

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,070
at Wally to suffer company its recent
Germany

20
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:13,070
I eat focus on business processes I'm
business so far

21
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:16,800
so most of the lash companies of the
were I

22
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,660
Ron their greedy got business process I

23
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:24,940
a up lead to SAP systems I

24
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:28,100
on at some point it's about money it's
it's where do it

25
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:31,180
company's money it's it's hardly so

26
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:35,649
at security miss it be if obviously a
big because of that

27
00:01:35,649 --> 00:01:39,610
I very air hi

28
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:42,970
a issue on a very important thing I

29
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:46,220
some other thing I forming a in there's

30
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:51,410
I'll his yeah

31
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:55,870
maybe at a lower

32
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:58,060
okay perfect I

33
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:02,100
so all while I think SIIA I think about

34
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,990
it's a good thing is a beast at it
requires a special light

35
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:11,170
Scio II calf the printer to run security

36
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:14,230
area in SABC's pent-up in

37
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:19,760
be no other environments so it requires
people very specialized on TS

38
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,900
it's also require some committed man
mostly from the management

39
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:30,010
because I when you are doing security in
SAP

40
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:33,269
you at some point coaching the critique
out process

41
00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:37,519
of of your company so either quite a lot
of commitment on

42
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,760
also you're quite the companies to have
a risk alter

43
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,590
to to have an understanding of of what
are they

44
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:49,220
actuaries your system RR are at some
point

45
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:52,830
and across so it's also about money

46
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:56,220
and because running all peace having a
special-use

47
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:00,299
and people working on these request
money having committed man

48
00:03:00,299 --> 00:03:03,890
also at some point require request money
so

49
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:09,579
%ah the picture of ASAP security and air
racing years

50
00:03:09,579 --> 00:03:12,730
I has been changing a

51
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:17,470
at least from from my spot standpoint
and he just started

52
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:21,630
fares after years ago a lot of years
actually but

53
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:24,630
most of the focus more on the user's

54
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:27,989
ossification up beauty is the roles on
the way

55
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:31,299
there users of the C stands access them

56
00:03:31,299 --> 00:03:34,430
I 10 this

57
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:37,920
this is started to mess up honey 11
companies

58
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,329
is start to to implement well large

59
00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:45,630
a amount of a users axis seen a CBC
stance

60
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:49,650
and that there was a need to at some
point out on my ties

61
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:51,070
I'm happy

62
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:55,420
softwares that air allows and companies
to check

63
00:03:55,420 --> 00:04:01,310
dose axis untended GRC wrap platforms at
some point I i rice

64
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:05,690
I more recently

65
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:09,900
and I start to see a lot of de France
approaches

66
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,040
for mine elitist the security on SAP

67
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,950
abdel of tools a lot of new attack back
to earth

68
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:21,680
I'm that involve us some point lot of
doors are often as you can

69
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,520
do for for testing and security in SAP
systems

70
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,430
and more recently some of the store
started to

71
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:33,950
to at some point to grow all I had to be
more out amazing

72
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:38,030
source so dead yet that now you have a
some band or so I

73
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:42,100
on the whole industry that allows you to
Rahsaan out a mayday

74
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:45,370
see it to this they had tools after
testing

75
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:51,500
your your recipe systems so each athlete
change and I i'm some point so

76
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:55,330
the main threats that I i seeee at that
affects

77
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:58,660
sabc staff first this complexity while

78
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:01,930
kerron mention it in in end it all but

79
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:05,220
a all the CBC stamps are really complex

80
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:08,230
I really big on

81
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:12,210
they are really complex on the
complexity at some point it's something

82
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:12,600
that

83
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,980
if he said trent and for for SEP also
customization

84
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:20,680
each system if the friend to to another
one so

85
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:24,390
you have the chance to customized I'll
be your uncle

86
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:27,690
hair upon it should be so it's also
about

87
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:32,860
also adds another layer of complexity to
the systems

88
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:35,600
I found a another thread if

89
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,430
the lack of knowledge at some point we

90
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:43,490
we are still well like in the AL East
ag's of

91
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:46,920
of now wean how to protect

92
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:50,740
our sabc stem pain in some point so

93
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:54,560
at the BCC Nami X if also something tat

94
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,920
at it's a threat for SAP system if you
want to the fastest them but

95
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,920
you can't it shutdown

96
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:05,730
for a few minutes to buy cheap at the
business the NYMEX

97
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:09,350
requires that a using usual fine

98
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:13,940
another way to of doing the slack maybe
in other environments are are more

99
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:14,470
leisure

100
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:18,480
so if this is something %uh also I

101
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:22,110
that it threats at some point ASAP I

102
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:25,590
so going to mara practica el

103
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:29,450
I are less abstract issues the threats

104
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:32,990
are obviously frog s been ash sabbath
dish

105
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:37,980
I'm obviously all the things that did
bad guys can doing on your sabc stems

106
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:42,160
I'm it's also a interesting that you
have to consider both

107
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,120
insiders an outsider's attacker a live
birth place

108
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:50,100
air this is also a something that he's

109
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,460
sometimes it's not and really cool air
in companies

110
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:57,910
and when they are focusing they are on
protecting the premature

111
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:01,410
I'm maybe not they saw their vectors

112
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:05,070
yeah Phil going to

113
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:08,620
i'm following with their threat
landscape yeah

114
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,340
well

115
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:13,220
I know that dot taggants attacks again

116
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:16,910
sabc stamp that has been known for years
I mean

117
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:21,650
a at some point anyone running SEP on a
large company

118
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:26,080
a staffer for for for some kind of
target attack

119
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,770
I I someone dared try the sham

120
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:32,840
Ian traditionally in in the sense that

121
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:36,880
at deaf actors are following their

122
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,440
stamps the usual step for for attack it
attack

123
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,650
I another thing is that

124
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:47,710
in most cases the targets are the
company's being target of

125
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:51,220
this kind of attacks a were now this
coaching data

126
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:55,510
about in there is a year there are some
kind of

127
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:58,800
I appearing on CS in meeting the media

128
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,960
I need this is also that at some point

129
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:06,300
chai change only to be date date last
Cape thrift landscape

130
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:12,140
yeah because other companies are no more
aware that they are being tagged for

131
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:16,920
for for this kind of attacks but all saw
we have a stat to seem

132
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:20,870
bro that tax or or at some point I
started to see

133
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:24,650
there so my fax that I remain for

134
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:29,550
for for both a sour face at like for
example from my war

135
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:33,400
looking for a CBS savvy césar SAP
software

136
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,400
yeah disease something

137
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:40,409
that happened a just after one or two
years ago

138
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:43,419
but for sample there were some my war
air

139
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:48,480
PCs got were looking for its Afghan East
LA shows

140
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,700
a in there were stations of the infected
users

141
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:54,820
so this something that at some point we
have to

142
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:58,020
take yeah I'm keeping time I'm because
yeah

143
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:01,620
its it's changing and in the way that

144
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:05,590
a the stock to be more calm on it will
be also another challenge

145
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:07,209
so

146
00:09:07,209 --> 00:09:10,759
what I thing also is that burlap sacks
will be proly

147
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:14,999
I mean I I don't think or I can be shown
on

148
00:09:14,999 --> 00:09:18,350
annisten idea where a Mar while

149
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:22,179
worry preteen exploit to a CBC sense
everywhere

150
00:09:22,179 --> 00:09:25,679
but yet I deem that it will be probably

151
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:28,819
you said ass an entry point for targets
attacks

152
00:09:28,819 --> 00:09:33,769
I mean running I'm our campaign thats
allow you to discover which use earth

153
00:09:33,769 --> 00:09:37,649
axis2 sabc stent I Los attackers

154
00:09:37,649 --> 00:09:40,730
to perform Mart agate attacks

155
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:45,959
against those users so fizzle and Cape
air

156
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:49,220
I its or composed by

157
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:53,209
to different types of attacks but ask as
I said I think that they are

158
00:09:53,209 --> 00:09:56,939
really connected mostly goes bro attacks

159
00:09:56,939 --> 00:10:00,019
bully probably use ass nooo reform

160
00:10:00,019 --> 00:10:04,509
more tag attacks so why do we have a

161
00:10:04,509 --> 00:10:08,069
and I think that we have some no ish
about

162
00:10:08,069 --> 00:10:12,819
what is going on on it'd be security and
what the attackers

163
00:10:12,819 --> 00:10:15,929
are doing I but both

164
00:10:15,929 --> 00:10:20,660
so that no ish its so what distributed I

165
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:24,259
an East distributed Nault I'm Aug

166
00:10:24,259 --> 00:10:27,709
a a very large our tenth but

167
00:10:27,709 --> 00:10:31,169
a pretty close one I and three ass which
is

168
00:10:31,169 --> 00:10:34,290
somewhere else has some more there

169
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:38,480
always always mention that there they
have people

170
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,389
disclose sheen actually funding will now
hear this in this EP

171
00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:45,910
eats it's close to I really

172
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:50,879
I really small number of companies so we
have some knowledge but it's distributed

173
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:55,799
in a small air amount of of people who
hospice no ish

174
00:10:55,799 --> 00:11:00,629
I at some point I think it did but I but
I think that we have

175
00:11:00,629 --> 00:11:04,959
some weak defenses at some point talking
with Castro marques

176
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:08,730
I always find that and there's at

177
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:12,119
i Laura room for improvement on

178
00:11:12,119 --> 00:11:15,529
anyone doing pen testing up sebe will
find that

179
00:11:15,529 --> 00:11:19,509
I from Boeing they will succeed and so

180
00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:23,829
what do we need I think that we need to
add we need to

181
00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:28,689
change the way we do security oh we def
and security

182
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:32,040
on this ABC stands but for

183
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:36,779
acting when you first 11-win we will I
actually haro now also

184
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:40,850
going to attach we can defend something
that we done on the stack

185
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:44,100
so yeah I think that we have to read our
how

186
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:47,730
attackers are hair doing the attacks

187
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:51,449
against are a CBC stems I we need to
share that information

188
00:11:51,449 --> 00:11:56,619
its it somewhat it will be really
difficult for you keep that information

189
00:11:56,619 --> 00:12:01,910
only on closer cycles so one of the
approach

190
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:05,939
of no way in at the way the attackers

191
00:12:05,939 --> 00:12:09,920
are performing attacks against different
systems

192
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,149
are horny both for anyone that does an
hour

193
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:16,449
what how anybody's its basically up

194
00:12:16,449 --> 00:12:20,610
piece of software whodunit were act that
right

195
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:24,850
to me Nick some actual systems Andre
course

196
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:28,790
and looks everything that happens so
they'd yes that

197
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:32,429
you could assist them like as a trap
attackers

198
00:12:32,429 --> 00:12:35,829
attacks though system and you gather all
the information

199
00:12:35,829 --> 00:12:39,370
about holiday it did so

200
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:42,529
Dara different horny but I'll

201
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:46,269
different types I with different goals I

202
00:12:46,269 --> 00:12:50,170
a different kind of implementations and
you can implement on a bus

203
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:53,249
in very different ways so

204
00:12:53,249 --> 00:12:57,020
it the title for the both a are

205
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:00,020
probably to actual brawley main

206
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:03,790
air categories up for

207
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:06,910
for a classifying the honeypot

208
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:12,440
the priest the interaction and you gotta
have on eBook at with a high interaction

209
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,240
with means

210
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:17,820
that the attacker can looking in to
assist them I'm perform some actions

211
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:21,170
I eat will see it like if it worth

212
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:25,410
I Rielle system I they can't complete

213
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:29,180
up 30 a from the beginning to the and

214
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:32,340
they're all there honey boats there are
aim out

215
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:36,100
a medium level interaction when you can
log into the system but

216
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:39,570
only perform some action i'll know more
time that

217
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:42,760
I always thought our no interaction a

218
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,190
base which means that you can spot the
service

219
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:49,510
you can perform some basic actions

220
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:54,000
I but you will probably won't be able to
login and

221
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,860
and I do candidacy STEMI feed was II
complete

222
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:02,980
implementation I I also know it I before
he bought

223
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:06,870
AI no category for honey but its its
base on the poppers

224
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:09,980
a you gotta have horny both aim at

225
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:14,030
research which means that and the idea
the main goal

226
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:17,450
he's too gathered information I

227
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:20,810
about new type of attacks on other ways
of attacks

228
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:25,070
to these services are you can have a
horny but

229
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:29,290
a minute hot I putting it on a
production at war

230
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:32,980
I some I'm for example gather
information on

231
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:36,280
more about their operation now air being

232
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:39,320
and more about the traffic its

233
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:43,050
it's receiving yeah but maybe doesn't
allow you to

234
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:46,260
to learn about new kind of attacks

235
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,620
it's more a mad air spot

236
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:53,589
information on known on tax against this
kind assistance

237
00:14:53,589 --> 00:14:55,480
so

238
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,680
I well I said dead even goals

239
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:03,149
but the the main one is that you got
information from my own ebook a

240
00:15:03,149 --> 00:15:06,170
peabody at some point and that yes to

241
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:11,019
you to obtain information about
attackers that also order honey boards

242
00:15:11,019 --> 00:15:14,990
a mob catching my war I am this is

243
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:18,560
every Lee interest in ion

244
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:23,019
eat has different implementations for
the from bridal shop from different type

245
00:15:23,019 --> 00:15:23,329
of

246
00:15:23,329 --> 00:15:28,740
of things there for example clients at
either a hottie boats that are

247
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:33,000
when clients that our downloading
estopped from

248
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,250
bad a jury else up by website I N

249
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:40,430
and records every teen and tries to
analyze their

250
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:45,640
them our date they got and they're all
horny boats a mob and say they are

251
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,860
distract just

252
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:50,700
the days to breed hair along with the
production at war

253
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:54,040
I so at some point attackers

254
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:58,529
eg got there I'm focused on that horse
that seems to be bondable

255
00:15:58,529 --> 00:16:02,149
I instead of attacking that the actual
the actual sister

256
00:16:02,149 --> 00:16:05,279
I'll obviously they're all our

257
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:09,310
hey goals and authorities you you can
you can think about

258
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:12,570
%ah but that didn't there's a lot of

259
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:16,070
horny boss actually and India

260
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:20,150
in the community top mostly focus on

261
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:24,140
Markham ont protocols and services

262
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:27,700
I I i think that

263
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:31,060
this one which is really interesting
that because

264
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:34,700
its shares some of the goals we do one
died I tried to be a

265
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:40,600
at which is calm but he eats there but
he said I i miss cale ICS

266
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,980
a honeypot I and implements

267
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:48,550
and for example from Scott a pro to both
well for

268
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:51,760
broke off our industry I'll control
systems

269
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,760
I am I well

270
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:58,700
they are all the earth a mob ass say
have a fb

271
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:02,340
8gb art client-side added be

272
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:06,390
its for different options you can you
can use

273
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:10,330
so ball

274
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:15,300
at the goal of this dog is to introduce
honey sup and we just did it

275
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,510
there be so funny but I I tried to to BL

276
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:21,880
the bridge I do worse to be a lot allow
interaction

277
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:26,120
honey pot up building in hi

278
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:29,910
or medium interaction holy book for is
to be will be something

279
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:33,170
really challenging the ghosts the
services

280
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:38,070
I and the interfaces I really complex
I'll need something that

281
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:41,570
it worry kinda lot of airport

282
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:45,200
I love of engineering I on

283
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,840
at some point I don't think that it at

284
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:53,760
this a stage and it will be a good idea
to put that day for

285
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,990
on on on building I interaction

286
00:17:56,990 --> 00:18:02,080
a or made any traction honey but I stay
I prefer to focus

287
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,860
are see what happens one at Dec Packers

288
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:10,020
see the services and did here try to
catch the fiercest

289
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:13,040
steps of of the attacks yeah

290
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,710
also its research sentry mostly because

291
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:20,010
air he is one of the first one

292
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:24,040
I am NOT sabc stems on we'd

293
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:27,460
don't have a cell much information about

294
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:33,740
how attackers I i doing agassi CPC
Central I think that their there

295
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:36,830
the main goal will be to to have some

296
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:40,010
hair Bible information about

297
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:44,330
how the attackers are are doing I

298
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:48,080
a wall another interesting I i think
that is one of their

299
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,330
most interesting one is that a that yes
that

300
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:55,830
this will be open source I this is an
important part because

301
00:18:55,830 --> 00:19:00,470
as they say I think that they've did
more Bible part of

302
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:04,110
running out of money a honeypot is to
share information

303
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:07,410
with the different parties so these be
an open-source

304
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:12,400
I loath anyone to contribute at to
extend it to try different approach

305
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,010
fun to try different things customized
it this of four

306
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:20,390
for running in their own net worth I and
tried to

307
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:23,550
to be a lack community of people willing
to contribute

308
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:27,160
I share all the information the gather

309
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:30,660
with this offer up both the goth

310
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:34,120
it obviously has a specific purpose

311
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:37,550
at our or our other a hottie both

312
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:41,160
that are Morgan outburst like for
example if you have a

313
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:46,470
aces sage a honeypot and eat something
that

314
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:52,500
it would catch at Naroff different kind
of attacks I i mean it's creepy is

315
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,110
trying to break for 14th

316
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:57,179
actual tag attacks

317
00:19:57,179 --> 00:20:00,540
looking at the information I have
company and tried to look to looking

318
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:04,640
in this case the goalies at that
discount to book

319
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,110
East it at a very specific purpose it
with chief

320
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:11,750
meek meek sabc ABC if I'll

321
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:15,910
they DS to identify it the behaviour

322
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:19,630
of the attackers on what day 21 they
found

323
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:23,460
sabc stance running somewhere I

324
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:27,510
I'll go least is that he will be
flexible

325
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:31,780
on but flexible I mean that that yes
that it will be ass

326
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:36,490
us self-contained as possible I'm a
slight wave as possible so

327
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:41,549
anyone can Ronnie in anywhere i mean for
example a company

328
00:20:41,549 --> 00:20:45,549
may have a like different branches their
branch offices

329
00:20:45,549 --> 00:20:49,460
and they want to put at one of these on
our raspberry be

330
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:54,950
I should be to one of their each one of
their offices for example on running on

331
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:55,809
internal med course

332
00:20:55,809 --> 00:20:58,960
its it's something Sat and eats

333
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,390
I goal from from from the knit deciding
Air Station

334
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:07,169
to to be the more flexible that

335
00:21:07,169 --> 00:21:10,580
it its possible I

336
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:14,330
another is a chilly the steady at that
here you can blog

337
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:18,120
new models on your services I N

338
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:22,700
they the ice that he would require at
some point and the less if or as

339
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,500
possible

340
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,559
to extend it or two to bill new things

341
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:31,460
yeah upon this up but I mean the sign

342
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:34,799
after a honeypot is that its

343
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:38,890
expandable added yes that you can at
services

344
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:43,610
are at feats feeds are the way you
shared information on

345
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:47,549
are you publish the information that the
antibodies collecting

346
00:21:47,549 --> 00:21:50,960
air so that yes that you can customize

347
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,700
and add new services or new ways to
publish

348
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:58,280
day at the information that they are
anybody's is logging

349
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,019
I

350
00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:04,070
another de facto voice that its Mahdi
lot if that you can polovina

351
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:07,919
cookout different components on their
side dynamic loader

352
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:11,009
I which Amy's to

353
00:22:11,009 --> 00:22:14,220
air load the different models

354
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:19,350
the different savviest I of chants at
base on

355
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:25,470
at the configuration a.m. humble also
the services

356
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:29,119
defeats I had at the store ismael you I
i will.

357
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:32,529
be take in more details about these
components

358
00:22:32,529 --> 00:22:36,119
in a few slight by the main idea is that

359
00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:40,070
okay you can a black enough

360
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:43,869
lookout different components of this 04
I

361
00:22:43,869 --> 00:22:47,039
another design decision on

362
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:50,509
is that air it should be easy to
configure it

363
00:22:50,509 --> 00:22:54,100
yeah I mean mosser of there

364
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:57,220
failures of some of the on a boat piece
that

365
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:00,649
Dr at some point difficult to config
your

366
00:23:00,649 --> 00:23:05,029
and dead yes that any walk and all night
and

367
00:23:05,029 --> 00:23:08,100
we'd of having a specific knowledge

368
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:12,580
Arora baby had no ish about SMB or about
on boats

369
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:15,909
air they gave that anyone can can run it

370
00:23:15,909 --> 00:23:20,240
acecomm figure so configuration its base
on

371
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,360
chase on or a JML

372
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:27,470
files say dead yes that you put all the
coach rationing if I i'm

373
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:31,799
its it read it I'm dead yet so should
the she beat

374
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:35,399
with some the full profile for example

375
00:23:35,399 --> 00:23:37,380
stand are and

376
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:42,540
net for scenarios yeah like an extent on
May 20 running 10 on that

377
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:47,450
I I know of that the Sangha loss

378
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:51,480
East at it should be easy to deploy it
yeah

379
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:55,340
I by piece and mean that

380
00:23:55,340 --> 00:24:00,040
a few having happy had dined at

381
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:03,770
configuring are deploying to sell our if
you need a lot of

382
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:06,870
dependencies you need to build Gaston

383
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:10,470
binaries obvious like dat it will be

384
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:14,300
kind of difficult to to have a massive
blow a man Arora

385
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:18,000
growth the bombing of this kind of so
far I

386
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,310
so I'm working on on having a up
background

387
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:25,360
I ass able a configuration

388
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,920
for deploying its at Paradiso for attack
I allows you to easily

389
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:33,180
air boot up

390
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:37,340
and p.m. hair brittle machines based on
my country a sham

391
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:40,340
I for example by running one come on

392
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:43,980
you can a start-up I

393
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:47,860
vehicle machine with all the
configuration on all the honey but come

394
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:49,300
together I i still there

395
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:52,620
and mostly for testing but also for
actual deployment

396
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:56,550
I ask the boys I tool for

397
00:24:56,550 --> 00:25:00,350
at the poor man distributed deployment
of

398
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:05,390
of different kind of so forth I so dead
yes that by combining

399
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:09,380
combining to this d 15th its elite II

400
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:14,360
at least I start for trying to EC day at
the boy I'm and

401
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:19,560
testing of this they sell for I also I'm
working on now darker

402
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,430
configuration with a thing it will be

403
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:25,990
nice of and because Italo issued to

404
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:29,750
also easily air was trapped and launch

405
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:35,800
I and he sounds of their of the iPod I

406
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,940
book dead architecture of the honeypot

407
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:42,470
it its base it's billed

408
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:46,100
on by some Python language I

409
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:49,790
if Bales based also on

410
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:53,570
II future libraries at the prettiest

411
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:57,380
G event which is fact call routine air

412
00:25:57,380 --> 00:26:00,700
courage in library attached hello to you
too

413
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:04,920
to implement computer and services I
it's

414
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:08,780
also reading by Don it's based on some
standout libraries of

415
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:13,170
afternoon the nukes had libraries

416
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:16,190
I the other main company

417
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:19,630
a library disease may sunny spice up
which is

418
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:23,790
at the library I percent at last year
it's basically

419
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:27,330
a library for crafting and accordion
pockets

420
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:30,390
on different and network protocols

421
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:34,030
specifics for for SATB at this is

422
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:38,250
at some point the result of some reverse
engineer work

423
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:42,230
II have been doing for for some of the
particles

424
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:45,890
I am an hour of their

425
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:49,440
libraries disease based upon his last
week he sat on a sh

426
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,570
the DB server for implementing the HDD

427
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:56,400
Sam PCs and for SAP at

428
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,630
so that car of the hani bought area is
based on

429
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:04,840
de France components at the main one is

430
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,680
I that the store manager this that mean
once are

431
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:12,070
at that the sum manager savviest us fish
on

432
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:15,310
I'm freed managers and they'd yes that

433
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:19,390
you gotta have talking about their feet
manager you gotta have

434
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:22,530
different ways of Polish the came from a
sham

435
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:24,030
I

436
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:28,260
two different feeds like for example
logging all the information in a

437
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:28,980
database

438
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:32,020
or sending it to i remote feel

439
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:35,760
are head throwing into the console or
anywhere

440
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:40,760
so there sa my major component that
handles or that stop there

441
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:44,800
the same for the service services
there's a serviceman share which

442
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,930
in church of loading and running all the
different services

443
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:51,660
you can configure I official my share
with cheese

444
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:54,820
at the one hand lean all that pac
Seychelles

445
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:58,540
that yes that anything it anytime tap

446
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:02,620
yes someone a Star Trek connection with
the on eBook

447
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:05,650
there sufficient create it and you can
track

448
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:08,830
all the interaction these client is

449
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:11,929
this its performance at throughout fish
on

450
00:28:11,929 --> 00:28:15,750
so everything is log a within the same
session

451
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:19,120
so you can you can track all all all the
things that

452
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:23,500
these it this attacker idiot I

453
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:27,800
and also a data store manager and
because said yes that

454
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:31,020
different services can modifier

455
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:34,420
information that share for example air

456
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:39,830
the if you have high this by charter be
switches serbian I'll gain

457
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:43,140
I on some all Aug 18th to

458
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:46,580
at but your service and change some
information

459
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:50,860
a this information should be reflected
at some point on all their services

460
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:54,260
if you are at some point at least in

461
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:58,970
the clients that I connected today said
BC stem at this crime should be

462
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:02,040
appear on the other therapies so the
idea is to have %ah

463
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:05,350
like I kind of data store that and I'll

464
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:09,420
different services to share information
I'm store information

465
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:11,640
I

466
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,490
however and there are some utility have

467
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:18,830
objects slide loggers their class till
there's

468
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:21,830
on hold the handling of their the
conflagration I'm

469
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:25,280
ubuntu is that the different reads
implementation

470
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:28,530
I I said you can knock

471
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:33,200
every team to our database today Troy to
the console owing to a fire

472
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,830
arts and the need to HPP its appt
thought

473
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:39,890
I very stand are feed system

474
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:45,540
half or defriend honey pot and they'd be
a step he said distributed model when

475
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:48,960
hair different clients can subscribe to

476
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,480
s South Korea suscribete I'm published
to

477
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,710
the same channels so that yes that hey

478
00:29:55,710 --> 00:30:00,350
you can subscribe to our channel and
anytime that honey bought some were

479
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:04,460
publish information to that channel you
can get all day of defeat:

480
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:08,120
so the idea East that you can easily
share

481
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:11,250
a information I am sure what is going on
on

482
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:16,190
on the different I put I'll blood the
last part

483
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:19,070
air

484
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:20,590
I ralph their

485
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:24,619
I could take to beat her and I i the
services Issa's

486
00:30:24,619 --> 00:30:27,879
they share I acecomm on datastore

487
00:30:27,879 --> 00:30:31,139
I on de nada de France services

488
00:30:31,139 --> 00:30:34,919
and that are implemented or can be
implemented sewed

489
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:38,200
this is the whole am feature of dacyczyn

490
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:44,580
I could enter I why I say that the a
staff did a test or

491
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:48,179
shares information on any service can
hair

492
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:51,580
puts the something that it should be
reflected

493
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:55,460
on the other wants I for example the
message server

494
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:58,679
hair East and a CB service that

495
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:02,200
you can create the least of clients that
I connected

496
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:06,629
a so if at some point some other
services

497
00:31:06,629 --> 00:31:11,259
hello games akele I and it should be
reflected on on that service

498
00:31:11,259 --> 00:31:16,080
are are if you can trigger at this to be
the environment with different

499
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,919
sabu fancies or different clients a.m.

500
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:23,559
that should be also reflective on some
of the other services

501
00:31:23,559 --> 00:31:26,799
so we get the ice that he saw keystore

502
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:30,609
hair key value star I

503
00:31:30,609 --> 00:31:34,730
on any service com push are are of
popping from a shout from

504
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:39,399
from there I about the services

505
00:31:39,399 --> 00:31:42,899
but thats song that are HTTP base

506
00:31:42,899 --> 00:31:47,239
I I see am is is here it the first
example

507
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:50,869
which is I Gondar Severus a

508
00:31:50,869 --> 00:31:54,159
SAP implemented based on on HTTP

509
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:57,159
II needa loath different kind of

510
00:31:57,159 --> 00:32:00,909
I Severus East to be Ron

511
00:32:00,909 --> 00:32:05,669
upon and Dez and this one Adam is a
server is

512
00:32:05,669 --> 00:32:09,340
another component that house an HTTP
interface for

513
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:13,289
and for example when clients are looking
into an SABC stem

514
00:32:13,289 --> 00:32:16,799
at they loud there nobatoshi information

515
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:18,750
from the service

516
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:21,940
that by a single minded HTTP I

517
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:26,020
the social web dispatcher say beef that
and you can put

518
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:29,600
like and your DMC I on

519
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:33,820
i no external users to access internal
HDD be services

520
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:37,630
and disc also can be implemented on a
boat

521
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:42,220
I am well for example their NetWeaver
gateway which is a service

522
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:45,230
I for implementing and air

523
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:48,460
web services I'll I what they are

524
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:51,940
all their services top our base on bicep
higher

525
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:56,220
Bay some binary protocols for example
the sub router

526
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:59,390
and missus sabir it has a a

527
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:04,110
a binary protocol saw the dispatcher
service which is this everyday use when

528
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:04,990
you look and

529
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:08,710
and the Gateway air which is the one
handling RFC

530
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:12,790
RC communications and things like that
so that yes that

531
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:16,380
there a police I a big distinction on

532
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:20,550
on geese to different kind of s every
sees and implementation is

533
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:23,820
somewhat kind of different air

534
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:26,830
mostly because of their deportable which
is space

535
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:30,990
I that also from

536
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:34,370
special services RRR concept

537
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:37,570
about the services the process they're
being taught services

538
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:41,430
that the ISTAT you can at the honey but
can

539
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:44,640
air Ron service which

540
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,540
I called Butte law I'm that means that
this service is not

541
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:52,520
actual release any to to allow TCP port

542
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:55,890
but he steadies running on a beautiful

543
00:33:55,890 --> 00:33:58,930
IP address I am on

544
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:03,370
its mostly allows der Rohe teen and
dispatching

545
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:06,490
so you for example be old

546
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:10,480
I an environment when you put a sub
router

547
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,700
our next time I'll and interface

548
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:17,460
you want to have attackers at

549
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:21,080
to road traffic to enter now the exposed
services

550
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:24,810
so the idea is that this way you can
configure

551
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:27,830
different services to be bitch what
services

552
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:31,120
I the silos a

553
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:35,300
this %uh brother to wrote the trophic to
the beach what services

554
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:38,360
which are not actually running on a

555
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:41,850
are all on every out to see people are I

556
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:45,840
another component is the for water
service

557
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:49,520
so let's think that you want to for
example

558
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:53,230
I know what's up router a to

559
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:56,250
road traffic to enter now if the sage
service

560
00:34:56,250 --> 00:35:00,250
and you want to put I and if the sage
honey pot

561
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:03,570
air inside your beetle

562
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:07,200
air Natwar I the for what is serbia's

563
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,380
air chemical fieger to be

564
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:13,920
a bit of service so you come for what
the traffic

565
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,940
that the attackers I wrote into

566
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:20,980
for example the sub router to our Riyadh

567
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:24,300
a honeypot for aces sage

568
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:29,920
so and actually another use of the for
water service

569
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,710
is that you got four traffic to Riyadh
external services

570
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:37,200
you can run I another bill so who r

571
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,320
in the honey boat a health I

572
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,160
i'm for the traffic hey instead of
directly

573
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,700
expose needs at two to text and I'll

574
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:51,170
interface you can for what the traffic

575
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:53,100
so

576
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:57,299
all the packets will be loved by their
by the Honorable so that yes that you

577
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,290
can have a trace of the Alsatian

578
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:04,020
of of attackers so there are a lot of

579
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:07,610
by myself integration with different
thinks

580
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:11,200
like asset you can integrate with
different high but

581
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,440
a routine traffic to to an SSH on BART

582
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:18,630
I to a web-based honey pot or things
like that

583
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:24,610
a.m. also a good idea is to share their
deployment at some point with other

584
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:28,160
type of on it puts so a you can put
together

585
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,540
difference ABC's not only for SAP

586
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:35,720
but also for other services I mean in
nineteen John level or

587
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:40,390
and you will find that the ASAP servers
I'm not only running SAP services but

588
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:43,650
around remote access services every be

589
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:48,810
its windows RSS age here II Linux box or
or things like that

590
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:53,400
so that the eighth that at some point it
agro deployment will be

591
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:57,940
Willingboro all saw integration within
different types

592
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:02,740
of 20 bucks I also it's possible to
integrated with actual systems running

593
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:06,010
I don't know if a good idea but the

594
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:11,030
it's possible yeah mostly it through
their routine and dispatching

595
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:14,160
I another porn app integration is

596
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:18,210
I said this stand up for its a the HP
feeds

597
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:22,550
carefree Teresa already implemented but
is possible so to extend to another free

598
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:22,880
it's

599
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,250
at taxi and sticks are for example some

600
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:29,360
standoff for months for sharing
information

601
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:32,810
I of ongoing attacks an Autobot

602
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:36,150
their I think that both are at some
point

603
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:39,580
a sponsor by me three or or something
like that

604
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:43,039
on download of air

605
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:47,740
savvy sees and I'm product and %um
production products that

606
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:51,250
are you think he's gonna feed to gather
information about

607
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:54,770
ongoing attacks so that the age that he
that more

608
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:58,460
Shelby I'll Colby also implemented at

609
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:03,670
at some point I and you can publish
information in these formats

610
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:07,230
I well there are other

611
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:11,140
point of integration air people they

612
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:15,660
possible to to implement so at let's
keep in a sample

613
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:20,279
of I'll text down all profile so dead
yes that

614
00:38:20,279 --> 00:38:24,119
you have the Internet some work you have
to

615
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:28,859
you're a bit sorry I which are there bad
guys the attackers or I

616
00:38:28,859 --> 00:38:31,859
a sponsor something

617
00:38:31,859 --> 00:38:37,710
are any wall I you have they are nice
app

618
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:41,880
bind to an external interface running
this %uh brother service

619
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:47,540
so that yes that for example on a bridge
say identifies the sub brother service

620
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:50,720
heats discover

621
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:54,590
open roads air we'd the sub router

622
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:58,530
something that you can do and its
something really come on

623
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:01,530
when you are doing a penetration test a
start

624
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:04,960
you can prove their sub router for it
for internal growth

625
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,880
I I'm CE this up router access

626
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,990
at Rhodes for Internet services so

627
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:15,830
less thing for example that get Brittani
discover some

628
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:19,870
up in rhode to internally Expo services
I

629
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:23,310
the attacker request I wrote

630
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:27,060
to the generally serve air system got

631
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:30,520
they'd think that Dr actually air

632
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:33,590
running on Intel IP addresses I

633
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:37,610
and a honeypot at some point

634
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:42,160
force all the traffic from the sub
router to the antenna be taught service

635
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:42,540
if

636
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:46,420
like for example you have a sub router
connected

637
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:49,520
to and in turn our dispatcher Severus
are

638
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:54,220
get with every if I'm by going through
the sub routes are you can request an

639
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:57,780
RFC call for example are

640
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:01,550
you can also expose a

641
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:04,780
lack in the sample on may shun air

642
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:07,840
other honey both ask internal services

643
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:11,350
so you can bill an entire bearclaw

644
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:14,670
and network that he's expose somewhat

645
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:21,670
I true this sub router I obviously not
all the information another scenario

646
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:23,460
will be

647
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:26,460
at base on the HTTP

648
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:30,460
part yeah there i cm service

649
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:34,800
yes every stat a it's commonly used and
through that

650
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,400
web dispatcher air for putting its

651
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,550
on the DMC an expose internal

652
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:45,010
SF services and

653
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:48,390
and this also something that you can
find

654
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:51,800
open i cm services on the Internet so

655
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:56,440
the let's think that the advert study
found unidentified

656
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:59,660
the icy and services I a disk and

657
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:03,380
he for expose its services

658
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:06,670
running upon this I I'm

659
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:10,540
at some point access they in turn out
ICS services

660
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:14,880
that I actually beat on services
implemented on the and the honeypot

661
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:19,650
I the last example I want to give East

662
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:23,460
a an example awning Tom and more a

663
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:26,800
when you gotta have different beat on
services like

664
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:30,150
gateway dispatcher masha service to all
did

665
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:33,710
services that are typically found on
internet war

666
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:37,450
I along with a i cm Severus I i'm for
example if

667
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:41,960
adversity identify its and he can access
did the different services

668
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:45,810
I'm everything will be logged by but
down yeah

669
00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:49,040
so I will tried to give a hi

670
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:52,849
Creek damn of some of the services

671
00:41:52,849 --> 00:41:55,410
well Kim a.m.

672
00:41:55,410 --> 00:41:58,470
they de-iced at

673
00:41:58,470 --> 00:42:02,200
the shell were run

674
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:06,070
honey but we dust and acculturation

675
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:13,070
I don't know if maybe is a small
hot-blooded yes that you can configure

676
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:15,270
some things about the log and

677
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:22,270
I are so

678
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:29,869
I about their operation about the east
on a whole

679
00:42:29,869 --> 00:42:32,989
it there sabc stem

680
00:42:32,989 --> 00:42:37,989
hair will look like like this I 7200
release

681
00:42:37,989 --> 00:42:41,930
that you found a mess NSBE which is
there try upper Sherman

682
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:44,940
nombre the client number is a lot on

683
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:48,650
the ASID ease PRD I

684
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:53,329
what else I and you can configure the
different services

685
00:42:53,329 --> 00:42:56,950
here's an example fun extend outside
router leeson and

686
00:42:56,950 --> 00:43:01,559
on their part 3299 at the rather bearish
on you can get here

687
00:43:01,559 --> 00:43:05,089
anything at you can allow for example

688
00:43:05,089 --> 00:43:08,319
X administration of the sub router I

689
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:11,609
you can configure all the different
options I

690
00:43:11,609 --> 00:43:15,480
their social something interesting is
that you can

691
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:19,819
a specified period wrote table I

692
00:43:19,819 --> 00:43:24,809
here so that the Ace that you include
the aggravation fog that contains the

693
00:43:24,809 --> 00:43:25,660
road table

694
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:29,430
you want for their dishab router I

695
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:33,059
I think you'll have somebody friend air
services

696
00:43:33,059 --> 00:43:37,619
which camby actual services RB 80 wants

697
00:43:37,619 --> 00:43:40,769
a for example disease I

698
00:43:40,769 --> 00:43:44,480
on despite your services that Pelosi to

699
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:47,599
looking to to with this subkey I

700
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:52,199
running on the part 32 lol I N

701
00:43:52,199 --> 00:43:55,119
is for example I mean chat now on

702
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:58,219
actual %ah i cm service running on a

703
00:43:58,219 --> 00:44:02,239
internal network on its been for water a

704
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:05,859
to appear to lock internal IP so that
the Ace

705
00:44:05,859 --> 00:44:10,609
that attackers a if they look

706
00:44:10,609 --> 00:44:15,119
at their sub router they will find that
the these IP address

707
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:19,119
is exposing the services when they'd
request that

708
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:23,469
wrote to that service that will be route
to an actual service running

709
00:44:23,469 --> 00:44:26,509
on another IP others on

710
00:44:26,509 --> 00:44:31,029
so long and finally there's their
configuration on for the feedstock

711
00:44:31,029 --> 00:44:31,539
called

712
00:44:31,539 --> 00:44:37,279
login I social for example their roads

713
00:44:37,279 --> 00:44:41,469
table deadly a thought at some point
needs seen a lot

714
00:44:41,469 --> 00:44:44,559
to the to this sup route table

715
00:44:44,559 --> 00:44:48,019
I but you can allow ok air

716
00:44:48,019 --> 00:44:51,699
access to the friend IP addresses the
front porch

717
00:44:51,699 --> 00:44:57,249
head you can also specify a password and
which is something you can do in his sub

718
00:44:57,249 --> 00:44:58,779
router and you can deny it

719
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:02,769
and a specific Road I on so long

720
00:45:02,769 --> 00:45:08,949
sawwy if you run yeah I bought the worst
are well

721
00:45:08,949 --> 00:45:13,049
its hair hitting the back and also it's
looking a lot of

722
00:45:13,049 --> 00:45:16,819
staff but what we can do for example

723
00:45:16,819 --> 00:45:20,209
his to scan

724
00:45:20,209 --> 00:45:23,749
the actual hype up

725
00:45:23,749 --> 00:45:26,809
its loving every try but de día start
here

726
00:45:26,809 --> 00:45:30,739
we r asking to the sub router

727
00:45:30,739 --> 00:45:34,569
a if they have a wrote to all

728
00:45:34,569 --> 00:45:38,190
those there all that

729
00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:42,519
hey I P ranch up for different services
I in this case

730
00:45:42,519 --> 00:45:45,690
discrete found out day

731
00:45:45,690 --> 00:45:47,880
does to host

732
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:51,599
I have exposed services once a
dispatcher

733
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:54,940
on another use an i cm I'm for example

734
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:59,500
I can request that I bought

735
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:03,170
I want to talk wheat this in turn our

736
00:46:03,170 --> 00:46:07,450
therapies I am please follow our

737
00:46:07,450 --> 00:46:11,020
the traffic to I no car apart

738
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:14,430
on my machine on for example

739
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:18,500
I can axis

740
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:22,130
an Intel now i cm service air

741
00:46:22,130 --> 00:46:25,830
been Ralph through their beer to all day
honey pot

742
00:46:25,830 --> 00:46:30,970
yes %uh brother sebas I on the same you
can do for example for the Subie

743
00:46:30,970 --> 00:46:34,780
you can a logging to the

744
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:37,950
disease appear to our

745
00:46:37,950 --> 00:46:41,770
despite your service this is not the
real one if the one India

746
00:46:41,770 --> 00:46:45,760
and a honeypot a you can see that day

747
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:49,150
he's stance is the one that we can
trigger

748
00:46:49,150 --> 00:46:52,359
a in the file and well you're going

749
00:46:52,359 --> 00:46:56,240
customize all giddy from maine use on
all the different staff

750
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:59,270
on it silos for example today

751
00:46:59,270 --> 00:47:04,960
try to lobbying I'm it's a stat

752
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:08,800
it's an able to process but its actually
gather in your the information so

753
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:12,599
you at Sardis do in I looking brute
force

754
00:47:12,599 --> 00:47:16,089
for example we can gather all the
tri-state they are doing

755
00:47:16,089 --> 00:47:19,359
I on on C what are

756
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:22,930
dear things that it they are yet Ryan

757
00:47:22,930 --> 00:47:28,970
I an art sample lease

758
00:47:28,970 --> 00:47:31,660
and Chernoff serious

759
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:35,370
being whole lotta to true the sub router

760
00:47:35,370 --> 00:47:40,780
I home for example I can also

761
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:45,520
looking into another service this is a
natural sabc stand-up I'm running

762
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:48,570
hey on rpm hey you can see that

763
00:47:48,570 --> 00:47:52,010
it has a different at ansatz

764
00:47:52,010 --> 00:47:56,270
I and and you can for all the traffic

765
00:47:56,270 --> 00:47:59,410
to the sub router which is the honeypot
itself

766
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:04,060
so they de esta all these

767
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:08,210
a its being logger on

768
00:48:08,210 --> 00:48:13,490
push at some point to if you configure
the fried and you can publish

769
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:17,400
all this information I share this
information with but holler

770
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:21,370
although Cape a

771
00:48:21,370 --> 00:48:24,510
so well some of the challenges

772
00:48:24,510 --> 00:48:29,300
I face II bill in case what they called
the bill a month

773
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:33,170
the development of only car I parties
and all that stuff

774
00:48:33,170 --> 00:48:38,350
a Los had can if a child ash trying to
build our model arse

775
00:48:38,350 --> 00:48:41,690
tractor are not conjecture that I loath

776
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:46,020
the things that I think are are are the
name up

777
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:50,040
also making G event work we describe
beyond which class

778
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:54,110
which is the HTTP Server implementation
Nissan teen

779
00:48:54,110 --> 00:48:57,120
kind of china cheap I

780
00:48:57,120 --> 00:49:00,300
our thing is that journey to the

781
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:03,650
how a lot of knowledge of each of the
services

782
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:06,770
if you want to me make I

783
00:49:06,770 --> 00:49:10,670
sometimes knowing the packets for Mott
is not an of

784
00:49:10,670 --> 00:49:14,270
and you need to know I the actual
behavior of the same if

785
00:49:14,270 --> 00:49:17,970
air and this is something that takes a
lot of time to

786
00:49:17,970 --> 00:49:21,760
to research I

787
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,990
finally another challenge

788
00:49:23,990 --> 00:49:27,230
East detection happin this but of course

789
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:31,380
so complex and its also challenge sheen

790
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:35,430
to build something got appears to be an
actual

791
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:38,470
sabc stem I and all saw

792
00:49:38,470 --> 00:49:41,870
that some services that are implemented
in honest and our

793
00:49:41,870 --> 00:49:45,210
way for example some HDB base

794
00:49:45,210 --> 00:49:49,010
their services in in SAP I

795
00:49:49,010 --> 00:49:52,220
behaves different to the stand up

796
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:55,530
and for example are now from the order

797
00:49:55,530 --> 00:49:59,620
of they had earth to think case
sensitivity

798
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:03,100
to tell no one of different particles he
in there

799
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:07,580
HTTP request all all of the things you
have to at some point

800
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:11,730
keep it in mind and try to implement it
and because

801
00:50:11,730 --> 00:50:14,740
otherwise it will be very easy to spot
that

802
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:18,970
cases at honeypot I'm not an actual
ac/dc yeah

803
00:50:18,970 --> 00:50:22,390
for example are a mess I she's and dad
different type of

804
00:50:22,390 --> 00:50:25,860
Masashi if I at different levels

805
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:29,160
of of a request if you me if

806
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:32,400
some field on our request there on my
sis youth

807
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,420
i defriend for each one of us feel so

808
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:39,030
you have to also take care of of that
I'm try to implement

809
00:50:39,030 --> 00:50:42,360
all that behave or on on the honeypot

810
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:46,120
I blast said STB service I one of their

811
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:49,430
examples of understand their behavior I

812
00:50:49,430 --> 00:50:54,470
bottle I I have some doubts about the
performance on hold peaceful

813
00:50:54,470 --> 00:50:58,490
work a enough natural environment with
high traffic

814
00:50:58,490 --> 00:51:02,160
I'm not sure about that there are a lot
of shelter

815
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:06,390
about perform on of actually CBC them so
I know worry that I'll

816
00:51:06,390 --> 00:51:09,710
I attack at but

817
00:51:09,710 --> 00:51:13,200
bullets it's something that we we might

818
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,610
see air in

819
00:51:15,610 --> 00:51:19,090
being in the feature mostly and they are

820
00:51:19,090 --> 00:51:22,310
some implementations with high traffic
going to

821
00:51:22,310 --> 00:51:25,870
today on here mostly the main childish
he stopped

822
00:51:25,870 --> 00:51:29,700
at the binary particles are implemented
you seen

823
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:34,230
by sup which is based on skopje I miss
gebbie celebrity for crafting

824
00:51:34,230 --> 00:51:39,590
it back its in which at some point and
ask some buffering

825
00:51:39,590 --> 00:51:43,390
I got something that the if you are
having

826
00:51:43,390 --> 00:51:47,150
high traffic is not it's not properly
something that you

827
00:51:47,150 --> 00:51:51,900
you want a so we will see Iowa Josh's

828
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:55,050
that pay wait til at some point find a

829
00:51:55,050 --> 00:51:59,480
find what's it will be the best to log

830
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:04,190
what things we want to of what
information we want to up

831
00:52:04,190 --> 00:52:07,380
on each of the different services and
what things

832
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:11,560
there attackers I had to end also
knowledge I she stood

833
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:15,410
debtor mine the indications of attacks
or indication

834
00:52:15,410 --> 00:52:21,080
of compromise and for example doubt the
finest and I waz

835
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:24,800
of air representing air this concept

836
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:28,420
of air I be an attack on

837
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:32,470
and this is what attacks looks like so
at some point we have to

838
00:52:32,470 --> 00:52:36,300
think about a how to implement ease

839
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:40,030
and how to identify this type of
situations

840
00:52:40,030 --> 00:52:43,270
using information provided by their the
honeypot

841
00:52:43,270 --> 00:52:46,490
I well I also saw

842
00:52:46,490 --> 00:52:51,800
and a challenge East to happen
deployments a date yet to make it ec2

843
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:54,090
to the bar yet but the

844
00:52:54,090 --> 00:52:56,950
he will take obviously bad time

845
00:52:56,950 --> 00:53:00,300
to people start a implemented and
deployed in

846
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:04,400
peace on on their own net worth and also
integrated

847
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:09,620
to did the French hani both different PT
Samsung things like that I had

848
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:12,700
also deciding I it's a it's a good
challenge

849
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:17,320
to up so account for contributions

850
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:22,590
yeah well i'd think that at some point
at said in the beginning

851
00:53:22,590 --> 00:53:25,980
the best that year the cab with this
kind of

852
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:30,370
so far he's at one know of people who is
running it

853
00:53:30,370 --> 00:53:33,960
and sharing information as so that yes
that

854
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:37,150
anyone can running testy at botch it

855
00:53:37,150 --> 00:53:40,450
a rest stop made the information on our
anything

856
00:53:40,450 --> 00:53:43,740
a obviously collect and analyze

857
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:47,310
what's going on are on Monday exposed to
it

858
00:53:47,310 --> 00:53:51,440
honeypots and obviously expanded

859
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:56,140
if anyone wants to implement kasam
broader goals %uh

860
00:53:56,140 --> 00:53:59,250
customize the different fair basis

861
00:53:59,250 --> 00:54:03,520
that actually a in my mind and and to
reflect

862
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:07,190
from characterizations in there are
network for example

863
00:54:07,190 --> 00:54:10,350
or things like that a.m.

864
00:54:10,350 --> 00:54:13,450
well there these will be

865
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:17,550
so on published on give cap on on their
car lot

866
00:54:17,550 --> 00:54:21,770
this site probably next week 1 I am
right

867
00:54:21,770 --> 00:54:27,180
home I eat Kasai GPL version 2

868
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:30,450
license so that the Ace that this will
be

869
00:54:30,450 --> 00:54:34,270
can't open source I and Adis that

870
00:54:34,270 --> 00:54:38,540
he saw Mom wants to extend that they be
a stat

871
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:40,569
hair

872
00:54:40,569 --> 00:54:42,910
it also shares what they did

873
00:54:42,910 --> 00:54:46,270
yeah I think that this is a did the most
important part of

874
00:54:46,270 --> 00:54:49,829
bill in this kind of software I and also
on

875
00:54:49,829 --> 00:54:53,349
I'm working on at out of it to to

876
00:54:53,349 --> 00:54:56,770
to have a common and feeds saw anyone

877
00:54:56,770 --> 00:54:59,839
that can install honey pot

878
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:03,579
to have this information I we can share

879
00:55:03,579 --> 00:55:07,470
old lady friend had attack social feeds

880
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:13,540
that are our archive perfect I

881
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:18,490
saw some conclusions well at some point
I think that we have

882
00:55:18,490 --> 00:55:21,920
I love you more Noi about some of the
services

883
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:25,690
because it by trying to implement it

884
00:55:25,690 --> 00:55:30,829
here heat require me to to ap some
knowledge about the services

885
00:55:30,829 --> 00:55:34,970
I mostly about the behaviour not only
did packet switches

886
00:55:34,970 --> 00:55:39,119
what I have been doing in the last years
but also about their

887
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:42,760
a behavior are on different directions
within the client

888
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:46,579
and the services I what someone we have

889
00:55:46,579 --> 00:55:50,079
a new source of information about at tax

890
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:52,599
I am

891
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:55,489
and also a different approach or a new
approach for the back

892
00:55:55,489 --> 00:55:58,959
defense on SAP systems so this

893
00:55:58,959 --> 00:56:01,969
what I think you stay at the outcome on

894
00:56:01,969 --> 00:56:05,239
I don't know we and a long

895
00:56:05,239 --> 00:56:12,239
have questions yes

896
00:56:23,180 --> 00:56:26,890
get yeah I A why I V Ryan appearing

897
00:56:26,890 --> 00:56:31,580
fanciest a.m. different cloud provider
or something like that mostly to

898
00:56:31,580 --> 00:56:35,050
tested calorie information I

899
00:56:35,050 --> 00:56:39,080
ideas start get to deploy had

900
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:43,520
east and southeast a mutt at at Star got
any information

901
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:48,800
that the ice to share it and but also
that yes that anyone cuando la

902
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:53,170
I'm running locally and see hell we'd
look likes I am

903
00:56:53,170 --> 00:56:56,420
start playing with it at that same an
idea that's

904
00:56:56,420 --> 00:56:59,470
my my main goal at anyone can dollar Kyd

905
00:56:59,470 --> 00:57:02,510
I running lock Ali I

906
00:57:02,510 --> 00:57:06,300
they see that font that

907
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:11,420
they have a place to put it on joint on
that your or your external WAN

908
00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:18,420
a just can do it that that's the main
idea

909
00:57:45,510 --> 00:57:49,589
yeah now that the question was if yeah I
i saw

910
00:57:49,589 --> 00:57:52,819
act right talks going on on the Status I
been running

911
00:57:52,819 --> 00:57:56,609
I the responses stack yes but

912
00:57:56,609 --> 00:58:00,050
at some point or an the guys

913
00:58:00,050 --> 00:58:03,380
see that they are SAP services

914
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:07,210
they did some basic checks basic
connection

915
00:58:07,210 --> 00:58:10,640
ask and a move to hey there I heart on
our

916
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:13,980
things so I think that II the on my yet

917
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:17,500
something back Hosono ish to to

918
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:21,240
talked some point out back at a specific
SAP Service

919
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:25,920
air saw another thing that I think will
be interesting

920
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:29,680
East at maybe we can start seeing

921
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:33,579
actual target attacks I games sabc South

922
00:58:33,579 --> 00:58:37,220
when we put down he bought I love with
or

923
00:58:37,220 --> 00:58:40,859
in a company that packed he's known to
run if ABC stands

924
00:58:40,859 --> 00:58:44,099
or along with actually sleepy air
service

925
00:58:44,099 --> 00:58:47,990
I think that they had the whole thing
will the

926
00:58:47,990 --> 00:58:53,270
got I mean running it along with
services actually safety systems

927
00:58:53,270 --> 00:58:57,900
I'm I want the attackers known that that
companies running SAP

928
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:01,329
so they have hair the preparation for

929
00:59:01,329 --> 00:59:04,520
for doing attacks to to specific service
so

930
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:09,089
they're responding ISTAT I i saw some I
have some

931
00:59:09,089 --> 00:59:12,200
I traffic so much tax at but

932
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:18,440
not get very specific to this SAP I'm I
don't think also

933
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:21,530
I don't expect to have a high-traffic

934
00:59:21,530 --> 00:59:24,609
on this kind of pics me know if you run
an SSH

935
00:59:24,609 --> 00:59:27,930
honey pot he would be he'd if mmm

936
00:59:27,930 --> 00:59:32,770
you spend annually when you adopt the
service you are being hit by a scanner

937
00:59:32,770 --> 00:59:34,030
scream about things like that

938
00:59:34,030 --> 00:59:37,329
i've this is not the case I don't think
that a

939
00:59:37,329 --> 00:59:44,329
people he'd high traffic

940
00:59:54,830 --> 00:59:57,670
and now

941

to be held a

948
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:27,590
like beat well machine services that eat
something
