1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,290
all by okay

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:07,310
thank you much and way come to my talk
and I'm very happy

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:10,570
tool a.m. to be entered to give a talk
and I

4
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:14,490
I hope that that it will be indeed
educative

5
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,900
I mean let's see if so the on I'm

6
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:21,600
title of the talk is crippling the clout
now which church

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,439
already has a little bit what it would
be about and

8
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,420
that sets and %uh so i win motivate a
little bits

9
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:33,760
this is a topic I'm going to talk about
saw the content of the talk will be

10
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,719
tool discuss Onorato high leverage
different

11
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:40,760
rod a new cryptographic techniques

12
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,790
that may or may not be ahead

13
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:48,219
forward to improve cloud security and
here I would concentrate

14
00:00:48,219 --> 00:00:53,219
on tool security goltz ok to security
threats namely

15
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:58,100
data breach and a top loss and finally
overdraw shot

16
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,219
conclusion okay let's start with a

17
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:05,239
motivation I think I don't have to say
that much about cloud computing I'll

18
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:08,180
concept is clear you ever use the
episodes provide up

19
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,670
who hosts service over sometime when the
clouds and and you can

20
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:16,299
out saw states are you can of sauce
computation

21
00:01:16,299 --> 00:01:21,860
whatever and Kaka building suddenly a
bus works

22
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:25,409
so it's always good to do research on on
such topics but its

23
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:28,869
a.m. I think modern this as our that

24
00:01:28,869 --> 00:01:32,110
being a is acquired new

25
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:37,079
so waz looking on on the importance of
cloud computing of like thunder them

26
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:40,530
prediction by ID see you thought that
input on 14

27
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,880
a.m. the markets

28
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,290
will be about 56 billion

29
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:52,290
US dollar and will grow more to $127
billion dollar and put on

30
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,399
18 and the five-year component

31
00:01:55,399 --> 00:02:00,380
Compal I am a compound annual growth
rate is about six times and compared for

32
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:01,770
the aura IT market

33
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:05,060
and so on and so on now thought these
from

34
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:08,459
the cloud computing is definitely
something

35
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:11,599
which is run a calming then going

36
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,329
and its and in this context

37
00:02:15,329 --> 00:02:18,370
not a price for for the Audiencia is

38
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:21,939
on one big senate is how to achieve
clock security

39
00:02:21,939 --> 00:02:26,170
and the class security

40
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:30,609
I mean this is a brought fear it ass on
I'm not going to tell you today how to

41
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:31,139
solve

42
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:35,260
clock the clock security problem and

43
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:39,189
butts what I would going to talk talk
today about

44
00:02:39,189 --> 00:02:43,040
is is 22 take a closer look and point to
specific

45
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,629
type of threats and discuss Hall

46
00:02:46,629 --> 00:02:50,900
new cripple mechanisms may help in this
context

47
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:55,319
and thought cloud security

48
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:59,180
s a.m. huge problem

49
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:02,519
in the context of of a cloud computing
the day this

50
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:07,219
club security alliance with which is the
nonprofit organization heaven

51
00:03:07,219 --> 00:03:10,290
sever member South who offering

52
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:14,329
different cloth I was like cool the and
Dropbox

53
00:03:14,329 --> 00:03:18,060
Microsoft and Zaza did a survey

54
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:22,629
from as a detective as number of sellers
are there was one survey

55
00:03:22,629 --> 00:03:25,120
which I think it from

56
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,520
this year leaving a though the asked the
people and companies so for example are

57
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:30,930
you all

58
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:35,610
I am what are the top 10 instead did you
perceive in the context of cloud

59
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:36,459
computing

60
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:39,550
and with mp3 percent of

61
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:43,470
okay we have some concerns about the
security of our data and

62
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:48,290
they also offices the security of data
residing the cloud connects the two

63
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:50,250
people bought lever concert on

64
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:53,800
and overrun more than 60 percent

65
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:58,580
of the participants at yes now as a club
security is indeed it's

66
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:01,890
something which is on so if they're
still

67
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:06,030
bothering people and I i said already
okay club security i mean that that

68
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:06,980
Spitzer

69
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:11,810
your fields and to cite another survey
of the

70
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:17,359
CS a this is fun expect from 2013 those
empty made in principle a kind of

71
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:18,100
ranking

72
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,880
for that the ass the the the people okay
but what of the

73
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,900
threats to Percy friend and which would
fuel

74
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:29,620
value law estimate is the highest risk
the second tires risk and so on and so

75
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,180
on and that came up with that

76
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:34,979
ranking for the quote the notorious 9
and

77
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:38,390
you can see the ranking here and the top

78
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:41,390
threats at Lisa and

79
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:45,539
on regarding that the perception of of
the people of other the company's

80
00:04:45,539 --> 00:04:49,700
offering cloud services is top one
thread if they have preachers in the

81
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,510
second one

82
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:55,200
is data loss and and this would be easy

83
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,219
tool threats overtake

84
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:05,060
a look today from a cryptographic
perspective okay so um

85
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:08,139
first question he didn't one could ask
us to say okay I mean

86
00:05:08,139 --> 00:05:11,180
the the

87
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:14,639
the Texas cripple since so long I mean

88
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,070
on isn't the crypto pop already set
alerts

89
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:22,560
and party s poppin off

90
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,860
novel poppy yes is if you're dealing
with

91
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:29,050
outside a take-out the other yes the
clout here

92
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:33,260
with with an on earth service provider
yesen on this issue with and if you take

93
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:33,510
a

94
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:37,520
outside of the clout they are techniques

95
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,110
that head all the established
cryptographic techniques like

96
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:45,780
encrypt our communication establish some
time access control and so on

97
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:50,690
and the situation becomes

98
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:55,460
more challenging and he I mean historic
village enough gosh I'm not going to

99
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:56,729
deny this but it's getting

100
00:05:56,729 --> 00:06:00,060
maybe even more challenging when you
consider inside a

101
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:04,870
at Tech outsells or I don't because it
does provide a is

102
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:07,960
it says not on us Rs maybe

103
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:12,940
catalysts are not implementing security
protection mechanism his footstool

104
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:16,310
all a take a try to achieve

105
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:19,889
somehow tool invades the the clout

106
00:06:19,889 --> 00:06:26,060
whatever and but it is not not a pure
threat ticker

107
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:31,669
danger but it's rather indeed a security
risk for you to stay

108
00:06:31,669 --> 00:06:35,520
a at the site again that the report of
the theater a

109
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,710
and has our organization experienced

110
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:42,960
and insider threat in the last year
youth the and

111
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,500
17 percent that yes and

112
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,530
thirty-one percent said not sure Nassau

113
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:52,539
only about half of the I am

114
00:06:52,539 --> 00:06:56,060
people asked could say for sure kittens
I district

115
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:00,720
have not been a problem fall company
okay well but we'll see

116
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,840
a.m. what's the problem if you talk
about so if you consider insider attacks

117
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,300
I mean

118
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,370
met at least many cryptographic
techniques

119
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:13,139
will fail now if even at taken off the
secret key I mean

120
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:16,979
than encryption is this hopeless if if
you can sauce

121
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:20,050
none of the date I mean group will not
help that much

122
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:23,919
and so it's clear that

123
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:28,460
if you want to have protection against
insider take a a.m.

124
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:32,510
and and you want to to alter egos
cryptographic techniques

125
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:34,490
then I

126
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:37,789
I'm traditional cryptographic methods
like like

127
00:07:37,789 --> 00:07:40,889
just ordinary encryption a.m.

128
00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:43,889
cannot be sufficient anymore

129
00:07:43,889 --> 00:07:50,590
that supports and the aim of this talk
is a key tool to discuss some

130
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:55,160
not a cryptographic mess ups that may
have to protect other line

131
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:59,729
mid getting closer to the X of research
in the cryptographic community him

132
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:03,240
and just a disclaimer

133
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,650
so I'm I'm going to talk about generic
Prince opponents

134
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:12,060
as a gin new rule message to produce an
incredible feat

135
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:15,159
I am going to talk to discuss all that
matters a

136
00:08:15,159 --> 00:08:18,900
advantages and disadvantages all the
little bit about the con States

137
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:23,490
but the focus would be on the
cryptographic blocks and the principles

138
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:26,560
house so if you'll if you came

139
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,060
with a whole tall should get a complete
solution

140
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:34,620
all some people can't just take off the
shelf to total so some other problems

141
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:38,529
I'm sorry for disappointing you and

142
00:08:38,529 --> 00:08:43,620
if you'll have already a a stronger back
riding crop a few maybe most of this

143
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,149
principle is unknown to your any house
will

144
00:08:46,149 --> 00:08:51,209
I'm sorry I'm it could be boring but my
hope is actually for all the others who

145
00:08:51,209 --> 00:08:54,890
may be hurt some of these techniques in
August 1 at what it's about

146
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:58,430
that the stock will be educated index
hopefully

147
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:01,839
okay so I S S et some

148
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,970
the firm the threats through just talk
will be the store

149
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:09,339
top a security threats

150
00:09:09,339 --> 00:09:13,440
so the data breach and it'll also let
let me start with data breach

151
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:20,440
and I am yeah I mean for the rest is
clear so what happened so how can I

152
00:09:21,579 --> 00:09:22,200
prevent

153
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,200
it's a day-to-day of sauced falls into
the wrong hands

154
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,890
ants of cause I mean II qott

155
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:33,860
also certain crips and and gives the
secret key

156
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:37,070
to the service provider and but

157
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:39,839
in the case of an inside it take to
oversee the slots I mean it is a

158
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,290
protection protect at the

159
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:44,379
encryption does not protect

160
00:09:44,379 --> 00:09:48,399
and the mall and the

161
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,870
experience whole state indeed

162
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:55,970
is a problem the fifth then the

163
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:59,029
date on all state up a so you can't have
a look at it

164
00:09:59,029 --> 00:10:02,620
and data loss DB dot all where their
lists

165
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:06,089
a the lobsters in third and of from

166
00:10:06,089 --> 00:10:09,120
date of that and and the latest inside
and saw

167
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,829
for example here in in August 2014

168
00:10:12,829 --> 00:10:17,170
220 million records have been stolen
from some

169
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:20,410
unknown organization and one at fifty
two million day

170
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:23,680
a recovery in stolen from Adobe cistern

171
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,040
and here to see that is the stuff 1 week
ago from from

172
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:32,439
cougar some 2000 22,000 record set in
stone

173
00:10:32,439 --> 00:10:35,860
now though it obviously a.m.

174
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:41,199
at take us indeed Menasha 22 get into
this data bases and and talk to steal

175
00:10:41,199 --> 00:10:45,170
the data and questions but what can we
do about

176
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:48,920
dis and whenever you want to

177
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:52,600
know what's going on in reality it's
always good to confide deluxe

178
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,709
and I don't know if you can read them
from from the

179
00:10:56,709 --> 00:11:01,339
last throw them a like this read it also
get this is mah talk to prevent of

180
00:11:01,339 --> 00:11:05,059
information for services that cloud
computing snow boots because trains

181
00:11:05,059 --> 00:11:06,689
would have access to all the data

182
00:11:06,689 --> 00:11:09,920
a little the thats in one panel

183
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,749
water had tool where needed five minutes
actually and

184
00:11:13,749 --> 00:11:18,209
a.m. and diverse on her is a trust thing
Khristian way more than I trust

185
00:11:18,209 --> 00:11:22,740
book gets auto parts and ok and then the
punchline

186
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:26,279
when you mention a potent yes he won't
listen to the rest of the arguments

187
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:30,189
and OK'd for the funny part in this is
the one

188
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:33,439
I just wanted to walk to highlight saw

189
00:11:33,439 --> 00:11:37,839
a.m. if if you want up saw state up

190
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,759
and and good do not trust the mechanism
are on today total projected that they

191
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:42,839
have to intrinsically

192
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:47,170
protect your data and the traditional
way would be to encrypt the data

193
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:51,620
and now the concept is clear tho

194
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:55,529
encryption mean through your plan take
seven encryption algorithm which takes a

195
00:11:55,529 --> 00:11:56,740
secret key

196
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:00,050
turn to decipher takes doesn't cost
money decryption

197
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:04,470
over is in with time spectra side for
texting is a plain text depending on the

198
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:05,480
decryption key

199
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:10,080
is talk lease can be the same all can be
different though if it's different it's

200
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,740
public you cripple underway system a
turkey cooked or

201
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:16,440
and a.m. if secret lover is in his court

202
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:20,090
then and attacker in between will only
see them crib today that would have no

203
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:21,350
clue about the content

204
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:24,850
okay so far so court and

205
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:27,910
a.m. and although crypto

206
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:32,160
great I encryption schemes out which
seems to be secure at least talk at

207
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,910
least two talk on state of Monessen

208
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:37,570
even Snowden said okay its strong

209
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:41,240
encryption schemes is one of the few
things to you can rely on gives us

210
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,380
stronger security implemented and so on

211
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:46,690
but it's not a topic and though

212
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:50,160
what why not just use it as a lineman
use a as the subject is a group date and

213
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,000
also sent

214
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,830
and now comes the points that not only
the goal of a Christian scheme is

215
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:58,020
actually two

216
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:01,190
I mean destroy like is too high it

217
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:05,970
the structure of the data as much as
possible and

218
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:10,090
but if you want to also showed a tough
talk to the clout

219
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:14,800
non Li get home this is contradicting a
little bits

220
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,250
the the aim now because I mean

221
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:21,980
non if you also state I mean you don't
want us to have one

222
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:26,320
big chunk of daytime and move it
somewhere else and if you need something

223
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,590
you just move it back but

224
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:30,330
actually you would like all the two has
become but also some of the

225
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:31,820
computational of those

226
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:35,160
some thumb operations on the data

227
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:41,130
ants this is not possible in this was
not a Christian

228
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:44,790
now so if I let's say I found a huge
database and prepare for saying in an

229
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:45,780
out songs it's

230
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:50,960
22oz to the clout and now I'm interested
in two I don't know 'em

231
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:54,280
how many of my custom us have fun

232
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:58,280
last day this month or something like
this: I'm hotel if you got this

233
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:01,540
ops if the everything's included in the
club's

234
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:05,160
and so

235
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,470
in and provide a few me them

236
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:10,470
good looking all corporate office we're
looking at this problem in Aust

237
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:15,010
themselves okay what if we could do
something like the following:

238
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:18,400
so we we all saw that they think rip it
so it's it's

239
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,440
intended to protect it and

240
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:26,560
if I have a sudden request on on my
daytime

241
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:31,180
an ideally I should still be

242
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:35,130
able to do this house although I think
the request to the

243
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:39,380
service provider which side mistrust and

244
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:43,530
what I get back s interpret results

245
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:47,740
and but this is like the goal

246
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:51,450
now if you can achieve something like
this then from you the perspective

247
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:53,490
everything's fine I had just typed

248
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:57,190
also the state they can still do
whatever he wants and

249
00:14:57,190 --> 00:15:01,810
but the that's a and malicious attack
was directly access to the data should

250
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:03,830
not be able to do anything i mean at
least

251
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:08,460
not tool extract anything about the
content and

252
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:12,340
desperate some some progress on this
question in the last

253
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:15,520
couple of yes and

254
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:19,790
in this talk I would like to focus on
tool specific types of encryption

255
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,110
schemes namely

256
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:24,280
and sucks for encryption schemes

257
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:27,670
and so-called home offic encryption
schemes

258
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:32,730
okay let's talk with our friend
Christian what is it about

259
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:36,700
I mean so the let me start first with a
midora call

260
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:40,400
the goal of mint a.m. sucks for
encryption scheme

261
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:44,460
yes that you can't place to encrypt the
data

262
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:47,470
somewhere else I mean the cooking scheme

263
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:50,890
on this has to be strong I meant to
protect sensitive content because

264
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:51,650
otherwise I mean

265
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:56,410
there would be no gain and nonetheless
it should be

266
00:15:56,410 --> 00:16:00,240
a possible to efficiently such with in

267
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,300
the data was also need to take root

268
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:07,930
ever said this is the Oracle and

269
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:11,030
let me start with a simple

270
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:15,030
solution which does not work namely

271
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:19,200
a.m. okay we have the author who encrypt
all the data

272
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,410
also everything to

273
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:24,180
the clout know has a thought for a crest
and

274
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:27,709
this is those providers Chuck giving
back

275
00:16:27,709 --> 00:16:30,819
the complete stott data and says okay

276
00:16:30,819 --> 00:16:34,379
look with it I mean that city

277
00:16:34,379 --> 00:16:38,009
now okay so that this kind of work

278
00:16:38,009 --> 00:16:43,949
and let's let's have a look at the
second

279
00:16:43,949 --> 00:16:47,720
sympathy north which although we're not
book but we're getting closer

280
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:53,439
is I am situation is the same with the
user we'll see also supra debates are

281
00:16:53,439 --> 00:16:57,319
and no I'm interested in something in I
would like to talk

282
00:16:57,319 --> 00:17:01,029
let's say such from the daytime and
knowing this

283
00:17:01,029 --> 00:17:04,220
simple solution the user is over some

284
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:08,150
local storage which has some its inmates
are information

285
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:12,370
about six data and given this this local
storage key

286
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:16,819
maybe North Hall ready what kind of
peace update: is interested in the mood

287
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:18,209
for them to find idea

288
00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:22,360
and an gets the requested

289
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:26,829
and trip to comment back it's a little
bit

290
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:30,409
better happy because the communication
complexity is low but it's not

291
00:17:30,409 --> 00:17:33,830
not really a good solution because of
with would mean that

292
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:39,150
depending on whole of the out of beta is
depending on on the amount of

293
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:40,280
flexibility

294
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:44,179
it may mean that you need a huge local
stops

295
00:17:44,179 --> 00:17:48,809
okay saw we cross the thought that
that's all they're not

296
00:17:48,809 --> 00:17:51,860
not what you look like to have not that
might become to the

297
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:54,880
basic concept

298
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,049
of suction encryption scheme

299
00:17:58,049 --> 00:18:02,220
named Ian insists its effect is similar
to

300
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:07,059
this scenario up with the following
difference we

301
00:18:07,059 --> 00:18:11,159
was to see you though with dizzy think
rip the data and now we have some

302
00:18:11,159 --> 00:18:12,610
addition unmetered data

303
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:15,669
with fifth some homosexuals

304
00:18:15,669 --> 00:18:19,500
and which is given tool to the service
providers for

305
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,400
others does provide us toss I

306
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,600
and saw record data and if this Meetup

307
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,080
one information and

308
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:33,070
if the user is now interested

309
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:36,420
into law to to suffer for certain

310
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:41,410
high end of Oct 22 suffer certain data
he prepare us

311
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:44,830
and something that is called a key works
and

312
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:48,080
census information to those provider

313
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:52,530
and given this for this key work and the
situa- index

314
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:57,420
he can figure out which data entries are
interesting for you with the intensity

315
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,070
spec

316
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:04,080
just the

317
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,530
good

318
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:10,640
disorder so maybe I just a.m.

319
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,980
business and overview of some of the
judgment corruption schemes

320
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:18,110
and an I hear your question was
referring to death

321
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:22,690
first column yeah though you see the
first idea

322
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:26,370
date back to to talk about that fifteen
years now and

323
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:30,860
the first solutions were only on on the
proponents to dictate our Christmas to

324
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:31,320
you

325
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,630
gave it once to the south provide I'm

326
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:38,290
after wanted to live with what jobs lost
and

327
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:41,840
over the time that pin

328
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,450
a improvements WC to lot of paper

329
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:48,450
some of them work on your birthday
dictator them all

330
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:51,450
%uh dynamic which means you can update
and

331
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:55,850
I i mean it's all secret that this knoll

332
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:59,800
free lunch in real life now with which
means

333
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:05,149
thats you we always have to pay 447
because I mean to you your game

334
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:08,440
some security and

335
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:12,400
and we which means there has to be some
some kind of overheads

336
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,480
I do on the you with a side on the
service providers title my maybe on both

337
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,290
sides

338
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:21,130
and a.m. just to give you an idea

339
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:24,320
is and hiya

340
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,810
this last two condoms display the

341
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:32,279
asymptotic FRx so the alarm

342
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:35,110
Britain with the new can Khan did
everything in all

343
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:41,789
notation and and you see folks on pit
okay we have been in the froth

344
00:20:41,789 --> 00:20:44,870
the first scheme which book on your vote
I am

345
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:48,240
static data that does suck time width

346
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,700
and over P and is the number of alt lost
a tough fight and peace the number of

347
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,350
calls

348
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:57,389
has in principle that the bus get to go
through all of the also lost a total

349
00:20:57,389 --> 00:21:03,090
to to make the results for crest the
index eyes was not even mentioned

350
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:08,450
been in the first book and and no it is
not just talk to have a look at that one

351
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:09,710
of the reasons schemes

352
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:12,960
that's one from 2013 which its dynamic

353
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,029
the that different security levels will
CK 82 with st.

354
00:21:17,029 --> 00:21:20,450
strongest one and you folks up at the
thought

355
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:23,960
time if are over PR its mouth the

356
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:27,159
documents that a.m.

357
00:21:27,159 --> 00:21:30,879
contains information that you're looking
for saw

358
00:21:30,879 --> 00:21:36,080
a artisan principally you cannot be
better than our and its are over P other

359
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,620
than me which means you can

360
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:42,129
paralyze it to some extent times lock
and unlock

361
00:21:42,129 --> 00:21:45,870
from moment due to the presence of two
were and is see

362
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:49,179
date up a size and the and excises

363
00:21:49,179 --> 00:21:52,549
m times and Gaza with your thumb

364
00:21:52,549 --> 00:21:56,090
the penalty that have to pay here this
is

365
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:59,950
a.m. another reason scheme levers that
such

366
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:03,700
time know depends on the possible number
of key what's

367
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:07,919
sewing if you have a.m. only few key
worth

368
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:12,289
suffer through you can be better the
area and Excise the same

369
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:16,200
and another scheme which has a subprime
of are also

370
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,539
I think this one is not cannot be
paralyzed

371
00:22:19,539 --> 00:22:23,230
but the every outsized the index eyes

372
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:28,340
is small its just M plus and thoughtful
again empath number of keyworth

373
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:33,100
n is the number of jobs lost a tough
fights so I'm I'm not get getting deeper

374
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,009
than this one as it is a CZ

375
00:22:35,009 --> 00:22:37,899
on a

376
00:22:37,899 --> 00:22:42,750
the most detailing its collection of
information given in this talk here and

377
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:45,250
then but what I just want to highlight
your is

378
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:48,270
that there has been some advancement

379
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:52,450
and depending

380
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:57,169
on on the use case some of the schemes

381
00:22:57,169 --> 00:23:01,090
might be interesting and on on after

382
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:04,140
and just to give an example days

383
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:07,500
in I don't know if you ever heard of
crypt DP

384
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:12,080
so too do the concept for from mighty
witches and encrypt the data base

385
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,600
which lost 22 such on on a trip to take
to

386
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,710
so this is something do you can use um

387
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:22,870
soda out that keep people out there who
really

388
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:27,600
tried to apply D's 22 practical database
or no for example the SAP

389
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:32,330
is investigating this topic okay this
post

390
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:35,630
nonesuch encryption not its head

391
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:39,220
overlooked war homomorphic encryption
though

392
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:44,149
what are some of the group about okay
the consider the following scenario:

393
00:23:44,149 --> 00:23:48,580
we have to use a and and riffs of
providing I would like to outsource my

394
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:49,419
my data

395
00:23:49,419 --> 00:23:52,840
yes let's say two datasets saw

396
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:56,200
I don't trust that those provider which
means banquet Mike data

397
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,380
and you think up to date I thought
nothing is planned so far

398
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:02,820
and and

399
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:06,260
actually will be extending for the this
and not your

400
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:09,690
that really looking and so far

401
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:14,610
because in in the previous night I was
looking for on on such bankruptcy which

402
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:15,409
means that

403
00:24:15,409 --> 00:24:20,789
the you suck after having outs of crude
the data can still such

404
00:24:20,789 --> 00:24:25,320
on the data but but maybe some section
is not sufficient number maybe you would

405
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,659
like to do some statistics

406
00:24:26,659 --> 00:24:32,279
on your data I to keep it simple for the
moment assume that the user would like

407
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:34,070
to walk let's say

408
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:38,909
takes a product of his tour venues lot
what got it or he cooks

409
00:24:38,909 --> 00:24:42,909
now I mean true solution would be to say
a

410
00:24:42,909 --> 00:24:47,289
I'm I mean those from other content with
the mother because because he is on his

411
00:24:47,289 --> 00:24:48,629
encrypt cipher text

412
00:24:48,629 --> 00:24:51,799
nominee the what continue the door
nominee you could just

413
00:24:51,799 --> 00:24:55,570
also could get me back minecraft the
date night the cryptids

414
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:59,729
then I compute the multiplication
tonight encrypt it again and then I also

415
00:24:59,729 --> 00:25:00,509
thought that they can

416
00:25:00,509 --> 00:25:03,979
which is not really satisfied

417
00:25:03,979 --> 00:25:07,489
and now that the

418
00:25:07,489 --> 00:25:10,879
goal of homomorphic encryption scheme is

419
00:25:10,879 --> 00:25:15,489
actually to build a hot cups here which
means

420
00:25:15,489 --> 00:25:19,259
to encrypt the data in such a way

421
00:25:19,259 --> 00:25:22,570
that sucking operations

422
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:26,299
can be done directly on tantrum the date
of such that the recite

423
00:25:26,299 --> 00:25:30,049
is encryption of the computation

424
00:25:30,049 --> 00:25:33,999
and the Wii which means that

425
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:39,059
those provide a cooked all to some
extent the computation directly on the

426
00:25:39,059 --> 00:25:39,679
daytime

427
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:43,679
without knowing anything about the
content and if the user want to look

428
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:46,830
wants to know about the content along
with the result that the contagion

429
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:50,450
he conducts requests the the response

430
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:53,559
are the result of computation and the
crypt

431
00:25:53,559 --> 00:25:57,129
O'Kane them I mean

432
00:25:57,129 --> 00:26:00,799
lot sounds very fancy maybe and and

433
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:04,090
on for thought could be to say okay I
mean

434
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:07,929
is possible ornament even if

435
00:26:07,929 --> 00:26:11,409
don't you get a very crazy encryption
scheme

436
00:26:11,409 --> 00:26:14,859
and surprisingly actually 11 of C

437
00:26:14,859 --> 00:26:19,159
most known encryption schemes is already
home offic

438
00:26:19,159 --> 00:26:22,210
namely the textbook arse

439
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:25,580
a encryption scheme and

440
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:29,729
so just all

441
00:26:29,729 --> 00:26:33,499
take the important point in the arse
encryption scheme

442
00:26:33,499 --> 00:26:36,700
a message earth are some something to
just

443
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:40,429
cipher text awesome intense us and
encryption means

444
00:26:40,429 --> 00:26:44,029
to take an intense operates its true to
some

445
00:26:44,029 --> 00:26:47,779
public EE take it more UN that ditsy

446
00:26:47,779 --> 00:26:51,190
encryption process of our stay

447
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:52,510
and and

448
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:56,150
of course you need to pick up will help
you choose the models hope the truth

449
00:26:56,150 --> 00:27:00,200
the 'em public EE but is not a focus on
today

450
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,299
night just encryption are a means

451
00:27:03,299 --> 00:27:06,720
I take an in-depth a.m. and I compute m
to the e mott

452
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,000
n and know what happens if i take

453
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,140
two different plain texts

454
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:16,340
m1 and m2 and I would like to

455
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:20,890
to encrypt both stunning the mean my
first hypertext is tough

456
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:23,900
M-one talkin mott enzymes

457
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:27,840
think of what and beyond all of its
operations

458
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,900
so I first have to take them one race to
eat my second type for Texas

459
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:35,260
and talk to the e and what happens if i
take dis to

460
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:39,010
a.m. Ste into into type it takes and
multiplied M

461
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:42,120
I mean that the three basic mathematics

462
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:46,429
then what you get is action encryption
of the product of the toughest

463
00:27:46,429 --> 00:27:50,020
a total plane tix and

464
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:54,200
I am saw

465
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,780
this for free a very simple exxon per

466
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:02,440
often home offic encryption scheme which
lawlz

467
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:06,270
talk to multiplication over in 10 shows

468
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:11,200
model some some other into okay

469
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,240
and its and death been a lot of progress

470
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,429
in in in the context of homomorphic
encryption schemes

471
00:28:18,429 --> 00:28:23,570
the most basic form of whom of a group
in Scheme this

472
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:28,410
want to call up call-up group home of a
contraption and group does not mean

473
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:32,610
a group of people also do group know it
did with the mathematical

474
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:37,400
group and and on a high level a
mathematic group is just have a set

475
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,720
and yet one operation I think of in
touch us and

476
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,720
addition for example ants

477
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:48,530
the majority of a form of a conclusion
schemes at least for for a long time

478
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:49,330
have been

479
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:54,250
group homomorphic encryption schemes and
its

480
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:56,020
so

481
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:59,490
just all the pool federal credit because
I had it in in this area

482
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:03,240
thought I'm colic from from till Tom
Sutton and myself were looking at that

483
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,050
this type of

484
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:07,770
home of encryption schemes and then
written

485
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:12,270
at that from 2013 though the we we have
to reside with us said okay

486
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:16,520
a.m. no matter how to the group of
encryption scheme

487
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:20,810
looks like in detail it always can be
characterized by by some kind of

488
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:21,700
framework

489
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:26,050
and the framework was not only based on

490
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:29,990
I mean that intense was not only to to I
dunno apply 00

491
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:33,690
mess medical skills but midtech he um

492
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:36,780
some concrete applications and

493
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:41,270
but before I'm going toward to talk
about this and just to give you an idea

494
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:45,230
a.m. so if you talk about the group home
often crippling scheme

495
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:49,210
and of situation lost that

496
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:52,310
all of the existing schemes encrypt

497
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:55,770
a message am as followeth

498
00:29:55,770 --> 00:30:00,000
in principle you have your plain text
message

499
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,340
and your combine its

500
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:06,570
within renova crop loss 0% yeah its own
a.m.

501
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:11,960
this one is a some in principle in home
of a group of the although you can

502
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,940
combine them

503
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:16,510
and always of will Pfeifer taken someone
has to fall much here

504
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:23,510
and I am based on the observations in in
all paper on base on the framework the

505
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:24,660
heads

506
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:30,680
a.m. the q10 and this is a text not
quite straightforward thing in the sense

507
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,330
that

508
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:37,950
many cryptographic schemes the security
of massacre cryptographic schemes can be

509
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:38,620
reduced

510
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:41,810
to to the something at a certain
mathematical problem is hot like like

511
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:42,430
for example

512
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:46,030
factorization the context of our stay
and

513
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:50,010
the focal form of encryption scheme so
if if you haven't description

514
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:54,030
of the problem of encryption scheme you
can immediately tell

515
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:57,370
rich mathematical problem needs to be
hot

516
00:30:57,370 --> 00:31:00,730
and the other direction works as well

517
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:04,030
if you have in mathematical problems are
you believe it's hot and which has the

518
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:04,490
same

519
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:06,370
it's a column

520
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:08,820
and appropriate palm I would say

521
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:13,549
you can immediately use its and to
construct new skins

522
00:31:13,549 --> 00:31:19,590
the button bottom line is actually if
your phone situation where say okay I'm

523
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:23,940
actually happy within group form of a
group in Scheme

524
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:28,240
dis it wishes us well understood so it's
actually clear how to construct

525
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,290
something like this

526
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:33,510
but the question is actually what this

527
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:37,100
if you want to a small how much does it
let's say I from

528
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:40,549
my my plain text date are some

529
00:31:40,549 --> 00:31:44,150
in 10 shots and I would like to all do
some

530
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:47,790
additions and multiplications over
encrypts data

531
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:51,299
and I so having

532
00:31:51,299 --> 00:31:55,360
no more pic encryption scheme which
supports more than just one simple

533
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,030
operation

534
00:31:56,030 --> 00:32:00,809
has been a key on alton problem for very
long time

535
00:32:00,809 --> 00:32:04,320
sewed it s been mention first time
indeed

536
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:11,320
and the lates 70s and was actually hunt
in not until 2009

537
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:14,630
that this quest has been

538
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:18,750
positively on subsidies in Syria today
has been

539
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:23,850
and a resides by Craig Gentry who work
for all

540
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:28,559
look at this point I'm for IBM anti
present

541
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:33,230
a so-called fully homomorphic encryption
scheme

542
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:37,169
so if if you ever hear yet is dis dis
tough when I'm of encryption scheme

543
00:32:37,169 --> 00:32:37,710
means

544
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:41,940
yesterday to your crypto data

545
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:47,070
and no matter what kind of computation
you would like to do

546
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:51,309
on Z plain text date on them secure data

547
00:32:51,309 --> 00:32:56,840
there's a corresponding operation you
could do one simple States and

548
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:00,620
proclaimed he was the first to propose a
concrete

549
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:05,940
encryption scheme which gift this
property

550
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:08,789
and that's being a on

551
00:33:08,789 --> 00:33:12,639
quite quite some the mostly

552
00:33:12,639 --> 00:33:16,200
important the security community but
also in in the press

553
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:21,820
and um in the next couple of nights I
would like total

554
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:25,249
comment a little bit on on this form of
a contraption schemes

555
00:33:25,249 --> 00:33:28,269
the further one um

556
00:33:28,269 --> 00:33:32,909
what's the main difference and

557
00:33:32,909 --> 00:33:37,309
on one of the main difference in his
approach the stupid Craig in an arduous

558
00:33:37,309 --> 00:33:40,619
and talk loss I am

559
00:33:40,619 --> 00:33:44,519
actually if you look and and house
encryption is stunted looks very similar

560
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:47,759
not total what we have in the case of
people moving from ski

561
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:51,769
but they have although some kind of
noise saw um

562
00:33:51,769 --> 00:33:56,330
noise in the sense that and

563
00:33:56,330 --> 00:34:01,139
its it Heights up if you combine service
of attacks

564
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:04,389
which is not the case for for some folks
form of encryption schemes

565
00:34:04,389 --> 00:34:07,549
saw if you have left their to encrypt
length

566
00:34:07,549 --> 00:34:11,460
in and do you truck just stopped a
combined n dense and moist

567
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:15,020
increases an increase in increases and
the main challenge both

568
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:19,659
actually how to deal with analysts but
the benefit Moss tatts

569
00:34:19,659 --> 00:34:24,549
a.m. most certain types of constructions
became secured the

570
00:34:24,549 --> 00:34:27,990
would have been insecure with office
nice

571
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:31,260
okay so about

572
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:35,710
I mean this is of course a and

573
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:38,879
very very very strong simplification
official

574
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:42,319
so it's a.m. otherwise I mean why would
people

575
00:34:42,319 --> 00:34:45,500
need thirty years softest and

576
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:50,629
just to give you a glimpse on on on how
involved is dis urias

577
00:34:50,629 --> 00:34:54,950
an the recently we and and then a group
of

578
00:34:54,950 --> 00:34:58,079
in in no way we took a look and it's the

579
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:01,349
con state and the first step was
actually tool

580
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:06,619
cool yacht to have a look at the
different in China

581
00:35:06,619 --> 00:35:10,109
now so it's in in the first paper Austin
Creek Center said okay

582
00:35:10,109 --> 00:35:15,069
we have something like compact a home of
encryption schemes and reform of a crisp

583
00:35:15,069 --> 00:35:16,000
skins bestest

584
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,430
property in this property and and

585
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:22,739
the desert see diagram became

586
00:35:22,739 --> 00:35:26,319
of with both holes okay how do you all
these different

587
00:35:26,319 --> 00:35:29,579
the motions relates to each other

588
00:35:29,579 --> 00:35:32,960
and don't worry I'm not going to

589
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,450
address any of these in detail and

590
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:41,519
but that's just to give you an idea then
things are getting much more complicated

591
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:42,109
Nole

592
00:35:42,109 --> 00:35:46,829
and I'm national question would be off
'cause okay but

593
00:35:46,829 --> 00:35:51,420
a.m. how is the situation notice I mean

594
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:54,729
okay been ok rake make one proposal but
not

595
00:35:54,729 --> 00:35:57,759
he other proposals

596
00:35:57,759 --> 00:36:01,849
can that be you lost and thought

597
00:36:01,849 --> 00:36:05,130
let's have a look at that this tapered
is a table we

598
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:08,769
the Met Ball said v went excuse was the

599
00:36:08,769 --> 00:36:12,479
state of the art of volume of a
contraption schemes

600
00:36:12,479 --> 00:36:16,660
and you feel that that some should
devote

601
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:20,430
8 different types of schemes and and
this column

602
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:24,259
holes okay I mean all of them the
security all of them up based

603
00:36:24,259 --> 00:36:28,170
on some allegedly hearts mathematical
problems

604
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:31,999
but save pocket different types of
problems

605
00:36:31,999 --> 00:36:36,440
and the may be the most interesting one

606
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:40,849
are youth to last columns the other
public runtime: in the concrete

607
00:36:40,849 --> 00:36:45,190
runtime: a new CEO careful for some of
the schemes

608
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:49,029
they don't even I did he said did not
mention

609
00:36:49,029 --> 00:36:52,259
southern to crime time now which is
already becuz

610
00:36:52,259 --> 00:36:57,309
and for some of them there exists some
implementations

611
00:36:57,309 --> 00:37:00,420
but a.m. the court rules

612
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:03,479
is they're not very practical

613
00:37:03,479 --> 00:37:08,779
I am the Fox om for this scheme has been
implemented

614
00:37:08,779 --> 00:37:14,630
and say evaluated CAES

615
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:17,729
I've written so that transcriptions a.m.

616
00:37:17,729 --> 00:37:20,749
standups on encrypt the data

617
00:37:20,749 --> 00:37:24,109
any talk 41 as: encryption

618
00:37:24,109 --> 00:37:27,670
36 hours I S

619
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:30,930
not pretty competitive and um

620
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:33,940
on the other hand things can

621
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:37,430
only get better and it was all those who
hope of from

622
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:40,990
the dop are and doctors to to show you
that that's

623
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:44,590
and fixins da pot to piss the written
very serious

624
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:48,400
and okay so couple of years ago but but
think

625
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,700
Spencer millions of dollars to

626
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:55,430
investigates homomorphic encryption to
those a specific the

627
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:59,170
volume of encryption scheme and and I'm

628
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:02,350
and and particularly interested in the
solution

629
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:05,700
to make these type of encryption schemes

630
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:09,990
more efficient okay thought hmm

631
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:13,180
question would be of cost now okay sewn

632
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:17,880
I'm the scheme obviously not not even

633
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:23,140
nearly practica and yup maybe it's
getting better met maybe not so good

634
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:24,180
offensive it's just

635
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:28,660
wait another five years and then come
back and discuss the con States

636
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:32,390
and in this context i just want to point
out

637
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:35,700
steps there might be a kind of trade-off

638
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:40,730
and but but the fun going to talk about
a trade offer the what what can we

639
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:41,410
expect

640
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:45,230
in the best case and I already mentioned

641
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:49,820
today if this distinguishing at this
them think between public encryption

642
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:50,910
scheme in the metric

643
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:55,160
can Christian scheme and roughly what
you can say is

644
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:58,420
and the metric CID criminal scheme its
is much more efficient

645
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:03,280
but is less flexible been a public key
encryption scheme not because he

646
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,840
everybody could encrypt

647
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:08,560
well hiya on it also can the crib can
only encrypt

648
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:13,630
and aspin resigns which holds that

649
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:16,420
for example if you have room for him of
a conclusion scheme

650
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:19,760
Victor symmetric then you can ton

651
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:23,050
immediately into a form of an
improvement scheme which this a public

652
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:23,450
key

653
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:27,830
scheme with myths about the same a fox
which means that

654
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:32,270
if if someone would come up

655
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:37,110
with a full of IHC encryption scheme
Anna

656
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:40,340
which would be s past ASM

657
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:44,120
nowadays you lost symmetric encryption
scheme

658
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:48,180
this would give immediately also I'm in
public key encryption scheme which is as

659
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:50,450
efficient as and symmetric encryption
scheme

660
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:54,320
which is actually a mother long-standing
open problem

661
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:57,720
so I'm I would not expect

662
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:01,350
this to happen so what however

663
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:04,370
though we which means that I'm

664
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:07,690
phone one form of encryption scheme

665
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:12,840
personally I did not see that much to
hope to see a very very efficient scheme

666
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,920
in the near future

667
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:19,600
box a.m. maybe we don't need to fully

668
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:23,279
home of interruptions cue now because
that is beginning I talked about

669
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,980
group of a contraption scheme where you
can do one operation

670
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:30,710
on the other hand is that we're full of
a group is going with you can be ever

671
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:31,230
seen

672
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:35,430
what about the ranch in between and in
deeds

673
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:38,840
and hun

674
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:42,000
many

675
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,660
up 37% off of his full of again
Christian schemes

676
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:48,820
Nexus all the variants which

677
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:53,350
are not fully pot from my it's caught
somewhat

678
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:57,280
meaning that it supports sought on

679
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:00,610
operations on on encrypt the data not
much ought

680
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:03,910
but more than just one group or more
ficken crippling

681
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:09,180
it just Monza subgroup operation and
diesel significantly faster

682
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:12,390
and so

683
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:15,630
my personal view on this issue is that

684
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:22,620
and if someone is interested in to
deploying and home of encryption scheme

685
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:25,329
it's probably the best tool

686
00:41:25,329 --> 00:41:30,499
think about what kind of operations
would like to have and N Sync 02

687
00:41:30,499 --> 00:41:33,930
to Pitt and Morgan corruption scheme
which perfectly

688
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:37,400
meets the expectations and not much more

689
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:41,219
okay look at possible apps encryption

690
00:41:41,219 --> 00:41:44,430
thought about that appreciates I'm
there's also

691
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:48,739
a.m. little bit but would like to say
about data loss

692
00:41:48,739 --> 00:41:52,089
and its I am

693
00:41:52,089 --> 00:41:56,049
okay with not just how the following

694
00:41:56,049 --> 00:41:59,469
trick NFC with a has with also lost

695
00:41:59,469 --> 00:42:04,349
the date up and in this case is not

696
00:42:04,349 --> 00:42:08,349
Lord anymore about a who has access to
my data

697
00:42:08,349 --> 00:42:12,009
be because maybe already in crooks but
his ride aboard

698
00:42:12,009 --> 00:42:17,369
about is my data still there other if
I'm going to need it tomorrow

699
00:42:17,369 --> 00:42:21,029
will be their stupid to all could be
lost

700
00:42:21,029 --> 00:42:25,630
and a.m. is actually

701
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:30,329
a.m. a.m.

702
00:42:30,329 --> 00:42:34,289
unjustified Christian because and

703
00:42:34,289 --> 00:42:38,900
noted more and more cloud storage
provide us

704
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:43,209
pop pop and I'm

705
00:42:43,209 --> 00:42:47,859
this of course almost incentive two of
us us provide up to

706
00:42:47,859 --> 00:42:52,029
to save costs and saving costs me

707
00:42:52,029 --> 00:42:57,249
could mean fuck some for I don't know I
decrease the number of both the level of

708
00:42:57,249 --> 00:42:58,170
redundancy

709
00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:01,249
of home I the data stops all I

710
00:43:01,249 --> 00:43:04,589
also lost %uh the day talk to some

711
00:43:04,589 --> 00:43:08,449
rather on reliable the placed us

712
00:43:08,449 --> 00:43:12,759
devices and in fact different look for
example at the MS on

713
00:43:12,759 --> 00:43:16,309
s sry page a.m.

714
00:43:16,309 --> 00:43:19,539
I mean you can rent storms from climate
on earth but at a price

715
00:43:19,539 --> 00:43:23,999
but they also provide and reduced
redundancies starch

716
00:43:23,999 --> 00:43:28,440
by SA okay it's keep up but you promise
you'll

717
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:34,500
lower-level of from failure tolerants

718
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:38,000
okay so the question from a security
point of view was okay

719
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,670
a.m. if I cannot exclude

720
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:45,849
that the starts provide up may try to
all

721
00:43:45,849 --> 00:43:49,380
save costs and maybe

722
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:52,840
do not relieve takes all measures
necessary to

723
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:57,550
cool and sure the level of redundancy on
did never overdone see which is

724
00:43:57,550 --> 00:43:58,810
necessary to 2 of 2

725
00:43:58,810 --> 00:44:04,220
fault tolerance can I is the use of some
how to check

726
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:09,000
if my data still available on Optus so
situation is

727
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,020
a.m. the user with all

728
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:16,000
thought the data would like to check
from point from time to time

729
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,470
if the data still there okay

730
00:44:19,470 --> 00:44:22,950
again iced up with some stupid solution
the stupid solution number one

731
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:26,859
is a the user says okay um

732
00:44:26,859 --> 00:44:30,410
if you're my date I wouldn't want like
to have a look 9

733
00:44:30,410 --> 00:44:33,690
up with the stupid in a pot of them

734
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:37,220
of being inefficient it's actually not
clear how the

735
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:40,890
you with a quick check if on the date s
is to me because

736
00:44:40,890 --> 00:44:44,720
if it did not kept local copy i mean
whole paycheck titty

737
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:48,220
that everything has been given back ok
does not work

738
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:52,500
stupid solution number two and

739
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:55,740
he just says OK

740
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:58,790
maybe he kept some information

741
00:44:58,790 --> 00:45:03,099
and he says from time to time I just
make a samper say okay I

742
00:45:03,099 --> 00:45:09,380
look diff me some some part of my data
back and I just checked these parts

743
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:12,710
okay all the year

744
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:17,160
it's not clear how to check and a.m.

745
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:21,520
depending on how much data has been all
thought that it might be

746
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:24,910
difficult to figure out that indeed some
time data

747
00:45:24,910 --> 00:45:31,589
is missing okay no no I comfort to the
cryptographic techniques discussed is

748
00:45:31,589 --> 00:45:32,490
contexts

749
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:36,119
which also caught proof of retro bility

750
00:45:36,119 --> 00:45:40,050
and so this is a tough number of of

751
00:45:40,050 --> 00:45:42,450
papash on

752
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:47,910
this topic aunt what what is a proof of
Twitter ability if

753
00:45:47,910 --> 00:45:51,759
actually a.m. a cryptographic protocols
between the user

754
00:45:51,759 --> 00:45:54,859
and the South provider and the the

755
00:45:54,859 --> 00:45:58,109
acted as a kind of china's response
protocol which means the user

756
00:45:58,109 --> 00:46:02,009
is making some changes to the source
provider which

757
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:05,529
he can only correct leon so if all the
data stopped

758
00:46:05,529 --> 00:46:09,769
and and of course we would like to have

759
00:46:09,769 --> 00:46:13,710
bit ditzy that the user can check that
he cannot

760
00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:17,329
be forwards if if the day does not
present and and so on and so on

761
00:46:17,329 --> 00:46:22,259
the way which means and what what the
the key idea behind

762
00:46:22,259 --> 00:46:26,240
if okay with a user with some data and
he also says that data

763
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:29,930
and the idea is actually in addition to
the dates not death

764
00:46:29,930 --> 00:46:34,059
some addition a data stops

765
00:46:34,059 --> 00:46:37,999
which helps to to do the check later on
and

766
00:46:37,999 --> 00:46:41,380
a.m. the

767
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:45,240
you have been a data is usually much
smaller tendons original date as

768
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:45,819
overdone

769
00:46:45,819 --> 00:46:52,819
book it misleads now that's that's a
good question them normally its

770
00:46:55,579 --> 00:46:59,180
on on it's it's so you was up the %ah
hmmm

771
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:02,609
schemes well the climb as a sofa while

772
00:47:02,609 --> 00:47:06,230
does it okay the butt but

773
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:11,460
a.m. okay maybe a first for the other
side and then a good for comments so the

774
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:14,509
idea is standing in the verification
step plate on

775
00:47:14,509 --> 00:47:17,749
the you though is making some samples

776
00:47:17,749 --> 00:47:21,579
now that they for example I would like
to check the yellow pot and he gets back

777
00:47:21,579 --> 00:47:23,910
the original data and additional data

778
00:47:23,910 --> 00:47:27,519
and is a loss to check if the data still

779
00:47:27,519 --> 00:47:31,039
intact and um

780
00:47:31,039 --> 00:47:34,529
the point s

781
00:47:34,529 --> 00:47:39,259
I mean by I'm again he I'm the done a
lot of details that I i completely

782
00:47:39,259 --> 00:47:43,380
economic here like like hope help do we
get security how do we get it efficient

783
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:43,849
so on

784
00:47:43,849 --> 00:47:46,869
but but I would like to point out which
is something I find

785
00:47:46,869 --> 00:47:49,960
person interesting is a

786
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:53,140
conceptually that does some some
similarities between this section in

787
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:55,730
production and Paul sand in the sense
that

788
00:47:55,730 --> 00:47:59,660
the authority to date and have some
additional data of sauced

789
00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:03,730
okay and ok yes assume

790
00:48:03,730 --> 00:48:06,830
coming as Thomas time's running out on
earth

791
00:48:06,830 --> 00:48:12,130
if the this one the I just have it on
the slides in and hit the month

792
00:48:12,130 --> 00:48:12,900
interested

793
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:17,420
to see how next topic what look like and

794
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:20,980
that has been several

795
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:25,800
types of um approval for turbidity
protocols

796
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:29,080
and all the heat has been some some
progress and

797
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:32,410
want want direction I want to to
highlight

798
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:36,150
is at again advertising little bit but
what we're doing

799
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:40,010
annis um not for

800
00:48:40,010 --> 00:48:45,520
wrong button proper I am 30 I

801
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:49,730
what's up the phone okay sorry i'd

802
00:48:49,730 --> 00:48:55,800
it is a bit shaky it sorry actually use
it correctly if you won't ever times I

803
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,640
think the people reap

804
00:48:57,640 --> 00:49:00,730
is over weekend but

805
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:04,970
I think they have no of the water I okay

806
00:49:04,970 --> 00:49:08,250
n no I thought that the problem I'm
going to make them

807
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:11,150
online and you know and and and people
are you and distributed or something

808
00:49:11,150 --> 00:49:11,520
like this:

809
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:17,349
and a.m. ok as I just got to give an
ideal for some recent development in

810
00:49:17,349 --> 00:49:18,619
this context is

811
00:49:18,619 --> 00:49:23,430
and in a knot should have been put
different types

812
00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:28,250
of of proof suffered for ability name
the public verifiable and secret for

813
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:29,260
five months

814
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:35,240
and am so the more fish in ponds as a
private verified once

815
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:38,800
which means that the user is actually
doing all the work so yes to

816
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:42,589
prepare all the data also lost it and
blew the check on its own

817
00:49:42,589 --> 00:49:45,619
and honest it was going through this

818
00:49:45,619 --> 00:49:51,810
now and a some this has been his public
for five once

819
00:49:51,810 --> 00:49:55,369
when principal someone else could do the
verification

820
00:49:55,369 --> 00:50:02,180
box the question that especially osco
safe in this context is OK

821
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:05,200
if I'm the was up I have also lost my
data

822
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:11,230
I i would like tool conduct up of from
time to time just to check my status to

823
00:50:11,230 --> 00:50:13,349
death but I don't want to do it myself

824
00:50:13,349 --> 00:50:17,780
what I would like to thank you to have
something like like paw as a service

825
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:22,380
but then other security concerns pop up
every cost and then bf

826
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:25,730
and a thought party with me

827
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:30,730
not doing justice Paul as a service and
maybe his party cannot be trusted

828
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:35,569
as well and but this is something that

829
00:50:35,569 --> 00:50:38,930
a context from NEC which are just

830
00:50:38,930 --> 00:50:42,390
over there down the throat United book
and I

831
00:50:42,390 --> 00:50:45,680
earned and we were looking at and we
actually extended

832
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:50,430
Justice Paul concept to outsource Paul
and actually a lot of

833
00:50:50,430 --> 00:50:54,250
take the test that I'm going to spend
now but its

834
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:57,329
'em oviduct just plus tool

835
00:50:57,329 --> 00:51:00,790
a.m. shortly

836
00:51:00,790 --> 00:51:04,020
summer I S is and what we shot

837
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:07,790
is that something like a pause to solve
this is possible

838
00:51:07,790 --> 00:51:12,780
and what's nice is the truth for the
solutions that meet proposed

839
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:18,410
anthem the brew dock broke offices our
skin though we did some experiments

840
00:51:18,410 --> 00:51:22,040
and the other one up non out sauced

841
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:25,240
boss you see movie compete actually
quite well

842
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:28,450
misty's and so

843
00:51:28,450 --> 00:51:31,549
das to questions but certain

844
00:51:31,549 --> 00:51:35,630
that's all some hope that they too can
that you can find on some to

845
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:38,839
to disarm Christmas okay

846
00:51:38,839 --> 00:51:42,020
and the last tour

847
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:45,500
type of protocols business agree only
one slight

848
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:52,500
for per topic annis um okay having on
something like a proof of retro bility

849
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:53,150
is

850
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:59,000
as nice in the sense that okay you can
check in for tested our

851
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:04,619
but I mean if you on this a.m. checking
if my day tested Amin

852
00:52:04,619 --> 00:52:08,309
instance may be too late if you realize
okay today there's already lost

853
00:52:08,309 --> 00:52:13,339
and what what are you was actually
really interested in

854
00:52:13,339 --> 00:52:14,270
is

855
00:52:14,270 --> 00:52:17,070
is my date %uh stops in

856
00:52:17,070 --> 00:52:21,090
its such that a.m. a Sutton

857
00:52:21,090 --> 00:52:25,290
protection against data loss is this
country it tough for example the debt

858
00:52:25,290 --> 00:52:28,450
sufficient number of copies and

859
00:52:28,450 --> 00:52:32,099
there's actually a lot of research going
on at the moment so

860
00:52:32,099 --> 00:52:36,349
if this um just one example because is
one of the first

861
00:52:36,349 --> 00:52:40,020
papon this topic in in in this one there
they

862
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:43,609
thought they said okay the data should
be

863
00:52:43,609 --> 00:52:47,140
start on on difference of us and

864
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:50,730
this protocol says OK I

865
00:52:50,730 --> 00:52:53,910
from time to time I make certain
requests to the data but from different

866
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:54,849
devices

867
00:52:54,849 --> 00:52:59,470
and I do some time measurement because
idea if thats

868
00:52:59,470 --> 00:53:03,330
and other the goal of this protocol was
to take

869
00:53:03,330 --> 00:53:07,490
is my data indeed distributed among
different operas

870
00:53:07,490 --> 00:53:10,810
and the call I D A is that it might

871
00:53:10,810 --> 00:53:14,310
my complete data is all on the same pop
strife and I'm

872
00:53:14,310 --> 00:53:17,619
asking for different pieces of the day
takes longer to respond

873
00:53:17,619 --> 00:53:22,490
then if it's on different hot truss and
to dissolve some experiments and it

874
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:25,570
seems to to working in some cases and
Ahmad is probably not

875
00:53:25,570 --> 00:53:29,430
but just to give you an idea of the
directions people up are thinking

876
00:53:29,430 --> 00:53:32,700
and finally

877
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:37,030
and proof of location something I just
wanted to commence because it's some of

878
00:53:37,030 --> 00:53:40,920
on the idea is some sometimes

879
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:45,170
I'm also interested well my data stops

880
00:53:45,170 --> 00:53:49,510
aunt up

881
00:53:49,510 --> 00:53:50,740
it

882
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:53,440
at least some tackles your me trip

883
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:56,510
the grito you could in some time I think
you are you

884
00:53:56,510 --> 00:54:01,360
and his idea of X he also to do some
time measurements I'll vote

885
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:06,430
both a the user communicating with the
thirst provide then

886
00:54:06,430 --> 00:54:10,040
if the day to start somewhere completely
as then

887
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:14,050
sometimes it's possible

888
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:17,720
non on to do some information from on
the

889
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:21,670
time it takes too long to respond the
the complete for a cause more

890
00:54:21,670 --> 00:54:23,090
complicated because debut

891
00:54:23,090 --> 00:54:28,420
a key to make request from different
place the thought of the idea that he

892
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:31,850
you make a request from here and across
from UN request from you

893
00:54:31,850 --> 00:54:36,780
the smartphone plan you through some
triangulation and this although

894
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:41,390
pop the U two different encodings and so
on though and there's a lot of going on

895
00:54:41,390 --> 00:54:41,990
but just

896
00:54:41,990 --> 00:54:47,300
to give an idea of of christians people
are looking okay I'm

897
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:50,740
come to the amps and actually I'm
practically done

898
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:54,500
so the and

899
00:54:54,500 --> 00:55:00,010
I hope that that's I could convince you
that okay

900
00:55:00,010 --> 00:55:03,160
club security is a concern

901
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:07,600
probably you well rafters already befall
and

902
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:11,710
Morlock traditional cryptographic
techniques

903
00:55:11,710 --> 00:55:15,390
are a.m. not sufficient

904
00:55:15,390 --> 00:55:18,620
anymore so we need novel ideas

905
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:22,870
and in this context

906
00:55:22,870 --> 00:55:26,600
day some cryptographic research going on

907
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:30,140
some of them are speculative for sure

908
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:35,190
some of them will probably never be of
any use somewhere but some of them

909
00:55:35,190 --> 00:55:38,560
Mike eat somewhere and it depends a
little bit

910
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:41,790
also on the right people talking to each
other

911
00:55:41,790 --> 00:55:45,050
that's it's my opinion okay some and

912
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:52,050
at the end of my talk thank you very
much was attached

913
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:58,240
thanks very I

914
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:03,910
that it was indicative perfect of the
same goes for you

915
00:56:03,910 --> 00:56:07,040
willing to give like

916
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:10,270
Q&A but up long day

917
00:56:10,270 --> 00:56:14,590
by everybody that

918
00:56:14,590 --> 00:56:17,660
yeah

919
00:56:17,660 --> 00:56:24,660
a somewhat but it's okay

920
00:56:40,970 --> 00:56:43,650
you mean of if Texas already

921
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:47,310
only schemes that that up dedicated

922
00:56:47,310 --> 00:56:50,960
and not so many as a day off on

923
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:56,000
so most of the somewhat more pic
corruptions out to is

924
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,130
'em might like to and

925
00:57:00,130 --> 00:57:03,760
puts once like this a

926
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:07,420
the most of this form of encryption
schemes are still actually

927
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:10,790
upturn a low-temperature

928
00:57:10,790 --> 00:57:14,330
bits into the pits and

929
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:17,820
a because %uh i mean the the underlying
idea is

930
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:21,810
at the ants you you have a PC everything

931
00:57:21,810 --> 00:57:26,490
is in college in bits any operation you
can do is actually a bit manipulation so

932
00:57:26,490 --> 00:57:27,860
if you have something which can

933
00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:31,520
operate on bits and combine bits I mean
in Serie

934
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:35,020
you can do everything and an

935
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:38,730
so and from mathematical point of you

936
00:57:38,730 --> 00:57:42,690
you can a.m. you can do two things you
can I do

937
00:57:42,690 --> 00:57:46,680
at bits which will be X all you can
multiply them which would be and

938
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:50,680
and on the hiring something we wish

939
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:53,790
a loss pics all is actually not that
complicated but having

940
00:57:53,790 --> 00:57:57,359
sufficient and visited the death of the
circuit actually

941
00:57:57,359 --> 00:58:02,200
and desde is somewhat of a concussion
schema most of them

942
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:05,430
actual of a certain number of ants

943
00:58:05,430 --> 00:58:09,720
operations the big doesn't most of
Denver

944
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:13,200
I am myself I had some

945
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:17,119
I was involved in into developing them
somewhat of a corruption scheme

946
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:20,750
would for example operated OVR a

947
00:58:20,750 --> 00:58:25,880
some into class all actually all over
finite fields all fields

948
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:30,140
other you can at and multiply and and
here

949
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:34,770
the the scheme was such that you could
say okay im

950
00:58:34,770 --> 00:58:38,080
if I know that my my application
requires that say up to five

951
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:43,500
multiplications you can and principal
June set up to you you can configure it

952
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:44,170
like this

953
00:58:44,170 --> 00:58:48,820
and it is keen had some advantages and
disadvantages that bothered positives

954
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:51,010
very very fast

955
00:58:51,010 --> 00:58:55,170
disadvantage is that it has none almost
blow up in the ciphertext so it's

956
00:58:55,170 --> 00:59:00,440
the I think up to a couple of
multiplications was okay but but more

957
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:03,510
much more of them cross complicated and

958
00:59:03,510 --> 00:59:08,860
and fought us operations and not

959
00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:13,750
a wealth term so but but I can say is
there seems to be a kind of trade-off

960
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:17,240
and actually does this one

961
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:20,620
research topic in a local missus tool

962
00:59:20,620 --> 00:59:25,960
to addressed is no more from a
publication point

963
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:29,670
of Yulin and look okay what kind of
applications are interesting

964
00:59:29,670 --> 00:59:34,030
and what kind of home office in between
it and then try to develop something

965
00:59:34,030 --> 00:59:38,450
and you actually happy for any import so
if you say okay

966
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:42,810
great if you could have something like
descent is operation

967
00:59:42,810 --> 00:59:46,070
it is possible I mean that that's
certainly a

968
00:59:46,070 --> 00:59:50,550
is strong motivation for us to look at
this but the Arsenal

969
00:59:50,550 --> 00:59:57,550
broke

970
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:15,200
it's the third last published:

971
01:00:16,890 --> 01:00:20,490
a yacht that that's own said

972
01:00:20,490 --> 01:00:25,090
young the problem is that that's not
clear though that

973
01:00:25,090 --> 01:00:28,520
I'm on the right slight actually the law
but somebody schemes

974
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:31,960
for his kids it has been proven

975
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:35,140
that is secure if his problems

976
01:00:35,140 --> 01:00:39,450
I may give their respective problem is
hot but no we need to keep people look

977
01:00:39,450 --> 01:00:40,980
at its respective problem so the

978
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:44,800
all of his number grams of the learning
and with al

979
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:47,890
problem with me to take him on problem
which is believed to be hot

980
01:00:47,890 --> 01:00:52,170
but some of them have been variations
and then it's not much of a nuclear

981
01:00:52,170 --> 01:00:56,720
and and I'm a bit but

982
01:00:56,720 --> 01:01:01,080
mean in this context what is also a and
not a line of research to try person to

983
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:03,060
find quite interesting is actually

984
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:09,260
to say an when I outsource my data

985
01:01:09,260 --> 01:01:13,400
and I encrypt my dates are I do not use
and homomorphic encryption scheme to

986
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:14,580
encrypt my date up

987
01:01:14,580 --> 01:01:19,460
right of from the beginning but I use on
symmetric encryption scheme

988
01:01:19,460 --> 01:01:24,810
like as: and if I need to do some
homework pick up a rationing

989
01:01:24,810 --> 01:01:28,200
I a.m. and principally inference like

990
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:33,330
home offically decrypts the date others
liked on an encryption on the lips a

991
01:01:33,330 --> 01:01:36,720
as: into an encryption under some form
of encryption scheme

992
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:39,910
and date was operations

993
01:01:39,910 --> 01:01:44,010
and this has set bondage that okay I
mean

994
01:01:44,010 --> 01:01:47,590
it's at least the the date hasn't
replied under some some

995
01:01:47,590 --> 01:01:52,660
non-christian scheme and if you find a
bottom of a contributing which for

996
01:01:52,660 --> 01:01:53,100
example

997
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:56,100
lost to dick rutan offically in AES
encryption

998
01:01:56,100 --> 01:02:00,170
bender some progress and in this context

999
01:02:00,170 --> 01:02:03,530
but Israel a.m. no hot topic

1000
01:02:03,530 --> 01:02:07,200
is that P performs it symmetric

1001
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:10,450
keep firm research community in
cryptography

1002
01:02:10,450 --> 01:02:13,910
are now looking for symmetrically

1003
01:02:13,910 --> 01:02:16,980
encryption scheme which op

1004
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:20,720
very quotes to be the crypt at home
offically

1005
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:24,760
other with which can be with the
decryption process can be described by

1006
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:25,240
an

1007
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:29,880
born circa it's a whole shell or death
something like this

1008
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:31,320
thanks again keep it going
