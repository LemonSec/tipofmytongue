1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,669
as a foreigner soccer people back it
comes up

2
00:00:03,669 --> 00:00:08,690
ok excellent got a ton material yet
through so I'm going to talk very very

3
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:11,889
fast I realized in the day hopefully I
can give you guys an energy

4
00:00:11,889 --> 00:00:15,299
and we'll get through everything we've
got here obviously

5
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:19,180
multipath TCP be a quick who the heck
are we

6
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:22,359
I am to people today on my my colleague

7
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:25,949
Catherine could be here today I'm but
she is actually instrumental in this so

8
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:27,090
I'm going to be giving

9
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:30,929
as best they can both more perspectives
I'm we r

10
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:34,480
mocha Mishra called new hampshire's who
was recently acquired by Cisco service

11
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,469
to getting used to that

12
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:40,210
she is the RCD she is the one who sits
down in resources for fun I don't

13
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:40,980
understand that

14
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,719
I'm on the application side and a
conversation between the two of us

15
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,160
really turned to this talk

16
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,510
this is going to be the thesis for today

17
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:56,170
the multipath TCP changes fundamental
assumptions about how TCP works

18
00:00:56,170 --> 00:01:00,340
and that word was very carefully chosen
talking about assumptions

19
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:04,739
multipath TCP isn't breaking things it
is an abomination exploited in a broken

20
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:05,420
protocol

21
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:09,810
it just challenges assumptions we made
network that had previously been true

22
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:13,350
that don't necessarily need to be true
in the future for some use cases the

23
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:19,119
actually really care about and I noticed
there's a last respects an asterisk goes

24
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:19,740
to

25
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:25,000
kind for not talk if we are not talking
earlier for

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,930
eventually thing so we can constrain our
view a little bit

27
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:32,970
so lower than later for can always try
model type

28
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:37,909
order above where four orbit player for

29
00:01:37,909 --> 00:01:44,490
TCP layer bottle let's get right into an
example

30
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:48,840
just you illustrate the level love
unusual miss that we're talking about

31
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,250
are reading it you know her good most
people kept

32
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:56,520
principle to we should all have at least
a basic understanding what it does

33
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,600
curl to a website if the default page
for web server

34
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,659
nothing weird their tools look like
they're behaving the same

35
00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:07,860
Wireshark I wish to

36
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,880
to Louis we like to use go follow the
stream

37
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:16,360
what we see the GET request perfectly
reasonable normally get your question no

38
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,310
response whatsoever on the street but

39
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:24,280
it was here in the console we know that

40
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:28,820
the application stuff is working to
working but our tools are lying to us

41
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,830
okay

42
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:37,690
net revenues net of butter simple as you
can possibly get for going to sleep East

43
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:41,710
please work reasonably make at

44
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:45,160
to server this happens

45
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:49,590
this is Nestor instead getting one
connection open up we get 10

46
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:53,070
to multiple different IP addresses
notice

47
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:57,300
ipv4 and ipv6 only these things being
done for us

48
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,590
like what the heck is going on here

49
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:04,660
if you don't understand what you got the
CB this makes no sense I did this is

50
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,120
just bizarre or

51
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,860
so

52
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:13,490
why we see that truck remote at the CP

53
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:17,770
but stuck in a multipath TCP we act like
a TCP

54
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:20,940
why are we doing what's the point

55
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,270
our current his peers

56
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:27,570
with Ronan I feel a bit dirty saying
that given how much

57
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:31,330
I V the Internet is growing the kinds of
things you can do in the key billion

58
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:32,430
thanks a million things like that

59
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:35,750
with the truth is it doesn't serve some
use cases

60
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,960
they are going to they are becoming
important now and going to be more

61
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,520
important

62
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:44,030
in the Internet that many people in
vision 5 10 15 years from now

63
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:47,840
things like high availability on being
able to have

64
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,110
Hoover Hoover up time or extraordinarily
high band with being able to pull

65
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:54,120
together a lot to heterogeneous links

66
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,220
to do things with multi homing if you
got mobile devices

67
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:01,440
they're going to be on multiple
different types of networks and then

68
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,790
Kennedy extreme

69
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:06,230
up to almost home in which is mesh
networking which is at any given time

70
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:07,620
you don't quite know what you're out

71
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:12,430
ought to be and you've got to have some
way to effectively use all those and we

72
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:14,980
all want to burn application code with
that kind of knowledge

73
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:18,510
so he wouldn't be back

74
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:22,370
it is an extension to TCP

75
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:24,800
adds that functionality and capabilities

76
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,260
that make that functionality possible
and it works over existing

77
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,080
infrastructure

78
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,510
so important thing is the multipath TCP
does not replace TCP

79
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:37,240
multipath TCP is TCP with

80
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,950
a few extra things added on: but

81
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:46,600
now much understand and why am talking
here today is now much understand

82
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,410
including security tools so all that
weirdness that we're talking about

83
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:55,550
%uh early on that carries over into
security tool so if they have to reason

84
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:57,900
about this and make important
security-related decisions about a

85
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:58,650
protocol

86
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:03,070
that they don't get we've got some
problems power

87
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:07,510
how to put the slide in because people
misunderstood we're

88
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:11,480
going back to the thesis its culture
shock

89
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:15,770
not broken protocol it's a cool protocol
it's a useful protocol we like

90
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:21,800
we like and it is really wanted to
succeed so please don't take away

91
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,290
kill it with fire or you know to kill it
all the time or whatever

92
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:28,930
the usual protocol there's a reason is
being developed sup

93
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:32,479
want to succeed on we just want to put
the word out and get people thinking

94
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:33,790
about what this changes

95
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:37,020
yelling for us to talk

96
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:41,979
little background a technical
introduction getting just as far into

97
00:05:41,979 --> 00:05:44,450
how multipath TCP works to understand
why

98
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:48,950
it works that way I'm bikie security
affects the one that we picked out a

99
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:50,910
seemingly the most important going
forward

100
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:55,080
side effects on perimeter security out
what

101
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,729
this change in kinda thought that we had
promised your email down late 90's

102
00:05:58,729 --> 00:06:03,220
not so much anymore network management
if you own or manage a policy for

103
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:03,840
network

104
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,860
what is this change will you have to be
thinking about and then just a little

105
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:08,380
peek

106
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:12,530
into once for a call like this becomes
widespread I wanted to do was that

107
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:15,050
enable so

108
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:18,550
what got us thinking about this in the
first place this is Kate sitting around

109
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:20,800
with a glass of wine reading our seas
for

110
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,220
who knows why

111
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:27,130
she's all this Apple in late 2013

112
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:32,250
makes a big fuss about this thing that
they're there so she follows it up

113
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:35,860
on this fella Olivier Bonaventure
professor by manager at a

114
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:40,450
University up in Belgium I'm is leading
a team who's doing a lot of this work

115
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:43,830
and he had P caps pickups are awesome
you take a look at those

116
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:47,910
and we saw the same period every time
there are tools don't do what you expect

117
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:48,440
them to do

118
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,960
interfaces contractor and

119
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,750
news outlets are you talking about it's
a whole school Apple's investing heavily

120
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,560
in this thing

121
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,630
most will have heard of I'm the register
for some reason hits multi-path I don't

122
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:01,030
know

123
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:05,230
they always are about articles about it
but um ultimately

124
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:09,290
um after that to media flurry

125
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:13,170
think I don't more quiet and

126
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:16,850
I me what what happened I'm

127
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:20,160
people are still working on it
implementations are getting developed

128
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,640
its being pushed into devices

129
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:25,400
that initial flurry for information was
putting it into iPhones

130
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,660
so who where to acquire you know

131
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:33,610
but what's the deal with that we being
scary people

132
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:38,010
like pay you for your call it a looka
was anything but curious

133
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:43,169
two different things here the security
of multipath TCP itself

134
00:07:43,169 --> 00:07:48,150
designing the protocol the handshakes
all that kinda stuff yes

135
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:51,760
they were thinking about it they the the
protocol has

136
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:56,060
assumes I'm really thoughtful choices
there and out for for people developing

137
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:58,630
these experimental things actually do
something really really cool

138
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:02,720
which is along with IRC for the protocol
there really is no receiver threat model

139
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,240
like redesigning this thing here's what
we think they are the attacks you to

140
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,229
where we think we can protect against at
your place that we can't on

141
00:08:09,229 --> 00:08:13,060
that's really cool we need to encourage
that kind effect however

142
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:16,760
now we're talking about that is you know
protocol reason

143
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:21,080
good no we're talking about context that
multi-path runs it

144
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,860
that's what this talk is about want to
change like this mean for network

145
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:25,350
security

146
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:30,180
not have a long talk on that so that's
what we're talking about today

147
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:35,200
ultimately

148
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,410
what is multi-path mean today you start
seeing on your network

149
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:41,620
you know we go back to work next week
what is significant about

150
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:45,790
having an affect things I'm what is tech
like this mean in the future

151
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:50,710
once we should have embraced this and
you know magid a when multi-path is used

152
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:54,190
widely and ipv6 is used widely like how
does that change

153
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:58,390
mesh networking mobile devices ball
ought to stop how does that change the

154
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:00,920
way we have to make security decisions
based on network traffic

155
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:04,610
and then of course I'm just to make sure
that we're not going to 48

156
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:07,710
we're gonna throw out some few seasons
to pick up that actually show

157
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:11,650
but certain things that we're talking
about here okay

158
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:14,750
this is the technical part in ghost
Manta track

159
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:18,260
I promise to get just deep enough into
it too understand

160
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:23,890
a the significant to the Ozarks gonna
TCP

161
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:28,660
defines a connection as IP and port it.
important echoing port to port

162
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:34,170
let's say I P important important not
between some abstract ideas and points

163
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:35,890
academically we could say

164
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:40,470
yes it's a friend 28 and point B but
realistically it's IP port IP port

165
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:44,020
so in the past this was a distinction
without a difference

166
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:48,500
multipath TCP says aha we have the
option

167
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:52,040
up splitting out that that abstract idea
of an endpoint

168
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:57,350
let's do it so multipath TCP connection
is defined by a connection ID

169
00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:02,490
that's it if you can prove that you are
part of a connection

170
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:06,130
van you're allowed to join in that
regardless of where

171
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:08,920
ever you're coming in from on the
Internet whatever IP address again in

172
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:12,230
from an election stuff and PTZ be

173
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:17,490
is is composed a plain old regular TCP
streams with a little bit other option

174
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:21,510
on that so its all the title multipath
TCP

175
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:26,020
is TCP over multiple paths
characteristics

176
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:29,520
the folks designs protocol building
billing implementations

177
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,600
a win for the student backward
compatibility this is huge

178
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,390
you cannot make a change like this I at
scale

179
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:40,100
without pulling teeth if it's not
backward compatible multipath TCP

180
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,770
is and that serve its strength and
that's also one other reasons that we

181
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:44,760
have to be talking about

182
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,920
okay how does it affect things that
we've come to take for granted

183
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,180
performance

184
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:52,030
why bother doing it for performance
wasn't better there are a lot two cases

185
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:52,840
do we care about

186
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,860
were really does have better performance
both in terms of maintaining a

187
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:56,420
connection

188
00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:00,370
in terms amping up capabilities that
action and security

189
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:03,490
the goal was at least as good as now and
they've achieved that

190
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:08,120
I at the protocol itself it looks like

191
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,280
client talk your server over a network

192
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:14,670
plan has a a they are

193
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:17,880
interface here service getting it is
here

194
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:21,080
but no one ever looks pretty reasonable
just looks like

195
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:26,280
to CP so far but what if you have

196
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:29,750
two networks that you can talk over this
is the classic mobile device near

197
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:34,310
if you're over wifi and you you also
wanna talk over L two years

198
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:40,820
like that okay you can make that
connection and again this could seem a

199
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:41,760
little bit like

200
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,150
just regular GDP but here's the
difference

201
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:49,030
in multi-path movies 2

202
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:52,410
TCP connections contributor1 single

203
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:56,410
logical multi perhaps data stream where
you can send

204
00:11:56,410 --> 00:12:00,660
any traffic over either one equally well
and the receiving server which

205
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:07,510
again SBI multi-pack aware will
correctly reassembly you can create

206
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:10,470
you can just keep on adding connections
if you want to if your multiple TCP

207
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:11,630
streams over here

208
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:15,280
use add those connections and stream the
data

209
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:21,240
multiple today across those however you
want the sender at the package chooses

210
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,130
where the data goes

211
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:26,940
so you can choose to saturate network a
in switchover network features a stripe

212
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:27,590
across

213
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:31,090
there any number reasons why you choose
those internet working context

214
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:34,830
a multipath TCP makes it available and
puts the power in the sender's hands

215
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,340
this is going to become important

216
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:41,850
as connections drop or did kill the time
now is a problem with the network

217
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:44,710
this flow can keep going multipass the

218
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:48,500
session higher level logical session
keeps going as long as there's

219
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:52,530
any on the actual TCP sessions there in
fact we will persist

220
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:56,390
even a all the sessions dying within a
pretty reasonable window

221
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:59,630
use pickup in resume where we left off
because multi-path

222
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:03,100
has that understands me dealing in
networks where

223
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:10,100
maybe it's a good thing to do if I use
against

224
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:15,040
slowness or anything like that you can
immediately rescind data and

225
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,990
obviously service two copies of it are
currently incorrectly slot that in

226
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:24,570
and move the the logical window for so

227
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:27,580
if this didn't make a hole in a sense of
this wasn't convincing

228
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:31,490
ultimately these are the series we talk
about for clients

229
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:34,700
mobile devices devices with
heterogeneous networks

230
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:37,920
devices that that need to have

231
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,640
those capabilities to make the best use
whatever networks are available to them

232
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:45,250
so it seems running a custom I data
centers

233
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:49,870
high-availability on the the ability to
failover instantaneously not even call

234
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,230
it a failover to keep the same TCP
streams going

235
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:56,560
all that sort of stuff that's on your so
these are the two major use cases

236
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,030
though just quite recently I was reading
some papers

237
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:03,350
and there is another kinda cool use case
its debts

238
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:07,430
were all networking networking where you
have people who have

239
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:10,520
no reliable network connections
whatsoever and had maybe have a

240
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:14,590
patchwork really question on networking
connections on multi-pack now has some

241
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:14,920
pro

242
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,760
some some reading choices that will they
will help with that as well so this this

243
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,740
is being used so

244
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:23,770
is a useful protocol there are there are
a lot of people developing

245
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:28,540
a approaches to to use it to solve some
very interesting ever

246
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:32,900
housing implement at a high level

247
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:35,940
this is just your regular TCP pack

248
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:39,580
TCP allows you to have an option tear

249
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:42,730
that you can stick other things in

250
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:47,190
extensions to TCP protocol multipath TCP
is one such extension 1

251
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:51,290
I want to top so option type we are MTG

252
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:52,100
p

253
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,680
what kinda panties you pack it is this
isn't a little the data which ultimately

254
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,240
ends up being used to identify
connections and things like that

255
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:04,590
in Wireshark right now PRI Wireshark
from

256
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:08,320
save the last 12 months or something
like that these pop open where certain

257
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,310
look at the Capitol

258
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:12,800
has to pick up later on entirely
readiness Eagles are playing with this

259
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:17,910
immediately high-level

260
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:21,740
8 subtypes we care about couple oven so
hit those

261
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:25,510
and be capable is a ho saying I speak
multi-pack

262
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:29,160
feel free to speak multi-pack written MP
joint

263
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:35,270
I'm attempting to join an existing
connection and DSS this is how it maps

264
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:38,350
all those different TCP sessions all
into one

265
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:41,830
address alone will become important
later

266
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:44,960
says this address also represents

267
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:48,360
me as an endpoint remove address

268
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,460
I'm no longer available on this site the
address please stop talking to me there

269
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:58,460
actual so wats controlling what

270
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:04,380
this capability means just US

271
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:09,830
boom

272
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:16,830
I broken it

273
00:16:17,329 --> 00:16:19,519
there haha promise

274
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,709
we have this capability said a mobile
connections

275
00:16:22,709 --> 00:16:26,850
what role that in Linux right now which
is where the reference implementation

276
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:27,230
leaves

277
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:31,100
there's two is one poll for mash missed
one call

278
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:35,079
and deport remember

279
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:39,850
this is in the TCP stack I said about
above layer 4 and the local Air Force

280
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:40,589
stuff doesn't change

281
00:16:40,589 --> 00:16:44,290
applications is taking vengeance camping
for free which one the reasons is really

282
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:48,740
important and reports

283
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:51,880
sort of an experimental apna aur sort of
the testing

284
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:55,370
experimental approach basically says
when know the client

285
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:59,750
says protection the server it should
also make additional connections to that

286
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:00,410
same server

287
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:03,740
on that same port looks like that

288
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:08,350
not super useful maybe there's a few
contacts in with useful

289
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:11,650
but mostly used for experimentation on
devices you'll have one interface

290
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:12,490
America

291
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:16,500
full mesh work its crazy

292
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:20,679
client talking to a server they will
connect

293
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:23,809
on all IP addresses on all interfaces

294
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:28,260
they choose to advertise to each other
subclans got for possible

295
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:31,830
interface to build my service got four
possible invasion filtered then the

296
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:33,130
connection start with my guess

297
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:38,299
and any of those links are perfectly
valid for

298
00:17:38,299 --> 00:17:45,299
any slice a traffic that you want to
send over a larger the border district

299
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:51,350
a TCP handshake that contains unusual
key information that's where you say

300
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:53,110
here i mean more to get connection

301
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:56,659
here's how to join later on things like
that but

302
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:59,700
keep this peace in mind unit you can
practice

303
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,919
the sender gets to make the choice a
bridge now what they want

304
00:18:02,919 --> 00:18:07,019
now at the center of the client-side or
the any responses down I did that its

305
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:07,860
name from the server

306
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:11,250
whoever's initiating a packet its make
the choice love which should be

307
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,450
available streams that goes down

308
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:16,429
I'll for all these details

309
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:19,750
where you see what you can do on we put
a cheat sheet out of the URL

310
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:22,909
at the end where you can get this
Calcasieu everything

311
00:18:22,909 --> 00:18:27,130
quick to pager so who

312
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:30,309
we're talking about this protocol a
basically the question is

313
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:33,620
is it relevant do people see using this
for

314
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:39,440
important stuff no one really using it
at large scale yet this technology

315
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:45,440
is is very nascent its a I it's mostly
being used for experimentation to prove

316
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,820
the case they can use large-scale

317
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:50,330
however couple very interesting
exceptions

318
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:53,389
I O S seven it ships on

319
00:18:53,389 --> 00:18:58,240
every iPhone its use for seared to be
able to maintain that

320
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,309
always-on connectivity that that
immediate responsiveness that quick

321
00:19:01,309 --> 00:19:02,019
failover

322
00:19:02,019 --> 00:19:07,240
so that you have a seamless user
interface they put a lot of Engineering

323
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:07,870
capital

324
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:12,590
into in to put it on and turn on for
that exact one system and

325
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:16,000
seems like that was that were successful
at something you like doing

326
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,120
because then in Yosemite they shipped it
enabled by default on all machines

327
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:23,870
now we do test earlier today I mean it
doesn't look like it's being

328
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:26,970
used for r4

329
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:30,799
arbitrary traffic but it is on a machine
that is an able that their capabilities

330
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,480
there may be turned on so

331
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,100
this is a huge engineering investment to
it but this technology out there it'll

332
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:41,510
be interesting to see at what point they
decided to go whole hog with it a couple

333
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:42,880
for external things your honor

334
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,100
other kit

335
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:49,549
not just Apple were numerous base you
react to

336
00:19:49,549 --> 00:19:53,179
Citrix Cisco I Citrix its Internet
scaler

337
00:19:53,179 --> 00:19:57,179
full implementation ovett three to go on
Cisco

338
00:19:57,179 --> 00:20:00,590
a bunch for their firewalls and device
in the fact that understanding and

339
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:03,270
intelligent decisions about it
intelligent decision most cases the

340
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,380
default is just rip it

341
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:08,070
but it's there I Apple obviously big
engineering effort

342
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:11,770
or causes the bringing the sole heiress
right now and I the

343
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:15,110
big AP is multipath TCP where

344
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:18,900
so we can do all that good stuff to

345
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:23,710
a lot of people wager and that's a lot
of people seeing this technology solves

346
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:27,590
some problems there have not want

347
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:32,279
a Microsoft kinda par for the course is
all is ill kg on on

348
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:36,909
sorta on on announced features so on
this isn't surprising I wouldn't read

349
00:20:36,909 --> 00:20:37,600
too much into this

350
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:42,740
if you want to get this working jointly
with it on your own

351
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:46,590
Linex are you can just go and get the
packages it'll work

352
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:50,380
apt-get install reboot you are MPTP
table that's awesome

353
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:54,440
arm don't try and go put on Kali

354
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:57,669
right away I try something else first
play with it on

355
00:20:57,669 --> 00:21:01,820
it can work you just gonna after a mess
for some things and I'll be annoying but

356
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:05,330
if you go to that effort I'm k tried it
out and played

357
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:08,950
and found yes once you get multi-path
working a

358
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:13,230
Metasploit will very happily run all its
payloads and all that kinda stuff

359
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:16,570
over over multipath and do crazy things
like that

360
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:20,809
so up yes really applications don't have
to know about it signature

361
00:21:20,809 --> 00:21:24,059
I'm this guy I think

362
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:27,090
also at the University a.m. in Belgium

363
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:30,720
I'm made a really excellent Stevie
implementation

364
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,149
are all of this stuff you wanna play
with it you do not need to start from

365
00:21:34,149 --> 00:21:34,649
scratch

366
00:21:34,649 --> 00:21:39,130
highly recommend you check out his stuff
our tools are are just a thin veneer

367
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:40,450
over top of that

368
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:43,500
so I'm huge props to him so a

369
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:47,720
amputees peacekeeping and get help are

370
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:51,890
this is this is the meeting or talking
biochemical

371
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:56,610
need tech so what here's what we've got

372
00:21:56,610 --> 00:22:02,600
4 mean pieces on the stromal appear
cross paths fragmentation

373
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,610
sure what time it is the whole point is
the ability to do

374
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:09,030
cross paths fragmentation now been nine
clients

375
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:13,220
rational reasonable clients are not
going to do any the crazy stuff to talk

376
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:13,620
about

377
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:18,070
however attackers can choose to do
whatever they want as long as the

378
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:21,190
be receiving she understands and that's
where summit this site comes in

379
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:26,340
moving target the idea that you can
change the IP addresses in the middle

380
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,180
the connection

381
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:32,070
potentially bouncing through multiple
ones I'm

382
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:35,400
a lotta tools don't expect logical
connections

383
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:39,260
to have different IP addresses within
New the light on a connection that's

384
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:43,380
a little bit unusual connection
resilience anything is based on trying

385
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:43,990
to

386
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:47,170
tear down connections by New Kingdom one
one by one

387
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:51,670
I like sending wrist slap a great fire
wall China type thing that kinda goes

388
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:52,540
out the window

389
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:55,770
when you can just pick up where you left
off as soon as you get

390
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:59,240
any kind a connection use it for the
length of it and when he is trying to

391
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,590
down you got another one ready to go

392
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:05,110
and then reversed connections into this
a little bit more later

393
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:08,860
but this is this is worse are talking
about a network architecture James

394
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:11,900
so kinda

395
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:15,840
if you want a gray one slide because if
these four key security

396
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:21,520
affects if the approach to security

397
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:25,810
requires any other these things if you
expect to see

398
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:28,910
all the App Player stuff in the TCP
stream

399
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:34,490
that's no longer going to work if you
expect to associate a logical sessions

400
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:36,000
at your application layer

401
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,610
or for I if your weather app is looking
at

402
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:42,940
the person coming on this AP leap in the
cookie and that kinda stuff

403
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:47,960
that's not gonna work anymore you try to
close bad connections basically in a

404
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,400
play whack-a-mole with connections

405
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,880
that's not gonna work anymore and then
finally this other one

406
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:57,630
differentiate clients from servers based
on the direction

407
00:23:57,630 --> 00:24:02,600
at the same based on the direction the
traffic that might not hold true anymore

408
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,950
and and networking people start with you
with a very worried look on their face

409
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:06,679
when I say that

410
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:09,490
so if you rely reviews and

411
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:12,330
on all security relies on this so this
is this is not the the world coming

412
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:12,970
crashing down

413
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:16,920
these are just assumptions that we have
made that have historically been true

414
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:20,929
vet are not necessarily going to be true

415
00:24:20,929 --> 00:24:26,850
in the Internet in the future top up

416
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:30,330
out practice was this today yes

417
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:34,600
these things will totally work democrat
up but

418
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:38,200
promise the client and server will have
to speak multipath TCP and as we talked

419
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:38,870
about before

420
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:41,960
there's not that many multi-party should
be speaking servers so it's great

421
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:45,250
the attacks me the attacks are the
vision thing I can stuff will work

422
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:52,250
but know is actually Alberto but they're
coming in

423
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,670
if Paul MPTP speaking world when

424
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:59,530
when we use it for things we expect your
network when our vendor support all that

425
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:00,050
good stuff

426
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:03,480
then essentially from both goes goes
away goes nearly 20

427
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:06,780
the defective analogy here is like a
ipv6

428
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:09,800
when it first on coming out Inc it was
showing up that

429
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:13,880
that supported it and maybe our network
devices didn't know we didn't understand

430
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,660
we weren't looking for that kind of
traffic

431
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:19,429
then something like this spike attack
comes possible where all your devices

432
00:25:19,429 --> 00:25:20,910
speak at the v6

433
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:24,100
and some good advertised hey let's train
ipv6 network

434
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:28,570
and all of your network goes starships
talking over that and you're not monitor

435
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:32,070
so it's that same sort of thing that
once as capabilities exist

436
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:35,470
if we're not using legitimately for not
managing them then attackers will say

437
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:36,210
hey cool

438
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:40,200
with you this so we have to get there

439
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:45,400
you

440
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:49,840
14 I'm as I said only thing to be
partially mitigated

441
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,850
but there is some reacting to do or are
there there is this

442
00:25:53,850 --> 00:26:00,330
understanding love that bit but we do
want multiple flows to Bill coming in

443
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:03,110
from multiple places because that solve
some real network problems

444
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:06,600
that either they were having I a check
on the mobile side on the data center

445
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,430
side any back

446
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:14,400
packet

447
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,880
sender decides where to send

448
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:21,970
I get

449
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:25,040
normal benign clients are going to do
any this crazy stuff

450
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:32,040
but just for a moment let's not be a
benign point so when I got here is

451
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:35,200
before the pressure the the video
running

452
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:41,040
I'm miss is a a IDS distro Linux distro
called security onion

453
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:44,550
that is really action here or play with
my DS stuff or really good said he saw

454
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:45,280
quite quickly

455
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:50,430
I'm definitely check it out to do here

456
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:57,430
use be them

457
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:03,740
mmm

458
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:10,420
and why no one else having problems with
that

459
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:17,420
are

460
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:21,870
so super plain vanilla insulation %uh

461
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:25,780
snort I'm not picking on snort it was
just on sturdy and very easy to set up

462
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:28,870
believing we changed on it is we've set
up a

463
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:33,820
up a signature to match basically a
dummy payload that we can use for a

464
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:36,650
second tale the alert log

465
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:40,240
anything with the sensor detects shop
here

466
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,350
for this you know i snort say intrusion
detection system

467
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:47,020
missed on a payload here and he be
fragment her

468
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:52,120
miss an no.1 this is a degenerate cases
regular GCP

469
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:55,150
with regular HTTP send a connection

470
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:58,809
and the IDS is hey there's something
malicious going on any network my

471
00:27:58,809 --> 00:28:00,250
signature picked up on us

472
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:04,919
okay sending you get

473
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:08,440
talking to a multi-track capable server
we saying it was an

474
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:11,669
any people five mistake or payload

475
00:28:11,669 --> 00:28:15,890
we're gonna split it up and multi-plex
it basically die said over five streams

476
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:19,179
open up by TCP connections send payload

477
00:28:19,179 --> 00:28:24,200
tear down all streams idea says

478
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:29,530
everything's cool no problems here why

479
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:32,919
so we go get the

480
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:36,630
are the traffic here which flight

481
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:41,590
normal TCP normal HTTP but if we pick
one of these out

482
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:46,570
actually look at it random how about
that

483
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:53,570
or

484
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:00,320
Allstream Jersey get

485
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:05,600
slash neo damn what they should say is
get new demo test new line host Eagles

486
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,350
this

487
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:10,570
all the cast of it should be a full HD
your quest we see the response here

488
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:15,640
a response to an invalid request this is
because our payload was

489
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:19,559
40 characters are so we fly standby by
five pieces

490
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:22,740
and then each other those pieces went
down

491
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:27,030
just one pack at which point the IDS if
its signature based

492
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:31,890
has nowhere to match the signature there
there is not enough context on any given

493
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:36,040
Pat to be able to do that and and this
is really just a traditional

494
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,460
fragmentation attack

495
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:40,600
like you know from the late 80's 92nd
stop

496
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,950
and more UN map says hey and fragment in
time

497
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:47,179
to a smaller packets slowdown

498
00:29:47,179 --> 00:29:51,360
don't provide I'm middle boxes with the
context understand that there is

499
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,500
something which is going on

500
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:55,940
so its fragmentation time this is
fragmentation in space

501
00:29:55,940 --> 00:30:02,940
or across TCP streams and its effect

502
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:22,580
per mister

503
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:26,400
what about the Spitfire also this gets
to something that I've alluded to but we

504
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,190
haven't talked about it

505
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:33,640
it has the possibility to change things
for primers I will preface this

506
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:37,480
by saying that will not talk about here
exists in the spec

507
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:41,660
there are reasons for it to exist there
are some interesting scenarios

508
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:45,520
it hasn't been implemented yet this may
never come to pass

509
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:50,860
but if it does what howdy how would you
like it outbound

510
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:54,780
incoming connection let's do

511
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:58,200
this network diagram to client talking
server through firewall

512
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:02,240
was good so far Sen Cenac

513
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,700
hey complex options were talking and it
is P

514
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:08,940
ac a run

515
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:13,330
on some future packet this client

516
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:17,280
can say add address when we talked about
those various types of him he's P

517
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:17,870
messages

518
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:21,330
one of those his address which says hey

519
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:28,330
I'm available on another IP address the
internal host

520
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:31,660
cult server here has the option

521
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:36,429
is not required to but may initiate a
connection

522
00:31:36,429 --> 00:31:43,429
outbound to talk together host point and
so the question right here is

523
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:47,480
is this new connection incoming or
outgoing

524
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:53,280
from my dataflow perspective the initial
client server where this way

525
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:57,200
but from a traditional like the
direction the scene establishes a

526
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:57,980
relationship

527
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:03,169
this is an outgoing connection this port
actually

528
00:32:03,169 --> 00:32:06,470
typically is is the same as this port um
but

529
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:09,850
a it could be different there is still
bring it on a spec

530
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:13,850
so is Inc is this incoming or outgoing
and and a week after I went around

531
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:14,990
around around on this

532
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:18,950
I'm and eventually we trying to say
whether is this

533
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:22,880
semantic source actually real difference
Angeles said we can come to a decision

534
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:28,200
you get okay so you can

535
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,880
and indeed this is legitimate computer
I'm

536
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,260
if something like this exists in your
network which could be useful for any

537
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:38,380
for any number above situations and an
actor personal or any that

538
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:41,730
um do you want this to exist is a good
thing

539
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:47,240
but paid it could be there with fewer
which gets us to

540
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:50,700
network management be aware of it is
really the point going on here

541
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:55,570
I'm both if you to also understand that
they can help you make

542
00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:58,940
the security decisions we want to make
when we're looking at content

543
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:03,510
we're looking when we're doing
inspection track here's wishing case

544
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:06,530
this is Firefox

545
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:09,540
grabbing one webpage from one server

546
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:13,200
palm Paul

547
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,610
always customization case this is the
mesh networking with multiple at

548
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:17,510
addresses

549
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:21,770
and again normal rational client won't
be doing all it can to stop

550
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:24,770
but if you don't have the ability to say

551
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:28,010
to condense all this down to a logical
view the endpoint endpoint

552
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:32,580
rather than IP port I Keyport then you
get something looks like this

553
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:36,190
that exact same traffic

554
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:39,280
if you can at least cluster by IP
address

555
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:43,080
and then if you truly understand
multi-path this if it looks like becomes

556
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:43,840
very clear

557
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:50,330
that it's this machine in this machine
talking so what defenses are now

558
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:53,810
it works and I feel so bad with this
right now that I've got people and

559
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:55,620
technology-based keynote this morning

560
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:59,080
on but I will try to avoid the traps
earlier people

561
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:02,690
you're here you're learning about it I
educate yourself

562
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:06,950
if this is coming may start making
decisions in it technology

563
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:11,290
part your vendors to support this do you
want to support this were used his way

564
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:12,260
should be useful

565
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:16,100
arm if this starts flowing through metal
boxes you care about are then you know

566
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:16,790
what to make of it

567
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:20,980
new look for use talked a little bit of
ipv6 earlier

568
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:25,940
up that it started going in today to
senator start going into devices

569
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:29,429
and we've kinda had to say deal that
things are adding support for

570
00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:32,540
part we may not have known that
immediately

571
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:35,950
so I'm look for if it's being added to
the races

572
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:37,900
work for if it's actually being

573
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:41,100
used in your network and finally

574
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:45,650
architecture I'm there are about simple
uses this technology but maybe you don't

575
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:46,010
want

576
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:49,840
used in all places so maybe decide hey

577
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:53,680
a great solution for us is to terminate
at the perimeter we like it

578
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:56,960
is mutual will bring it in and was
terminated the same place we terminate

579
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:57,590
SSL

580
00:34:57,590 --> 00:35:01,410
entry as one of those things that I'm we
need to go away

581
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:04,130
for us to do certain piece in the
network and they may be a fan it out

582
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:04,670
again

583
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:09,030
um late for their new data center or two
other separate sites things like that

584
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:12,090
so there there are some some resembles

585
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:15,630
reasonably simple architectural choices
you can make if you decide that it's

586
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:17,880
maybe too much chaos for certain parts
of the network

587
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:22,380
speaking of support we have a scanner

588
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:26,590
that will be able to scan open ports
it's not you know it's not gonna try to

589
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:27,230
place on map

590
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:30,840
you tell it open ports and it will talk
to the sports and see if the underlying

591
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,190
I have machine

592
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:38,410
speaks multipath TCP basically test
advice for parents support does it's

593
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:39,180
typically

594
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:43,650
supported and it is super actual support
by trying to open up a multi-pack

595
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:44,210
connection

596
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:47,500
some devices beware starving looking at
the stuff this

597
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:51,220
lots of middle boxes or or other
firewall die-cast up

598
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:55,000
those blindly echo packets II coaches be
options back at you

599
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,410
on I'm talk a good game or China a great
for all China

600
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:02,240
on if you try and scan it it will just
blindly echo on

601
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:06,810
TCP options so I'm were you actually
have to test for real support not just

602
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:07,790
advertise support

603
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:11,440
basically Sen

604
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:15,940
ac join a with a random

605
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:19,440
invalid ID here and a

606
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,820
served actually understand and he's p
well say K

607
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:26,190
you've attempted to incorrectly joint in
MTG AB session

608
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:29,290
when it doesn't actually support it will
say okay

609
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:32,610
the ballad TCP session that's all I know
about cool

610
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:36,320
third that tools out there if i if you
wanna start going to your network into

611
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:36,770
hate

612
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:41,550
what what kinda boxes we're up in a
sport this stripping

613
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:44,610
talked about this earlier if you are

614
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:47,650
if you want to take a manager in some
places but not others

615
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:50,480
you can now you can proxy in terminated

616
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,460
that's perfectly reasonable choice I'm
if you decide

617
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:57,079
that just for whatever reason you need
to kill it farrell rules are

618
00:36:57,079 --> 00:37:00,480
a table strip options 30 or first I Wes

619
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:03,849
the strip options or artist B after
thirty 30 clear

620
00:37:03,849 --> 00:37:07,069
that will make it go away um this turns
out to be the default

621
00:37:07,069 --> 00:37:10,069
on a lot of fiscal year so you may not
you have to make that change

622
00:37:10,069 --> 00:37:14,349
but a that's up basically is the

623
00:37:14,349 --> 00:37:20,520
till it will deal with it later approach
active network security now we've been

624
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,789
talking a little bit about privacy and
things like that

625
00:37:22,789 --> 00:37:29,619
multi-party sipes even more resistant to
network tampering redirection that kinda

626
00:37:29,619 --> 00:37:30,059
stuff

627
00:37:30,059 --> 00:37:35,059
in GDP that's not a huge go love it but
just by way of doing things

628
00:37:35,059 --> 00:37:38,420
essentially if you want to if you own a
minimal traffic you have to be there on

629
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:39,349
the first connection

630
00:37:39,349 --> 00:37:43,309
and you gotta performs a nontrivial
calculations

631
00:37:43,309 --> 00:37:50,309
to maintain the state all the different
connections

632
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:53,290
yes I agree with you

633
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:57,520
I have summer that concern I the folks
who actually developing protocol

634
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:02,750
which I am definitely not one I a they
are doing some things to manage that but

635
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:04,320
I think that is an open question that
will

636
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:11,320
really matter for adoption this i think
is one

637
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:16,630
%uh be be reasons they did impede his
peace got an interesting shot

638
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:21,830
it's moving power to that internet ideal
taken a

639
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:26,290
ATF ideal love power to the endpoints
that the network should be able to exist

640
00:38:26,290 --> 00:38:28,630
and be in flux and maybe not be trusted

641
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:34,060
but we have our clients and our server
should be able to talk in a way that

642
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:35,030
works for them

643
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:39,240
one example being you know if you get
your ISP

644
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:42,560
you show your company and your swing
gate across that am

645
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:46,950
you gonna show have to to trust either
of them with all that data you can split

646
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:47,550
across it

647
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:52,380
and if you got it on you have multiple
networks the donor so we trust each

648
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:52,860
other

649
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:59,860
then there are possibly some games there
in practice split trust crypto

650
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:06,190
I'm not sold on this I but some people
are talking about it

651
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:09,850
if you maybe if you are conducting
different parts to the negotiation over

652
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:10,870
different protocols

653
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:14,400
I'm is there a gain there is that
something worth doing

654
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,740
Morsi people are working on it and and
multi-path agility

655
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:22,180
I'm there's I think much talked a lot
about crypto agility of God We Trust for

656
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:22,880
how long

657
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,150
why and the same thing coming to network
paths

658
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:29,600
on we can we can make choices in the
middle the connection without actually

659
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,180
affecting the services that are writing
to

660
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:35,250
on topics and that very issue leading
research

661
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:39,010
in the private events on here who's in

662
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:42,370
well to bad is awesome and it's coming
I'm

663
00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:46,370
if not explicitly impeaches p this is
the one that looks like I'll probably

664
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:46,940
make an

665
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:50,850
but a technology that serves all these
network needs a network purposes

666
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:57,290
so a something is coming

667
00:39:57,290 --> 00:40:00,369
and traffic inspection is going to get
harder

668
00:40:00,369 --> 00:40:05,700
just the the active above trying to get
machine physically together

669
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:09,210
to talk and reassemble data when some
other traffic is gone over separate

670
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:09,849
networks

671
00:40:09,849 --> 00:40:13,540
is your YouTube and it being limited by
geography speed of light

672
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:17,540
those sorts of thing the logistics I'll
moving information about

673
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:21,310
I what we've captured from partial pads
to a central location

674
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:24,530
that makes it harder for for active
network attackers

675
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:28,390
for people monitor networks overcast and

676
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:31,599
ultimately we're talking about this now
keep talking about it

677
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:34,740
if you're interested in using the stack
look it up if you're interested be

678
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:39,540
in managing this tech show talking
offenders back mister try it

679
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:43,010
we've got to get out there here's a
challenge um that

680
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:45,859
if you're interested in spending if you
wanna try out a little bit sleepy

681
00:40:45,859 --> 00:40:49,520
candidate dip your toe into it the the
ultimate solution is about

682
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:53,140
dozen lines a pipe on a site that's what
has me huge investment on

683
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:56,599
the solutions out there just a peek if
you if you want to do it yourself please

684
00:40:56,599 --> 00:41:01,369
play with it get involved and your
questions on the acting up afterward

685
00:41:01,369 --> 00:41:08,369
for you go questions %ah

686
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:14,780
we

687
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:18,960
0

688
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,280
has been a long day

689
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:26,240
said up

690
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:33,240
probably happy to outside

691
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,440
so

692
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,110
RI not super familiar with its net
recruiting

693
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:57,220
um so i cant give a precise

694
00:41:57,220 --> 00:42:01,400
answer to that um are you talking about
like that that at

695
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:04,600
all outgoing traffic comes in one way
and incoming traffic comes in the other

696
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:08,620
so yeah

697
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:14,430
this this is it on this hide it from the
applications applications don't need to

698
00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:15,660
know anything about this

699
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:19,460
the one question is are they gonna be
API's for applications to you

700
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:23,370
influence the decision that they're out
managers take are probably

701
00:42:23,370 --> 00:42:26,420
to be determined wanna questions but are

702
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:30,530
ultimately this works and I think the

703
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:34,420
the example of once you get it working
on se Kali or something like that

704
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:38,940
a an application is very particular
about being able then being able to

705
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:41,070
manipulate the network a low-level
things like that like

706
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:45,030
Metasploit I that just works so

707
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:49,580
I the if your question is is it going to
cause incompatibility

708
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:53,270
by and large no if the question is I'm
is gonna cause

709
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:56,640
potentially I'm weirdness

710
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:03,640
in how we manage the network carry
monitor the network absolutely

711
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:10,150
up

712
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:12,650
yes and that's a

713
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:16,740
a getting that to be the case has been a
little bit of a headache for the people

714
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:18,200
implementing it because

715
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:21,240
ultimately if you gonna do be able to
pet to traverse

716
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:24,460
a gnat you have to let the NAT rewrite
some packets

717
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:27,980
and and they want to have this BS
resistant

718
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:32,720
to manipulation they wanna the flows
beatrice imitations possible but not his

719
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:33,510
manipulation

720
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:36,740
so there are pieces love up

721
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:40,220
the multi-path header that they would
like to check some

722
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:43,540
that they choose not to to to tolerate
net and

723
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:50,200
job yeah its mmm

724
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:57,200
up

725
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:04,720
that part I don't think yeah if you if
you are a diverse as an internal network

726
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,610
or if you advertise the address at the
NAT

727
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:10,720
it is never heard of on that step that
it's gonna come in its gonna bark of it

728
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:11,300
than that

729
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:18,300
and I connection just won't work up

730
00:44:21,050 --> 00:44:24,060
yeah I yes

731
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:28,480
I E don't have an answer I know you can
start the initial connections to net and

732
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:29,580
I was actually reading

733
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:33,930
the other night about someone at
headaches I don't have a keep

734
00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:37,250
yeah at that one sack our um

735
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:41,830
but I probably need to go do some more
looking on

736
00:44:41,830 --> 00:44:45,670
whether there's any way I mean just
always stunning things like that take to

737
00:44:45,670 --> 00:44:48,140
get to do not reversible 10 minutes like
novelty that anymore

738
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:51,200
on so yeah I don't think that

739
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:58,200
that has a way to work once

740
00:45:04,330 --> 00:45:06,780
yes that was I had a slight on

741
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:10,370
I was debating putting it in there but I
don't want to invest too much

742
00:45:10,370 --> 00:45:15,170
up capital yet in saying hey there's
always things like we can do and what

743
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:15,480
not

744
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:19,990
but I'm but yeah if you are I'm
connecting to torture and then you're

745
00:45:19,990 --> 00:45:20,950
fragmenting

746
00:45:20,950 --> 00:45:24,880
your you know different a few bites your
backs they're all the way through this

747
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:29,580
then it can even tear down the ability
of doing my timing attacks or or you

748
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:30,690
know and you that I'm asking

749
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:34,200
I'm there are definitely people working
on some of those ideas

750
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:38,430
and I you know I hesitate to say that
just that fragmentation is

751
00:45:38,430 --> 00:45:41,930
is affective privacy but it's certainly
a piece of it

752
00:45:41,930 --> 00:45:45,560
and and a a a mesh network type thing I
tore

753
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:48,990
whitten the ability to do all the houses
you want same time

754
00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:55,990
begins its medical stuff

755
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:59,890
he he said it's going to be expensive
for the NSA to to monitor traffic and

756
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:00,740
he's absolutely right

757
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:07,740
this raises be the level up effort for
people monitor

758
00:46:14,609 --> 00:46:21,609
mmm

759
00:46:25,299 --> 00:46:27,400
me

760
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:32,520
um somewhat possible right now there's a
buncha papers actually I had the

761
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:36,080
the row Africa one up there and there's
some yesterday paper on on connecting

762
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:37,110
rural Scotland

763
00:46:37,110 --> 00:46:40,400
where I'm basically they would have up

764
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:46,410
everybody connect to local hob and that
use multi pack TCP to try and reach out

765
00:46:46,410 --> 00:46:48,760
across much different connections and it
was

766
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:51,990
a proxy that took normal traffic I'm

767
00:46:51,990 --> 00:46:55,460
and then split it out over multipath to
other proxies

768
00:46:55,460 --> 00:47:00,350
and and that was using slight
modifications of existing proxy tools

769
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:04,840
so in in

770
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:08,300
in the case there is a striking out
there is yet they didn't want to have

771
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:09,150
all of their

772
00:47:09,150 --> 00:47:12,780
the people being served in a row
internet I'm have to have

773
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:18,950
multi-path I stuff and there's not a lot
most got service after you

774
00:47:18,950 --> 00:47:22,400
I I'll Sayyad

775
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:26,599
thats a former coming infrastructure
type view

776
00:47:26,599 --> 00:47:33,599
love it but day use mostly official
proxy tools

777
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:03,710
and so forth a reflection attacked for
the add for small

778
00:48:03,710 --> 00:48:08,740
the the peace thereof actually having a
server can expect somebody else that

779
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:09,790
isn't implemented yet

780
00:48:09,790 --> 00:48:13,410
and and that might be part of why it is
but in that case you wouldn't get any

781
00:48:13,410 --> 00:48:16,030
multiplication and I think Dolce without
multiplication

782
00:48:16,030 --> 00:48:19,290
is you know San um

783
00:48:19,290 --> 00:48:23,710
mmm injures the protocol and like are
three potentially see like they're being

784
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:25,660
gaping own abilities and supply ken

785
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:29,130
they made some really conservative
choices I don't foresee

786
00:48:29,130 --> 00:48:33,900
anything really nasty coming out the
protocol and if they're in there

787
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:37,390
really looking at what has TCP done what
are those lessons learned there

788
00:48:37,390 --> 00:48:44,390
and let's make sure we don't make any of
those mistakes

789
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:04,530
so at that point you're basically
talking about Pam something could just

790
00:49:04,530 --> 00:49:05,360
as well applied

791
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:08,950
TCP like if you're on the server chip
control the server if you can look at

792
00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:12,370
I'm the a TCP connection sequence

793
00:49:12,370 --> 00:49:15,780
ID's and things like that at that point
is projected to be connections

794
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:19,880
on multi-path doesn't he is no better
protected against

795
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:23,270
already owning machining Alexis at so
I'm

796
00:49:23,270 --> 00:49:27,230
the in that case that's one place is Ray
said we want to be no worse than TCP

797
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:32,510
and no sir

798
00:49:32,510 --> 00:49:34,240
%ah
