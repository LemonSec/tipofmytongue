if sand this request

360
00:22:43,129 --> 00:22:47,299
I'll when continue onto

361
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:50,669
connectionstring so on the server or

362
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:55,919
a have crash I'll rewrite this
connection

363

368
00:23:14,529 --> 00:23:18,100
for fix it this world we need to style
I'll

369
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:24,720
this substituting art up

370
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,440
okay well hooked about server on

371

priligy can sent

384
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:22,009
can track on a tool up Sapa to conduct

385
00:24:22,009 --> 00:24:25,470
I might be up content provider

386
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:30,740
I would include a SQL injection dais

387
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:37,320
oh well loyalties fix it on

388
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,100
a food

389
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:44,330
love for her to cantaloupe this to
install this

390
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:51,039
up security not I'll

391
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:53,210
about the Safari a

392
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:56,380
I yes tough think so

393
00:24:56,380 --> 00:25:00,049
across Asia information about the

394
00:25:00,049 --> 00:25:04,850
for p.m. about plot for all but I i
would tell you about disappear Afaria

395
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:08,080
what is set severe fire teaser

396
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,659
and then solution prone it's a big
company

397
00:25:11,659 --> 00:25:15,429
and damn it is a mobile device
management

398
00:25:15,429 --> 00:25:18,740
the for us the the protocols initially
developed by

399
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:21,860
other company XO let and

400
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,450
cold a

401
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:26,220
session expressed and was developing

402
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:30,200
1990s so I'm up I after the

403
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:34,539
her shootout a Arab reading

404
00:25:34,539 --> 00:25:38,080
and a finally lost ball by

405
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,820
cyber a San after fact-based or small

406
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:46,049
I a a.s.a.p and came problem well

407
00:25:46,049 --> 00:25:49,110
a a SAP

408
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:52,220
a release a so if I hope

409
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:55,870
SAP a failure so

410
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:59,240
as a set SAP Afaria Pisa

411
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:02,830
MDM solution a it's the

412
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:05,900
a use the we've if

413
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:11,370
it the solution often use the a a
subpoena by a plot former

414
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:15,210
a in from Tennessee you know the both
this a

415
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:19,860
solution share one database that's why
you for an attacker can compromise

416
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:23,659
a a about part for he can get access to
the

417
00:26:23,659 --> 00:26:26,679
Sep a higher and and

418
00:26:26,679 --> 00:26:29,850
and other way for tactic from Mike a

419
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:34,140
a subpoena her Africa get better for all
a subpoena about pokémon

420
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:37,450
that's the why important protect both
the system's

421
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:40,770
and hardcore ok so

422
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:44,590
the my idea of a and ill

423
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:47,659
solution is control income protection
lebowe devices

424
00:26:47,659 --> 00:26:51,150
a used by the company and it's a plus

425
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:51,700
a

426
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:56,649
and a a mobile device management or MDMA
a

427
00:26:56,649 --> 00:27:00,500
has a two main goals a frost secure
corporate data

428
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:04,139
on any device of how the corporate
network

429
00:27:04,139 --> 00:27:09,860
as the second why it to a controlling
the state all the device

430
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:13,309
themself so a that's why I

431
00:27:13,309 --> 00:27:17,409
all portable devices feature Houston

432
00:27:17,409 --> 00:27:21,559
company a a connect to the

433
00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:25,820
a on this device is powered a as a PFR a
client a

434
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:29,019
a this classic this all

435
00:27:29,019 --> 00:27:32,470
to pry into about part for all a

436
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:35,549
you for a and roll for i/o the

437
00:27:35,549 --> 00:27:38,629
the for mobile devices according to
family life

438
00:27:38,629 --> 00:27:42,799
Astra after the a portable device
connected

439
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:46,789
to use a a fire server the

440
00:27:46,789 --> 00:27:49,950
all the devices available fro

441
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:53,720
for administrator kick and a

442
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:57,000
superior fire mister can manage that
device control

443
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,669
the the the apply for the C et cetera

444
00:28:00,669 --> 00:28:03,769
also admit to it or can a

445
00:28:03,769 --> 00:28:07,340
great a group of device and apply a all
these

446
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:10,409
a all available policies a to

447
00:28:10,409 --> 00:28:13,730
group of device and how it works a a

448
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:17,620
I will sure a a dictator so

449
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:21,879
the pearls a and Giza our own policy

450
00:28:21,879 --> 00:28:25,610
now what is what was that a a

451
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:28,870
a client successfully as the

452
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:32,639
into client the client the

453
00:28:32,639 --> 00:28:37,509
short his power all their for employers
who follows their

454
00:28:37,509 --> 00:28:41,190
up portable device a our client a

455
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:44,909
application after that he need to enroll

456
00:28:44,909 --> 00:28:48,470
a a policy and

457
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:52,179
for that he a have had to wait for that

458
00:28:52,179 --> 00:28:55,340
first of all he can use a self-service

459

474
00:29:51,309 --> 00:29:54,800
Google a up after that

475

476
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:01,679
a of tropical shorter euro

477
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:05,280
have this the court bro I read it

478
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:08,850
by the stator to I'll employer

479
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:12,000
and when implore the six little of it

480
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,330
a of our clients all the I was there the

481
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:18,780
ever for example here just the
intervista

482
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:22,000
aroma coal to a

483
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,700
as a class successfully a no lauded a

484
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:29,530
all needed information about a higher
yes there are

485
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:33,250
so a aroma called a

486
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:38,020
we should use the a misused by

487

10 euro darkness a teach our set

488

for Google to earth they stop be G

489
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:48,540
chaucer and for example a if attacker

490
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:52,190
a like a boy she can try to break for
some a

00:31:01,809 --> 00:31:06,790
configuration policies

494
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:08,740
Lana yeah

running causes done devices and of
course the last 1i forgot

585
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:48,360
most interesting it is a a a

586
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,760

the next thanks for trying tho the Lord
a Honda

615
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:39,190
client for under or and to compile them
'cause the youth job us a

616
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:42,390
languishes the we saw

617
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:45,400
are up caucus a

618
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:48,830
application was the first date we can't
see

619
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:52,340
any class name pair even a all popular

620
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:55,000
and over the computer like a two-degree

621
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,170
me the can to compile some interesting a

622
00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:01,610
not mess up issues for encryption
program

623
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:05,700
a

624
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:09,090
also or a fiery clients a

625
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:12,660
in our case for Android

626
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:17,250
in a fire class from both like this some
our checks

627
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:20,640
reach a the tech for example a

628
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:25,510
wrote exercises a fall and census
information to the sever

629
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:29,950
and that mister soul a rooted devices or
jailbreak

630
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:34,560
devices miles away also the file to

631
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:38,310
the that's all good news but to also
found a

632
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:41,380
up to

633
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:45,090
10 abilities its Classica

634
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:49,670
mission operation check my abilities I

635
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:53,000
I him the

636
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,190
I in one of the source up

637
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:59,300
of iraq's ever a

638
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:02,470
the it's allowed to or

639
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:06,150
or establish connection a using Cup

640
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:10,880
special up I i think is called coach and
I'll

641
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,880
it's a a channel so it's a a

642
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:17,200
thinks which allow I tool

643
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,880
a higher than Twitter up to mate from

644
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,980
I'll actually for a

645
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:29,120
device for example she can a create a
channel

646
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:32,370
a richer we'll be

647
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:36,070
a a force the some policies you for

648
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:39,420
detective rooted device for example so

649
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:43,390
up weaker a

650
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:46,710
we can we found few a

651
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:51,520
if gonna to to only two a Commons
Treasury can use a

652
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:56,020
poor without identification one of them
from china /url

653
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:59,720
than other one is a test a for

654
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:02,850
104 into think around shall allow both

655
00:41:02,850 --> 00:41:06,820
up to Ponta IP address and port

656
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:10,160
a if we sent this request to the server
up RS ever

657
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:13,700
I a fire serra will try to connect to

658
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:17,970
we've this Paul King a pointed to IP
address on his

659
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:21,140
a a port number and try to

660
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:24,500
establish a channel connection a
