1
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:04,410
okay so I'm

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:07,810
welcome everybody to a the frost talk of
the

3
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:11,120
a taken research track I am

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,469
we have some kind of technical challenge
us because

5
00:00:14,469 --> 00:00:19,090
a a reader couldn't made it up too high
to Brock so we are using bebe X

6
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:22,279
a but it's not the first time in the
troopers history

7
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:25,590
that we have to do that so I'm pretty
sure it will rockwell

8
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:29,349
so I'm I regards from Switzerland so
it's not

9
00:00:29,349 --> 00:00:34,430
not that close for but I'm sure some of
you had a a block away two hundred book

10
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:38,440
until he will give a talk about a.m. s
far

11
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,640
II Hatf understood a for now a

12
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,500
about influences from the past like
nuclear weapons

13
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,660
and a and consequences and

14
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,010
your approach us for information
security so are

15
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:55,800
let us work %uh Marie go and a reader I
would like to to stop so

16
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:02,800
please go ahead

17
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:07,070
her oh thank you Michael for the
introduction

18
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:10,090
and apologies for not being there but

19
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:13,460
there were on strength first the whole

20
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:16,560
I about that know them I know that these
days

21
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,890
whenever there's a someone on the screen
it's meant to be it's know them but

22
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:24,220
and local to make the arrangements so

23
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:28,350
I apologize they're getting away with me
and

24
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:32,479
I well we're talking about a personal
haul there's a a slide

25
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,240
about an arson the a a for all the talk

26
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,530
there's going to be an elephant that I'm
not going to be able to mention

27
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:44,630
and I'm sure you will be able to figure
out what it is

28
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:48,210
and unfortunately because I signed the

29
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:52,080
something called other I restricted
secret the a which means that I've been

30
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,770
told incredible secrets

31
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:59,440
I will have to reply to a question about
it by saying

32
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:03,810
a I don't think about it its

33
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:08,259
something I apologize in advance but I
better or does so we are not the point

34
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:08,569
that

35
00:02:08,569 --> 00:02:11,660
so there is a plan crystal ball

36
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:15,220
I am going to go through some history

37
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:20,099
some nuclear history and then I'm going
to delve into some firmware

38
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:25,930
hardware add to discuss a bit about bike
recalled

39
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:29,520
salt going back to a long time ago

40
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,610
other child

41
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:35,700
the fun and games were

42
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,940
main the illegal legal modems

43
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:42,160
in my specific case illegal oldham's

44
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:47,510
imported from the US and that was the
colors that were used to this battle and

45
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:49,770
connect directly to the phone line

46
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:53,800
and we had the physical TTY is

47
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,340
a 6502 also bore computers

48
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:01,660
and then interesting things like
machines running on

49
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:06,950
to obscure processors like as the log
that 8,000 16-bit processor

50
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:11,620
at the same time thanks to be a cause
the Cobblers

51
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,750
and later the modems

52
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,300
I discovered are interesting BBS

53
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:20,070
in So Cal which at the time was behind
something called the iron curtain

54
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:23,390
which contained interesting assembly
called

55
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:29,880
for writing viruses so this was one of
the first choice I used to play with

56
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,220
its a 6501

57
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:37,730
single board computer sources if I will
too

58
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:42,660
this one is I one of my first your ex
machines

59
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,770
a and politics a 2002

60
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:49,620
I used to have a forty megabyte hard
disk

61
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:53,390
and supported ate cereal terminals

62
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:58,000
which look like this and it happened to
be in our living room

63
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
to the great joys of my mother who
thought

64
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,030
it wasn't a exactly what you wanted to
show

65
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:07,240
people when you invite them over
especially because it was

66
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:12,300
extremely loud and my father used to get
very upset when people use that

67
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:16,160
to ahold a you know coffee cups

68
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,299
or white glasses so

69
00:04:19,299 --> 00:04:23,220
at the same time and the early eighties
was the peak

70
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:29,240
of nuclear weapons and those of you who
are old enough to remember

71
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,780
in the nineteen eighties it was very hot

72
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:36,070
time in europe the person missiles were
being

73
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:41,850
a deployed in Germany the cruise
missiles were being deployed

74
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:46,000
in that %uh the south of Italy and

75
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,850
the the local population was very upset
in particular

76
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:54,550
the a film up several film for coming
out

77
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:58,940
and different people react to the
different ways

78
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:03,180
and I particular decided that it was
very interesting to find out everything

79
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,150
possible about nuclear weapons

80
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:08,580
at my end of the year Adobe AIR project

81
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:13,130
to get them entry school was about the
Moncler weapons and cruise missiles

82
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:16,160
too low great droid all my friends

83
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,970
and a again on the day I

84
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:22,480
decided it was very interesting to find
everything

85
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:26,420
accord about nuclear weapons add to my

86
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:30,950
a birthday present when I was 14 by in
one part of my family

87
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:34,830
what the time translation although
brilliant book about

88
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:38,810
understanding nuclear explosions
underground by reading

89
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:42,560
the a earthquake from

90
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,710
this seismic readings as if it was an
earthquake and that's very interesting

91
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:47,870
to find out

92
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:50,930
how I know the ground nuclear explosion
differs

93
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:55,330
in the seismic readings from a normal
earthquake

94
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:59,750
and how you can determine whether or not
to the explosion has been the couple for

95
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:00,600
example

96
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,130
if you want to know more you can ask me
offline

97
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:08,060
but it's very interesting for example to
determine if

98
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:11,910
the north koreans have up or kill about
kill time bomb

99
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:15,370
or 15 plot on bomb depending on the size
big reading

100
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:20,690
and the what up the aspect I want to
discuss

101
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:24,310
in nuclear warfare is the concert over
decapitation attacks.

102
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:27,810
the combination attack is when you
should do you clear weapons

103
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:31,560
and you hope to get ready all the
command-and-control structure

104
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:37,530
so that there is no child's all the
opposition order retaliation strike so

105
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:38,560
you can imagine

106
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,160
the russians should all their missiles
they gonna read

107
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,800
all Washington DC idea theory there is
nobody to give the order

108
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,770
to the nuclear submarines to sugar
missiles so

109
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:53,930
the reaction today's is

110
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:58,990
project develop sophisticated means to
guarantee the continuity all

111
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:03,030
the command-and-control structure sold
in the US for example

112
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:07,140
there is a gigantic least all who is in
command

113
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:10,380
if the president is incapacitated so

114
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:13,630
if the president got all give the order
to go to the vice president

115
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:17,350
if the vice president Cal give the order
that goes to

116
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:20,750
head on the senate if the head of the
senate cannot give the order then it

117
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,720
goes down the line

118
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:27,120
until fundamentally your sister gave the
order should the missiles

119
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,120
and this goes on and on

120
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,330
in the US they basically have a list
like that

121
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:36,920
other countries talk different
approaches to the problem

122
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:41,510
and you might think why do I care well
this has an interesting relevance

123
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:44,680
in computer security for example

124
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:48,480
you have a beautiful salk

125
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:55,200
in your company now a long long long
time ago you might remember there was a

126
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,250
beautiful intrusion detection system
called Black Ice

127
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:02,920
and at the same time there was a
computer virus which was written

128
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:07,660
which attacked specifically black ice
sensors

129
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:10,740
you might think why on earth would you
want to do that

130
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:15,010
well that is an example although the
capitation attack

131
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:18,750
if I get red all your black ice sensors

132
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:24,310
that suddenly whatever shoot down the
network you're not going to be able to

133
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:24,850
see

134
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:29,890
so 730 the capitation attacks against
her salk

135
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:34,380
are quite interesting Mel

136
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:38,300
one was the ultimate Bad with respect to
the capitation attacks

137
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:44,330
and here we go to Russia the russians it
back to the system called parameter

138
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:47,380
which was designed in the mid sixties

139
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:50,770
where the russians this covered that the
Americans had

140
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:54,710
more and more accurate missiles

141
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:57,930
which meant that southerly they could
really say okay

142
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:01,290
we're going to shoot a missile which
will drop exactly on

143
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:05,510
the kremlin bunker and they're plaid
walls

144
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:08,520
if we detect launch

145
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,940
by the americans we're going to show 30
missiles

146
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:16,250
which are going to flight all over
russia and broadcast

147
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:19,490
I read your message which gives the
order to launch

148
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:24,500
all our missiles at the same time that
sort of works

149
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,570
the Americans that said fantastic

150
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:31,040
on our first launch we're going to take
out

151
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,190
every single launch site at the same
time

152
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:37,810
this is when the a number of nuclear
weapons

153
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:39,850
in the american are small

154
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:43,829
reached around 12,000 the idea being
that you will drop

155
00:09:43,829 --> 00:09:46,860
between 100 to 150 weapons

156
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:50,060
on each nuclear launch site

157
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:53,940
to make sure that there was no hope all
that in the sole surviving

158
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,970
but India

159
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:01,529
the russians had an even better plan the
fight over certain which

160
00:10:01,529 --> 00:10:06,040
allegedly is still operating is totally
automated

161
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:09,149
and it detects the specific parameters

162
00:10:09,149 --> 00:10:12,660
it looks for a radiation burst

163
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:17,600
got my first blast the specific flash

164
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,579
which is associated with a nuclear
explosion the total also communications

165
00:10:22,579 --> 00:10:26,690
added automatically initiates a launch
sequence

166
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:32,480
for every surviving ICBM missile at the
key word here is automatically at the

167
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,160
school that that iran says them

168
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,290
a eventually this was

169
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:40,519
renamed the doomsday machine after

170
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:43,949
the famous film doctor strangelove
kubrick

171
00:10:43,949 --> 00:10:48,009
you're being that the American stakeout

172
00:10:48,009 --> 00:10:51,399
Moscow doesn't matter the system detects
it

173
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:54,670
allegedly it's a mount yet but I'll in
the Orioles

174
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:57,670
the system detects that moscow has been
taken out

175
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:01,069
and all the remaining russian missiles
are shot

176
00:11:01,069 --> 00:11:04,079
towards the american so the messages

177
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,300
you try to kill us don't worry we will
go

178
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:13,670
and our robots are going to shoot you
back there is a western counterpart

179
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:19,550
the western counterpart is something
called the letters a last resort

180
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:23,990
which the British came up with trust the
British to have something very quaint

181
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:28,079
the letters a last resort are pretty
letters

182
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,639
written by the Prime Minister where he
goes into power

183
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:36,120
had he writes for letters one for every

184
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:40,720
missile submarine commander at the
letters are kept secret

185
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,790
we are told only the content is not only
to the Prime Minister

186
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:49,820
either prime minister says your
commander

187
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:53,150
if you got no longer here BBC Radio 4

188
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:57,320
you can no longer reach commander

189
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:02,640
you can no longer reach London at Duke
assume that you the United Kingdom is no

190
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,570
longer here

191
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:07,130
do 104 things either

192
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:11,420
retaliate shooting or missiles or do not
retaliate

193
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:14,510
find a nice island in the Pacific

194
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:17,770
and go on holiday or plays herself

195
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:22,090
other door allied command or I have no

196
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:26,810
whoever you feel and that who cares so
those are

197
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:30,080
the so-called letters a last resort at

198
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,500
the British version so

199
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:37,170
all of this sets the mood for what
follows

200
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:41,120
what happens when you're young lad

201
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,230
and you spent many many years reading
assembly cold

202
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:50,850
on a Bulgarian BBS you always thought
that this is incredibly cool

203
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:54,590
I want to write to the ultimate back
door well

204
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:57,690
initially sought for sounds very
interesting you think well

205
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:02,170
I can take the Avengers called the Dark
Avengers cold

206
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:06,130
take a polymorphic virus and make it
even more polymorphic

207
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:10,220
so that it becomes even more detectable
sure

208
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:15,130
a call from the dark Avenger in 1980 is
pretty sophisticated

209
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:19,820
every time you run it looks different
the antivirus is

210
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:23,610
had no clue they still have no clue but
that is a separate discussion

211
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:26,640
problem is

212
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,960
its software and eventually

213
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:33,700
once you have played with soft parade of
you realize that the real fun

214
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:37,360
start when you look at hardware and

215
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,400
it so happens that I asked my father's
also hacker

216
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:45,690
except that he hacks bigger things and
he started working with something called

217
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:46,810
the Model UN itself

218
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:50,920
which was the time the America's Cup
charge in the nineteen nineties

219
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:54,119
and he was the official electronic
warfare wizard

220
00:13:54,119 --> 00:13:57,509
so his job was

221
00:13:57,509 --> 00:14:00,629
we want with the America's Cup

222
00:14:00,629 --> 00:14:04,779
you go out look at all the other boats

223
00:14:04,779 --> 00:14:08,769
and figure out how we can get all their
data

224
00:14:08,769 --> 00:14:12,189
using a helicopter obviously because why
not

225
00:14:12,189 --> 00:14:15,569
and the cold

226
00:14:15,569 --> 00:14:19,730
the day top and figure out how we can
beat them so

227
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:22,850
for my father's footsteps I decided that
since

228
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:25,859
unfortunately I couldn't get something a
squirrel helicopter

229
00:14:25,859 --> 00:14:30,139
I would attack network cards and this is
the for more stuff I did previously

230
00:14:30,139 --> 00:14:33,970
which ended up with each other packager
so

231
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:37,489
let me introduce my first pack my first
hockey

232
00:14:37,489 --> 00:14:42,329
is this beautiful printer I'm most
you've probably never heard of it but

233
00:14:42,329 --> 00:14:46,059
in the nineteen eighties we have this
gorgeous printer called

234
00:14:46,059 --> 00:14:50,350
a prism p80 this was a color dot matrix
printer

235
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:54,209
with a completely programmable firmware
as a processor on it

236
00:14:54,209 --> 00:14:59,610
and you could do things like a senate
access a justify it

237
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:02,759
a you could tell it to write to bowl

238
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:06,269
%uh you could actually ask 8 to poor
things

239
00:15:06,269 --> 00:15:09,419
like other spell check so the first
thing I

240
00:15:09,419 --> 00:15:12,989
act on it was it says it only did spell
checking in English

241
00:15:12,989 --> 00:15:16,949
I set up a small stuff checker for
Italian so decided to text

242
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:20,790
and is what made basically tied in
mistakes it was corrected before

243
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:21,669
printing

244
00:15:21,669 --> 00:15:25,040
it was extremely cool I thought in the
day

245
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,419
so this was my first cock now

246
00:15:28,419 --> 00:15:32,799
going back to sailing boats the beauty
all they've already been a TI was that

247
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:34,829
the first thing they told my father is

248
00:15:34,829 --> 00:15:39,339
your budget is infinite now if you're
told your budget isn't that

249
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:44,579
thats nice and they tell you

250
00:15:44,579 --> 00:15:47,889
just go and find out how to make

251
00:15:47,889 --> 00:15:51,299
this sailing boat go faster than someone
else assembled

252
00:15:51,299 --> 00:15:57,619
so easy way of doing is if I helicopter
over someone else's training area

253
00:15:57,619 --> 00:16:00,620
and if you're in Italy at the other guys
training

254
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:03,670
Zealand what legal well easy you get out

255
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:06,700
you get an airplane to fly over there
with the whole crew

256
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:10,010
your home we had a called third to play
over

257
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:13,210
you know easy things your budget has
infinite so

258
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:18,320
what's the big deal and then you rolled
up the computer because the nineteen

259
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,630
nineties soul

260
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:24,190
you know what's up big soft between you
and your

261
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:28,330
got a large I'll far not think so you
yourself lol

262
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:32,750
you compute put the stuff in using the
data but it's incredibly boring

263
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:36,820
and your budget is a definite so what
you know you something cooler

264
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:42,440
so you take your own sale you can rate
in sensors

265
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:45,700
so what you do is you actually build a
factory

266
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:50,170
your Venice that makes

267
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:53,780
specific sale materials wholesale fabric

268
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:58,910
with embedded sensors in its aunt

269
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:02,290
you feed real time sensor data

270
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:05,430
to a computer

271
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:10,980
which you build inside the hollow the
sailing boat you stick to my father in

272
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:11,850
the sailing boat

273
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:16,730
to program the computer while it's
running and

274
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:22,130
as the boat is sailing it during the
tests he relays the information to the

275
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:23,400
guy selling the bold

276
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,460
and gives them the shape of this area
real time

277
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:30,160
compared to the mall goals which give
them the optimal speed

278
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,620
had the net result

279
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:38,860
is reach the finals of the America's Cup
so why did they know who's

280
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:42,250
hi good question

281
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:46,300
the answer is not my father sold

282
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:50,960
but you see where I caught the firmware
bug

283
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,480
now the mathematics was mine

284
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:59,640
the physics was my dad Sol I guess is
brought my maths

285
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:05,790
but what happens next is I when talked
all that for cards

286
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:08,790
so the network cards were accidental air

287
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:12,020
a interest they were started because

288
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:17,030
I both the powerbook and the particle
had a Broadcom card

289
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:21,290
in case but check sums on TCP down but
the rest is history

290
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:24,320
at the same time %uh

291
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:29,220
yes if I he was a rising star and the
one of the two entries in my house

292
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:34,980
was a 2006 I'm back I had

293
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:40,799
read about if I so i thought well let's
find out what we can do

294
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:45,860
with option roams and this was the start
of a protocol bushel

295
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:48,860
which should pose a big Sol your 5a

296
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:52,720
and modifications all micro cold

297
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:57,610
on the iMac the problem was it wasn't
working very well

298
00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:00,820
so I went back to the drawing board

299
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:04,270
the drawing board goes back again to my
father

300
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:07,780
his work on bit slicing processors

301
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:11,799
so this is where we begin

302
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:15,790
and that hearing is microcode updates

303
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:20,110
%uh not thrown CPU's in 2004 this is up

304
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:25,070
rather forgotten paper which appeared

305
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:31,630
in a mailing list in 2004 and it was
about reverse engineering the AMD k8

306
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:33,120
Mike recalled that was the

307
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:39,790
first up their own core at the first big
discovery is that

308
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:43,429
to all inject modified bar-coded ikat

309
00:19:43,429 --> 00:19:46,700
you don't have to do anything you simply
injected

310
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:51,320
there are no verification what so ever
so

311
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:55,679
what is the problem well the first
problem is how do you write K

312
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,600
Mike recalled well not

313
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:04,929
a big problem what you do is you go to
someone who speaks by a group called

314
00:20:04,929 --> 00:20:09,940
namely my father the second problem is

315
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:14,700
well you power cycle processor the bag
recalled up that is lost

316
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:18,409
so with no problems

317
00:20:18,409 --> 00:20:21,929
understand that the microcode and

318
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:27,339
figuring out persistence so what you who
is in 2004

319
00:20:27,339 --> 00:20:30,579
I handed over the bar called update file
to my father

320
00:20:30,579 --> 00:20:33,690
with him it took us 10 years

321
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:38,339
so they called it so i'd thirty years

322
00:20:38,339 --> 00:20:42,700
a maybe my father figured out how the
microcode update

323
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:47,409
for the AMD chip worked I the particular
what the various

324
00:20:47,409 --> 00:20:52,729
bits meant and the the net product was
thus the mall

325
00:20:52,729 --> 00:20:55,869
salt dusty mauve is in effect

326
00:20:55,869 --> 00:20:59,619
a a modified mark called UPDATE

327
00:20:59,619 --> 00:21:05,339
which allows you to know patch

328
00:21:05,339 --> 00:21:09,690
the mic recalled inside the AMD k8 score

329
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:14,589
and some subsequent course which are
derived from the k-8

330
00:21:14,589 --> 00:21:18,289
using the original security imposed
mechanism

331
00:21:18,289 --> 00:21:22,320
and of course all the magic

332
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,509
is in the backcourt there is no magic in
the update mechanism

333
00:21:26,509 --> 00:21:30,219
the magic is entirely in figuring out
how to write that Mike called

334
00:21:30,219 --> 00:21:34,509
was you've got it what can you do

335
00:21:34,509 --> 00:21:40,529
well what you could do is of course
modified structions such as well I said

336
00:21:40,529 --> 00:21:42,579
basketball because you can modify mall

337
00:21:42,579 --> 00:21:46,259
how to modify ball well for example is
that all

338
00:21:46,259 --> 00:21:50,629
mall simply moving between two registers

339
00:21:50,629 --> 00:21:53,690
it might move between two registers if
and only if

340
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:57,249
the call that a register he is

341
00:21:57,249 --> 00:22:01,369
a positive number with a negative number

342
00:22:01,369 --> 00:22:05,029
doesn't move it that is a useless
example

343
00:22:05,029 --> 00:22:09,209
but you could see how this suddenly
becomes more interesting for example

344
00:22:09,209 --> 00:22:15,259
it the store should your body finds a
job so

345
00:22:15,259 --> 00:22:20,159
what you do next he is you modify

346
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:24,039
interesting instructions the interesting
the structure to mollify

347
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:28,029
are the world's which deal with AMD V
VIII pic

348
00:22:28,029 --> 00:22:31,829
those are all the virtualization
extensions the RDA

349
00:22:31,829 --> 00:22:37,429
the equivalent solvated the VTX at all
the aisle at the high I'm annual

350
00:22:37,429 --> 00:22:41,609
virtualization extensions that intel has
brought online

351
00:22:41,609 --> 00:22:46,929
so what happens is you think your
hypervisor is being a hypervisor

352
00:22:46,929 --> 00:22:50,519
but in reality what your hypervisor
makes

353
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:55,079
a request for a big event route for
example

354
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:58,499
that he eventually is being mediated by

355
00:22:58,499 --> 00:23:02,849
my micro cold now

356
00:23:02,849 --> 00:23:05,979
remember that these days

357
00:23:05,979 --> 00:23:09,039
you have multiple cores on a CPU

358
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:13,309
so what should know he is

359
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:18,459
in a specific example all this o'clock

360
00:23:18,459 --> 00:23:23,129
is you don't mold the same a microcode
modification

361
00:23:23,129 --> 00:23:26,849
in each CPU so let me illustrate how it
works

362
00:23:26,849 --> 00:23:30,179
what you do is

363
00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:34,799
you figure out which is the one CPU
that's pretty easy

364
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:38,419
once you figure out which is that would
secure

365
00:23:38,419 --> 00:23:42,509
dole the hypervisor will prefer

366
00:23:42,509 --> 00:23:46,329
that CPU I had your gold

367
00:23:46,329 --> 00:23:50,619
the virtualization extension
modification to the microphone

368
00:23:50,619 --> 00:23:55,059
all that CPU soul when you have a VM
entry

369
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:58,679
by the hypervisor you that

370
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:01,959
of local the task all simulating

371
00:24:01,959 --> 00:24:08,959
the virtualization to other core why did
you decide what to modify

372
00:24:09,819 --> 00:24:13,019
on the core on which the adventure has
been requested

373
00:24:13,019 --> 00:24:18,079
so the hypervisor is in effect be
executed by the front core

374
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:21,679
what you do that asked the star on the
core which has been called

375
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:24,849
so the crux of the matter here

376
00:24:24,849 --> 00:24:26,250
is

377
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:28,930
I in many ways the difficulty is

378
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:33,030
to keep the coherency between the
various course but in practice since you

379
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:34,540
all the biker cold

380
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:38,830
the trick is to slow down the hypervisor
a little bit

381
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:42,990
so you have the time to keep the
coherency now

382
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:46,180
another tricky is to

383
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:49,670
effectively take over 10 the course so

384
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:52,780
one of the examples I tried which is
borrowing more efficient

385
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:55,840
is to actually take over or the course

386
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:00,770
so what you do is say you have a 12-core
alter on what you do is work to get

387
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:01,870
eleven course

388
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:06,320
for Rio and you must go out what all the
cores where you run your own operating

389
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,120
system

390
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:11,480
which actually had the whole the hacking
soul

391
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:16,230
where the virtual machine asks how many
cars are available you obviously answer

392
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:21,270
12 but in practice you're running all
the virtualization 11 Kors

393
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:25,310
a 12-core is yours to run for example

394
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:28,330
a PSD or whatever you prefer

395
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:31,540
to virtualize all the star

396
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:34,650
that the hypervisor things is being done
on the real hardware

397
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:38,470
so if you really are virtualizing the
hypervisor again

398
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:41,950
by I'll the biker called

399
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:45,060
sending over acting effectively oz

400
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:49,680
a job in 20 the operating system that
you're running

401
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:53,380
on the corner you're hiding this is

402
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:57,390
quite 30 and it's already explained in
the slides because

403
00:25:57,390 --> 00:26:01,350
well I directed up because it was their
clock in the morning

404
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:04,910
when I finish this light yesterday but
Adam

405
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:09,380
I probably said it so the idea is
effectively to steal a slide

406
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:14,010
to steal a core what you have done this
you have to appreciate that because you

407
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:14,550
all

408
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:19,020
the bike recalled there is no way for
the hypervisor to

409
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:22,540
goal they have stolen a core the only
way for to bowl

410
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:28,110
would be to perform metrics and say this
is a bit small for a cloak or alter on

411
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:32,160
but how can the hypervisor know that it
is lolol because remember

412
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:38,380
how you're under the tidings well your
other performance registered don't you

413
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:40,580
but who wrote the performance registers

414
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:45,580
is the core who owns the micro called I
on the mic recalled

415
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:49,320
so if you ask the performance divers

416
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:53,400
to give you time makings other
performers on the core well obviously

417
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,170
you know I

418
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:57,320
so Inouye

419
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:01,570
you have just virtualized the
virtualization

420
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:04,810
all the virtualized environment and

421
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:08,580
you know sorry who knows

422
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:13,140
now this is all very exciting

423
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:16,610
it's all a recall but we still have the
power cycle problem

424
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:20,920
because remember all this beautiful
magic disappears

425
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:24,820
the bomb on someone resets that CPU you
don't even have to power cycle all you

426
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,310
have to do is that the CPU

427
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:30,160
and resetting the CPU is not such a hard
job

428
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:34,410
as a matter a fact you could actually
reset individual cores

429
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:37,960
so what we're going to do he is

430
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:41,950
play dirty now remember though we have a
weapon in our arsenal

431
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:46,990
so in theory if we attack a machine

432
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:52,690
what is running with a hypervisor and
the I'm you protections are active

433
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:55,690
I cannot infect any PCI device

434
00:27:55,690 --> 00:28:00,720
easily so for example my old tricks of
the trade I package tray

435
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,880
eccentric central or block if your
machine is running

436
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:09,090
so what you know is I need to subvert

437
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:13,510
somehow inject persist

438
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:17,920
and then gain control so here's the
trick the cunning plan

439
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:22,310
case the takeover the dick and in this
case there has to be a dick on which

440
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:23,750
train because this age works

441
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:28,920
and I do that from the outside so I 510
those makes that allows me

442
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:34,610
to by our a suitably craft that packet
flash the firmware from the outside or

443
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:38,120
by the IPMI because remember that
there'll be there

444
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:41,830
several interesting IPMI takeovers right

445
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:45,010
so I flash the firmware all the lake

446
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:49,100
and I inject an option ROM into the
firmware

447
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:53,620
adoption drawn is this beautiful
heritage from the PC era

448
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:57,350
which is executed at boat even by AFI

449
00:28:57,350 --> 00:29:01,610
so I know either wait for reboot

450
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:06,380
or trigger a reboot all the machine
how'd you trigger a reboot that's easy

451
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:10,770
if you all that the network card you
could trigger a buffer overflow

452
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:14,860
even at the network card drivers on the
operating system

453
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:18,160
simply by returning a gigantic package
when

454
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:22,500
that her card isn't expecting into
windows were crash ru stream reboard

455
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,900
with all the server year FY boots

456
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:31,270
it will execute the option ROM from the
network card which rejected

457
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:36,160
you option ROM executes injects the
microcode update

458
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:39,230
into the CPU

459
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:42,350
at which point this yours

460
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:46,890
are ours all the course the microcode
update

461
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:51,300
obviously disable the bar code update
before the operating system starts

462
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:55,300
because otherwise the microcode update
from the operating system

463
00:29:55,300 --> 00:30:00,740
we'll overwrite buyback recalled update
but we don't disable it in such a way

464
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:04,200
that it will take you are able to all
that the MARC record obviously

465
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,680
we started into a ball and %uh

466
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:12,500
the mangled update they'll take sober
the AMD virtualization extensions

467
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:17,310
why would we wanted to do that well why
we have to control the machine we might

468
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:17,870
as well

469
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:22,980
able for example PCI to PCI transfers
between different devices

470
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:26,780
which is a classic immu protection you
don't want

471
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:31,280
I as direct DMA transfers between a
network card energy PU

472
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:35,630
but you do want to defer running the SSH
so

473
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:40,160
the first thing we do is we're in a
bullet it is we all the boot process

474
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,570
with persistence

475
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:45,750
and I just finished weaponize in its I
was all about a month ago

476
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:50,980
so this brings us to the end

477
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:54,660
all the talk all the Michael part and

478
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:59,990
now the part where we talk about that
that happened this started off as a as a

479
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:01,369
joke between

480
00:31:01,369 --> 00:31:04,639
to mathematicians over Twitter we were
meant to meet

481
00:31:04,639 --> 00:31:08,320
on holiday in third ayyash art that is
the is the old dame

482
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:12,009
all started in Pirates and the

483
00:31:12,009 --> 00:31:15,179
I what happened as I called the number
on your inferred area

484
00:31:15,179 --> 00:31:18,580
while on holiday of course and

485
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:22,450
what happened is that like all good
security resource

486
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:25,830
researchers I have heard that had system
ya BA

487
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:30,909
about if I were to disappear I wouldn't
want all my research to

488
00:31:30,909 --> 00:31:34,839
disappear with me soul

489
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:38,580
I have a system whereby all their
research

490
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:42,129
is automatically broadcast elsewhere

491
00:31:42,129 --> 00:31:45,190
with a suitable encryption key so that
my friends

492
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:49,399
to get hold of it and publish anything
that they think is interesting for

493
00:31:49,399 --> 00:31:50,169
example

494
00:31:50,169 --> 00:31:54,119
the source go to nick SSH and all of
this stuff

495
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:57,289
for st. Paul which is not publicly
available

496
00:31:57,289 --> 00:32:01,099
so what happens

497
00:32:01,099 --> 00:32:04,799
is that this message and that this is
this the awakening this is the best that

498
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:05,429
ended up

499
00:32:05,429 --> 00:32:08,820
on Twitter first the more you can see my
UNIX heritage

500
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:12,809
this is the parser from term top and

501
00:32:12,809 --> 00:32:16,499
it says I haven't heard from you in the
last 12 hours

502
00:32:16,499 --> 00:32:19,619
and %uh the first thing you do

503
00:32:19,619 --> 00:32:24,269
is shoot for the network card to take
over

504
00:32:24,269 --> 00:32:27,929
that's the big shock bootstrap so what
happened is that it peaks

505
00:32:27,929 --> 00:32:31,099
a series of machines all the internet
which

506
00:32:31,099 --> 00:32:35,450
I have a around them they scouted at is
injecting

507
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:40,519
because this age into them I'm without
permission obviously

508
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:44,429
it then performs the Big Shot

509
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:48,779
at the GW Haxby the eight packs the
gateways

510
00:32:48,779 --> 00:32:52,440
I'm using a prime number of 73

511
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:55,899
that's how it picks the I'm

512
00:32:55,899 --> 00:32:59,570
this is how it selects for their numbers

513
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:03,350
the OG Loc is the Google lock so what
happens is that

514
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:06,610
you pick up right but it uses Google
lacking

515
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:10,030
to pick to prime numbers to fetch

516
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:13,440
the source cold 20 the IPMI hoc

517
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,980
which I published on several sites

518
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:20,880
which you can only reach by picking to
prime numbers

519
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:26,200
and put a bullet in there with Google
using a paper which I wrote a lot

520
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:30,790
a long long time ago basically a pic to
private numbers but the main goal goal

521
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:34,150
and there are only certain web sites
which have those two prime numbers in

522
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:34,590
the

523
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:39,020
and those two prime numbers batch a
website web sites

524
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:42,630
where the source code for the IPMI hack

525
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:47,500
is found Sol that had system down law
wants the IPMI

526
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:51,760
hack source calls from those web sites
and executes it

527
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:55,520
at attack so the IPMI

528
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:58,890
all those web sites using that make
takeover

529
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:02,870
I firmware at which points

530
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:06,180
at which point the a

531
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:10,100
there are several machines on the
Internet was I P A by

532
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:13,219
has been taken over using the SSH

533
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:17,429
I'm not something to particularly proud
of but a beer and that's all

534
00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:21,610
you know hoops I'll

535
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:25,270
so they had met the dead had proper
starts

536
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:29,770
add users beyond access all the Broadcom
driver

537
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:34,340
the AM the backer polled a attack

538
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:37,800
at the NPD a jeep you SSH takeover

539
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,860
to effector the a

540
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:44,100
machines that it has selected and

541
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:47,259
it also uses vote or network to

542
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:51,520
a speak to each other add it distributes
itself

543
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:56,240
using the his unfortunately you will
notice that even though I have a

544
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,340
mathematician

545
00:34:57,340 --> 00:35:04,210
the a initial vector organization vector
for the encryption is 0000

546
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:08,230
so if anyone here is both a person with
a buddy

547
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:12,730
I think that encryption you will notice
that I made a horrible mistake of

548
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:14,880
selecting about initialization vector

549
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,140
for the encryption up the

550
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:22,730
wiping out a random for the machines
that holbrooke he is the Peter got about

551
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:24,109
wiping out a rhythm

552
00:35:24,109 --> 00:35:28,030
and it initiates the wife of the machine
at all

553
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:33,119
so this is a starting to transfer all
the data on that machine that whole

554
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:36,250
tool the machine that I have infected
with

555
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:39,890
make this SH at the microcode flashing

556
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:43,840
and it is transferring the data by the
Tor network

557
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:47,230
at it is also wiping my machines at home
at the same time

558
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:51,140
I finally was established

559
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:55,240
it says the communications is now using
all the world which is

560
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:59,510
another a peer to peer network which is
actually based

561
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:04,440
although the old waste that work this is
that his life

562
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:08,780
so he said it sends to my friends for
them to access

563
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:12,940
at the Cabana control says there is no
all so you can no longer access it

564
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,150
except for those special

565
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:17,500
he's on the waist at work so at this
point

566
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:21,920
or membership that I told have been
wiped which was actually the case

567
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:26,980
a.m. all the data has been spread the
two machines that I have

568
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:29,980
selected on the Internet to be a

569
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:34,070
infected with my systems and a a

570
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:37,859
certain had to have they'll be in the

571
00:36:37,859 --> 00:36:41,650
selected as carriers for my precious
data and the keys are being sent to my

572
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:42,280
friends

573
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:48,570
so this is my personal that system which
uses all my hacks so-far

574
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:51,609
and finally the credits

575
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:56,840
so I thank at No and the crew my
children Toby

576
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:00,490
at the people at the Elephant Walk I
think you have figured out by now

577
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:05,290
is the other chip company that I have
not mentioned the single time in the

578
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:08,680
ok presentation and obviously made out
for hacking

579
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:12,480
and heard the reference those

580
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,540
as you might notice are missing I
promise to fill them up

581
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:20,760
had published the slides with all the
references to all the various bits of

582
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,640
information you

583
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:26,029
need to be able to reproduced by work
without seeing the cold as they always

584
00:37:26,029 --> 00:37:26,690
do

585
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:29,789
and in the meantime you should read the
up

586
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:33,819
the beautiful paper produced by

587
00:37:33,819 --> 00:37:37,150
our friend had to thank you very much

588
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:44,150
pressure thank you very much a regal

589
00:37:46,019 --> 00:37:53,019
I'm other questions great nope no
questions

590
00:37:54,319 --> 00:37:58,250
okay fine so I'm are eager thank you
very much

591
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:02,210
and charm I hope to see you sometime
yeah

592
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:06,289
its ok I sorrow I okay

593
00:38:06,289 --> 00:38:09,680
thanks for joining us a.m. your butt

594
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:13,920
I think we have gained about a.m. 10
minutes for a short break we'll continue

595
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,420
at

596
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:17,799
a 11 talked with the next talk so thank
you

597
00:38:17,799 --> 00:38:21,210
thank every girl group buying

598
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:21,470
I
