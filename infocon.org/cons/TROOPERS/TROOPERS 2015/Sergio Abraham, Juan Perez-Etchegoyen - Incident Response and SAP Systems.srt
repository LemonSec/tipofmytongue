1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:04,250
to hearing about basically incidents
when all

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:07,399
in the incident response phase so just
go for it

3
00:00:07,399 --> 00:00:10,950
okay thank you a.m. Thanks hair

4
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:14,719
of you who are like so late I know this
is the last ok

5
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:18,660
we all want to go to there today the
Mehran

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,230
to fish of the day so let's wrap up with
something and very quickly

7
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:27,170
and they say said another small talk
this is gonna be

8
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:31,529
30 minutes anymore company on ourselves

9
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:34,649
you can take on on their presentation
later

10
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:40,010
this at week presentation some this lame
ass

11
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:43,760
at this is not a technical presentation
right so

12
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,030
if you're expecting some niceee

13
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:51,079
exploits you won't have it right it's
this that easy in response to ACh

14
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:54,079
whether to cover some some

15
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,030
topics that are related to the
proceedure on how should we do

16
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:02,809
in our to actually respond to an A and
Tony CN specifically NEC and on SAP

17
00:01:02,809 --> 00:01:03,539
systems

18
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:08,780
am so yeah it is say just this claim
myself what the stock chase

19
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:11,790
I am so let's start

20
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:15,030
am K it's a response

21
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:18,430
basically the stock he spare kinda for

22
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:20,880
following the of that we have been

23
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,590
following in their last through purse as
well we have been presenting

24
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:28,300
and are on they said be four and six two
years ago

25
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,980
SAPI de France six techniques and last
year

26
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:35,420
and easier with we came with these
presentation that he's

27
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:38,600
kind of and day there

28
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,970
the conclusion of this right he's how
should we proceed

29
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:46,220
in our two actually move for a while
when something happened which is

30
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,170
something that

31
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:51,060
actually happens right and when when
there is an easy and specifically NECN

32
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,450
involving sabc stems and well

33
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:58,090
a if you are involved in the season
helping the customer

34
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:02,600
you can definitely not talk about it so
we we cannot talk about details of

35
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,180
anything we have been working on but we
will definitely

36
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,310
percent some 50 shows a case

37
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:13,210
that you can see how to move all wearing
their in there

38
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:16,550
and I suspect so we need to understand
some

39
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:19,990
to some and topics right way to the fine

40
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:24,710
objectives and we need to find this call
criticality of the C Stennis

41
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:28,220
air by the Seychelles all that although
things we have in our

42
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:32,750
quickly go over to basically 2025 the
root cause

43
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:35,800
of things here right what happened TEM

44
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,730
and this is related to how we detected
that we will see in the next light

45
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:43,750
air another objective is basically limit
the damage

46
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:48,110
right once we know something happen on
the system and we want to make

47
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:52,790
sure that the Dane but these restricted
on the Dane but these

48
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:57,610
the the low Westwood can and we
definitely want to recover from it

49
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:00,610
so it's EC here to recover from
something

50
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:05,930
like let's say someone and got
information from the CBC's them get we

51
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:07,080
have to do some stuff

52
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,140
we need to a identified it the
information that was leaked

53
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:15,150
but this is simply be up and running but
what happens if someone is

54
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:18,210
doing a salad dish attack and the system
southbound Route

55
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:22,100
right with we want to move forward
quickly I we want to make sure that

56
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:25,670
our systems are up and running ask
quickly as possible because

57
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:30,930
the life or the company usually depends
on I'm definitely

58
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:34,150
and after all this process what we need
to know

59
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:37,240
ace identify how can we do better

60
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,560
I what can we do in order to improve
detection

61
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,640
in order to improve how we react you
know to improve

62
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,990
and the security of the system's how how

63
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:51,780
did things go wrong right what and and
was there any exploitation if we reduce

64
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:52,190
any

65
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,599
and and

66
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:57,870
British escalation on any you serve
being the

67
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:02,739
use the united to connect two systems so
all that he spoke to her lesson slap

68
00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:08,140
so in terms of detection first of all
what happened right

69
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:12,129
I these are some examples of of seeing
time's because economy

70
00:04:12,129 --> 00:04:15,780
really they versus the situations that
we are facing it's not the same

71
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:18,850
if we southerly wake up on C

72
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:21,910
and on the internet or even then use
that

73
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:25,000
one of our a systems worse compromise
right because

74
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,699
that thats in the park but then if you
receive an e-mail

75
00:04:28,699 --> 00:04:32,520
hair threatening you or a providing you
information on

76
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,750
at saying hey I have information of the
SAP system

77
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:40,570
that's a different situation I meet some
steak right the system just went down

78
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:43,860
and it was an interface that the sound
working

79
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:47,830
which is kind of the the most the the
most common

80
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:52,380
a case its when you have mistakes or
errors human error

81
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:57,090
air making things say to stop working
right

82
00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:00,919
so here you have some examples in terms
of the symptoms

83
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:05,849
that we identify I'm on the eight-day
mission of the impact of these

84
00:05:05,849 --> 00:05:10,010
retried or the scenes here because it
could it could be

85
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:13,310
specifically a breach right it could be
someone trying to that

86
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:17,050
but it could also and peace just a human

87
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:21,340
state right human R Us we know II we are
all human sign on

88
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:26,530
think that that happen thank terms of
classification

89
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:30,000
am actually is your response

90
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,949
when we go to the theory right there are
different type of specifications

91
00:05:33,949 --> 00:05:38,740
but right now we are talking about essay
response on SAP systems

92
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:42,800
which makes it and a bit different not
I'm not only because

93
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,560
those systems I'll company actually
depends on both systems

94
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,729
to be up and running but also because of
the information that is that right

95
00:05:50,729 --> 00:05:54,880
well in their printer in our previous
talk IIIA

96
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,599
mentioned the fact that the race
sensitive information on the sees them

97
00:05:58,599 --> 00:05:59,000
as

98
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,380
abe endorse information customers
information HR data

99
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:06,159
all of that is they are a sensitive and
it really depends on how you

100
00:06:06,159 --> 00:06:10,390
classified information i'd its it's all
about being able to

101
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:14,950
identified a the extent of the breach so
for example i dled solid ash

102
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:19,300
system going down confidentiality
information being leaked

103
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:22,310
or even a for attack but how do we

104
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:26,760
identify this kind of right that's right
usually this kind of addiction if it's

105
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,210
not

106
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:31,270
have because at some conference that we
have that could be

107
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:34,480
by chance but if someone is saver he say
what I think if I

108
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,550
something that is wrong something that
is suspicious

109
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:41,860
then we need to have this procedure
right or this framework an easy and

110
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,000
response proceed your

111
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,880
that tell ass assessing the needs of a
company

112
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,990
how to proceed in our two more for what
if

113
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:54,540
if something was detected are on the
SABC stance but this could also be

114
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:58,450
airframe into a ganar ACR response
proceed your

115
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:01,990
not on any specific policy for services
that but a

116
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:06,340
combining Weiss but we definitely need
to to take care of this is just us what

117
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:10,070
so let's say that

118
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:14,780
and ask us our fans also of someone that
wants to have the company

119
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:19,870
that their somehow was sayin I identify
the nancy and right

120
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:22,970
into serb reach it was a some problem on
this systems

121
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:27,200
while this is very basic but with
definitely need to identify the assets

122
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,720
that we want to analyze

123
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,140
it could be a a portion of this ABC
stands

124
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:35,610
it could be a physical server and
database it really depends on their own

125
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:36,030
they

126
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:40,260
scope right on the information that we
get I'm

127
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:44,500
this assets would definitely a should
definitely be chosen

128
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,810
based on the symptoms that we receive
right I'm

129
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:52,840
I know it's it's really difficult and we
will see how the person your looks like

130
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:56,010
in the end but its end eat at the
approach I

131
00:07:56,010 --> 00:08:00,470
so it's something that you eat if this
was really a breach

132
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:04,520
then its it something complex because
maybe the bridge was identify and assist

133
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,030
them

134
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:08,600
but then if the compromise if the extent
of the com- price goes beyond that

135
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,170
system

136
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:15,580
then you need to move for a while on and
start analyzing other systems as well

137
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:18,219
I yeah and this iz

138
00:08:18,219 --> 00:08:22,110
this is something that is actually very
complex

139
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:25,249
height it but it's a management decision
that needs to be take

140
00:08:25,249 --> 00:08:29,159
and this is something that you need to
know beforehand even before starting

141
00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:29,499
work

142
00:08:29,499 --> 00:08:32,599
is starting to get the hands in today to
right

143
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:35,719
because this really changes how

144
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:39,320
they perceive your site going to be
actually carried out

145
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:43,000
it's not the same to know that the
company the sites

146
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,920
to move for what and with legal actions
I rather than

147
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:51,380
just an internal investigation that
wants to identify this call

148
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:55,690
there there of course am which create
information last say

149
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:59,279
compromise because this chain of custody

150
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:03,100
their did this information is to be
process in a different way

151
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:06,380
needs to be air proof that this is the
same

152
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:11,120
the exact same formation at what
extracted from the system their side of

153
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,740
and form all procedures that are a
former procedures on these

154
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:19,709
that will make things completely
different so that's a decision it's a

155
00:09:19,709 --> 00:09:20,550
yes or no

156
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:24,160
that will drive and did they proceed
your

157
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,649
may in in different directions so you
will see

158
00:09:27,649 --> 00:09:30,990
out of text on the slides I would try to
be brief but

159
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:35,160
you will be able to keep this as a
reference as well and we want this to be

160
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:40,329
for you that kind of help if we are
trying to build something like this in

161
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:42,529
your company's swallowing your
organization's

162
00:09:42,529 --> 00:09:46,000
BY SA Sean hi

163
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,329
yet we need to its way to set this goal
we need to identify

164
00:09:49,329 --> 00:09:53,459
and the assets right information on
ceased and databases

165
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:56,660
and so in the in a

166
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,660
if they if they EC and worse

167
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:03,180
a complex one then you will most likely
have a lot of

168
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:07,480
assets out of information and of pieces
that you need to analyze

169
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,959
so it's in terms of cost on time

170
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:15,899
its probative to go just like go on how
nice everything you need to prioritize

171
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:18,410
depending on which are they they

172
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:22,769
here most important assets for you I
which %uh the most relevant assets

173
00:10:22,769 --> 00:10:26,459
in terms of their they him EC and itself
right

174
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:30,040
safety identified ACN from one sees them

175
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,379
then you will most likely start with
that system but then

176
00:10:33,379 --> 00:10:37,779
ass ass ass a compromise with extending
then you need to define

177
00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:44,779
which other systems that you want to
keep looking up I and aim but

178
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:49,160
well there which watching for a sunny
south risk right

179
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:53,439
when a hey we have name just %uh feel
a.m.

180
00:10:53,439 --> 00:10:56,560
pieces of information just a few things
that you can find them

181
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:01,730
as a systems but basically and all the
information that you have in your city

182
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:02,339
systems

183
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:06,339
is critical from from company standpoint
so

184
00:11:06,339 --> 00:11:09,449
you need to have this classic by then
you need to be able to identify

185
00:11:09,449 --> 00:11:13,160
to what extent the information was
compromised and believing that

186
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:17,509
that is not EC at all and especially

187
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:20,829
SAP system being ice complex as they are
right

188
00:11:20,829 --> 00:11:23,980
you have a lot of different and no
mechanisms

189
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:30,040
trace make any sense that could keep you
explore an idea on what happened

190
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:33,709
to some extent but if you don't have the
system properly configured

191
00:11:33,709 --> 00:11:36,779
then you are I blind right you

192
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:42,350
that this not much thing that you can do

193
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:45,820
so I'll I'm what do we do right

194
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,940
if you go it's really different from my

195
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:52,959
like if if you know goal if the police
growth

196
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:57,839
to air house someone's house and that
guy was involving to some crime

197
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:02,680
they will get they are their computer
they will and confiscated this outburst

198
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,010
the computers everything

199
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:07,020
they would do we measure this I'm that
would be

200
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:10,940
replica and walk through the mushies
hashing and other procedures

201
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:14,600
that's very straightforward on ec2 to
the right

202
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:19,890
but with this ABC says we are not in the
same situation right you cannot go they

203
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:22,029
are unjust and bloody this system

204
00:12:22,029 --> 00:12:25,959
get the day matches get information on
style icing

205
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:29,850
because you definitely need to have the
systems up and running and that's that's

206
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:30,870
really a challenge

207
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:35,070
in terms of identifying what happened
because you get new information all the

208
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:35,510
time

209
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:38,950
eat are you know that air no mechanisms

210
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:44,170
on Tracy's are a treats he treats fool
it gets operate in depending on the

211
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:47,800
on the AM on the law you will get new
locks

212
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:51,510
you you definitely need to know that the
system is being used

213
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:54,649
how to proceed sorry david your hair one
more thing

214
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:57,920
is as US Hwy same and a

215
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,320
Sheree's they the the challenge because

216
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,350
who are extracting information from an

217
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:07,980
like system but it don't worry running
a.m.

218
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:13,130
we have to be very careful to at the
moment of its ok and information

219
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:16,410
not been mighty fine in itself so

220
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:20,440
this is the challenge in life or a
sister

221
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:23,970
this is and the kind of races which is
performed

222
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:28,130
with sister like ASAP

223
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:31,269
I in terms of the analysis right once
they're

224
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:35,120
the base station on this deficit is
called the finish on the prosecution the

225
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:35,870
finish on

226
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:41,110
and day in the shower this is the scene
comes identification information that I

227
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:42,930
think once you have all that

228
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:48,420
Don then it's time to get their hands
dirty right it's time to analyze

229
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:52,620
the information and I said before it's a
lot of information silos

230
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:55,630
i'd of different mechanisms some some

231
00:13:55,630 --> 00:14:00,490
my being able some others might not this
is just as a reference there are others

232
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:04,120
as well so we this lease the scheme %um
be there right

233
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:09,139
and but this is just for you to get an
idea on the

234
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:13,500
type of fair or the party of information
that we are talking about right

235
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,839
many of these a.m. of these

236
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:21,800
and Tracy some rocks are information he
starred in the database itself

237
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,199
so you can think about huge tables

238
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:30,600
a delight or or even terabytes of
information so

239
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,279
having done this very quick introduction

240
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:37,300
into the topic so she's going to

241
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:41,300
described affect issues and I miss his
face

242
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:45,620
on how you cannot move forward I'm photo
that TT of their

243
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:49,300
it a potential attacker someone and that
that managed to

244
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:53,800
breaking to assist thank you Jeff am

245
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:57,730
way want lopez's first is this is not
the complete process

246
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:01,069
and the process is much bigger than than
that

247
00:15:01,069 --> 00:15:04,199
you cover all the steps that day be just
plain

248
00:15:04,199 --> 00:15:07,810
and then at the end you have you go to
the attraction of information

249
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:11,290
and then today announces probably

250
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:14,370
if it's illegal case you

251
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:20,019
we I did it we ask us a ton we're not
going to meet their day at the Peabody

252
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:20,519
church

253
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:24,439
of and of taking it is he shot

254
00:15:24,439 --> 00:15:28,420
of what happened we they are also tons

255
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:32,240
our task is just too extra information
and then

256
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,519
they know you're the prosecutor or
another personal

257
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,240
I don't turn it on for some with legal
knowledge with the

258
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,980
the time I if that this the seventh is

259
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:46,339
right for a a row so

260
00:15:46,339 --> 00:15:49,459
the day

261
00:15:49,459 --> 00:15:53,860
scenario its fiction it's not a real
case death

262
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:57,149
a Astoria we meant to

263
00:15:57,149 --> 00:15:58,760
a.m.

264
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,320
visit me please mail they see my wife
send a fluke on money

265
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,370
this is who from and animals

266
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:09,580
a our gym 10

267
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:13,710
this hilarious of some people in the
convoy so this is

268
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:17,350
the the same time tho JB toll a before

269
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:20,410
so this is the information I was leak

270
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:24,090
ahead when we we need to talk to think

271
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:27,120
which is them but

272
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,690
it if you will be on Wii air I you know

273
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:34,200
a in the best really an early company on
quarries

274
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,990
end up email so here accounts there

275
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:42,120
management decision of what to do with
these so

276
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,280
dusting gather we already did

277
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:49,660
all the process of but day and I seen

278
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:55,650
name but deficit on other stuff then we
try to

279
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:59,130
and ice what happened supposing that

280
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:04,220
it came from an HR SAP system so

281
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:08,830
that's for both that this information
was it ok if I said the system

282
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:11,900
that's what the system is hr1

283
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,900
one of the 15

284
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:18,580
Tehran of first thing that we need to
ask ourself

285
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:22,840
is it was the system to take compromised

286
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:26,170
or just plus a request to the stairwell

287
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:30,200
possibly for a 20% cut access or

288
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,480
maybe what us that system

289
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,610
compromise or were our system correct to

290
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:39,610
in how to try to the system's so

291
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:43,900
with a good thing and a lot of
possibilities of

292
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:47,580
how these sleeper call it could be
performed before

293
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:50,590
in this case

294
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:53,980
we saw salaries which are locating

295
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:58,850
the table be a co-ceo 08 I which can be
a success

296
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:02,190
made us up some beer to any or there
everybody who comes here

297
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:05,470
there are other ways but in order to

298
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:08,770
though his presentation will need to
raise disco

299
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:11,490
so we have to have him us entry point

300
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:15,570
with these three is a videotape so

301
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:19,559
our first thing to Lewis take a fine

302
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:22,880
who quote that says to one of these or
reject

303
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,800
you want to sing into

304
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,820
in the use of that sucks I'm sorry for a
report

305
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:32,900
first we need to know

306
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:36,360
which is this if you rush in
definitively also cut the friend

307
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,570
security auditing features is very
important to us

308
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:45,360
a this question and them we need to
start putting up all day

309
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,900
toes obviously be the first one of the
most now only this would only logged

310
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:53,370
which the baby no koi de Janeiro know we
confine

311
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:58,290
Corby and what and then work on the FDA
to social which is

312
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:01,720
fortitude a statistical analysis that

313
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,730
a DBN is not the Security tab

314
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:08,160
Social Security by chez reavie by the
week going

315
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,170
get some useful information from the
transaction

316
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:14,820
so the first thing

317
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,920
to though us the host trying to to solve
this case

318
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:22,640
east to look at I some 19 and

319
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,760
tape to identify which %uh the the
Venice that in a while for us a good day

320
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,290
look

321
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:30,390
we need to know if and icing

322
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:35,550
the stool will be useful or not in a
combined we will process

323
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:40,760
this will be the plaintiff I need in
this information should be provided

324
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:44,200
to that concert on before restarting
this process

325
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,330
both ok to booking that this is not

326
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:50,429
air and no information way to

327
00:19:50,429 --> 00:19:54,090
getting to know that this anti-social
I'm no and the

328
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:58,020
the text which idea events in this case
will cut of interest

329
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:01,510
it means in the first case we're going
to

330
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:05,030
see all the events for the emergency you
sir

331
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:08,780
in this client I'm in denmark are fitter
witty

332
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:12,240
only no one event fun

333
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,440
any user so

334
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,070
if in the nineties you said this on
thing we're going to see it

335
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:24,000
if you was another user prolly not well
the

336
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,360
that sunshine s into any well we see
there is sort of this he would do it up

337
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:32,070
and we see that the mountains here so
what you just behind idea that s

338
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:36,960
are some transactions we know what date
did you said the

339
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:42,340
be they have these sorry what we had a
few we know it's

340
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:48,139
it %uh a that it be used to use a you so
much antisocial but we don't know what

341
00:20:48,139 --> 00:20:51,669
he or she did so doing information here
is

342
00:20:51,669 --> 00:20:54,750
because I am writing to you sir use

343
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:57,799
by somebody in that

344
00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:01,429
AP others so how important all rights
here

345
00:21:01,429 --> 00:21:04,940
which her what is the CBS

346
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:09,350
it is we don't somebody yes we do
combine outside the sax thumbnail

347
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:12,350
somebody who works here I'm

348
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:15,830
another important thing is the policy of
a much into service

349
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:19,409
hosted by much in this company thank you

350
00:21:19,409 --> 00:21:22,480
so anyway kind after two to this

351
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,009
you sir or all who all how is this

352
00:21:26,009 --> 00:21:30,620
their workflow tool access to you sir so
these are questions on information that

353
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:33,899
have to perform during the process the
process

354
00:21:33,899 --> 00:21:38,679
of talking information ass

355
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:43,059
we will play making very useful in there
seemed a little

356
00:21:43,059 --> 00:21:48,149
we go to their 50 transaction which
might buy a default

357
00:21:48,149 --> 00:21:51,460
stores forty-eight hours of 32k
information

358
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:55,000
you coming on fewer for ordered

359
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,570
period of time but by default the CS
there

360
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:00,090
the maximum

361
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:06,640
bit of time ship

362
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,090
so here we are fine something

363
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:13,450
somebody study that I some s e16

364
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:16,750
which issues for quarry tasaday

365
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:21,660
tables and here we see that they this
person access to the table

366
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:26,440
p800 she'll 8 so this is

367
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:31,180
what you have %uh sorry and we've come
so the user it kato such a bright

368
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:35,390
the formation here the them but
somebody's

369
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:38,610
way to a week because

370
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:43,110
if waiver from this action so they say
later

371
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:49,570
affinity data we won't find anything
here so

372
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:53,110
somebody so far because I'm writing to
you sir we've

373
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:58,300
what which we don't know what she
oceania who honey bee this

374
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:02,630
and we know that the EU ser got into the
table

375
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:06,030
so next steps way to

376
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:09,550
thanks for the creation of the soho use
this is her

377
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:12,800
that would be down to about it yet but a
son or

378
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:16,400
or twenty interface or what what wasted
then

379
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,770
we need to know if the SeaTac lower
comprise 20

380
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:23,150
I'm if there is any other left

381
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:26,620
in the system as we all know

382
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:31,610
instilled a love air which you said was
created because

383
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:34,640
that event is known able we can use the

384
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,730
see you the ASU I am change government

385
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:41,670
which start all the information about

386
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:45,910
you some management you don't see all
these are created by home

387
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:49,600
which provide what a sign which rose
everything

388
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,640
so in this case we see that the user

389
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,690
was created by I know you too which is
me

390
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:59,280
a.m. so now what we have identified

391
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:04,700
who created origin any that you sir

392
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:09,529
so to now without some question

393
00:24:09,529 --> 00:24:14,039
because a.m. the time from China and
analysis

394
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:17,210
is not an isolated tough we need to talk
to people

395
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:21,929
so first we need to ask cool what's this
person

396
00:24:21,929 --> 00:24:25,350
cool that you so we don't owe and then
we come from

397
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:30,019
hypotheses because in this case in this
fictitious case

398
00:24:30,019 --> 00:24:33,200
we know that this employees what some
occasion he couldn't wait

399
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,200
inside the company so call somebody s

400
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,200
use his account and them

401
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,519
if he s ha if he's obese

402
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:47,049
close with a key I he got the key so no
equal to enter a plea could hit two hits

403
00:24:47,049 --> 00:24:47,470
apiece

404
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:51,090
so it means that that's a whopping from
from another cost

405
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:56,570
I'm prolly the Sabie we don't know yet
and then

406
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:59,919
we think I'll be much as you saw that it
just

407
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:03,429
what used I we don't know a.m. white

408
00:25:03,429 --> 00:25:08,049
so that we know now that

409
00:25:08,049 --> 00:25:13,220
did what he said about we don't know yet
how this but a song but that's iz

410
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:16,779
to you sir so now we need to go deeper

411
00:25:16,779 --> 00:25:20,230
and Ace if there was any other kind of

412
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:23,320
know it up

413
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:26,330
we have we are thinking out here

414
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:30,440
about sorry a working it out it'd be a
tux

415
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:34,029
one call either need ASAP XPG remote
command execution

416
00:25:34,029 --> 00:25:36,769
and then I'm now on

417
00:25:36,769 --> 00:25:40,710
and and all unknown atop they are
correct and authentication

418
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:44,279
or think a lot any adult life axis

419
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:49,799
to a lower layer we don't know today

420
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:53,200
to social SMG the review witchy

421
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,210
and go to the export functions looking
well we're

422
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:59,799
we define the low impression I D of the
Gateway

423
00:25:59,799 --> 00:26:03,769
but in this case southerly the Venice

424
00:26:03,769 --> 00:26:07,499
what disabled so how Inc it

425
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:11,320
so it though this is here it's not
useful for us

426
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:14,590
so we can all for what we cannot detect
the setup

427
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:18,129
if this person I thought by by this way
with a

428
00:26:18,129 --> 00:26:23,429
s is a pic speedy we don't know so

429
00:26:23,429 --> 00:26:27,899
just try we had a or go with another
indication I thought

430
00:26:27,899 --> 00:26:32,039
we'll open it and I'll this is not a low
price AB

431
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:36,490
where now talking about that I so here
we find a connection

432
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:40,330
from ABS that we're talking for

433
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:45,399
and we see national with you said a DM 1
ATM which is

434
00:26:45,399 --> 00:26:50,440
the user who is running this baby sister
as 13 ASAP

435
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,789
the EU ser connects to the database

436
00:26:53,789 --> 00:26:57,980
but from the APIs on this ABC them you
cannot be

437
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:02,919
useful Rabs so here we see finally that

438
00:27:02,919 --> 00:27:06,399
this about what perform from

439
00:27:06,399 --> 00:27:10,830
it means that occurred with access into
that well we don't know yet

440
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:15,019
is what he did he say that ice we just
know that

441
00:27:15,019 --> 00:27:18,090
this person got axis to they

442
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:21,779
day use her and create another one but
we don't know anything else

443
00:27:21,779 --> 00:27:25,590
so

444
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:29,950
IV n work-up someone who shot some
questions because

445
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:33,730
we know we ask today team they are all
the same

446
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:37,940
get this I V two missiles this a benefit
of a computer

447
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:41,580
which is just bite so ever since so we
cannot

448
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:44,940
relate this computer to one person

449
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:48,050
so it does ma difficult from

450
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:51,650
we gonna so deter- mined at that sucker
have knowledge

451
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:55,350
about at that honest abe a.m.

452
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:59,680
what s I 10 question if that other

453
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:02,930
creating a user from the IRS

454
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:07,190
so up sis through they say people a year

455
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:10,390
to a table in the database why the

456
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:13,860
this when he did you sir the N word
access

457
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:19,150
for a race to the table because they
said predates went through that the race

458
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:22,330
created you sir in the application and
that but

459
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:26,240
into the table so what it is

460
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,680
the these personal way I its is this

461
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:34,490
suspicious because maybe he's doing
anything else on that ice

462
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:37,870
fire steps bill needed to use her

463

00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,430
chilly so TT model an hour

465
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:47,610
right now and then custom the difficult
but

466
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:51,220
which is we don't know this person
dumped 12 system

467
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:55,450
way to ship other hit the nation's I'm
finally

468
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:58,740
Channing Toney D i misses

469
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:02,450
a key concept the last one in

470
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:06,270
us SAP he's running on a database

471
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:09,620
and hit is system

472
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:12,680
he said if the system is compromised
totally

473
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:16,620
it means that the attacker can cox et a
letter to

474
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:20,830
so and I seen only delay it off the TV
system

475
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:24,740
East is kinda wrong we need to

476
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:28,750
and ice also the integrity of that ice
you know to be fully sure

477
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:32,290
that that we are fine

478
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:35,520
like to a wedding so

479
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:39,630
this is a complete process well we
cannot be alone ass

480
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:42,970
SAP and just so you know this to be way
to talk

481
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:46,690
we are people the air that I sex but

482
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:53,690
an OS X but and then take their
conclusions idea

483
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,620
thanks Sergio okay basically

484
00:29:56,620 --> 00:30:01,020
wrapping up this is how where we GNE be
shown on easy and response rate

485
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:04,050
proceed your and having a pic to write

486
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:07,730
so its addiction onyx classification the
C Shaun

487
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:11,430
and then it comes to style icing a

488
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:14,840
having hypotheses of what could have
happened

489
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:19,870
they get information on on a nice on
maybe go back to New

490
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:24,610
to from munich offices and generate new
in potential scenario sprite

491
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:27,750
and then in the end of their all these
brush address

492
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:31,170
actually carried out we definitely need
to know what

493
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:35,710
have we learned as a company in terms of
and maybe

494
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:39,030
new air security standouts maybe you
proceed US

495
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:42,080
you configurations so having

496
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:46,540
a renowned all the sweet up growing this
kind of the CNC in the future I

497
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:50,110
someone to russia's

498
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:54,350
any cell response process is key here
week we definitely need to have that

499
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:58,290
we mock most likely big companies have
something like these

500
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:01,710
and all approach we need to

501
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:04,760
also incorporate sabc stance on this
because

502
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:09,140
sabc since our are keen I'm how
companies are banking on them

503
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:13,850
yeah it could be not only an isolated
system but it could be

504
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:17,470
many systems that who have been
compromised therefore we need to

505
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:22,040
performed analyses we need to know the
extent of the compromise 22 now

506
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,279
which information was

507
00:31:24,279 --> 00:31:27,059
compromise right I love you

508
00:31:27,059 --> 00:31:30,950
the computer on us also this was
supposed to be an

509
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:34,399
an opposition right I know that it's
late so

510
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:37,809
it's going to be challenging I also
review some

511
00:31:37,809 --> 00:31:42,169
some other open questions a.m. if you
want to race them

512
00:31:42,169 --> 00:31:45,870
and or if you want us to discuss it and
we can do it

513
