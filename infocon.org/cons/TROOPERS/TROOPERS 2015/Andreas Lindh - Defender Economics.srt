1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:03,260
this is going to go well ap okay so

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:08,309
hi well come an a lot more people

3
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:11,509
when I'm originally court a

4
00:00:11,509 --> 00:00:15,070
that's fun he so term

5
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:19,020
so this toxic call defender

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,400
perfect economics and the

7
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,439
it's not actually about money but

8
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:29,439
yeah iight your

9
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,090
so I'm not going to give away money or
anything that

10
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:36,540
strieber but someone actually

11
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,379
pointed out to mean when I'm there this
was that

12
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:44,460
well this kinda suitable because it's
just one dollar bills

13
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,520
and that is exactly what the fans

14
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,129
typically pass no it isn't

15
00:00:51,129 --> 00:00:54,629
defense has a lot of money and they
still have no

16
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:58,170
budget at all which is can do it

17
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:01,649
okay so Who Am I I am

18
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:04,909
from customer Sweden I work

19
00:01:04,909 --> 00:01:08,680
essay security analyst for a company
called I secures sweet on

20
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,220
a security analyst can mean anything

21
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:16,250
I i do security analysts analysis on the

22
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:20,020
defensive side so I I do

23
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:23,960
log analysis the intrusion analysis now
analysis

24
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:30,420
threat and vulnerability analysis you
name it and before I joined

25
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,630
I secure I used to work for you really
big automotive

26
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:37,409
company so if you google automotive I'm

27
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:42,579
governor you'll find out pretty quickly

28
00:01:42,579 --> 00:01:47,060
a the point of this is that I know what
it's like to work at a you really really

29
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:47,909
really big

30
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:52,020
company I know it's not easy I

31
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,050
on I'm

32
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:58,830
other limb on Twitter I philosophize

33
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:03,729
if that's the word a lot which basically
means that I have very

34
00:02:03,729 --> 00:02:06,940
very very strong opinions about stuff so

35
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:12,510
if you wanna argue that's good I i
consider myself

36
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:16,459
a securities Swiss Army knife that does
not mean that I'm sharp

37
00:02:16,459 --> 00:02:21,550
just means that I'm versatile an

38
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:26,040
okay so what is this talk about well
it's mainly about

39
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,320
attackers because I think that we

40
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,930
in the security industry in many ways
think about attackers

41
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:37,070
a in the wrong way we own really
understand

42
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:41,180
the room reality that a

43
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:44,400
an attacker they've said and it's about

44
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,050
understanding them their capabilities
and more importantly there

45
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:52,270
const strains so both what they can do

46
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:56,120
and both what they can to for barry's
reasons

47
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:01,150
and ultimately how this information can
be used to

48
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:05,239
get better at defense and

49
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:08,360
as a bonus if you're doing offensive

50
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,680
security and this will provide some

51
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,870
input on how to no try to school

52
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:19,330
life when you if you doing home tests &

53
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:21,989
things like that

54
00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:27,730
and and there's a lot of you know really
smart people who have

55
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:30,760
moved on work or expressed opinions

56
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,849
in this area before so

57
00:03:33,849 --> 00:03:37,840
you should really know a look up the
previous work all

58
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,120
the Tanguay dodi and I solely and done
on

59
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,239
near Miller who I will be referencing

60
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,459
there will be links to everything

61
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:51,109
in man in in the talkin I will put him

62
00:03:51,109 --> 00:03:57,730
online so you don't have to be pictures
public if you don't want to and

63
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:02,389
since this is a talk about security this
is not a talk about

64
00:04:02,389 --> 00:04:07,409
fixing anything because that's not
really doable

65
00:04:07,409 --> 00:04:11,840
in security I think I mean small things

66
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,099
can probably the pics

67
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:19,639
but and it's basically more about
raising the bar

68
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:23,220
for attackers than actually fixing
things

69
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:27,680
okay so let's get to it on

70
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,440
okay so we all know that

71
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,690
security in general it's hard and

72
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:39,849
defense in particulars very very hard
right

73
00:04:39,849 --> 00:04:44,460
so I mean Austin defense we very often
feel like this guy

74
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:48,370
and there's a lot of

75
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:51,659
saying same security about this so

76
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:56,009
for example the defenders dilemma

77
00:04:56,009 --> 00:05:01,990
in where it said that so the attacking
to find one way and the band the needs

78
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:02,560
to defend

79
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,120
everything right technically

80
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,419
it's really hard to argue against that

81
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:13,870
right and another saying that

82
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:18,169
has actually come up a couple times
during the day is that

83
00:05:18,169 --> 00:05:21,960
so when I talk to people like

84
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:26,580
especially people in the on the offense
inside

85
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:29,490
and I say that well you can do this and
they say well

86
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:34,600
I mean I could fine I'll way around that
and yeah

87
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,990
I mean there are no defenses that are

88
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:41,960
perfect I mean there are

89
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,670
defenses that are close to perfect but

90
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:49,570
you can't really use them because that
disables

91
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:53,260
alone other things like never connecting
your computer

92
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:56,750
to a network okay so that computer is

93
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:02,140
pretty useless to right and of course
we've got the media

94
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:06,040
so this is kinda way reference to

95
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,500
the talk that was in here earlier about
pyrite

96
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:13,910
for example so both vendors and media
are really good

97
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:17,200
at telling us Hall or some

98
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:21,540
attackers or right and you know how

99
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:26,470
targeted at axis the new normal and the
Packers are laughing at a

100
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:30,410
an hour defense is an everybody's
compromised

101
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:36,200
anyway and this is also no cut the truth
but

102
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:40,090
when we talk about it attackers and this
way

103
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:43,620
kinda you know create some

104
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:47,490
attacker mythology so for those who've
you don't know

105
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:51,440
this is abba he's the lead singer all
the Norwegian black

106
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,669
metal mom there are a lot of really
funny

107
00:06:54,669 --> 00:06:58,090
miss awning because he looks funny

108
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:01,340
so I'm using them

109
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:04,630
but the thing about when you

110
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:08,020
talk about attackers in the way in

111
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:11,120
this way it's kinda hard

112
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,280
to come up with ways to

113
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:18,620
do the fast because if ur constantly
told that

114
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:22,520
attackers are so also laughing at you
there

115
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:27,949
in your network now and they're their
life

116
00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:30,800
I mean my and that creates

117
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,939
a situation like this

118
00:07:33,939 --> 00:07:37,110
and this is went bad defensive

119
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:42,460
decisions gets me so this this when you
like

120
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:45,879
oh my god attackers also at Lance

121
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:50,099
I'm going to spend a million dollars
song appliances that I

122
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:55,030
don't really know what they do which is
not good for anyone except for the

123
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:56,050
people selling those

124
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:59,979
appliances do so

125
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:03,870
here's the thing and this is

126
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:07,860
purely coincidental that this that this

127
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:11,439
flies call the thing about the thing
after params

128
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:14,669
keno which was great I thought

129
00:08:14,669 --> 00:08:18,750
so on the 1 I'm yeah the Packers

130
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:22,310
are getting better all the time because

131
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:26,150
that's what they do investor job

132
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:31,180
but and no its not possible to protect
against

133
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:34,300
everything you can't do that

134
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:38,750
so I mean last year they're worth

135
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:44,600
I don't think it was ten thousand dollar
bill at the start

136
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,470
were assigned CV's but I was pretty
close

137
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:52,339
right and I mean you can't really

138
00:08:52,339 --> 00:08:57,699
keep up without it's not possible

139
00:08:57,699 --> 00:09:00,819
but on the other hand

140
00:09:00,819 --> 00:09:05,879
no attack you really have infinite
resources

141
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:10,689
so the assumption in like sayings like
the

142
00:09:10,689 --> 00:09:13,939
defenders the llama and you know the
skilled and motivated

143
00:09:13,939 --> 00:09:18,879
attacker is that the attacker pass the
time and steals and

144
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:22,319
budget to

145
00:09:22,319 --> 00:09:25,959
life go along and attack them feel he
gets a

146
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:31,139
thats kinda been unrealistic assumption
right

147
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:34,829
I mean bats really that's not really

148
00:09:34,829 --> 00:09:38,639
know how it works and

149
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:44,459
do you really need to protect against
everything with I'm pretty sure that

150
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:47,850
a the bossed majority

151
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:51,410
of the vulnerabilities that were signed
TV's

152
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:55,170
last year the 9000 something bonneville
this

153
00:09:55,170 --> 00:10:00,850
has never been exploited im the while
and

154
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:04,160
this pretty much comes from this

155
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,250
when we talk about attackers

156
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:11,529
we tend to think hackers so

157
00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:14,740
a hacker it's a like

158
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:17,910
in so im my mind packard

159
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:20,930
I consider myself something

160
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:24,029
I like about im my mind pactor

161
00:10:24,029 --> 00:10:27,819
is someone who is really good at solving
problems

162
00:10:27,819 --> 00:10:31,040
and who is very innovative and will come
up with

163
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,750
like new ways to Sol

164
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:38,059
problems but an attacker

165
00:10:38,059 --> 00:10:41,699
today in juice to thousand

166
00:10:41,699 --> 00:10:45,019
15 typically isn't really hacker

167
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:48,040
I mean there are apps

168
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,139
Siemens sim similarities and there are
hackers

169
00:10:51,139 --> 00:10:55,300
in ball by an attacker today is more on

170
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:58,589
organization than like

171
00:10:58,589 --> 00:11:02,620
a person right and

172
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:06,040
that means that hackers and the Packers
have

173
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,209
know pretty different considerations

174
00:11:09,209 --> 00:11:14,019
so where hacker could just think that

175
00:11:14,019 --> 00:11:18,490
d I can think the 100 waz into this been
at work

176
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:22,300
an attacker needs to think about
different things

177
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:25,350
like for example I

178
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:28,850
I think this is a great tweet so

179
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:32,220
as soon as you have in organization

180
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:36,069
you have other things too think about
you have to keep your

181
00:11:36,069 --> 00:11:39,800
both happy have to keep their budget

182
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:44,449
you might have to keep or following on
designated

183
00:11:44,449 --> 00:11:47,449
workflows you might have to use

184
00:11:47,449 --> 00:11:51,089
certain tools you might have to do a lot
of things that

185
00:11:51,089 --> 00:11:54,089
you know you and I do in our

186
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:57,940
jobs but no in a different context

187
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:01,389
and and

188
00:12:01,389 --> 00:12:04,740
Dean all day so with the in a speech

189
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:07,910
or a presentation called attack them up
in 2000

190
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:11,930
11 that if the cost

191
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:15,120
of attack is less than the value
information to the attacker

192
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,870
you will be attack and this is kinda way

193
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:22,149
he's basically in a really fancy way
saying that

194
00:12:22,149 --> 00:12:25,750
what you do has to have a positive

195
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:30,569
are alive which is I mean it doesn't you
know necessarily

196
00:12:30,569 --> 00:12:36,880
have to do with money by

197
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,320
the cost all the attack has to be less
than what the

198
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,690
returns otherwise is not going to you

199
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:47,450
be worth it I'm sure there are no

200
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:51,290
cases with this is not really valid

201
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:55,650
by in most cases hopes up

202
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:59,740
so the but actor

203
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:05,210
economics in this is that for an attack
to take place it has to be

204
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:09,600
economically motivated and I say
economically because

205
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,130
doesn't necessarily have to be about
money and

206
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:17,410
when it's motivated the attack has to be
executed

207
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:21,010
with the resources available to the
attacker

208
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:24,500
app that type so

209
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:28,800
and the bottom line to the system that
the attacker has to keep it within he

210
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,670
budget and that budget

211
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:37,230
will of course very for different
reasons on where

212
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:40,260
coming to that so

213
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:45,420
if we flip that coin weekend tennis say
that the

214
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:49,790
def under economics is that if the

215
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:54,020
the family can figure out what the
limitations what the weak spots

216
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:58,050
in a certain attackers he can make those
areas more expensive

217
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:01,740
for for the the packet and

218
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:05,060
by doing that he can very the attackers

219
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:09,140
budget so it's no longer worth it to the
fact that

220
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:16,069
particular target for that particular
attack

221
00:14:16,069 --> 00:14:18,970
I can see a love you are going like mmm
10 this

222
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:22,550
world what was going with this and

223
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:26,199
that's okay so how do you actually do
that

224
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:29,680
okay so the first thing you need to do
is actually no

225
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,740
your animee and this is time does

226
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:37,660
something that vendors say so I've read
a lot a blog post

227
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:40,980
were around us thing like know the
adversary

228
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:44,079
and then they say nothing about the

229
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,199
a bursary except that there really a
boss

230
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:50,860
a and that doesn't really help right

231
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:54,569
we we need to actually do research

232
00:14:54,569 --> 00:14:58,829
on the Packers to be able to pundits up

233
00:14:58,829 --> 00:15:04,189
and the way we do this s by attacker
profiling this is not you know a really

234
00:15:04,189 --> 00:15:05,050
serious

235
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:09,230
really know low-level I profiling

236
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:12,690
am only going to use three areas

237
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:16,010
to be able to provide some

238
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:20,920
examples you can basically use which
areas you want they will probably vary

239
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,920
that depending on the attack

240
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,030
but these areas our motivation

241
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:31,600
resources and procedures this is now

242
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,820
threat modeling this is this touches
base on

243
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,990
threat modeling but it's not I'm I can't
really do

244
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:42,410
threat modeling I haven't read that
threat modeling

245
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:46,120
ok bye Adam something

246
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:49,210
and so

247
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:52,850
what we need to know is what's the
motivation all the attacker what's the

248
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:54,340
motivation behind the

249
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:58,510
attack and more importantly what's the
level of motivation

250
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:01,560
per part so if you look at my motivation
on

251
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:05,980
media you can see that the

252
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:09,670
NSA when the NSA's eaves the dropping

253
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:13,400
they are really motivated when it comes
to eavesdropping on

254
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,960
at work snow so they will spend a lot

255
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:20,530
in in achieving that

256
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:23,980
that's because their motivation Pretoria
really high

257
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:28,320
but when it comes to this all 30

258
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,990
who I found on by have no idea who is
this

259
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:36,689
I hope it's no one's ground for the
world

260
00:16:36,689 --> 00:16:39,249
if that diana now

261
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:43,860
so their plot they're probably not very
motivated

262
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:47,179
when it comes to spying on her so

263
00:16:47,179 --> 00:16:50,809
if she drops off their radar because
they

264
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:54,170
space by on everyone they will just like

265
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:57,639
assume that okay so her computer bro
where she died

266
00:16:57,639 --> 00:17:03,230
I so they won't really you know it's
time someone in juneau finding out why

267
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,569
because they don't care about her

268
00:17:04,569 --> 00:17:10,260
and then we got the resources and this
could be you know pretty much

269
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:14,139
anything you know about the resources
all the attacker but

270
00:17:14,139 --> 00:17:17,169
typically like people steals

271
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:20,760
tools infrastructure

272
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:24,409
supply chain et cetera and

273
00:17:24,409 --> 00:17:27,500
the willingness to actually spend these
resources

274
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:31,299
depends on motivation so no motivation

275
00:17:31,299 --> 00:17:36,529
no spend resources and then we get the

276
00:17:36,529 --> 00:17:41,389
the procedures which is basically so how
does this attacker actually do

277
00:17:41,389 --> 00:17:45,080
attack miss could be like preferred

278
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:48,320
attack vectors typical post expectation
activities

279
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,940
if this attacker actually willing to
change the way he does

280
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:56,350
but I so that you have several preferred

281
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:59,500
the factors and saw and

282
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:04,799
procedures for an attacker who is
organized can't be life

283
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,809
do it a different way

284
00:18:07,809 --> 00:18:11,029
for every you attack because that's
really on

285
00:18:11,029 --> 00:18:15,029
economical and that makes it that makes
every attack

286
00:18:15,029 --> 00:18:18,120
more expensive than it passed to be so

287
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,570
the more efficiency and

288
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:24,539
reusability and scaleable the that can
be built in

289
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:28,019
to these procedures better for the
attacker because

290
00:18:28,019 --> 00:18:32,130
it means that is going to be less X
pensive

291
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:37,529
which basically means higher budget so

292
00:18:37,529 --> 00:18:40,669
to apply this reasoning

293
00:18:40,669 --> 00:18:44,320
to some examples I have two very
different

294
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:48,220
examples the missus to show that the
reasoning work

295
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:52,309
or I think it works from open for
criticism

296
00:18:52,309 --> 00:18:56,190
of course but the examples we going to
take a look at

297
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:59,769
is Google Chrome versus now our so this
is Nam

298
00:18:59,769 --> 00:19:04,169
point from that Mauer like
run-of-the-mill high-volume

299
00:19:04,169 --> 00:19:07,679
our and big company X versus

300
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:14,059
ABT group and be company on the picture
has nothing to do with the actual

301
00:19:14,059 --> 00:19:14,870
company which

302
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:18,010
because this is the a yet

303
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:22,830
aim made up senario okay but starting
with Google Chrome versus

304
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:27,029
now or so a most I'm you probably know
that boo

305
00:19:27,029 --> 00:19:30,970
chrome is the world's most popular web
but but but also so

306
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:31,770
in

307
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:34,920
I'm December 2014

308
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:38,130
go Google Chrome had a market share over

309
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:41,370
over 60 percent for web browsers

310
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:44,370
and the source of this is a

311
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:47,640
website called w3 schools which is like

312
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:51,120
a website for aspiring web developers
and

313
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:56,650
so maybe an aspiring web developer is
more prone to you

314
00:19:56,650 --> 00:20:01,370
Google Chrome than Internet Explorer so
maybe these numbers are a bit skewed but

315
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:04,380
let's say 55 or 50

316
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:10,200
so who promised not to 120 remote code
execution vulnerabilities

317
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,710
reported and between 2012 in 2000

318
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:16,990
portent according to the open source
vulnerability

319
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:20,250
database who is usually the pretty

320
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:23,590
reliable source so who

321
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:26,730
with this information

322
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:30,230
doesn't Google Chrome sound like a
pretty good impression with the poor

323
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:34,470
my work right so

324
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:37,920
if you look at likee really really high
level attack a profile for

325
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:41,600
now our we can see that Mauer's

326
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,990
volume the river mower doesn't really
care who it impacts it cares

327
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:49,950
that it impacts

328
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:51,580
enough targets

329
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:54,749
but it it isn't really going to notice

330
00:20:54,749 --> 00:21:01,090
if a particular party isn't in pick the
an hour prefers

331
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:04,779
drive-by downloads for the same reason
it be

332
00:21:04,779 --> 00:21:08,559
bowling River a that's easy to scale

333
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,609
and now we're requires

334
00:21:11,609 --> 00:21:15,200
file system access so like a universal

335
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,249
cross-site scripting body isn't really
going to help

336
00:21:18,249 --> 00:21:21,269
now work to be able to infect someone
you actually need

337
00:21:21,269 --> 00:21:26,730
file system access to their machine

338
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:30,460
if you look at these three you can see
that what I said

339
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:34,299
earlier about Google Chrome having huge
market to Google Chrome

340
00:21:34,299 --> 00:21:37,570
having a lot of on abilities you it
kinda matches

341
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:40,600
those rights so volume

342
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:44,179
driven good there's lot of people do
single

343
00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:48,249
crawl drive I'm download Google Chrome
is a browser

344
00:21:48,249 --> 00:21:52,139
and it requires five system access lots
o

345
00:21:52,139 --> 00:21:56,080
remote call execution on the bill

346
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,230
okay good there's something really
interesting and thats

347
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:03,320
goo her somalia has a really no

348
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:07,159
interesting supply chain dependency
which is X book

349
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:10,869
so Mauer typically yes its exports from

350
00:22:10,869 --> 00:22:14,279
X buckets and if you haven't looked at

351
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:18,600
time guido exploit intelligent project
work

352
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,649
this you real issue is

353
00:22:21,649 --> 00:22:25,650
a couple years old but not much have
changed

354
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:32,440
and in that he found out that that
pretty much know exploits

355
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:35,660
in export its are developed by exported

356
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:39,320
authors so it's generally repurposed

357
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:43,140
exploits from other sources so like from

358
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:47,240
Metasploit or security researcher blog
posts or

359
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,670
no that time think so it's basically
repurposed

360
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:54,960
the replaced the shellcode do some
modifications on

361
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,040
that's about it and

362
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:02,309
and exposed like that it typically

363
00:23:02,309 --> 00:23:05,340
develop for a default installation

364
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:08,510
of the target software so if you just
wanna do approval

365
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:12,299
concept you're not going to do and then
I'm going to do this by passing this pop

366
00:23:12,299 --> 00:23:16,820
this but you just going to or topic the
and everyone will

367
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:20,590
up claw and

368
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:23,820
Expo kids actually have very few series

369
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:27,960
I know that there's been three flash
serie de San

370
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:31,280
expected this year I don't really think
that's a

371
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,330
threatened and before that the latest
theory

372
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:37,590
in the netbook its the as far as I know
was in 2000

373
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:41,799
30 so not very many at least and

374
00:23:41,799 --> 00:23:45,480
the targets the targets software and

375
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:48,570
expert its are pretty limited to because

376
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:52,630
they can freely choose what they

377
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:56,040
what they've into to rate they have to
make do with

378
00:23:56,040 --> 00:24:00,040
what available and also you they will

379
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:03,980
probably go for that thing about you
know give them passes the Maxis

380
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:07,410
in these so if we if you look at

381
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:10,720
explicate activity in 2000 Courtney

382
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,040
and this is from the contain Joe

383
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:18,130
expletive table an hour

384
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:22,080
we can see that for 21 on the biggest

385
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,660
Facebook its only 10 new exploits

386
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:29,030
were added im of

387
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:32,820
14 and I was seven-plus and and

388
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:35,850
3 I so no Google Chrome

389
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:39,470
and if you look at how long it took for
those

390
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:42,860
explosive get integrated in expect its
we can see that

391
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:46,180
for plus it took

392
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:49,870
minimum seven days and the maximal

393
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:53,460
88 and for IE

394
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:57,020
took a minimum eight days in the maximum
one on

395
00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:00,540
have been a so for the sake of the
example we're going to give

396
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:05,010
exploit kits book a break and say that
exploit kits

397
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:08,310
can integrate any exploit seven days

398
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:11,430
of the patch right to be really nice

399
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:15,890
that's not through but thats

400
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:19,770
say that so if you look at the krome
security

401
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:23,090
model we can see that it has a really
strong

402
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:26,420
from nation it's actually made for with

403
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:29,620
with security im mine

404
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:32,800
and it has a really robust tumble

405
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:36,410
really really good some books and

406
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:39,520
all the tabs on all the plugins runners
I'm privileged

407
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:43,310
processes in this somewhat so you
exploit something

408
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:47,680
in a top like the HTML parser

409
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:51,140
you still have to breakout all this on
both

410
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:55,560
to achieve piles systematically

411
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:59,160
is now uncommon in like modern offer

412
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:03,190
but still and Google Chrome

413
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:06,590
produces patches really fast when they
have to

414
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:11,250
so they have the capability to actually
produce

415
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:14,799
and deploy patching 24

416
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:18,549
hours they've done this couple times
this is something that they say

417
00:26:18,549 --> 00:26:22,070
we will do this if we see life a CRT

418
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:26,549
in the wild or someone drops to see
really and or

419
00:26:26,549 --> 00:26:30,110
something like that and

420
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:34,299
they're also able to actually deliver
the patches to users really fast

421
00:26:34,299 --> 00:26:37,350
so good chromosome

422
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:40,700
security updates which you know no one

423
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:45,190
no help Honda all its possible but very
few

424
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:51,370
new which is good so all in all this
means that when Google Chrome

425
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:55,700
relief patch like ninety percent all the
Empire grew

426
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:59,460
from user base is passed within the week
this is like

427
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:03,120
unofficial numbers which I have checked

428
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,820
with unofficial official official

429
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:10,049
sources so it's not taken other

430
00:27:10,049 --> 00:27:13,100
him there and the rest of the town

431
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:16,129
purse some are like people who restart

432
00:27:16,129 --> 00:27:20,320
there there also were seldom

433
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:24,710
or organizations who have chosen to

434
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:28,179
not do like that time patching

435
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:32,229
to do centrally manage having was in
this case I think

436
00:27:32,229 --> 00:27:36,159
it's a pretty bad idea but so if we

437
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:39,549
if we look at the five chrome versus now
we're

438
00:27:39,549 --> 00:27:44,929
we can see that personal it's really
hard to write be

439
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:48,820
working what for throw you have to
change the world

440
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:53,119
bone abilities to the other and this
takes a lot of time

441
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:57,159
which means that if you do that you're
probably not going to just

442
00:27:57,159 --> 00:28:00,629
the rocks here today you're probably
going to live

443
00:28:00,629 --> 00:28:05,580
handed over to the Google by volunteer
so it just CDI

444
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:10,200
your something Michaela and this means
that there's not very many

445
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:14,359
publicly available chrome export after
which means that

446
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:17,909
expected scan unit get them

447
00:28:17,909 --> 00:28:21,899
and even if they could and they could
integrate

448
00:28:21,899 --> 00:28:25,399
but bonneville the in 7 or that
exporting

449
00:28:25,399 --> 00:28:28,769
seven days remember what I said

450
00:28:28,769 --> 00:28:32,210
about patching so by the time

451
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:36,539
unexploited integrated in Mex expected

452
00:28:36,539 --> 00:28:39,559
pretty much everyone who uses chrome
will be patched

453
00:28:39,559 --> 00:28:44,450
anyway which means that there's really
no market fourth book it's there's no

454
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:47,979
it's not feasible forex markets

455
00:28:47,979 --> 00:28:51,929
to actually use through MacBook which is
why

456
00:28:51,929 --> 00:28:58,929
no mauer is in part throw he's so

457
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:04,670
what moving on to the next

458
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:07,840
and the next example

459
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:13,050
so be company X the company X is a
really big

460
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:19,300
company they have 50,000 I'm ploy they
have a centrally managed I T

461
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:23,230
which is not on common among I mean

462
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:28,040
medium to large company and they don't
do rapid

463
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:31,350
patching which is also very common for
no

464
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:35,310
medium to large companies or Companies
Inc

465
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:40,350
general and this is because they have a
lot of knowing Parnell

466
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:43,670
dependencies everything very

467
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:47,620
if you go over like I E 9

468
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:52,270
something like that they have a really
low security awareness

469
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:55,350
um among their employees

470
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:59,010
these people will click anything
preferably

471
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:03,620
twice and this is also not

472
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:06,800
on common when it comes to this found a
company

473
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:10,690
security awareness is something you
should take seriously not something you

474
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:11,120
should

475
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:15,160
real I'll and being company AXA course

476
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:19,610
pasame the problem oh my god cyber and

477
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:22,280
okay so if you look at

478
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:25,470
a high-level attack a profile comes to a
pretty

479
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:28,720
group Anna this is kinda no

480
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,560
this is not an exercising how

481
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:37,260
to protecting a pity this this day there
will be no

482
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:40,790
Mar conclusive as everything else but

483
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:44,610
its for the example so

484
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:47,730
we know that a fitting room for parking
driven

485
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:51,540
they know who they are they are at
attacking

486
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:56,400
right so they're going to notice if
their attack fails and they typically

487
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:56,820
use

488
00:30:56,820 --> 00:31:01,560
fishing fishing is really no effective
way to get to

489
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:04,820
watchu want it's basically the closest

490
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:09,650
roots to the information sure of that
because you typically

491
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:13,470
can't figure out who has access to the
information

492
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:18,290
Europe and they've been known to use
both passed

493
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:21,560
boner boner built this old old ace

494
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:25,410
and Saturday's and the use both

495
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:28,590
off-the-shelf and custom tools and now
our

496
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:32,190
and their really really good at the

497
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:36,050
holes intrusion pace so when they're
already in

498
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:39,120
relieve efficient the really this a plan

499
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,530
they know exactly what they're looking
for they're really good at

500
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:46,790
playing and they're also really good at
maintaining

501
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:53,200
a Press thing under the radar for a long
time and they're generally very

502
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,510
very professional and this is I mean

503
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:58,889
you can have a life too

504
00:31:58,889 --> 00:32:01,889
opinions about the stealthy presence
part by

505
00:32:01,889 --> 00:32:07,239
their style the not so there's been some

506
00:32:07,239 --> 00:32:10,799
some previous research into a BTU need
to keep

507
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:14,559
attacks so at the Virus Bulletin
conference and

508
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:18,049
2013 and no known

509
00:32:18,049 --> 00:32:22,840
Miller from a secure how to talk call
statistically effective protection

510
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:23,239
against

511
00:32:23,239 --> 00:32:26,899
a bit the attacks on what he did with
that he took like nine

512
00:32:26,899 --> 00:32:29,940
30 export some post that pic securing
found

513
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:34,220
and in the while the random against a
number all

514
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:38,289
farm and the all these exploits have
been

515
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:41,440
3b that somehow to AP yep

516
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:46,190
and Iran them against the number of
different life mitigation

517
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:49,740
techniques

518
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:53,110
and one of them was Microsoft 32 the map

519
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:56,590
and that was found to block every one of
those

520
00:32:56,590 --> 00:33:00,110
export %uh so that

521
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:03,990
so that's good right so this is not

522
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:07,299
conclusive because this is the part that
attacker

523
00:33:07,299 --> 00:33:11,150
pictorial attacker will notice that I
mean

524
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:15,670
okay this didn't work might come back
with any bypass or my

525
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:20,210
trial something out right %uh

526
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:23,590
so if you look at a pity groups that
were active in 2000

527
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:26,790
14 I'm okay I only look the 13

528
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:30,600
group because I only wanted a data set
that was

529
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,740
sufficient for the that sample this

530
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:36,830
is not you know the family having

531
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:40,330
ATT's one all 1

532
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:44,700
this is not that so but all these groups
are from

533
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:48,710
Kaspersky site the a pretty dull
securely stop

534
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:51,860
com and their the pretty well

535
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:57,830
document but but and these groups have
been active for as long as two thousand

536
00:33:57,830 --> 00:34:02,500
3 not all of them summer 100 percent of
them use

537
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:06,330
spear pushing some of them used
additional

538
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:09,600
attack vectors to like for example the

539
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:14,129
dark I'll tell group they'd like a wifi
man in the middle

540
00:34:14,129 --> 00:34:17,520
attack very very rare I think

541
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:21,260
other attack vectors have been used like
three times

542
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:24,260
since 2003 so no

543
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:28,040
very much about fifty percent of them
has to use

544
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:33,260
series but none of them issues Mon and
Tue

545
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:36,649
and this is only what document that they
could have used more about

546
00:34:36,649 --> 00:34:39,769
and no got doesn't call

547
00:34:39,769 --> 00:34:42,980
and only one of those explores

548
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:46,399
bypass lane on the full ins elation

549
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:49,889
in that case it was a hardened Windows
8.1

550
00:34:49,889 --> 00:34:53,599
system and harden on a system-level

551
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:56,599
mark on like the software that was
target them

552
00:34:56,599 --> 00:35:00,000
level and if you look at the

553
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,529
software they exploded not very

554
00:35:03,529 --> 00:35:07,420
surprising Adobe reader

555
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:11,019
its on the top and then class in Java

556
00:35:11,019 --> 00:35:14,539
three each the Co Windows

557
00:35:14,539 --> 00:35:18,160
I E Microsoft Office

558
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:21,400
and WinRAR which is kinda surprising

559
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:24,460
I S but whatever works so

560
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:30,480
if we take this Imphal and looks okay so
what are the strengths and weaknesses

561
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,650
all these AP he actors

562
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:37,180
by the way we should stop using the AP

563
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:43,079
the acronym its the already tape

564
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:45,960
but if we look at that we can see that
their strength

565
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:49,640
are what they do of the day did

566
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:54,230
getting they're really good that and the
really good at staying

567
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:58,970
under the radar on the network for a
long time and the

568
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:02,910
generally behaving very professional
disciplines

569
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:09,910
structured way and if you look at what
they're not so

570
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:13,299
good a its so the gotta

571
00:36:13,299 --> 00:36:16,440
kinda predictable attack after

572
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:20,319
we know we pretty much know I shouldn't
say that we know about

573
00:36:20,319 --> 00:36:24,460
we can be pretty certain that there's
going to be in email at some point

574
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:26,839
there's going to be an email with an
attachment

575
00:36:26,839 --> 00:36:31,430
or anything and it has also been

576
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:34,630
shown that the exploits

577
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:39,480
that the use are actually pretty crappy
in there was a sofa

578
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:42,660
paper which I'm now referencing in it
because I

579
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:46,069
for gotten to add it by just remembered
it

580
00:36:46,069 --> 00:36:49,160
that shown like the beginner

581
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:52,480
mistakes in writing bad Expo

582
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:56,470
and the basically even if the exploits

583
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:59,720
or working the

584
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:03,130
they are just barely working so

585
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:06,930
with that in mind what would some you
know reasonable

586
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:11,650
options be an remember we're not talking
about making something 100 percent

587
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:12,710
secure

588
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:16,770
we're talking about raising the bar in
them in a way that is

589
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:20,119
those cheap for the the founder costly

590
00:37:20,119 --> 00:37:24,200
for the after so

591
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:27,740
some options for company X

592
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:30,950
so the cheapest thing accompanying

593
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:34,430
can do which we've already talked about
is actually

594
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:37,829
to deploy some explore mitigation

595
00:37:37,829 --> 00:37:42,329
measures so am

596
00:37:42,329 --> 00:37:46,150
company X has a centrally managed I
think so they can

597
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:49,599
easily deploy life configuration changes

598
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:52,730
new applications to works stations

599
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:56,109
so they can be easily deploy something
like he met

600
00:37:56,109 --> 00:37:59,890
over although workstations

601
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:02,950
in a couple dais that will cost them

602
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:06,869
very little some testing and some
maintenance

603
00:38:06,869 --> 00:38:10,450
and can also do stuff like actually

604
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:14,880
securely configure commonly talk

605
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,210
software and remove some of the

606
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:21,980
that attacked surface so for example in

607
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:25,329
exploit that targets the

608
00:38:25,329 --> 00:38:29,829
JavaScript the parser in Adobe Reader
would be totally

609
00:38:29,829 --> 00:38:33,630
worth less if Adobe Reader wasn't
allowed to

610
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:36,640
execute health right so

611
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,670
that can thing so and if

612
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:43,480
company s want to do something that will
cost them

613
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:47,010
a little bit more bout that will also be
very effective

614
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:50,480
that could deploying a third-party
somewhat

615
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,440
now this could be expensive depending on

616
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:57,640
on these some books but

617
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:01,349
you could actually you something like
Sandboxie

618
00:39:01,349 --> 00:39:04,500
which is not very X offensive

619
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:08,280
and it was still add something that the
attacker

620
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:11,080
is not expecting because

621
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:15,120
even if its explore this working it will
be like code execution

622
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:18,830
in another some books and there's
basically no way

623
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:23,520
except for maybe hosting to know what
the somebody

624
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,740
and I'm not saying that rely on

625
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:30,010
obscurity but adding an unknown layer

626
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:35,100
can be very effective and you know

627
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:39,390
them there's always you know the very
it's fun expensive

628
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:43,300
route that you don't really know if it's
going to

629
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:48,060
effective and that is by your way out so
there was a fire I talking

630
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:51,770
are or it was ATT protection talk with
with

631
00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:54,860
they're investing that demonstrate this
pretty

632
00:39:54,860 --> 00:40:00,000
clearly you can buy that product going
to cost you a lot

633
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,850
and you have no idea what that case all

634
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:07,970
the conclusion for this mother Eva
specter

635
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:11,750
the he's awesome you should all Google

636
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:15,250
other is so I have a son

637
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:18,540
these five we watched the Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles to

638
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:22,160
the other moss to splinter who is there
some say he's my

639
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:26,160
idle he so smart he's

640
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:30,270
like if come through with the rap that
would be that

641
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:33,770
so and he said you do not fight the
armory

642
00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:34,400
fight them

643
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,430
him type this is pretty much

644
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:41,500
what we need to do to get better defense
we need to start thinking

645
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:44,520
and trying to understand Packers better

646
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:48,900
because we're focusing on on much more

647
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:52,809
shallower things were like who can pass
the fastest mass

648
00:40:52,809 --> 00:40:56,490
just not going to work out so

649
00:40:56,490 --> 00:41:00,059
security card attackers were not made a
magic

650
00:41:00,059 --> 00:41:04,839
to paraphrase bruise shania and every
factor Haas

651
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:09,680
limitations and if you can understand
those limitations you can actually build

652
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,700
the defense's

653
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:15,150
that is going to be costly for attackers

654
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:18,619
to by I vast raising the bar

655
00:41:18,619 --> 00:41:23,190
which is you know all weekend hope for
and

656
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:26,819
raising the cost of attack can be very
affected because

657
00:41:26,819 --> 00:41:32,980
I've only talked about prevention and
I'm not saying don't you

658
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:36,430
at work security monitoring I work with
doing

659
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:39,690
with security monitoring that will be
released few thing to say

660
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:43,450
by and we shouldn't forget that

661
00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:46,790
responding to fewer incident is

662
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:51,070
going to be much better for us and

663
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:54,710
as I said this is not about being 100
percent secure

664
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:59,240
but doesn't Texas it its all about
making it harder for

665
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:02,520
attackers were still going to get
compromised we're gonna have to deal

666
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,690
with that k so

667
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:09,770
and for the offensive people and for
everyone really do have to realize that

668
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:13,600
thinking like a hacker's not the same as
thinking like attacker

669
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:17,200
there are a whole set of different
considerations

670
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,760
and when you talk to your clients about
schools

671
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:23,850
use real attack

672
00:42:23,850 --> 00:42:28,370
and you know basic school on that
because companies get own

673
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:32,390
in the same way all all the time and

674
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:35,590
where not testing and now for those

675
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:41,920
methods I think and in the eternal words
though

676
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,290
China play so you're backer that on
impress me much

677
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:48,370
thank walk Oct up

678
00:42:48,370 --> 00:42:55,370
thank you very much

679
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:01,329
so I'm expecting a lot of

680
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:07,480
criticism now yet

681
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:13,570
type

682
00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:19,660
you mean

683
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:22,860
not

684
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:29,860
up

685
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:37,740
up

686
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:41,690
are yep

687
00:43:41,690 --> 00:43:47,089
are okay I mean birth

688
00:43:47,089 --> 00:43:50,089
up

689
00:43:50,089 --> 00:43:55,150
now I mean that's the problem i mean
short

690
00:43:55,150 --> 00:44:02,150
home

691
00:44:03,109 --> 00:44:05,510
that's pretty good

692
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:12,510
no

693
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:18,299
but yep but what you should actually do

694
00:44:18,299 --> 00:44:22,299
and or mine mine

695
00:44:22,299 --> 00:44:25,789
suggestion for what you should actually
do if

696
00:44:25,789 --> 00:44:29,160
dig up a number or

697
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:32,220
exploits from like the last

698
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:35,250
two years that I've been used in this
time counterattack

699
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:38,460
and then say these would not have worked
if we

700
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:43,319
would have done this do you have to
actually give them

701
00:44:43,319 --> 00:44:48,160
something that that a you can just go to
them and say this is

702
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:51,740
not secure we're going to have chamber
there with a proven

703
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:58,740
yep

704
00:44:59,479 --> 00:45:06,479
yep cool

705
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:21,640
him

706
00:45:22,379 --> 00:45:25,810
no

707
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:30,150
yeah and and

708
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:34,050
yeah

709
00:45:34,050 --> 00:45:38,350
yeah but I'm I mean one thing that year

710
00:45:38,350 --> 00:45:41,670
could do as to actually look up

711
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:46,630
the paper from 90 and actually just
bring about

712
00:45:46,630 --> 00:45:50,110
I said look he's actually here's the
numbers

713
00:45:50,110 --> 00:45:53,490
I mean there's no reason not rollout

714
00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:57,900
ima it breaks very little thing I mean

715
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:03,369
it breaks very little I yep

716
00:46:03,369 --> 00:46:06,860
say people

717
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:13,860
know what to say

718
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:20,030
are on our way you have actually his

719
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:23,770
yeah

720
00:46:23,770 --> 00:46:27,500
the strip

721
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:31,880
choice

722
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:35,359
and this

723
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:38,760
this wasn't about protecting against
peabody

724
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:45,760
it was about making them example base on
a day to sleep

725
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:49,500
alright don't forget the underscore aka

area hi

749
00:48:19,970 --> 00:48:25,150
for hip-hop

whose up

754
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:57,710
all

755
00:48:57,710 --> 00:49:03,280
pro-life I actually help

756
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:06,820
several company with like more than
20,000 them

757
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:10,280
I'm employees rollout that them

758
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:13,450
there have been very little problems

759
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:16,740
and that's you know the typical company

760
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:20,400
they've got the to pickles I'll so

761
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:24,400
one 12 works great

762
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:27,400
its cost-effective bites

763
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:31,160
where this one tools after you mean the

764
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:34,410
and I export obviously over

765
00:49:34,410 --> 00:49:38,210
tools that him actually kicks

766
00:49:38,210 --> 00:49:42,580
execute US to all

767
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:47,000
where I'm and stuff executed

768
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,970
like the incident exposed I spent

769
00:49:50,970 --> 00:49:54,330
and assist with we're still really know
now

770
00:49:54,330 --> 00:49:57,670
on with public much talk at all hope

771
00:49:57,670 --> 00:50:04,670
but let's go yeah

772
00:50:04,970 --> 00:50:08,120
yep yeah and that's it yeah

773
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:11,390
and that's it because some attackers

774
00:50:11,390 --> 00:50:15,070
will be able to keep up somewhat be

775
00:50:15,070 --> 00:50:18,910
peep

776
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:22,000
the top yeah because I

777
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:27,770
yeah there is actually and that's where
the

778
00:50:27,770 --> 00:50:31,260
the No the the the Modi so Vick call

779
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:34,359
doesn't really hold up because if you're
im

780
00:50:34,359 --> 00:50:39,030
if you're in them outrun the beer
senario

781
00:50:39,030 --> 00:50:42,220
then it doesn't really matter

782
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:45,400
then you just have to know our from
Thomas

783
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:52,400
someone's something about yep

784
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:04,160
yep said

785
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:07,920
yep

786
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:13,300
good

787
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:15,290
good

788
00:51:15,290 --> 00:51:19,930
I think

789
00:51:19,930 --> 00:51:23,450
one of the main problems is that a lot
of the fans this done based on

790
00:51:23,450 --> 00:51:26,600
not feeling I'm going to do this

791
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:31,190
and then you know no one is attacking
and that's just stupid

792
00:51:31,190 --> 00:51:34,570
I mean you you actually need to look at
where am I getting

793
00:51:34,570 --> 00:51:38,640
the fact and then do some something
there and you also need to actually

794
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:40,950
understand how does the APAC work

795
00:51:40,950 --> 00:51:44,930
so you can't really im implement

796
00:51:44,930 --> 00:51:48,880
am at Bingo all everything is good and
then someone

797
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:52,040
comes along and find like a logical
volume

798
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:57,270
I E because I want help at all you need
to realize that too

799
00:51:57,270 --> 00:52:00,670
up

800
00:52:00,670 --> 00:52:07,330
yep

801
00:52:07,330 --> 00:52:14,029
up

802
00:52:14,029 --> 00:52:15,400
