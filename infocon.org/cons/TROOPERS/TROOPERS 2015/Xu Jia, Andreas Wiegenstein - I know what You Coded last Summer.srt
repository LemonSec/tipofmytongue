1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,159
hello everybody I hope you can hear the
loud and clearly a

2
00:00:03,159 --> 00:00:07,250
people and effective I'm I'm very happy
to be here

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:11,290
should you up again the true birth if in
a couple of times

4
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:14,750
and to the previous conferences the
trooper 30

5
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:19,529
talk about a lot of different
vulnerability scan SAP applications

6
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:23,380
and serve us like a very good other

7
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:26,590
telethon talented intelligence
researchers have

8
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:30,070
as well so in the past we have talked
about

9
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:33,120
wearability such a simple injection in
SAP

10
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,190
a month injections in SAP up court
injections in SAP

11
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:42,420
are victorious in SAP I'm deranged
privilege

12
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:46,149
elevation techniques in SAP buffer
overflows in SAP

13
00:00:46,149 --> 00:00:51,739
Klein problems from SAP lots of problems
in SAP software but no one has ever

14
00:00:51,739 --> 00:00:55,320
talked about the problems the customers
produce themselves

15
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,699
so this talk is not about faults in SAP

16
00:00:58,699 --> 00:01:02,109
as a software company but false by
adding

17
00:01:02,109 --> 00:01:05,830
custom Colt sure your SAP installation

18
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:09,010
which means by ending

19
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:13,689
coat that is poorly written and the but
the key question is of course if you

20
00:01:13,689 --> 00:01:14,439
talk about

21
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:17,520
coach security with companies I'm

22
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,880
to your party's politics up policies
politics of course

23
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:26,340
policies for coding is a LB trust our
developers they can do

24
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,860
what they do very good we have no
problems we trust our SAP systems are

25
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:34,390
sound and their own them with no
mistakes in our other court

26
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:38,439
but the point is these companies don't
know and throughout

27
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:42,500
to really show them they are wrong and
this is what we have done

28
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,259
we have been through a lot of companies
we have scant

29
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:52,020
one of their SAP systems the custom code
one of the recipe systems and BF made an

30
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,850
analysis about the problems

31
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:57,590
in the air and created an overall
benchmark which

32
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:02,119
we present the first time ever today
sells a press conference we talk about

33
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:02,619
this

34
00:02:02,619 --> 00:02:07,469
and as you can read we have scanned
approximately $450 million

35
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:12,500
lines of up court only if they succeed
customers

36
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,910
again this is not about us a few
problems

37
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:19,020
you can all the guys from SAP in the
audience can relax

38
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:22,500
we're not talking about 20 days or
anything like that I'm

39
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:28,230
in your sumner so I'm also very happy
that I'm the troopers conference

40
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:31,270
again make the specifics up security
track because

41
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:34,610
this increase this number of people
there on the audience

42
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:37,910
people that the really focused on SAP
security and that

43
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:41,330
there not just popping in because
they're basically every pro because of

44
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:42,320
the TV hacking

45
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:46,320
a talk and now they're hoping you know
this is really got

46
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:52,090
it helps the community to do that it
helps to improve security in SAP systems

47
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:57,760
in general thank you very much and up
for this so what's this talk about

48
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,690
first I'm we need to let to give a
little background on what is SAP and

49
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:04,560
what a specific to SAP I know

50
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,660
many people in the audience already know
that many of my colleagues also here

51
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:14,300
we know what's why what's special in SAP
but some people watching this maybe

52
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,950
later on the internet they don't know
that that's why we get some

53
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:21,530
basic not too long a information about
SAP in general

54
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:26,280
then we talk about other the custom call
statistics that we have gathered

55
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,070
and we can well from we can talk about
that

56
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:34,030
with the audience as well appoint action
here and if I leave

57
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:37,370
we propose some best practices you may
follow

58
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:42,160
in order to get the situation better and
your company over the next couple of

59
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,910
months last year's

60
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:50,790
for

61
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:54,700
so first I'm a little bit about me and
about

62
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:59,700
sure what what we've been doing PR SAP
security researcher for quite some time

63
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:03,510
we have discovered a a considerable
amount of

64
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:07,189
were abilities India set the standard
which we have

65
00:04:07,189 --> 00:04:10,989
I'm reported to a CPU in all instances

66
00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:14,140
and SFPs issue pictures and

67
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:17,590
given of credit on a rather unknown

68
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:21,009
web page on at this up community network
I'm

69
00:04:21,009 --> 00:04:23,930
usually no one in the audience knows
about that page so I don't bother a

70
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,970
proposing to you but they need me
there's a page which gets credit for

71
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:28,150
security researchers

72
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:31,250
and I'm we've talked about all worth it
he saw

73
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:36,870
I'm a fair amount of them at Bryce
conferences but bf also contributed some

74
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:39,030
of the results of all booked through

75
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:42,080
communities like the German SAP
usergroup all

76
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,690
the German Federal Office of Information
Security PST

77
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:48,949
sup

78
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:53,030
I'm from many people do not really know

79
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:56,440
SAP systems are really assets

80
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,139
to the German industry to the world
industry to companies that run them

81
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:05,490
so here's a slight which we have to use
more than once to convince people that

82
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:07,880
SAP security really matters

83
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:11,520
why should be protected because

84
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,729
a real lot of companies run SAP and the
business of both companies

85
00:05:16,729 --> 00:05:21,400
and from the stability of the SAP system
so

86
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:26,860
for example the specific customers
transport 1.1 billion flight passengers

87
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:27,550
year

88
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:30,949
produce sixty-five percent of all TVs

89
00:05:30,949 --> 00:05:34,120
77,000 cost per day

90
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:38,180
and a lot of movie so without those
companies being productive all of this

91
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,349
would not be possible

92
00:05:39,349 --> 00:05:44,330
which to some extent could be acceptable
but there's

93
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:48,270
one final statistic about companies that
depend on a fifty

94
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:51,699
with should convince all of us to really
invest

95
00:05:51,699 --> 00:05:58,699
research in that area

96
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,860
so that this is what keeps us motivated
through find more problems

97
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:08,410
report them and get them fixed so

98
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:11,960
some basics about SAP custom croat

99
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:15,020
basically all cost a must-read

100
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:20,630
run SAP right some additional court in
order to adapt the SAP stand up to their

101
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,820
specific business

102
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:25,060
purpose probably all

103
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:28,550
I can proof that I haven't talked with
all 248,000

104
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:32,770
but I think career fair amount of them
does that so

105
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:36,800
they do this one through internal
development team so they have the only

106
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,070
about 20 percent and Hong

107
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:42,720
the standard 4 p.m. the US external
developers

108
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,750
which means they hire freelancers or

109
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:50,150
they outsource to somebody that again
outsources to someone else and so the

110
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:50,690
coldest

111
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:55,220
somehow bill and brought into the
company and hopefully

112
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:58,710
does what it's supposed to do so this is
the first

113
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:02,440
first thing about a recipe development
you cannot

114
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:06,410
in the end trough the court you're
running because

115
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:10,340
you do not build on of the court
yourself in many cases

116
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:13,450
not in talking to some companies who
this only internally but

117
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:17,090
on the other side there are some
companies they're doing only externally

118
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:20,090
so this raises the question of for are

119
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:23,669
a the quality of the code and be at the
security integrity of

120
00:07:23,669 --> 00:07:27,910
called but business morale yeah a
philosophical question cannot be

121
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:29,230
answered by statistics but

122
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:33,970
we get to that effect later so
interestingly if you talk to SAP

123
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:35,210
customers and ask them

124
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:38,750
can wish can you show me your
development got out what are they like

125
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:39,150
what

126
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:42,230
what do you focus on in your custom code
development

127
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:48,810
what does the one thing everybody looks
at Tennessee anybody knows that thank

128
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:49,580
you very much

129
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:54,520
naming conventions what is naming
convention been a conventional is

130
00:07:54,520 --> 00:08:00,180
I'm and Methods that separates the
custom court from the SAP stand out so

131
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:04,470
if you write custom court units to stick
to certain conventions

132
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:08,419
so you cannot overwrite SAT stunned out
cold

133
00:08:08,419 --> 00:08:13,120
all your programs must start with that
all-white and you must clearly separated

134
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,629
that at the the problem is if you if if
your company

135
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:20,800
writes a program called thats Tamil and
someone else

136
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,800
a external company you hire also write
the program

137
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,830
that entire try to transport it is your
system with override

138
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:32,860
go on court so you need clear guidelines
how to keep that separate thats naming

139
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,130
convention and that's what

140
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:37,250
customers mostly focus on which is
definitely a good thing but it has

141
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,719
nothing to do with security

142
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,659
Norbert performance or a bus not to
mention ability of your cock

143
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:46,820
its it's got yes but from a security
perspective

144
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:50,550
there is no good guideline in the
company's

145
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:53,630
because their focus on the wrong area

146
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:56,740
so that sucked under

147
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:01,920
on the other side delivers some
rudimentary tools for static and dynamic

148
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,910
court and on earth

149
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:07,190
for example for performance testing of
the court for basic flaws

150
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:11,420
in the cold the can be there which
companies can use

151
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:15,290
or goal some some use them some don't
use them

152
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:19,930
but this is the situation and some

153
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:23,029
someone to detail about that that these
through with do not really have metrics

154
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:24,790
to measure the volume of the cold

155
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:28,690
for to us than SAP Customer how much
coat have to return

156
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:33,430
the question is always I have no idea
they can't tell you

157
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:38,860
law or like maybe a hundred packages of
court but how many lines of code

158
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:42,500
nobody knows that so this was the first
thing

159
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,510
that we want to solve with our benchmark
to understand how much court have

160
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:47,850
companies really written

161
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:51,490
process

162
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:55,360
so here some more substance to fix which
are important to understand for the

163
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,970
problems we are talking about living
later in

164
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:01,389
in our analysis here so first of all

165
00:10:01,389 --> 00:10:05,339
subsystems are designed to run
independent of the operating system and

166
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:06,149
the database

167
00:10:06,149 --> 00:10:09,720
so basically you can develop your
application

168
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,730
this year on the microsoft system it may
be in two years move it over to windows

169
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:14,250
this

170
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:18,920
the picture social care Microsoft I
didn't get money for the I'm

171
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:23,269
move it over to a Linux system and it
should still run the same

172
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:27,360
same famous for databases through you
use one database and maybe your

173
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,170
then migrate to another and it still run
so does the basic design of SAP

174
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:35,220
I'm so

175
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:38,339
SAP also has a I'm specifically

176
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:41,420
design proprietary front then caught sup
way

177
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:45,379
it's like a vet browser not met but it's
a brother

178
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:48,720
a very big fat klein's that makes

179
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,000
gives you access to a CPU and I'm
provides a lot of functionality

180
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,620
to interact with a Becca so

181
00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:01,459
also in STP in the business world their
specific requirements and regulations

182
00:11:01,459 --> 00:11:04,870
when accessing data unit authorization

183
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:08,240
to access important business data you
need authorization

184
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,319
for reading for for changing the state a

185
00:11:11,319 --> 00:11:14,480
it's very important and if you change
anything you need

186
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,420
main med change documents which which
document up

187
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:22,920
the use the weekends time on this they
change the use the records office

188
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,180
colleagues to GR by

189
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:28,220
editing his password something like that
needs to be in the SAP system so you can

190
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:28,759
really

191
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:32,110
haven't audit trail of what's going on
and your

192
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:35,720
your although your business transactions
are really reliable and auditable

193
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:41,689
so also you can and once up database
host the date of

194
00:11:41,689 --> 00:11:44,819
multiple different organizations recipe
calls them

195
00:11:44,819 --> 00:11:48,329
clients they all stored in the same
database

196
00:11:48,329 --> 00:11:51,389
even the same database came separately
of each other

197
00:11:51,389 --> 00:11:54,389
this is designed by SAP so

198
00:11:54,389 --> 00:11:57,490
you only need one database to maybe
almost like two hundred different

199
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:00,820
companies that are totally isolated

200
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:04,530
technically speaking in theory I'm
there's

201
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:09,530
also specific about command called
authority check most other languages do

202
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:10,560
not have a comment like that

203
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:15,180
which checks if the user currently
locked on has the authority for specific

204
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:18,540
type affection you're performing in your
quote

205
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:22,190
for summer read excess twirl HR across
or something like that

206
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:26,460
SAP also has a proprietary 60 layer
between

207
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:30,590
the up stack and the database in order
to make the other coach

208
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:34,310
database independent so you have just a
few commonsensical

209
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:38,300
in open 60 to to do whatever you need to
do

210
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:43,880
to read and write data in your SAP
system and there's also a proprietary

211
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:47,940
system to system communication protocol
called remote function call RFC

212
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:51,450
by which SAP systems can talk to each
other

213
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:56,040
its all in in yes appear old and some
place or another in

214
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:59,550
we'll get back to Los apiece a
technological

215
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:02,680
things in a few minutes so I

216
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:07,020
again if you talk two companies what do
you think that they say is the biggest

217
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:07,810
risk

218
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:14,519
for their SAP system

219
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:17,959
what is the biggest risk for company
running SAP with their systems

220
00:13:17,959 --> 00:13:24,530
any idea I'm alright

221
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:27,690
thank you very much the gentlemen that
the third drawer for pro

222
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:31,660
downtime outage that's the biggest risk
because the cost a lot of money

223
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:36,790
if your production comes to a halt cunt
cost you millions per hour if your

224
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,560
production comes to all that's by

225
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:43,190
downtime is the biggest risk and US to
make sure you up

226
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:47,110
your system is really operational and
you also have to make sure the custom

227
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:48,710
court you're adding to your system

228
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:52,130
is keeping your system operation that
not vice versa

229
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:55,880
so now let's look

230
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:59,610
into the statistics what we discovered
in our analysis

231
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:02,890
first football some birth about the
statistics

232
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:06,540
I'm to be very honest of course you can

233
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:10,800
take some numbers shake them bring them
into some perspective and

234
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,960
prove a point that you want to make so

235
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:18,520
of course statistics are not absolutely
neutral they are not

236
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,940
objective saw what you're showing you
here

237
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:25,010
might therefore yeah not

238
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:29,510
be totally object if that's just what I
wanna say here that justice can meet

239
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:29,900
with

240
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:33,360
for example you tried to shoot a rabbit

241
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,660
you miss the rabbit 53 just to the left
to short again you miss the rabbit 5 me

242
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:38,540
just to the right

243
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:41,690
but statistically the spare evidence
that no

244
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:44,960
so there's a statistics you can't with

245
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:48,580
let's have a look what what they find
out

246
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:52,660
we have analyzed I'm and we are still

247
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:56,670
analyzing the court of large
organizations worldwide this statistic

248
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:57,480
is based on

249
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,700
results of two hundred and seventeen
different companies

250
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,890
across the world these companies

251
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:07,160
have divers quality assurance processes

252
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,530
and maturity levels some already did
some testing

253
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:14,050
some didn't some head extensive
guidelines

254
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:18,240
others hadn't some new stores others did
and for what well that

255
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,500
quite diverse and what they have done
process life

256
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:25,920
they all various corporate sizes they
are mega corporations

257
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:30,010
among them let me look at one of the
systems and they're very small companies

258
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:33,110
among them maybe look at one of the
systems I'm

259
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:37,000
they have a different length of history
with SAP some

260
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,780
run SAP for more than 20 years others
just maybe for one or two years

261
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:47,270
and they also from various industry
sectors and countries

262
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:50,530
so there's a very good mixture of

263
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:54,250
of of those and we think that that and
an assist this therefore quite

264
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,260
representative

265
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:58,780
also due to the large number of
companies that the scant I'm

266
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:03,280
how to be billets this coat benchmark I
mean you cannot manually

267
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:09,280
of you probably cannot manually analyze
$450 million lines of code for various

268
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,000
mistakes

269
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,400
in in your lifetime I'm so we use the
static code analysis tool to check for

270
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,060
various

271
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:21,930
problems in the area of performance
robustness security and compliance but

272
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:22,500
the only

273
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,860
yeah focusing on security in this talk

274
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:29,870
I'm on things be found over there sign

275
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:34,660
maybe only consider the critical the
critical mistakes in the course of

276
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,110
course

277
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:38,240
ridiculous again are relative to 'em

278
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,780
its our perspective offer critical with
it's not all the mistakes the phone

279
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:45,980
it's the one that we think are really
dangerous and their

280
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:49,180
they made and that this text and the
data collection of the statistics to

281
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:49,850
give us some

282
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:54,490
some frameless between 2000 13 and 14

283
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:58,300
and the 2015 information is not yet in
their

284
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:02,390
people do that next year maybe again
when we have a significant

285
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:08,820
rice in and companies that test so

286
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:13,550
the whole the output of that can be
accessed online

287
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:17,460
SL you like for the QR take if you want
to do that now it's also a link

288
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:21,480
if you have a presentation later on and
PDF document

289
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:25,580
where the entire analysis and included

290
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:31,060
meaning also performance and robustness
saw

291
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:34,250
general statistics now the real fun
begins

292
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:38,630
so on average this is the first inside
the got

293
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:44,090
every company running SAP on every test
2.8 million lines of custom court

294
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:47,450
per system thereon not

295
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:50,650
entirely over the company per system and

296
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:53,810
what does that mean how many systems
store large

297
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:57,000
organizations have how many of these
systems any ideas

298
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,790
more than 10

299
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:04,230
for the friendly man on the left side

300
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:10,270
Beth more than 10 who bets more more
than 100 now you have a gentleman race

301
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:11,310
then typically

302
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:15,240
some companies even have sure to 300

303
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,730
production SAP systems not lot

304
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:22,470
just test systems but production system
so it's really a lot

305
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:26,760
some companies that others are more and
they're more than 10 area that you

306
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,670
mention right

307
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:31,180
but the ones that are running recipe for
a long time

308
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:35,090
they can have more than a hundred and if
you multiply this number with more than

309
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:42,090
a hundred you understand the magnitude
of a custom court they have created

310
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:47,650
overlap

311
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:50,810
yes of course in with what you write
your thank you very much

312
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:53,810
if you are looking at the same
production line you have overlap because

313
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:54,830
the transport

314
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:58,250
that the court is transported between
the systems but I'm

315
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:05,250
usually put productive system you have a
different production line

316
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:16,910
well the question is if you don't see
customers to distribute their court

317
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:19,930
across many of the production systems
yes they do but

318
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:23,600
if you're trying to to it to 'em week

319
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:29,040
the analysis through this kind of of
apology it's very difficult to sort out

320
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:29,890
this court so

321
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:33,250
for the sake of simplicity be just talk
one system

322
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:36,350
in all of these companies skinned it and

323
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:40,890
added it to the statistics on and on I'm
ice form so it cannot be traced back to

324
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:42,560
the company yes you're three

325
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:49,560
the question is if it was a specific
systems like for example all the CCC

326
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:55,320
I'm actually no we BB of what the
company through

327
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,610
give us access to any of their systems
they think

328
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:02,270
might be good for analysis for

329
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:06,580
maybe per accident is the only six
seasons I have no idea but

330
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:13,580
the company all this makes the decision
we didn't do that

331
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:19,580
for your schedule said I'm be sick or
system contains most of the custom court

332
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,920
probably yes

333
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:24,200
yeah but again I don't know so

334
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:28,120
and the statistic does not relook at it
but the it just found out that

335
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:31,520
2.0 million lines of code you find on
average

336
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,960
precipice umbrage proves that the
company's

337
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,050
do not run sure recipe standard solution
so they have

338
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:42,390
two doors significant changes to the SAP
stand out

339
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:47,240
to adapt to their cause was process for
at least its that perception that they

340
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,460
have to do these changes

341
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:52,120
maybe they don't have to do the changes
but actually they're doing that

342
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:57,560
that the second interesting thing is
that we found this

343
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:03,370
if you look at the type of programming
that's used 64 percent

344
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:06,430
of all the code module worth this forms

345
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:10,460
which means some technical program terms
procedures it's not

346
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:13,580
object-oriented already in nineteen
percent this

347
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:17,910
object-oriented code in methods so that
means

348
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:23,400
I'm the coat these companies programs is
probably very old and it's very

349
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,110
difficult to read jus

350
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:28,180
and probably they have to throw that
away at some point and

351
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:31,850
change it into object-oriented Corso
it's not yeah

352
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:36,950
from from a problem quality perspective
this kind of code is not very good

353
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:41,410
for me

354
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:46,860
here it now we go to come closer to
security on ever rich they of 14,500

355
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:50,120
additional input forces created by
custom court

356
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:54,030
so what does that mean that means that
the attack surface of your software

357
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:56,030
significantly risers

358
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:59,800
jew to the custom called you I did
because them many many many

359
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:03,320
additional entry points for hackers or
attackers can

360
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:07,250
feet in militia stuff so this is a

361
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:10,500
the statistic increase of your at Tech
surface

362
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,900
Expo the stuff of them or to the outside
which

363
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:20,420
increases the risk often exploit also

364
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:25,030
I'm if you look at the ad in full source
seventy-eight percent of the simple

365
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:25,810
crumbs from

366
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:30,430
SEP we have two cations which is like I
mentioned earlier the specific to elicit

367
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:31,110
the road

368
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:36,310
to access their back at most
applications that exists I actually run

369
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:37,030
through sup

370
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:41,260
go away and eighty percent of a call

371
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:46,450
this is also interesting if for
machine-to-machine communication its

372
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:47,210
functions

373
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:54,210
that can be called remotely from the
outside

374
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:58,650
saw therefore if you think a little bit
about the the risk that pro

375
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:02,110
that introduces the militias insider in
an SAP convicts

376
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:06,910
is the the person that has the highest
likeliness to find some porn abilities

377
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:08,390
because lost the fur coat

378
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:11,980
it six both at least up a custom called
not talking about

379
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:15,180
standout is exposed sup go away so

380
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:18,660
if you have a chance it does something
going wrong

381
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:21,850
probably that the back door it will be
exploited of

382
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:25,360
maybe also that sector but this is the
human interaction recto that's bad

383
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:25,820
people

384
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:29,070
look at usually made me pay accident
fine thanks

385
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:36,070
alright

386
00:23:37,419 --> 00:23:40,409
the question is that the phone system
but there was no line of custom code

387
00:23:40,409 --> 00:23:43,580
know your that wasn't there wasn't

388
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:46,720
they all this but the phone somewhat
forty million

389
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:51,320
on a single so there's quite a variance
of

390
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:55,019
of the magnet your so

391
00:23:55,019 --> 00:23:58,350
now you come some very interesting
general thing

392
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:02,460
they are more quality issues with
database access

393
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:05,779
then there is data base excess ink us
court this iz

394
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:10,350
astonishing if you look at the numbers
this on average 24 thousands

395
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:14,720
open secret serious through the
independent database Leah for the

396
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,429
database

397
00:24:15,429 --> 00:24:19,149
but they can even did yeah

398
00:24:19,149 --> 00:24:24,559
bridge spread it between read and write
access very to see mostly 320 alt

399
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:28,389
also significant amount of custom court
that changes

400
00:24:28,389 --> 00:24:33,919
SAP data but there's 26,000 quality
mistakes

401
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:37,720
in open secret curious distributed

402
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:41,279
across all test areas which means that
salsa performance

403
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:46,039
mainly performances also mainly robust
Prince but it's also securities things

404
00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:47,850
like sequel injection so this

405
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:50,919
actually that means that if you're right

406
00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:53,960
the database Cleary and custom court you
have a good guess

407
00:24:53,960 --> 00:25:00,960
its role to some extent something with
it is wrong statistically speaking

408
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:04,830
and another interesting output if they'd
already

409
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:08,000
0.3 percent of all SAP modules

410
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,670
custom modules can be directly accessed
via HTTP

411
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:15,720
so the smallest portion of about

412
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:20,860
applications is accessible through so
that the internet the entrance its does

413
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:24,790
at guys significantly is equipped with a
small number

414
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:28,340
that means that security solutions that
i've

415
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:32,220
that focus don't really help you secure
in your SAP system

416
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:35,420
yes they secure some part of it but not
really very much

417
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:38,790
especially not the park that you have
written your cell

418
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:44,020
forget that saw

419
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:47,080
what statistics on security and
compliance now

420
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:50,160
there's one critical security issue

421
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:54,100
flesh compliance issue in one thousand
lines of custom called

422
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:57,650
that's the very sound average number

423
00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:02,110
be far that means that persist that we
have more than 12,000

424
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:05,350
critical security issues in your custom
croat

425
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:10,060
again I'm not talking about the essay
stunner it's just your custom caught by

426
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:10,540
adding

427
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:15,870
custom court you really I'm make the
security situation you have created

428
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:16,880
through a lot of

429
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,130
other measures like GRC I like

430
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:24,200
encryption roles authorizations you ruin
all day

431
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:28,560
by adding custom caught because really
draws your system down

432
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:32,670
it makes it X possible to hackers makes
an exploitable

433
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:39,670
it interest you for loss of all kinds

434
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:44,389
saw these are the five loath top comment

435
00:26:44,389 --> 00:26:48,879
I'm security problem you having coat

436
00:26:48,879 --> 00:26:53,409
PPP broke it down to a certain
categories like

437
00:26:53,409 --> 00:26:56,769
authorization loss which is everything
you can roll

438
00:26:56,769 --> 00:26:59,899
with I'm the authorizations you need to

439
00:26:59,899 --> 00:27:04,049
check for access and the probability
here

440
00:27:04,049 --> 00:27:09,249
I'm indicates the the chance that you
have at least one of these problems in

441
00:27:09,249 --> 00:27:10,230
your SAP system

442
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:13,239
computer across although the customers
the Afghan

443
00:27:13,239 --> 00:27:17,609
and business the average number of
occurrences you find of problems like

444
00:27:17,609 --> 00:27:17,980
that

445
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:21,470
on your system so you clearly see
authorization problems

446
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:24,549
%uh everywhere and this is really
surprising

447
00:27:24,549 --> 00:27:28,749
because I'm roth authorizations other
one thing

448
00:27:28,749 --> 00:27:32,509
SAP has been preaching to their
customers for years

449
00:27:32,509 --> 00:27:37,690
and years and years and still this is
the most common mistake a custom code I

450
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:38,700
really don't get it

451
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:42,369
business I'm yet to me very surprising
that

452
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:46,669
that this problem is there everywhere in
every SAP installation at the object

453
00:27:46,669 --> 00:27:47,559
they have loss

454
00:27:47,559 --> 00:27:53,809
and Los authorizations stakes they also
make the mistakes everyone else does

455
00:27:53,809 --> 00:27:55,320
directory traversal

456
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:59,899
ninety-one percent probability of having
at least one directory traversal

457
00:27:59,899 --> 00:28:04,100
and probably you have a lot of them more
than 300 for system

458
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:08,470
very bad and directors reversal mean
somebody can mess up your file system

459
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:09,429
can read 5

460
00:28:09,429 --> 00:28:13,619
that out critical that you don't want to
expose for you can change fires or

461
00:28:13,619 --> 00:28:16,450
delete fights that you don't want to be
changed or deleted

462
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:21,899
at an NAACP so there's a lot of files
that I interesting that stayed up with

463
00:28:21,899 --> 00:28:25,340
this thought their the certificates on
the file system for example

464
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:30,340
SAP transports can be there a lot of
critical information if in five

465
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:33,820
including the lock while some of the
lock price also files

466
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:37,970
which could be manipulated allred
through directory troubles

467
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:42,739
that's also significant coat that
directly modify

468
00:28:42,739 --> 00:28:46,029
SAP stunned Oct database tables which
custom court

469
00:28:46,029 --> 00:28:49,450
really should not do especially not
without proper checks

470
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:52,919
because if you're if you change in SAP
stand up table

471
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:55,720
you'll you must make sure your that
you're checking the correct

472
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:59,309
authorization to do that this thing was
authorized to really change the data

473
00:28:59,309 --> 00:29:02,419
do you write the correct change
documents for that too

474
00:29:02,419 --> 00:29:06,309
what a table saw the change will make
its in an audit

475
00:29:06,309 --> 00:29:09,419
I'm job a testable and I'm

476
00:29:09,419 --> 00:29:12,520
still transparent and that many mistakes
a

477
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:16,630
in that area about across Klein excess

478
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:22,020
I I told you earlier that it's possible
to host state of multiple organizations

479
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:27,710
isolated in the same database in SF you
can attend companies in the same to the

480
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:28,390
mall 100

481
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:32,220
and all of them can lock on end up with
the data totally isolated which is a

482
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:32,520
good

483
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,809
idea but there's the possibility from up
to

484
00:29:35,809 --> 00:29:40,130
to skip that protection to across the
border

485
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:43,409
and reach in should be other customers
date of

486
00:29:43,409 --> 00:29:47,460
on the same database and the chance that
this happens as

487
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:51,770
eighty-three percent per system with a
hundred and twenty two occurrences where

488
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:54,409
up court simply beacon of this very up

489
00:29:54,409 --> 00:29:58,080
and interacts with data from
organizations this

490
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,630
brought program should have no access to
very bad

491
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:08,260
sequel injection I'm I mentioned earlier
that SNPs a specific sequel AR

492
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:11,779
open SQL between you up code in the
database

493
00:30:11,779 --> 00:30:16,260
and this thick layer is also susceptible
to some degree

494
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:20,159
to signal injection with a again some
frequency

495
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:24,610
however the occurrences are not really
dramatic this is something you can

496
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:28,240
get rid of quite easily with remediation

497
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,090
process this year something you have to
spend on significant F

498
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:39,090
and we're still talking only about one
system you have to do that August

499
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:43,670
so another striking thickness out of the
port of critical issues

500
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:46,830
they of beverage 10 were abilities

501
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:51,080
that are so great that the attackers
total control over your SAP system

502
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:55,990
total control I'm not talking about an
authorization mistake where somebody can

503
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:59,640
by accident read certain HR table and

504
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:04,600
run away with the data no I'm talking
about a mistake by bitch exploiting it

505
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,250
you own the entire box

506
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:10,010
10 out of them now I'm

507
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:13,370
we wanna see what does it mean I'm

508
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:17,630
total control over SAP system is again a
very broad and generic term

509
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:21,850
you want to demonstrate that and this is
why I brought my your friend and iconic

510
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:22,610
shoe here

511
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:26,700
to show us what this means yes I think I
guess

512
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:31,860
hello for the body yes I want to show
you how what does it mean

513
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:35,490
200 and the SAP system so yeah

514
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:39,530
I think maybe things like that

515
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:42,600
disowning a mississippi suspect the

516
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:49,600
actually you can play with it yeah

517
00:31:49,789 --> 00:31:54,330
that means if you have put a game play
and maybe you can know an SAP system

518
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:57,750
I'm so so question

519
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:01,110
my question is yes do you have any idea

520
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:08,110
what makes with it me on and as SAP
system

521
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,760
about cooking picture

522
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,510
not bad

523
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:17,490
and then

524
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:21,410
what can you do when you own it play
Super Mario

525
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:25,740
what but except Super Mario can you do
if you own an SAP system

526
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:29,140
everything Israel a very good job

527
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:32,270
but it more gently warm water management

528
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:37,820
like what can you do day all red

529
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:43,440
okay get money out of it

530
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,340
kill the business shot on the business

531
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:50,770
our

532
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:57,770
any further ideas

533
00:33:00,419 --> 00:33:05,549
that what we can could do is also to
innovation our previous

534
00:33:05,549 --> 00:33:10,230
so that means to create and as a user I
will show you how it works

535
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:14,090
so actually to show you

536
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:17,730
we can create a new user I have to show
you that

537
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:21,580
you this not excess and the system

538
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:24,940
so as the heck I can I was

539
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:28,529
say I called only thing other such
stupid name as

540
00:33:28,529 --> 00:33:31,970
ice cue you has a user I'm

541
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:35,240
you can see here use the IQ

542
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:38,840
does not exist so the user it's not
there

543
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:43,130
okay stunt then I will

544
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:50,130
look of

545
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:55,170
I will now look on with that another
user that at this tech

546
00:33:55,170 --> 00:34:01,250
aka a.m.

547
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:05,200
he has just limited access to the system

548
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:09,290
that means death no se8 King no

549
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:12,829
authorization no AC St

550
00:34:12,829 --> 00:34:15,929
sixty know ask him this

551
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:19,639
nothing really really limited

552
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:22,700
but what he can do

553
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:27,770
the only see he can do is execute every
part at Maine's

554
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:31,960
ng is he said so he ate and yet

555
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:36,850
what he can do

556
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:41,910
you can also pay so Super Mario yet

557
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:48,910
but I'm accident font and that's our
report

558
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:55,040
which has the OS ka month injection so I
want to show you that

559
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:58,220
one OS ka month injection this one
ability

560
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:02,050
can yet kinda to attack a oh yes it can

561
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:05,620
yeah so what that and ethical try

562
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:08,860
at the beginning as s justifies

563
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:12,380
appears to be not working

564
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:15,490
so but that hecho un won't give up

565
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:22,110
so that means keep trying with another
come out now looks better

566
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:25,360
at itself is this is a Windows system

567
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:29,700
it'll yeah

568
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:33,840
and I'm so I but I want to the to

569
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:39,910
is I prepared 25 yet I extend the server

570
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:43,450
so there could be in China some ways
yeah

571
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:47,460
both by and evil heck appease

572
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:50,810
film at chai with this domain and

573
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:53,970
yeah both by should be copied to the

574
00:35:53,970 --> 00:36:00,970
SAP system

575
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:09,380
the first thing s I will show you

576
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:13,280
the folder there's a chance Park in the
SAP system

577
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:17,050
that Maine for 15 because it could %uh
ko FAI Spota and

578
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:20,430
the other I should be compared to that
they have order yeah

579
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:27,430
and that's just do it

580
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:33,190
actually using publisher here can tout

581
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:38,010
download things

582
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:41,280
stakes

583
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,950
but it's working so thats check if the

584
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:51,950
highest-rated there

585
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:54,020
so

586
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:57,740
you can see that the fight here this
just created

587
00:36:57,740 --> 00:37:01,240
today just seconds ago and

588
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:05,109
its you know I said his sister from
China

589
00:37:05,109 --> 00:37:07,710
yeah

590
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:10,790
so that's that the same for the another
fire

591
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:17,790
it's the same

592
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:23,289
and this works again so now we have both
by

593
00:37:23,289 --> 00:37:27,490
from remote server 20 SAP system yet

594
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:31,319
and to remember the user I'm currently

595
00:37:31,319 --> 00:37:35,119
am your kind on the system has only
limited access

596
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:40,940
so now

597
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:44,890
I was that the chest part

598
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:51,890
sorry

599
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:57,490
and that this everything's okay at the
chance but this at to the buffer

600
00:37:57,490 --> 00:38:01,060
this one most that

601
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:08,060
than we are our go

602
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:11,400
way

603
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,220
way

604
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:20,040
yes to everything okay so now

605
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:23,349
which I get with the user I Q U

606
00:38:23,349 --> 00:38:30,349
so they see what's happened

607
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:36,510
and them but that they use a wasn't that
does not understand

608
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:40,119
and we are you stain you use that we've
created

609
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:46,100
and now in the system and better

610
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:50,029
the user has TMO prodigious esta the
original you

611
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:55,150
that means can cause every transection
cue on

612
00:38:55,150 --> 00:39:02,150
yeah sorry yeah

613
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:05,330
and the uses yeah

614
00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:06,790
yeah

615
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:09,790
thank you sir so this this this shows
you what to do with them

616
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:13,950
OS come on projection how you can
promise such a seemingly technical

617
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:14,650
problem

618
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:18,560
right into the core of your SAP system
getting it was over

619
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:22,589
highest privileges that can basically
excess all data in your system

620
00:39:22,589 --> 00:39:27,980
by one of the flaws in these ten were
abilities and every customer has ten of

621
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:29,599
these on every of their service

622
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:35,829
statistically because of the Costco
thank you for the demo she fell

623
00:39:35,829 --> 00:39:39,430
another one interesting figures I'm you
have

624
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:43,650
approximately 180 for proprietary
authorization checks which means

625
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:45,579
authorization checks that are not

626
00:39:45,579 --> 00:39:48,960
base on the authority check amount which
is available

627
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,520
up but based on the user name that is
locked on missus

628
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:56,450
very poor to do that audit us they're
really not like that

629
00:39:56,450 --> 00:40:01,089
95 ninety-one percent chance that you
have at least one of those in your

630
00:40:01,089 --> 00:40:01,839
custom code

631
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:05,119
herself up which means that you have
more than one server you have one of

632
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:05,849
these problems

633
00:40:05,849 --> 00:40:10,520
statistically this will give you a red
traffic light

634
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:14,680
in financial audits financial audit us
really do not like

635
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:17,980
using custom of a recession because this
is the one thing they are looking at

636
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:20,460
authorizations they don't understand
things like

637
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:23,930
watch your show you I'm like a mock
injection of stuff they don't know them

638
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:26,829
but this is the one they're looking at
and you have a lot of that probably

639
00:40:26,829 --> 00:40:30,250
also custom court

640
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:34,369
her raises the number of RFC neighbor
function what you have for

641
00:40:34,369 --> 00:40:36,599
machine-to-machine communication modules

642
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:41,660
by fauna 76 and only 64 percent of them

643
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:45,290
half they own authority check I'll have
have no authority

644
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:49,460
36 on your project which means the this
court is not only exposing a tech

645
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:52,630
service but also highly likely to let
people in because they don't know

646
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:59,450
check specific authorization for what
the module is doing

647
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:01,990
another statistic I really like if you
compare

648
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:06,670
the number of instances for somebody
made correct authorization check to a

649
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:10,070
number of mistakes they make per system
is also increasing

650
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:14,210
interesting that there's thrown by as to
what there's more mistakes than

651
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:15,160
authorization

652
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:18,350
then they are correct authorization
checks like before

653
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:22,730
their small mistakes were database
access then there is data base excess

654
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:26,120
these are very sad numbers

655
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:31,710
and pick by other there because the
guidelines of both companies focus on

656
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:33,580
naming conventions excellent

657
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:37,700
for saw

658
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:38,820
of course

659
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:42,070
this is a very poor situation your
Dakota

660
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:45,230
quality of custom systems is really for

661
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:48,540
but there's still some hope in theory so
you

662
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:52,100
you got for some best practices in order
to change things

663
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:55,510
in order to to to really

664
00:41:55,510 --> 00:42:00,630
get a change you need to do and %uh
Venice workshop with your management

665
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:05,110
if you want to do something with out the
backup of the management board

666
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:08,500
buck you can try to do something but you
cannot I'm

667
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:12,830
change the court of a big organization
by good will you need to management to

668
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:13,790
enforce that

669
00:42:13,790 --> 00:42:17,160
you need to convince them you need to
show them what's possible unit ish

670
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:21,170
to show them a vulnerability like what
we've just seen your a five-minute

671
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:22,110
general from sure

672
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:26,520
for example of one wonderfully all many
other good researchers out there

673
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:29,750
that shows the management what you're
doing what they have done in the past

674
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:31,480
years is fundamentally wrong

675
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:35,320
if spent millionth of of dollars or
Euros

676
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:39,300
on GRC on ross now three sessions but it
totally neglected

677
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:42,570
for example croat all our coats the bach

678
00:42:42,570 --> 00:42:48,440
statistically speaking so you and your
initial management that

679
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:52,700
that you have to do something and then
you should set achievable goals

680
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:57,280
venue change something no developer been
done a hundred new secure coding

681
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:00,860
practices overnight that's not possible
stop small

682
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:04,260
give them the the pop critical problems

683
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:07,750
first show them what a command injection
that's what are called injection that's

684
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:09,110
what a sequel injection

685
00:43:09,110 --> 00:43:13,340
and get rid of the 10 kill a problem for
all of your system first then

686
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:17,280
expire on to the next phase of problems
for example the ones that give you the

687
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,950
red lights and financial audits

688
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:23,360
but do it slowly otherwise you will not
you're just confusing people

689
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:30,360
I'm also you need to plan how to deal
with legacy caught

690
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:36,180
if you're calculating two million lives
of court across the organization you're

691
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:38,500
talking about millions and millions of
lines of code

692
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:43,270
you might have to put entry cleanup this
will cost you a lot of time in a lot of

693
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:43,820
money

694
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:49,750
think about what time you need but also
think about that it's not economically

695
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:50,550
viable

696
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:53,829
to correct all of them doesn't make
sense to correct all issues

697
00:43:53,829 --> 00:43:56,990
device a plan which other issues to me
too

698
00:43:56,990 --> 00:44:00,000
to get rid of and bitch other ones it

699
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,290
you can keep in your system or other am
waz

700
00:44:03,290 --> 00:44:07,720
to minimize the efforts to do that
because I know of no single company

701
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:10,800
that actually killed all the box

702
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,940
in their court actually that's wrong I
was once the winger

703
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:19,050
a source code audit for company in China
are

704
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:22,050
is the only company that corrected all
optimistic the phone

705
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:26,260
no miss no no exceptions all of them I
know of no other company that ever did

706
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:28,329
that because it's economically not

707
00:44:28,329 --> 00:44:32,030
by able to do it but you need to get rid
of

708
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:35,570
all the important ones and yet then you
have to accept the residual rest

709
00:44:35,570 --> 00:44:41,150
also you need meaningful development
guidelines

710
00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:44,200
yes you can launch a 200-page

711
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:47,349
guideline that helped develop a photo
but they will understand this

712
00:44:47,349 --> 00:44:51,460
but you should focus on the most
important areas

713
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:55,040
for your business second its

714
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:58,290
is how how important is performance for
me how how what would it be if

715
00:44:58,290 --> 00:45:02,800
if I overhaul my code at the performance
would rise by fact or 10

716
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:07,119
or twenty just by writing better access
to the database that that would be a

717
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:09,400
measure ago you can have to promote your

718
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:13,650
court guideline changes or at more
stability to your court

719
00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:17,380
reduce the number of dumps and of course
at more perform

720
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:20,520
more security focus on all

721
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:26,660
the relevant areas for your company and
also do not forget external development

722
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:27,420
if you only

723
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:30,540
train UN Charter developers your court
not get better

724
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:34,589
if you are depended on all source code
you have to have policies for the sixth

725
00:45:34,589 --> 00:45:35,430
on a developer

726
00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:39,060
and you have to enforce that and you
should consider that

727
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:44,530
the moment you ask people to give you a
quote for building new coat you should

728
00:45:44,530 --> 00:45:45,119
tell them

729
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:48,829
the only pay you money if the court to
deliver this high-quality

730
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:52,869
in terms of security performance
robustness and what else comes to online

731
00:45:52,869 --> 00:45:56,960
but the court must will be tested and it
must meet our requirements

732
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:00,579
and the advice

733
00:46:00,579 --> 00:46:04,660
application security is a very difficult
concept to understand for developers

734
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:08,670
in in contrast for performance and
robustness which is straightforward to

735
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:09,349
understand

736
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:13,829
if I forget the index yes the craterian
the database through this law

737
00:46:13,829 --> 00:46:17,299
yeah what if I forget to check that the
result code of

738
00:46:17,299 --> 00:46:21,460
of the functional then I might cause the
crash because I have no exemption ending

739
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:21,740
but

740
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:25,970
securities usually thinking around the
corner very difficult for people to

741
00:46:25,970 --> 00:46:26,980
understand that so

742
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:32,359
your trip it future I'm developers must
be specifically trained

743
00:46:32,359 --> 00:46:36,180
to understand this real challenge

744
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:39,960
and you need tools

745
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:43,859
if you want to check if your cord is in
compliance with the guidelines because

746
00:46:43,859 --> 00:46:45,359
with the sheer number of court

747
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:49,650
we're talking about it's not viable to
hire a thousand people to do

748
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:53,099
court quality that that doesn't help you
meat rolls

749
00:46:53,099 --> 00:46:56,769
for already testable requirements can be
enforced

750
00:46:56,769 --> 00:46:59,779
if it's not testable you couldn't you
can scratch that

751
00:46:59,779 --> 00:47:02,900
know what he will do it because nobody
can find out that

752
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:07,380
they didn't also need it or forget your
transparency

753
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:11,660
to see that what you're doing it's got
that where you're standing today

754
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:17,019
you cannot do something then sent a
thousand on it or through the court at

755
00:47:17,019 --> 00:47:19,269
analyzing three months later maybe

756
00:47:19,269 --> 00:47:22,940
you know what a quality issue must be
able to scan that every night or every

757
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:23,759
vehicle

758
00:47:23,759 --> 00:47:28,849
whatever your needs are and definitely
you need to measure the success of your

759
00:47:28,849 --> 00:47:29,799
activities

760
00:47:29,799 --> 00:47:34,259
in order to show management yes remove
something be improved the quality of our

761
00:47:34,259 --> 00:47:36,789
code it's no more stable it's more
secure

762
00:47:36,789 --> 00:47:42,190
its even faster only successful give you
the basis for low

763
00:47:42,190 --> 00:47:46,769
lasting changing your process if you if
you implement that and there's no

764
00:47:46,769 --> 00:47:51,940
success to manage with the kill it may
be the next year or the year after that

765
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:54,970
so what what else if the output of our
benchmark

766
00:47:54,970 --> 00:47:59,920
the court quality benchmarks the
business hopefully that's not be created

767
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:00,800
a budget forge

768
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:05,140
which we have demonstrated here is the
first benchmark that has been done

769
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:09,180
of its kind and it's used I'm

770
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:13,250
to provide guidance for companies
developing their own I've up court in

771
00:48:13,250 --> 00:48:16,990
Verizon base first the fall I'm the
basic

772
00:48:16,990 --> 00:48:20,420
at 11 stunned of application security
for another

773
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:24,540
is based on the outcome the most common
to most dangerous problems

774
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:28,760
which are yeah present

775
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:32,340
five basic business security community
I'm of which many companies

776
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:37,180
our speakers I'm at this through press
conference it's based on the statistical

777
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:40,430
a finding we had here also I'm

778
00:48:40,430 --> 00:48:44,650
recently released the German Federal
Office of Information Security ponder

779
00:48:44,650 --> 00:48:45,740
some for the side

780
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:48,920
I'm is has published I'm a

781
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:51,980
wanna of a possible the top 20 critical
up

782
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:57,400
risks I'm there's also a link about that
this is also based on the statistical

783
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:02,000
insights the game from the analysis saw

784
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,430
the music up eleven this can be seen
here if you want to use that as a

785
00:49:06,430 --> 00:49:08,110
benchmark for your company

786
00:49:08,110 --> 00:49:11,460
and I'm the PSII up top 20

787
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:15,550
is also in the slights if you want to
use that as a first benchmark

788
00:49:15,550 --> 00:49:20,700
for your company in order to change
something

789
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:24,070
protrusions written incorrectly

790
00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:27,760
I'm if your company run sup
statistically speaking

791
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,920
it has significant quality issue within
in your custom call

792
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:36,100
the company is exposed to at least the
following arrest system downtime

793
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:40,080
every voter ability can call system
downtime sure could have killed because

794
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:43,690
the system from the OS command injection
with a simple form of

795
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:47,430
see for example and if so both gone very
easily

796
00:49:47,430 --> 00:49:50,930
coat issue with great red lights and
financial audits

797
00:49:50,930 --> 00:49:54,580
which is the risk for your company
industrial espionage choo-choo

798
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:58,000
data leaks in your code is the risk to
your company

799
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,250
of course manipulation of your business
state of is a risk to your company but

800
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:04,390
somebody suddenly change is the chemical
formula

801
00:50:04,390 --> 00:50:08,270
you have or the bay you produce your
car's is not a good idea

802
00:50:08,270 --> 00:50:11,390
and the court could of the country and
back doors because

803
00:50:11,390 --> 00:50:15,430
some companies outsource and they may
have malicious parties sitting in some

804
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:17,690
other countries that want a back door in
your system

805
00:50:17,690 --> 00:50:22,070
and all of that can have a huge impact
and how do you find out that

806
00:50:22,070 --> 00:50:25,700
not by running naming convention in your
guidelines

807
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:30,980
a test like that so the next steps and
for that to come to the conclusion of

808
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:31,560
the talk

809
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:36,590
we the invite all the company's out
there to take part in our study

810
00:50:36,590 --> 00:50:40,490
pick one of your sleepy systems let us
get it

811
00:50:40,490 --> 00:50:43,650
you get a results for free it is. get in
for free

812
00:50:43,650 --> 00:50:49,320
and you contribute this output
anonymously to our results for get

813
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:51,360
people more precise numbers in the
future

814
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:55,060
so thats the the starting point to have
something

815
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:59,080
you can show to a management to discuss
the out

816
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:03,740
the results of that its tell people this
is how our company looks like this the

817
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:04,380
statistics

818
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:07,620
say we have problems but this show them
proof we have problems

819
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:11,350
we should do something then you should
think about optimizing a process because

820
00:51:11,350 --> 00:51:14,650
not joking you have issue for custom
court

821
00:51:14,650 --> 00:51:17,780
each company's sitting here that runs
sup Hess

822
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:21,820
company s a.m. significant problems and
their custom code

823
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:26,090
you should optimize your process should
make it better and maybe next year you

824
00:51:26,090 --> 00:51:27,340
can come back and say well yes

825
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:31,460
we achieved something be made something
better and this is

826
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:34,210
the spirit of true plus make about safer
place

827
00:51:34,210 --> 00:51:38,819
may drop off court a safe place make
their company effect place thank you

I'm no problem a you show 13 that on
average there was one defect in like a

837
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:23,039
three thousand lines of cutting back on
it

838
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:26,619
is there any figure debt you have wrong

839
00:52:26,619 --> 00:52:30,859
standard SAP codes about does it I mean

840
00:52:30,859 --> 00:52:33,869
is it better engine worse I'm this is
the

841
00:52:33,869 --> 00:52:37,559
and nasty question your exam 330 online

842
00:52:37,559 --> 00:52:41,859
I'm I will not I'm so that the public
but who everyone with a interesting that

843
00:52:41,859 --> 00:52:45,760
we can talk offline about that I don't
want to say anything about SAP standard

844
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:46,809
court here today

845
00:52:46,809 --> 00:52:53,809
will do that online

846
00:52:56,160 --> 00:53:02,690
we can talk later you thanks this

847
00:53:02,690 --> 00:53:07,920
do you already have an experience as
about that USAP products like

848
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:11,680
Hana enterprise cloud all of sweet fatah

849
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:15,520
but they wouldn't allow us to install
horse can I don't know but

850
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:19,830
maybe we can talk with SAP about that
and yeah

851
00:53:19,830 --> 00:53:23,020
maybe 'we've will have a future talk
about I'm

852
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:26,990
the quality of peace applications as
well but at this point

853
00:53:26,990 --> 00:53:30,770
like I said in the beginning everybody
or many people have spoken about

854
00:53:30,770 --> 00:53:32,490
durability from the standout

855
00:53:32,490 --> 00:53:36,090
just wanted to make a point that they
also other

856
00:53:36,090 --> 00:53:39,090
this other homework to do in your all

857
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:42,720
house in your own company which has
nothing to do with whatever

858
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:46,850
and whatever recipes play of course the
these are sound ballot questions

859
00:53:46,850 --> 00:53:49,940
but I'm not the focus on our bikes

860
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:55,000
research right now thank you

861
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:59,299
another question

862
00:53:59,299 --> 00:54:01,089
partner her you

863
00:54:01,089 --> 00:54:05,400
oh yeah

864
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:08,490
just just ask sure you'd like to share
it with your company drill

865
00:54:08,490 --> 00:54:11,970
with I'm fun factor in your organization
by tentatively

866
00:54:11,970 --> 00:54:16,849
every should sell

867
00:54:16,849 --> 00:54:20,130
at applications like that may be beyond
more money with that member

868
00:54:20,130 --> 00:54:23,460
security thank you

869
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:30,460
any more questions oh yeah and

870
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:35,520
expedient it's easy to run the or it's
still

871
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:39,869
easy to identify issues even present to
the management

872
00:54:39,869 --> 00:54:43,069
but many actually comes to cleaning the
cord

873
00:54:43,069 --> 00:54:48,000
the pastors finding the locked up
challenger said it's not a question

874
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,210
but its a government out of the
experience that we have had in

875
00:54:52,210 --> 00:54:55,400
tranquil kill the old code and to

876
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:58,880
cleanup a little beauties like command
injection

877
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:04,450
cross-site church yeah alright this is a
huge challenge in companies to deliver

878
00:55:04,450 --> 00:55:07,630
the legacy court that's what I had a
that's why didn't the slides

879
00:55:07,630 --> 00:55:11,980
that's the real a challenge how to set
up a change like that the organization

880
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:14,200
innovate your organization can handle it

881
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:17,740
different organizations have had
different approaches from doing that

882
00:55:17,740 --> 00:55:21,289
or which succeeded but they are
definitely some

883
00:55:21,289 --> 00:55:25,880
thinks you should do in the beginning to
analyze flexible what up the code that I

884
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:26,390
run

885
00:55:26,390 --> 00:55:30,210
is that court if I identified the debt
court I can kill it

886
00:55:30,210 --> 00:55:34,730
I don't have to reprogram it and to
North removal that were abilities

887
00:55:34,730 --> 00:55:38,690
but simply deleting it i maybe get rid
of 30 percent off my shoes

888
00:55:38,690 --> 00:55:41,839
easily things like that you have to
consider but

889
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:45,990
it's a challenge yeah and it's also
sometimes the reason why the company's

890
00:55:45,990 --> 00:55:49,630
don't want to stop an initiative because
if they think

891
00:55:49,630 --> 00:55:54,740
old if you do that if the scan our
systems not be suddenly no

892
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:58,220
that BF thousands of compliance problems
we don't want to know that

893
00:55:58,220 --> 00:56:02,010
we don't start yet rated that's not a
joke companies that that in a process

894
00:56:02,010 --> 00:56:03,829
that we don't want to let this problem
no

895
00:56:03,829 --> 00:56:07,170
we do that maybe sometime later what
they don't want to have anything

896
00:56:07,170 --> 00:56:08,040
to do with it

897
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:12,330
now because of the legacy code if you
start this if you from scratch

898
00:56:12,330 --> 00:56:17,010
somebody becomes a recipe customer today
or maybe last week they haven't written

899
00:56:17,010 --> 00:56:17,680
much call

900
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:20,990
then they can say well the start it the
right baby have

901
00:56:20,990 --> 00:56:24,200
good guidelines from the beginning but
most companies

902
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:27,260
habisupi for a longer period of time and
they have

903
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:30,630
big history of problems thank you for
the comp

904
00:56:30,630 --> 00:56:34,830
any more problems

905
00:56:34,830 --> 00:56:39,990
all questions

906
00:56:39,990 --> 00:56:42,119
okay thank you very much the
