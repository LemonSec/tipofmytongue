dirty I would say that these

2
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:00,080
announcements are um a repeat of

3
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,330
yesterday but they were thoroughly

4
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:04,190
targeted all the people who are still in

5
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:06,560

Alan Berta dev and I'm a member of the

81
00:04:46,449 --> 00:04:51,250
DNS or program committee I'll be

82
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:52,990
chairing the session this morning just a

83
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:55,030
reminder that if you come up to the

84

86
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:02,409
or making a comment our first speaker

87
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:05,139
for this morning is William tow-rope of

88
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:16,539
NL net labs and he is here to present

89
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:19,479
open Intel so open Intel is a project a

90
00:05:16,539 --> 00:05:24,490
collaboration of University of Twente

91
00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:28,240
surf net a CDN labs and in our labs and

92
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:31,599
our love's joint basically last November

93
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:34,180
band garland for Iraq also joined in

94
00:05:31,599 --> 00:05:42,310
Ahmed love so he sort of brought that

95
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:44,620
projects to our foundation so open

96
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:52,199
interest our tats almost five years ago

97
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:58,169
in too late 2014 the idea was to set up

98
00:05:52,199 --> 00:06:03,720
measurements to look into mitigation

99
00:05:58,169 --> 00:06:07,150
against denial surface attacks

100
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:09,070
it started with setting up measurement

101
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:13,450
infrastructure

102
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:21,730
said accumulating a collection of jean

103
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:25,450
files and with the goal of measuring

104
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:31,420
large parts of the global de deenis on a

105
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:34,599
daily basis but then the open until we

106
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:37,630
realized many applications on the

107
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:40,620
Internet are some have some form of

108
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:43,719
presence in the D in essence actually

109
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:47,530
interesting to have this collection of

110
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:52,690
data also to look into other services

111
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:55,299
and in this talk we will discuss why we

112
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:57,520
wanted to do this how we do it and then

113
00:06:55,300 --> 00:07:04,630
give a few examples of what we have

114
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:07,539
learned so far so yeah like I said the

115
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:09,990
original goal was to track the use of

116
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:15,910
the distributed denial-of-service

117
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:18,190
protection services but soon it was

118
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:21,150
realized that every network service

119
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:24,910
relies on the dns in some way and

120
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:29,020
consequently the dns or the history of

121
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:31,960
how DNS data evolves tells a story about

122
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:38,229
the evolution of the internet and it's

123
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:42,150
protocol so this some of you might be

124
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:46,780
familiar with passive dns it's also

125
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:49,599
keeping a history of DNS data but it

126
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:53,229
doesn't differently in the sense that it

127
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:58,240
does it passively so it doesn't provide

128
00:07:53,230 --> 00:08:01,180
the lakeil regular time series that we

129
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:05,290
would like we would like to have a data

130
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:11,890
point for every delegation second level

131
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:16,030
the delegation and a day so this cannot

132
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:18,789
be done with passive DNS because

133
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:21,729
you see only what people are actually

134
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:23,980
asking for so you don't see what's

135
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:27,310
already in a jean that only was been

136
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:34,990
asked for and also you have no control

137
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:38,559
of when those requests are done so the

138
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:41,830
opal aqua Intel performs active

139
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:46,060
measurements instead it's a sensor set

140
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:50,140
of queries to all cover domains once

141
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:55,689
every 24 hours so we send queries for

142
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:58,270
the shower record an asset but we of

143
00:08:55,690 --> 00:09:04,930
course now the Knesset delegation point

144
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:08,170
because of the song files for the MX

145
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:11,079
records also the IP addresses of the

146
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:14,319
names they point to and also tillage a

147
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:18,970
records for it from all the typical

148
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:22,300
queries are for DNS keys and CDs and

149
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:28,690
seediness resource records and we do

150
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:32,229
this at scale the width does gTLD

151
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:35,170
Slotkin donated or infer mobile and all

152
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:39,339
the new deities that we can get our

153
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:45,040
hands on together with the CC tildes

154
00:09:39,339 --> 00:09:48,460
that allowed us to use their own selves

155
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:53,410
to do this kind of measurements we are

156
00:09:48,460 --> 00:10:03,100
covering over 260 million domains per

157
00:09:53,410 --> 00:10:09,750
day and ok so the next slide is going to

158
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:14,290
be about big data big data yes because

159
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:17,050
the amount of data is in the same order

160
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:21,550
of mckee magnitudes that we collect each

161
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:26,260
day as the amount of base pairs in a

162
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:28,949
human genome and so this has been

163
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:37,870
ongoing since February

164
00:10:28,949 --> 00:10:41,560
2015 and so 3.1 trillion names or visual

165
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:45,699
record chefs have been collected since

166
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:52,750
then so that's more than 1,000 human

167
00:10:45,699 --> 00:10:56,589
genomes already we do it we try to do it

168
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:59,170
responsibly so we have clearly marked

169
00:10:56,589 --> 00:11:02,050
the address space for which we do the

170
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:06,430
measurements and also we first the

171
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:10,060
necessity in scanning from or doing the

172
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:13,180
queries for all those delegation points

173
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:17,349
with IP addresses from that block and

174
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:19,779
also we contacted large operators like

175
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:22,870
dot-com or the larger healthcare

176
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:27,810
providers that I might see a lot of

177
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:32,740
queries coming from our vantage points

178
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:37,989
also we spread out all the queries over

179
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:40,870
the day it's one data point per day for

180
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:44,529
each delegation and there's a square in

181
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:49,329
the lower right corner you see the graph

182
00:11:44,529 --> 00:11:54,009
of how other queries spread out of the

183
00:11:49,329 --> 00:11:56,500
day so what what can you do with all

184
00:11:54,009 --> 00:12:00,850
this historic data about all those

185
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:03,759
domains of this long area well we will

186
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:06,759
illustrate the use of Intel with three

187
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:11,110
examples first we will have a look at

188
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:14,740
domestic operational practices then we

189
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:19,240
have looked in how up intel can help in

190
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:22,689
improving DNS resilience and the last

191
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:24,699
example is a funny example like what we

192
00:12:22,689 --> 00:12:28,389
are also doing queries for all the

193
00:12:24,699 --> 00:12:31,180
delegation points for the txt records

194
00:12:28,389 --> 00:12:34,000
and people put all sorts of funny things

195
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:36,839
in that resource records which is kind

196
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,839
of fun to look at

197
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:51,630
yeah so this is the to consider the

198
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:55,200
impacts of DNA check deployment

199
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:59,250
incentives you might know that dot NL

200
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:02,279
and dot s e they have rather hide in

201
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:05,610
effect deployments due to financial

202
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:10,100
incentives if you register a domain name

203
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:13,110
with dozen L or dep dot as e and you

204
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:18,870
sign user and within a sec then you get

205
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:22,100
that the manfred less money cheaper so

206
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:25,310
our thinking was our reasoning was that

207
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:29,490
that's nice but it's only a small

208
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:31,890
benefit so that would probably only be

209
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:34,350
often a bit benefit to really large

210
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:39,420
operators and not to the smaller ones

211
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:45,950
and also the incentive is just for

212
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:45,949
deploying the in a sec and it has not a

213
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:56,520
requirement on security best practices

214
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:58,649
shall we would be predicted that the the

215
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:03,959
waiting effect was deployed was perhaps

216
00:13:58,649 --> 00:14:07,880
not the best way one one can do that so

217
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:12,779
this is historic data out of our intel

218
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:21,930
of the at a certain point which is now

219
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:24,779
and these two graphs represent the the

220
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:28,680
operators that have been a section data

221
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:33,120
and you can clearly see that on the left

222
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:39,569
it's the sort of red areas are 80% of

223
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:42,660
the operators so in dot Annelle the 80%

224
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:45,810
of operators are covered by jest or of

225
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:48,719
domain names sorry the graph represents

226
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:51,000
the 80 percent of DNA

227
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:54,480
science the main names the wet parts in

228
00:14:51,000 --> 00:15:00,060
that graph and indocin l that wet area

229
00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:03,420
is covered with just 14 operators and in

230
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:06,660
dot e it's even a little bit worse

231
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:12,589
80% of all phantom ants are covered by

232
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:19,379
just three operators now the table below

233
00:15:12,589 --> 00:15:22,769
shows you how many site zonas those

234
00:15:19,379 --> 00:15:26,310
operators have so those 14 operators

235
00:15:22,769 --> 00:15:31,920
covering 80% of our science urns have

236
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:35,790
four and half million suns in dot NL and

237
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:42,719
they almost three million of them are

238
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:47,189
signed and which is similar with dot I

239
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:50,750
see 1 million the the large operators

240
00:15:47,189 --> 00:15:52,319
have 1 million of the sons and with

241
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:57,089
700,000 sites

242
00:15:52,319 --> 00:16:02,309
well in both cases is almost 63% of all

243
00:15:57,089 --> 00:16:06,089
science earns versus around 1 percent

244
00:16:02,309 --> 00:16:13,649
with the dot-com not net and not work

245
00:16:06,089 --> 00:16:16,829
and the small operators for the NL n dot

246
00:16:13,649 --> 00:16:19,800
as E the you see still see the Dina SEC

247
00:16:16,829 --> 00:16:23,099
incentive in action there the percentage

248
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:26,639
of science earns is larger than income

249
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:28,740
net and orc but much smaller much

250
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:34,350
smaller than what the larger operators

251
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:36,750
do so it's easy to check or it's

252
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:39,389
possible to check with our Intel the

253
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:42,000
historic data and we noticed that those

254
00:16:39,389 --> 00:16:46,529
operators those large operators actually

255
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:49,439
never or almost never roll the sun

256
00:16:46,529 --> 00:16:54,209
shining key and also they are not

257
00:16:49,439 --> 00:16:57,420
compliant to Dean SEC operational best

258
00:16:54,209 --> 00:17:02,209
practices that the sunshine key is too

259
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:02,209
small they don't roll that often

260
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:08,860
well at least that's what we see for the

261
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:15,170
larger operators in dot Sen dot now so

262
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:19,969
this work was presented as the internet

263
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:23,870
days of the IRS the as e dot operator

264
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:28,860
and last November November last year and

265
00:17:23,869 --> 00:17:31,239
at the same time the datasheet I is

266
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:35,169
[Music]

267
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:41,000
increased the requirements for the

268
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:43,520
dinner check incentive that people that

269
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,940
wanted to have this fun financial

270
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:50,720
benefit had to do some explicit security

271
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:53,510
requirements this was in November and we

272
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:56,720
can already see that this has already

273
00:17:53,510 --> 00:18:01,160
impacted how the initiatives deployed in

274
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:05,570
dot se for example on the left one of

275
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:07,850
the optional requirements that operators

276
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:10,280
could do was to introduce tillage a

277
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:14,120
records and on the left you see the

278
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:19,910
uptake of the tillage a records for meal

279
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:21,860
domains within several domains it's the

280
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:25,820
operator here that introduces other

281
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:28,129
still si records is one dot-com and I

282
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:32,570
think it's also interesting to see that

283
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:36,020
this security improvement also spills

284
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:38,510
over to other domains so one comm does

285
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:40,400
it because it can get a domains in dot

286
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:44,480
as it cheaper that way

287
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:46,670
but of other top-level domains like da

288
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,510
janela and dot-com benefit from this

289
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:52,720
because that same operator also has

290
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:59,990
domains in those other top-level domains

291
00:18:52,720 --> 00:19:05,020
on the right you see a operator and let

292
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:05,020
me check what which operator this rough

293
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:13,740
yes banheiro

294
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:16,380
so they decided to roll to a better

295
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:20,010
algorithm so the announcement was made

296
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:22,350
in November in December they all removed

297
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:25,770
the D s records all the zones with

298
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:29,669
insecure and came back in January with a

299
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:32,930
better algorithm the elliptic curve so

300
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:39,950
that's that but what's there on the

301
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:44,310
right bottom so open interval can also

302
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:47,460
but we can also look into historic data

303
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:52,100
surrounding attacks so this is the

304
00:19:47,460 --> 00:20:00,180
aftermath after the attack Ondine in

305
00:19:52,100 --> 00:20:04,469
2016 the graph that I shown is the the

306
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:09,870
number of NS records which are exclusive

307
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:12,930
with dine or if if the the NS set also

308
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:16,620
includes and as we saw records that are

309
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:20,700
not dying so it's only a small

310
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:23,729
percentage perhaps only 2% of the dying

311
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:26,730
customers though those were all the big

312
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:30,330
internet brands that suffers from that

313
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:33,720
attack so we can see that the attack had

314
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:40,669
this effect on the topology of the

315
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:44,300
internet open interest now also

316
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:47,400
collaborating with Qaeda and the

317
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:53,000
University of California San Diego on

318
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:57,890
the Met Fiber project we're looking into

319
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:01,500
internet topology and configuration like

320
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:04,170
parent-child delegation mismatches TTL

321
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:06,420
mismatches how much shared

322
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:11,250
infrastructure that is and how many

323
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:16,290
topological bottlenecks so for example

324
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:17,970
this is the TTL on the assets which are

325
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:23,760
used by

326
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:29,040
delegations of names in comm so you can

327
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:33,390
see that 90% of the TTS order ttaen calm

328
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:38,550
is set to two days but already 90% of

329
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:44,250
the delegations prefers they are an

330
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:48,300
asset to be one day almost 65% prefers

331
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:50,360
that TTL of they're an asset to be less

332
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:55,830
than six hours actually

333
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:59,520
so there's and I wanted because then I

334
00:21:55,830 --> 00:22:05,669
can switch over to different operators

335
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:09,200
more quickly also respond to Dina's

336
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:09,200
hijacks more quickly

337
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:18,480
topological diversity is important by

338
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:21,840
looking at en assets we see that in

339
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:26,280
dot-com three quarters of all

340
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:31,439
delegations are within the same a s in

341
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:35,730
Donnell this is almost half we also look

342
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:39,000
into ipv4 prefixes so and that come more

343
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:44,040
than half of all the name surface in an

344
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:47,820
NS set is within the same announced ipv4

345
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:52,740
prefix so the assumption then or the the

346
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:56,669
the suspect that there's name surfaced

347
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:59,190
at least more than or to name surface

348
00:22:56,670 --> 00:23:04,110
could be in the same date iraq in the

349
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:07,290
same data center and will be now

350
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:10,169
starting a student probe project with

351
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:12,990
ripe Atlas to to see with triangular

352
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:19,500
measurements to see if that's indeed the

353
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:23,040
case so example 3 but people put in text

354
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:27,090
records now we see all sorts of

355
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:29,520
interesting HTML standards JavaScript

356
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:31,119
Windows PowerShell code and other

357
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:36,158
scripting language

358
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:38,649
which appear to be part of operations

359
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:42,989
which might not be you know have the

360
00:23:38,649 --> 00:23:47,079
best intent for the internet at heart so

361
00:23:42,989 --> 00:23:50,820
malicious scripts appearing there which

362
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:56,399
are interesting to study we also see

363
00:23:50,820 --> 00:24:00,908
x.509 certificates and quite funny

364
00:23:56,399 --> 00:24:05,309
pieces of DNS zone files and text text

365
00:24:00,909 --> 00:24:10,149
records but the most interesting thing

366
00:24:05,309 --> 00:24:13,329
we found and let me say this burner

367
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:15,609
machine never attributed malice that

368
00:24:13,329 --> 00:24:30,190
which can adequately be explained by

369
00:24:15,609 --> 00:24:33,539
stupidity as I private key quite a few

370
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:37,269
of these this one was particularly

371
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:41,109
interesting because we also found the

372
00:24:37,269 --> 00:24:47,829
the matching DCAM records including the

373
00:24:41,109 --> 00:24:52,749
public key of data so future of the

374
00:24:47,829 --> 00:24:56,319
projects we are talking with the Dutch

375
00:24:52,749 --> 00:25:00,219
science count Council to establish that

376
00:24:56,319 --> 00:25:03,129
we can do this or collect these data for

377
00:25:00,219 --> 00:25:09,429
the upcoming years that we in 25 cans

378
00:25:03,129 --> 00:25:12,428
can still do long term reflections on

379
00:25:09,429 --> 00:25:17,049
how things changed on the internet

380
00:25:12,429 --> 00:25:20,829
looking at DNA zone data at secondary

381
00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:26,219
level and yeah have a real world impact

382
00:25:20,829 --> 00:25:29,319
by doing research based on this data

383
00:25:26,219 --> 00:25:33,629
looking into resilience and security of

384
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:33,629
the DNS so

385
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:37,300
Christian's

386
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:57,639
Alex may offer from dignity

387
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:59,800
I can only say thank you to you guys for

388
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:02,920
doing that we are one of those who

389
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:05,500
appreciate getting daily fresh data

390
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:09,820
about essentially the whole DNS of our

391
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:13,059
zone and we use it for quite a couple of

392
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:15,399
interesting insights and also

393
00:26:13,059 --> 00:26:18,879
operational findings so it's it's it's

394
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:22,750
really an amazing data set so my only

395
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:24,550
question is is that going to be

396
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:26,500
something that you guys are going to

397
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:30,790
provide for the next foreseeable future

398
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:33,130
and it's funded or yes yes sure quite

399
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:36,730
big infrastructure yeah indeed also

400
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:39,280
maybe I have to tell you yes indeed we

401
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:42,250
were getting sponsorship to make sure

402
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:44,860
that this data will remain and that we

403
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:48,580
can keep collecting incremental amounts

404
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:52,120
of data and put it in Hadoop cluster etc

405
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:55,510
and but also I want to you are a good

406
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:59,050
example because you are one of the top

407
00:26:55,510 --> 00:27:02,050
level domains which is measured with

408
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:05,950
upper Intel and so it's of benefit to

409
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:08,770
you you say so if if there are any other

410
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:11,380
top-level domains here in room and they

411
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:14,500
they want to benefit from this data as

412
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:18,370
well and you can contact me and you know

413
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:21,610
we can set up some agreement that for us

414
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:24,040
to use you're shown first to get

415
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:26,409
additional data for the open

416
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:28,750
intelligence yeah maybe one use case

417
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:31,480
that I'll share we do actually crawl the

418
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:33,640
starting page of each of every Delta et

419
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:35,710
domain that seems to have an al quad-a

420
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:39,070
or crochet or a top top top record and

421
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:41,380
so what we use open Intel for is when we

422
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:43,600
see that the a record for a page where

423
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:46,090
website has changed and we schedule a

424
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:52,230
recrawl for the next day so that's

425
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:52,230
really useful okay

426
00:27:53,210 --> 00:28:02,429
yeah I guess this is thank you thank you

427
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:04,279
villain

428
00:28:02,429 --> 00:28:09,149
that was a very interesting presentation

429
00:28:04,279 --> 00:28:12,690
next up we have ray ballast and Oliver

430
00:28:09,149 --> 00:28:16,820
Guzman s'en presenting about what DNS

431
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:16,820
key floods tell us about resolvers

432
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,080
second

433
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:46,460
okay perils of growing old all right

434
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:49,129
it's working

435
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:51,230
so I'm ready Ellis ray I see to my right

436
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:54,860
sir we all know Oliver got Benson from

437
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:55,730
cloud fillet so we're gonna be talking

438
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:57,320
about this some other thing that

439
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:59,360
happened last year that apparently was a

440
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:03,139
key role in the DNS or something like

441
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:04,389
that as many of you know there were some

442
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:06,770
concerns about what's going to happen

443
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:10,399
with the Internet Ashley cope with the

444
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:14,000
key rolling would yeah with the Internet

445
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:16,129
break what people fail to get answers

446
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:20,809
because the keys the packet size of them

447
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:23,210
increasing from the buying side of

448
00:29:20,809 --> 00:29:25,010
things we have some concerns schools

449
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:28,520
would all 50:11 implementation work

450
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:30,529
correctly thanks very much to the icon

451
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:36,860
folks for their testbed which we did

452
00:29:30,529 --> 00:29:39,200
make use of that worked very well we

453
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:41,658
also had concerns from a dicey about

454
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,460
whether other people's versions of bind

455
00:29:41,659 --> 00:29:49,450
might work correctly or not

456
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:53,440
and we're looking at sorry see is the

457
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:53,440
like asleep getting to me

458
00:29:55,090 --> 00:30:00,249
and sorry the complete rust anchor

459
00:29:58,629 --> 00:30:02,860
signaling whales could her concerns

460
00:30:00,249 --> 00:30:06,789
about hacker actually turn out to be our

461
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:11,229
own Daktronics platform and i see is not

462
00:30:06,789 --> 00:30:12,970
that great and with cloud player running

463
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:16,320
somewhere it knows on over half will

464
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:16,320
talk to them to look at the data for us

465
00:30:17,129 --> 00:30:23,498
so the data source we looked at

466
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:25,330
aggregate data with nasa's permission

467
00:30:23,499 --> 00:30:28,029
because CloudFlare also serve ear oohed

468
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:30,129
sites there's going to be some data here

469
00:30:28,029 --> 00:30:32,529
from nasa as well as the our sac

470
00:30:30,129 --> 00:30:34,748
double-a to data that most of the RSO is

471
00:30:32,529 --> 00:30:36,009
produced that shows the total traffic

472
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:37,570
across the internet so I'll sort of

473
00:30:36,009 --> 00:30:39,730
total US traffic for the root system

474
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:42,309
which interestingly if you look at this

475
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:44,049
graph has grown substantially over the

476
00:30:42,309 --> 00:30:46,840
last 18 months or so

477
00:30:44,049 --> 00:30:48,249
yet we've seen something the order of 1

478
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:51,959
million queries per second across the

479
00:30:48,249 --> 00:30:54,549
entire root system a 50-cent growth

480
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:58,570
since January last year to April this

481
00:30:54,549 --> 00:31:00,970
year and we've also also looks at the

482
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:04,119
data that I can produced from the octo

483
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:05,830
team on the data they received the

484
00:31:04,119 --> 00:31:12,129
summary data from the RFC eight one four

485
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:14,799
five signaling data so I can later it

486
00:31:12,129 --> 00:31:16,059
was a daily summary report there were

487
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:19,330
two different formats of this data

488
00:31:16,059 --> 00:31:23,379
produce over time the first one included

489
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:26,799
quite a lot of information including or

490
00:31:23,379 --> 00:31:28,449
basically all key IDs individual IP

491
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:31,360
addresses the council the number right

492
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:33,100
at times each IP address was seen they

493
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,689
later reduce that to only include the s

494
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:36,519
and the IP address and this essentially

495
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:39,039
only one record per day per IP address

496
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:41,440
it didn't include the counts of how many

497
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:43,149
like those IP addresses sorry how the

498
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:47,830
counts of how many times each IP address

499
00:31:43,149 --> 00:31:52,449
have been seen within each day and night

500
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:55,990
all the first two over yeah so this is

501
00:31:52,450 --> 00:32:02,159
an example of the first format I pulled

502
00:31:55,990 --> 00:32:02,159
out one semi random address

503
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:08,179
exact address is not important but

504
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:13,549
through the basically first three

505
00:32:08,179 --> 00:32:15,619
weeks of June last year it kept flipping

506
00:32:13,549 --> 00:32:19,970
between true and false as it is

507
00:32:15,619 --> 00:32:22,580
reporting the new one or not and but it

508
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:26,419
is showing up or solidly basically

509
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:28,580
showing up every day the TA report that

510
00:32:26,419 --> 00:32:30,499
I can God was not compressed and so if

511
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:32,149
they did not get all of the instances of

512
00:32:30,499 --> 00:32:34,129
all route service reporting it so maybe

513
00:32:32,149 --> 00:32:37,689
queries went somewhere else so why is it

514
00:32:34,129 --> 00:32:40,009
going up and down true and false well

515
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:40,519
let's look at this guy a little bit more

516
00:32:40,009 --> 00:32:43,129
in detail

517
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:48,950
it's a typical resolver for a broadband

518
00:32:43,129 --> 00:32:52,820
provider okay the best explanation I

519
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:56,869
have for this going up and down is it is

520
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:59,178
actually receiving TA from somebody

521
00:32:56,869 --> 00:33:03,110
behind it so it is acting like a

522
00:32:59,179 --> 00:33:05,330
forwarder okay so the signal that is

523
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:09,590
being seen has lots of noise in it in

524
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:12,070
this regard so it's hard to draw our

525
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:15,399
conclusion what machine is actually

526
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:17,840
originating signal of being bad this is

527
00:33:15,399 --> 00:33:22,610
exactly what I can discover when they

528
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:26,178
try to auction this data with it face to

529
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:29,629
data the thing that is interesting in

530
00:33:26,179 --> 00:33:34,629
that one is to look at the number of

531
00:33:29,629 --> 00:33:38,449
addresses that are reporting the old

532
00:33:34,629 --> 00:33:41,899
okay and fortunately we see that it is

533
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:45,200
going down with one exception more about

534
00:33:41,899 --> 00:33:47,869
that later so we can summarize the

535
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:51,019
signal is not actionable on day to day

536
00:33:47,869 --> 00:33:53,480
basis it is possibly accident report

537
00:33:51,019 --> 00:33:55,730
when we see shifts in it as we were

538
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:58,100
gonna see a little bit later there is

539
00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:59,960
also a bias in this anybody who is

540
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:02,899
running a local route in accordance with

541
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:06,769
RFC 7706

542
00:34:02,899 --> 00:34:10,069
is not showing up in our I checked a few

543
00:34:06,769 --> 00:34:12,230
Network a s numbers that are where I

544
00:34:10,069 --> 00:34:14,719
know people are doing that and none of

545
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:17,710
them showed up not even a single time in

546
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:20,418
the data sets that I that we looked at

547
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:21,420
and also there is not every route server

548
00:34:20,418 --> 00:34:25,080
in there

549
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:28,080
instance there is also lots of ipv6

550
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:32,429
addresses in there we know that lots of

551
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:34,679
my DNS query engines they talk both v4

552
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:38,730
and v6 there is no way to correlate

553
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:41,279
between the till so somebody may showing

554
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:43,050
not too often but it does because half

555
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:47,130
the time it's showing up as a v4 and

556
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:48,840
sometimes it's showing up as a v6 a very

557
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:50,670
interesting thing was when I started

558
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:55,700
counting how many different unique

559
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:58,860
addresses came out of different a SS and

560
00:34:55,699 --> 00:35:02,990
if you look at those areas is that the

561
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:05,760
largest number of reported addresses

562
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:08,930
basically they can be classified into

563
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:12,570
wall broadband networks as we expected a

564
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:14,310
possibly people running or validating

565
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:15,320
resolver on a machine at home or

566
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:17,610
something like that

567
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:19,410
cellular network was a little bit of a

568
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:23,430
surprise but then you look at that

569
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:26,190
little bit more detail and third or non

570
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:28,259
Europe non-us cellular providers were

571
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:30,540
much more representative in there that

572
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:33,240
means either they have both landline and

573
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:38,220
cellular or cellular is the only way to

574
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:41,520
get internet access so and there is also

575
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:44,370
obviously lots of carrier great not

576
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:46,800
going on in there so addresses are

577
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:49,859
changing all the time it's not uncommon

578
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:52,890
to see an address basically we're seeing

579
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:56,190
four or five addresses a day from a

580
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:59,490
carrier and then they they're always

581
00:35:56,190 --> 00:36:03,200
different so they are being translated

582
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:05,819
and the other thing was a big cloud

583
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:08,609
computers like digitalocean and others

584
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:11,810
they have a large number of these and

585
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:15,330
they also do not have address stability

586
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:16,980
the addresses changed over time that

587
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:18,960
means that some of the assumptions we

588
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:20,910
have made about resolvers in the past is

589
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:23,280
that they have always had the same

590
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:27,930
addresses no addresses or many of these

591
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:30,240
devices changed over time and either

592
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:32,759
because they move or because they are

593
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,600
being spun up spun down they move from

594
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:35,130
here to there

595
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:37,950
whatever reason so

596
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:41,240
resolvers that are being seen are not

597
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:47,850
necessarily coming from fixed addresses

598
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:51,000
okay right so looking at the actual

599
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:52,290
traffic that we saw hopefully it's not

600
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,840
too much to surprise to many of the

601
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:56,700
people here that DNS key traffic had

602
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:59,520
some interesting artifacts but going

603
00:36:56,700 --> 00:37:03,270
from v4 that later so this graph shows

604
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:06,259
the change in the DNS key traffic at the

605
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:10,530
point of which cascade 2017 was added in

606
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:13,200
July of 2017 and effectively

607
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:15,150
there was no change system kept on

608
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:17,279
running as usual there are too much

609
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:19,050
about the line at the bottom they saw

610
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:21,780
the light bottoms the ear oohed and

611
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:23,220
ahhed lines F root and this the change

612
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:24,300
there is not because the keeping itit

613
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:29,459
was just an internal change within

614
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:31,890
profilers Network so then when

615
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:36,170
eventually the key did rule in October

616
00:37:31,890 --> 00:37:38,730
last year there was a slightly and

617
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:41,340
surprising increase in the DNS key

618
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:45,930
traffic the order of four or five times

619
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:48,750
increase the actual volumes are fairly

620
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:49,950
negligible still to be honest I was read

621
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:52,500
that here sort of five or six hundred

622
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:57,480
queries per second across the whole of

623
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:59,280
the enf systems between them unexpected

624
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:02,450
but actually not concerning

625
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,450
operationally in any way

626
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:11,339
the TA signal yeah that did that to

627
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:12,960
change a little bit it was actually a

628
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:15,840
spike in the number systems that only

629
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:19,050
reported the twenty ten key which our

630
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:21,570
own analysis would suggest that some

631
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:24,870
resolvers did not like that key role and

632
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:26,280
were essentially trying to keep on

633
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:31,500
fetching the keys when they when they

634
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:33,270
shouldn't have been to so yeah that meet

635
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:36,360
them in fact yeah well we said on this

636
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:39,270
first I'd of three times increase and it

637
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:40,830
stayed quite steady for quite some time

638
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:42,980
after that key roles so yeah there was a

639
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:46,080
rise over a period of two or three days

640
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:47,330
so it wasn't an immediate jump it did

641
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:49,580
take a little time to come

642
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:52,310
through and having jumped it pretty much

643
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:53,540
stayed there again the spike on that

644
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:55,190
graph from the right is it just a

645
00:38:53,540 --> 00:39:00,290
measuring artifact that's that's not

646
00:38:55,190 --> 00:39:01,760
real but then the real fun started when

647
00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:04,160
the key was revoked in January and

648
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:07,970
suddenly it went up another further five

649
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:13,670
times again this took a little while it

650
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:16,730
took a day or so but yeah it was odd

651
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:19,760
nobody was expecting this at all there's

652
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:21,470
no real explanation for its number of

653
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,790
people research groups and other RSOs

654
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:26,029
did look at this and I'm sure we'll hear

655
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:27,560
about later fortunately I mean the

656
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:29,120
volumes of pack is concerned are still

657
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:31,460
not in any way operationally concerning

658
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:36,490
I mean 4000 cores per second over across

659
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:36,490
the whole of the enf root not a problem

660
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:46,250
the sorry yeah so we were looking to

661
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:48,410
this graph that are showing us what is

662
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:51,260
the change in the TA signal

663
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:53,180
when this happens we see that suddenly

664
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:55,610
the ones that are advertising that they

665
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:58,970
trust only the new key because the old

666
00:39:55,610 --> 00:40:01,580
key was revoked that happened but this

667
00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:03,230
is happening way much very faster than

668
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:06,350
we expected we expected like when the

669
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:09,230
key when we win the switch keys and we

670
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:14,770
saw the new key go up slowly this one is

671
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:19,100
basically down almost instantaneous why

672
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:21,680
well it turns out that not everybody who

673
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:25,279
sends a TA signal is equal this is an

674
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:28,399
the biggest reporters in one hour at

675
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:32,780
some point in time somebody is sending

676
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:37,340
basically to a second others are sending

677
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:39,560
of the order of one or less so the

678
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:43,280
signal that I was in the prior graph is

679
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:45,710
biased by the ones that send a lot and

680
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:48,110
the ones that are having either problem

681
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:50,660
or we're very good are sending it the

682
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:52,640
reason why they sent this TA signal is

683
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:55,819
not clear we know that one

684
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:58,580
implementation sends it periodically

685
00:40:55,820 --> 00:41:00,950
another one says they do it whenever

686
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:05,210
they see a DNS key query

687
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:10,819
and there is one that looks like it sent

688
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:13,450
it on every query and maybe amplified

689
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:21,020
for every query when it is having

690
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:23,270
problems so yes so but then let's look

691
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:27,170
at what was the change over a few days

692
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:29,930
so the day before these are two one-hour

693
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:32,840
windows a few days apart before the

694
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:35,509
revocation and after their vocation the

695
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:37,940
blue arrows show the good movements ie

696
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:41,810
the one that understood Paul or accepted

697
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:43,430
both they went down the one why there

698
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:48,490
was somebody who only trusted the new

699
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:51,230
key before I don't know but it goes up

700
00:41:48,490 --> 00:41:53,029
the ones that only trust the old one

701
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:56,210
they went down I guess that should be a

702
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:58,520
good one too there are some really

703
00:41:56,210 --> 00:42:00,620
strange ta strings that also show up in

704
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:04,070
the sample and we have no explanation of

705
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:05,960
it I did not go down all the list but

706
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:09,170
there was somebody who who kept sending

707
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:16,880
religiously that they trust the DL v dot

708
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:20,390
ISE and yeah so basically lots of

709
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:23,090
resolvers or validators picked up the

710
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:24,160
new signal removed the old key as

711
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:27,880
expected

712
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:30,859
relatively fast so this basically means

713
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:33,410
resolvers that are configured to follow

714
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:36,050
5011 are doing the right thing

715
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:40,190
fifty eleven is not the only way to

716
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:43,070
configure validators with trust anchors

717
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:46,070
some operators prefer to do that via

718
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:48,830
configuration files and that is probably

719
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:52,730
what is explaining why the ones that are

720
00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:57,310
on line two in the second graph are we

721
00:42:52,730 --> 00:43:00,980
are still seeing 4000 some with the old

722
00:42:57,310 --> 00:43:03,350
with both keys I hope I would expect

723
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:05,870
over time that that will be updated

724
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:08,860
manually or via the system and that

725
00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:08,859
count is going to go down

726
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:19,410
so following that initial five-fold

727
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:23,700
increase things then start to get very

728
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:26,670
very strange the previous graph really

729
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:29,009
only showed that first quarter of this

730
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:31,700
graph here so out of initial four

731
00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:36,390
three-fold increase and then there was a

732
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:39,259
slow but quite steady increase the dates

733
00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:41,430
are through early February

734
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:43,950
yeah we're mid-february look at this

735
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:47,640
about fourteenth fifteenth and then

736
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:50,490
you'll see there's a somewhat steep rise

737
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:52,828
in the gradient until just before the

738
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:56,720
start of March and that suddenly will

739
00:43:52,829 --> 00:43:59,160
hell breaks loose and it goes way way up

740
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:00,990
fortunately this is still way way below

741
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:04,890
our capacities so that was again it's

742
00:44:00,990 --> 00:44:06,479
not operationally concerning but this

743
00:44:04,890 --> 00:44:09,390
was something of a mystery I mean why

744
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:13,349
should some six weeks after the roll

745
00:44:09,390 --> 00:44:15,359
we're still well outside the 5011 hold

746
00:44:13,349 --> 00:44:17,369
down timer for the replication of key

747
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:20,430
why would things suddenly jump up like

748
00:44:17,369 --> 00:44:21,960
this I'm afraid just so nice just a

749
00:44:20,430 --> 00:44:24,750
little bit of a mystery although we do

750
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:26,490
have some ideas and again I'm sure

751
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:30,780
they'll be more about this later during

752
00:44:26,490 --> 00:44:32,430
today's talks and this graph here

753
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:34,109
actually shows the entire as I think

754
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:37,560
it's nine month window roughly of the

755
00:44:34,109 --> 00:44:40,319
entire key role cycle so the the very

756
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:44,328
small uptick about of course the way

757
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:47,759
through is when the key was first rolled

758
00:44:44,329 --> 00:44:49,109
there's a fairly steady level I mean

759
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:52,980
there's a discernible increase in tin

760
00:44:49,109 --> 00:44:54,930
Sok traffic but it's flat and then you

761
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:57,720
can see these sort of four separate

762
00:44:54,930 --> 00:45:00,660
phases and then you see at the end when

763
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:03,990
the key was finally removed a very sharp

764
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:06,299
drop in the u.s. key traffic so suddenly

765
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:07,950
for some reason systems that were

766
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:10,829
entirely unhappy with the key being

767
00:45:07,950 --> 00:45:11,970
revoked just fixed themselves when the

768
00:45:10,829 --> 00:45:16,470
key was actually finally removed from

769
00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:18,328
the zone no plat 1 will include this one

770
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:19,348
in the deck just so people refer to if

771
00:45:18,329 --> 00:45:22,260
they want to it was just a bit more

772
00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:23,819
detail on this phase is but I drop I

773
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:24,750
mention when the key was removed was

774
00:45:23,819 --> 00:45:26,730
incredible

775
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:28,710
sharp it would actually took less than

776
00:45:26,730 --> 00:45:31,410
two seconds between when the key was

777
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:32,970
removed from the zone and the vast

778
00:45:31,410 --> 00:45:39,060
majority of that new DNS key traffic

779
00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:40,620
coming in the the systems that were

780
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:43,500
effectively responsible for that traffic

781
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:47,069
noticed that removal essentially

782
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:49,650
instantaneously the resulting levels are

783
00:45:47,070 --> 00:45:52,080
now back to where we were immediately

784
00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:53,400
post roll so there's still a little bit

785
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:58,290
higher than they were before the key was

786
00:45:53,400 --> 00:46:01,410
rolled at all but it's now a hundred or

787
00:45:58,290 --> 00:46:03,060
so queries per second so there are

788
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:07,799
clearly some systems that are still not

789
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:12,000
entirely happy the keys been rolled but

790
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:14,250
it's essentially business as usual well

791
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,710
detail on that drop again and this is a

792
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:20,190
that that graph on the left is only

793
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:24,510
about a twenty second window so that

794
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:26,550
traffic rock the you can see the titles

795
00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:28,290
on the graphs the left one is the DNS

796
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:30,630
queue traffic the right hand graph is

797
00:46:28,290 --> 00:46:34,550
the number of unique sources of the DNS

798
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:39,960
key traffic that were being seen the

799
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:42,660
yellow and green being NASA and I see

800
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:43,920
Ian efforts respectively and the blue

801
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:47,009
being the total so there were in fact

802
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:48,750
distinct populations there it is not the

803
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:52,800
exact same set of sources sending the

804
00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:55,320
traffic but the overall levels were

805
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:59,910
consistent between the two before and

806
00:46:55,320 --> 00:47:00,330
after the removal so current state of

807
00:46:59,910 --> 00:47:03,029
things

808
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:07,740
traffic is as it was immediately post

809
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:09,120
roll collection of the TA signaling is

810
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:13,379
still happening as well as I said

811
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:16,140
earlier the actual counts are not

812
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:18,030
especially relevant we think but what's

813
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:21,569
most interesting is the way that counts

814
00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:23,940
change over time there are still

815
00:47:21,570 --> 00:47:25,080
unfortunately a hundred source IP

816
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:30,540
addresses telling us that they still

817
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:31,770
only handle know about ksk 2010 the only

818
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:33,060
reason we can make of that is that they

819
00:47:31,770 --> 00:47:34,380
are presumably not validating because

820
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:35,290
otherwise they would have fixed them by

821
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:36,500
now

822
00:47:35,290 --> 00:47:39,680
[Music]

823
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:42,310
the vast majority systems the 75% are

824
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:44,390
now only reporting with the new key

825
00:47:42,310 --> 00:47:47,480
there is still a substantial number of

826
00:47:44,390 --> 00:47:48,529
machines still report on both keys but

827
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:49,850
the very least they're not getting

828
00:47:48,530 --> 00:47:55,280
validation failures because they do now

829
00:47:49,850 --> 00:47:56,390
have the new key yeah again there these

830
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:58,610
are systems that are probably not

831
00:47:56,390 --> 00:48:01,160
validating but they have at least

832
00:47:58,610 --> 00:48:05,060
managed to roll the key so if they are

833
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:09,710
violation it will be working okay so any

834
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:12,500
questions please thank you thank you so

835
00:48:09,710 --> 00:48:14,120
Warren Kumari Google partly a question

836
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:16,550
and guess also partly just a statement

837
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:22,900
can you back go back to the summary of

838
00:48:16,550 --> 00:48:28,370
TA stuff it was a favorite further back

839
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:31,670
no further back one more actually I can

840
00:48:28,370 --> 00:48:34,640
just start talking so something that I'm

841
00:48:31,670 --> 00:48:36,890
slightly annoyed about is for both of

842
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:39,920
these Wis hidaka had provided a bunch of

843
00:48:36,890 --> 00:48:43,940
research and the one of the big signals

844
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:48,140
for the 80 145 stuff was a VPN app on a

845
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:50,840
bunch of cell phones and that was a huge

846
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:53,120
contributor to the to the data and looks

847
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:55,850
as though that might still be or the

848
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:58,400
hasn't been updated yet app which is

849
00:48:55,850 --> 00:49:00,080
providing some of the signal of you know

850
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:03,170
looks like I'm validating but not ready

851
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:06,710
mm-hmm and then the other one for the

852
00:49:03,170 --> 00:49:08,780
DNS key thing on the KSK futures mailing

853
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:12,260
list Wes had sent out a bunch of detail

854
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:14,330
about configurations and bind where a

855
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:18,800
single query causes six or seven

856
00:49:14,330 --> 00:49:21,049
outgoing queries and the sort of tone of

857
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:22,190
the response that was largely yeah

858
00:49:21,050 --> 00:49:25,250
that's an old bug it doesn't really

859
00:49:22,190 --> 00:49:26,960
exist anymore that's not it there was

860
00:49:25,250 --> 00:49:29,390
some follow-up saying but look it still

861
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:32,570
happens and then it all sort of went

862
00:49:29,390 --> 00:49:36,080
radio silent so I'm slightly miffed at

863
00:49:32,570 --> 00:49:38,810
the not mentioning a bunch of research

864
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:41,810
which had shown some of the served no

865
00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:43,640
credit being given and then also the hey

866
00:49:41,810 --> 00:49:47,120
look I think we found it and no real

867
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:48,629
follow-up from that our focus was just

868
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:50,100
looking at traffic we are not

869
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:55,890
trying to do any attributions of what

870
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:57,930
this was so yes there is other work and

871
00:49:55,890 --> 00:50:02,460
there's a talk after this one that maybe

872
00:49:57,930 --> 00:50:04,830
going into that detail yes what I joined

873
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:08,070
was from Verisign um a couple of

874
00:50:04,830 --> 00:50:09,600
comments I guess I think this slide that

875
00:50:08,070 --> 00:50:13,700
Wes was or that Warren was trying to get

876
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:15,420
you to go to summary slide that said

877
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:17,009
this one yeah

878
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:19,590
so your first bullet point here says

879
00:50:17,010 --> 00:50:22,320
that the GS signal is mostly noise I

880
00:50:19,590 --> 00:50:23,490
think you've done a pretty bad job of

881
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:26,880
showing that it's mostly noise you

882
00:50:23,490 --> 00:50:28,379
showed one example of a mixed signal but

883
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:31,530
that doesn't mean that it's mostly noise

884
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:33,810
fact a lot of the signals are are pretty

885
00:50:31,530 --> 00:50:35,430
clear that it's it's not mixed rated

886
00:50:33,810 --> 00:50:36,960
they're consistent the ones that are

887
00:50:35,430 --> 00:50:39,810
mixed are in the very small percent of

888
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:45,090
sources that are that are noisy I think

889
00:50:39,810 --> 00:50:47,610
it's far from mostly noisy I guess I

890
00:50:45,090 --> 00:50:50,130
phrased is really badly what I meant is

891
00:50:47,610 --> 00:50:51,690
you cannot look at one day's data and

892
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:54,390
draw conclusions from it you can only

893
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:56,130
see the changes in the pattern and and

894
00:50:54,390 --> 00:50:58,830
I'll be the first to admit that this

895
00:50:56,130 --> 00:51:00,780
protocol has issues there there are it

896
00:50:58,830 --> 00:51:02,640
is difficult to interpret in some cases

897
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:03,870
but but there is also cases where it's

898
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:08,730
pretty clear turned toward what's going

899
00:51:03,870 --> 00:51:10,680
on and I'll talk about that more you had

900
00:51:08,730 --> 00:51:13,320
a slide later that they talked about how

901
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:16,310
some sources were sort of pounding you

902
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:19,800
with with trust Decker signals and I

903
00:51:16,310 --> 00:51:21,240
agree that does happen I think but in

904
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:22,830
this case you know it's not important to

905
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:24,390
count the number of signal queries that

906
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:26,819
you get it's important to count the

907
00:51:24,390 --> 00:51:31,830
number of sources interpret IP addresses

908
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:33,510
sending you signals so this is this is

909
00:51:31,830 --> 00:51:35,730
unfortunately what's happening but we

910
00:51:33,510 --> 00:51:38,250
have to deal with it but it explains why

911
00:51:35,730 --> 00:51:40,260
I had this happen in this graph that is

912
00:51:38,250 --> 00:51:41,310
counted yeah right but it's better in a

913
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:44,850
graph like this it's better to count

914
00:51:41,310 --> 00:51:49,200
sources not queries yes and last last

915
00:51:44,850 --> 00:51:51,120
point is in I think ray you said

916
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:52,169
something about there may be sources

917
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:54,270
that have the old key but they're not

918
00:51:52,170 --> 00:51:55,830
validating right and in fact there was a

919
00:51:54,270 --> 00:51:57,120
bug in a version of mind I think where

920
00:51:55,830 --> 00:51:59,190
it was reporting the trust I could

921
00:51:57,120 --> 00:52:00,049
signal even though it was not configured

922
00:51:59,190 --> 00:52:03,259
for validation

923
00:52:00,049 --> 00:52:05,179
so it was unbound oh I thought it was

924
00:52:03,259 --> 00:52:06,890
mine anyway so yeah that that did happen

925
00:52:05,179 --> 00:52:09,259
unfortunately that's you know an

926
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:10,848
implementation mistake in the 81 45

927
00:52:09,259 --> 00:52:12,019
portico need to refer that one back to

928
00:52:10,849 --> 00:52:14,150
Andre but I did have a recollection that

929
00:52:12,019 --> 00:52:16,368
there may have been a version of buying

930
00:52:14,150 --> 00:52:24,229
wild I know it was fixed but it did get

931
00:52:16,369 --> 00:52:26,569
out there and in its in the wild I think

932
00:52:24,229 --> 00:52:31,848
if you go to slides further then I have

933
00:52:26,569 --> 00:52:35,089
a quick this one yeah

934
00:52:31,849 --> 00:52:36,979
any idea why some of the sources are

935
00:52:35,089 --> 00:52:39,619
still currying and why some are not I

936
00:52:36,979 --> 00:52:42,739
mean there's all this was the traffic

937
00:52:39,619 --> 00:52:45,920
there seems to be a reduction in a huge

938
00:52:42,739 --> 00:52:52,910
reduction actually it's worse IP address

939
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:54,679
that actually don't speak too much on

940
00:52:52,910 --> 00:52:56,598
this one because of whether some stuff

941
00:52:54,679 --> 00:53:00,410
that's going to be following but there's

942
00:52:56,599 --> 00:53:03,410
clearly a software issue yes some of it

943
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:04,939
is going to be attributable to bind we

944
00:53:03,410 --> 00:53:08,538
do think it's probably related to

945
00:53:04,939 --> 00:53:11,660
misconfigurations predominantly where

946
00:53:08,539 --> 00:53:15,229
for example systems can't write to their

947
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:16,459
manage keys directory so even though

948
00:53:15,229 --> 00:53:17,839
they may have seen the new key they

949
00:53:16,459 --> 00:53:23,479
can't actually write that state out to

950
00:53:17,839 --> 00:53:26,119
the system once it's gone they don't try

951
00:53:23,479 --> 00:53:28,249
anymore yeah basically seems that way

952
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:31,939
just transyl Warren's point about the

953
00:53:28,249 --> 00:53:34,879
old software I mean we have attempted to

954
00:53:31,939 --> 00:53:36,439
replicate the issue had some success and

955
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:41,329
we also know that it's not possible to

956
00:53:36,439 --> 00:53:46,069
replicate it deterministically where's

957
00:53:41,329 --> 00:53:47,779
his reports did mention replicate

958
00:53:46,069 --> 00:53:49,759
something with 911 but we've been unable

959
00:53:47,779 --> 00:53:54,109
to produce that we did review some stuff

960
00:53:49,759 --> 00:53:56,599
with 9.10 but in any event Rossi

961
00:53:54,109 --> 00:53:58,549
it did only appear to be on generally

962
00:53:56,599 --> 00:54:02,150
older versions and only in the cases

963
00:53:58,549 --> 00:54:03,890
where there was some configuration issue

964
00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:07,009
preventing the key from rolling

965
00:54:03,890 --> 00:54:09,429
correctly so we haven't yet been

966
00:54:07,009 --> 00:54:12,529
identified any specific bug we have

967
00:54:09,429 --> 00:54:13,460
admittedly certainly a lot more queries

968
00:54:12,529 --> 00:54:14,599
of them we should do

969
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:16,130
is not a good thing in fact I mean

970
00:54:14,599 --> 00:54:18,859
although we didn't report it on these

971
00:54:16,130 --> 00:54:20,690
slides I mean the top IP address selling

972
00:54:18,859 --> 00:54:22,569
the DNS poppy queries was actually

973
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:24,680
responsible for 10% of the entire volume

974
00:54:22,570 --> 00:54:27,040
it was a hundred million queries a day

975
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:32,330
we were seeing from that one IP address

976
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:34,550
which is crazy but you know we can't pin

977
00:54:32,330 --> 00:54:36,710
down exactly why it did it because there

978
00:54:34,550 --> 00:54:39,980
we haven't had anything to fix and to

979
00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:42,380
some extent it may have even been a yeah

980
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:48,109
previous edge case version of roll over

981
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:51,760
and died when I saw that one machine

982
00:54:48,109 --> 00:54:54,380
that was sending that enormous amount of

983
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:56,630
my first thought was oh it is some

984
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:59,330
custom code by somebody that does not

985
00:54:56,630 --> 00:55:02,830
know about the revoke pit and decides

986
00:54:59,330 --> 00:55:05,029
this is bad data so let me get it again

987
00:55:02,830 --> 00:55:07,250
went through every version of mine

988
00:55:05,030 --> 00:55:10,400
couldn't find that every version of

989
00:55:07,250 --> 00:55:16,160
Unbound it didn't find it there so I

990
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:18,530
don't know um first where we can find

991
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:22,970
the slide that has all the arrows going

992
00:55:18,530 --> 00:55:24,410
different directions question yeah

993
00:55:22,970 --> 00:55:27,770
please identify yourself

994
00:55:24,410 --> 00:55:30,618
sorry Oh Brian Dixon GoDaddy yes I think

995
00:55:27,770 --> 00:55:32,509
in some of those cases what you have is

996
00:55:30,619 --> 00:55:33,890
a single arrow is really two different

997
00:55:32,510 --> 00:55:38,839
things going in two different directions

998
00:55:33,890 --> 00:55:42,310
so the top left the 28 690 I think it's

999
00:55:38,839 --> 00:55:45,140
actually bifurcating to two different

1000
00:55:42,310 --> 00:55:47,240
destinations where one of them is the

1001
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:50,270
top one and the other one is the second

1002
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:53,118
one ie it's indicating that there's a

1003
00:55:50,270 --> 00:55:55,700
bunch of systems that have switched but

1004
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:59,089
the Qualis or the quantities have not

1005
00:55:55,700 --> 00:56:00,710
changed and similarly I think there's

1006
00:55:59,089 --> 00:56:02,599
one or two other places where it's one

1007
00:56:00,710 --> 00:56:04,730
arrow but there might actually be some

1008
00:56:02,599 --> 00:56:07,130
convergence and divergence anyway we can

1009
00:56:04,730 --> 00:56:11,030
follow up on that the other thing I'm

1010
00:56:07,130 --> 00:56:13,040
wondering about is when the TA stuff was

1011
00:56:11,030 --> 00:56:16,690
originally being designed or discussed I

1012
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:20,410
think there's some signal that could be

1013
00:56:16,690 --> 00:56:23,510
extract that are added by adding a

1014
00:56:20,410 --> 00:56:26,770
prefix to or not a prefix but a child'

1015
00:56:23,510 --> 00:56:30,550
record that's for instance like

1016
00:56:26,770 --> 00:56:33,880
the hash of the IP address that would

1017
00:56:30,550 --> 00:56:36,910
allow you to distinguish sources that

1018
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:38,290
have the IP address that you're seeing

1019
00:56:36,910 --> 00:56:42,009
being the thing that's actually

1020
00:56:38,290 --> 00:56:42,940
generating the TA versus forwarding and

1021
00:56:42,010 --> 00:56:45,760
the other thing that might be

1022
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:49,690
interesting to also consider putting as

1023
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:54,070
a child underneath the the underscore ta

1024
00:56:49,690 --> 00:56:56,080
of whatever value is some ID about what

1025
00:56:54,070 --> 00:56:57,670
software is running I mean just

1026
00:56:56,080 --> 00:57:00,819
suggestions but I think that would allow

1027
00:56:57,670 --> 00:57:02,500
you to get signal and systems that don't

1028
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:03,910
upgrade you'd be able to derive that

1029
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:13,720
from the fact that they don't do the new

1030
00:57:03,910 --> 00:57:15,700
thing Jo Apple API are some time ago

1031
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:18,790
before I was at PIR I can't actually

1032
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:21,040
paid me to call people and ask why they

1033
00:57:18,790 --> 00:57:22,840
were sending these queries and it turns

1034
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:24,970
out you actually can't pay people enough

1035
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:27,670
to do that because it's a horrible job

1036
00:57:24,970 --> 00:57:28,959
and don't ever do it and it's also

1037
00:57:27,670 --> 00:57:31,120
incredibly difficult to track down

1038
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:34,030
people these days it was easier in the

1039
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:35,680
eighties and but one of the things that

1040
00:57:34,030 --> 00:57:40,120
did stand out is that there are a large

1041
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:44,770
number of big sources of 80 145 traffic

1042
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:48,850
that were non validating resolvers at

1043
00:57:44,770 --> 00:57:50,920
big carriers that didn't support 80 145

1044
00:57:48,850 --> 00:57:53,350
in any way and they were just forwarding

1045
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:54,880
queries from downstream mm-hmm so I

1046
00:57:53,350 --> 00:57:56,850
think there's a couple of graphs here

1047
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:58,930
what you talked about number of sources

1048
00:57:56,850 --> 00:58:00,190
you're not really talking about numbers

1049
00:57:58,930 --> 00:58:02,649
of sources of the queries really you're

1050
00:58:00,190 --> 00:58:05,890
talking about number of senders of

1051
00:58:02,650 --> 00:58:07,180
queries as seen by ENF you're not

1052
00:58:05,890 --> 00:58:11,650
talking about the ultimate sources of

1053
00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:13,000
them so I think sometimes you have to be

1054
00:58:11,650 --> 00:58:15,160
a little careful to attribute behavior

1055
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,510
to an address yeah when it might be

1056
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:18,759
sitting in front of a hundred thousand

1057
00:58:16,510 --> 00:58:21,160
devices all doing different things yeah

1058
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:24,550
I was really surprised for example of

1059
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:28,120
all I saw a lot of comcast addresses in

1060
00:58:24,550 --> 00:58:33,160
there and yeah basically yeah some

1061
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:35,470
customer sending it to theirs yeah so

1062
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:36,609
yeah I think one takeaway that I talked

1063
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:39,009
about the system ICANN meeting back I

1064
00:58:36,610 --> 00:58:40,480
remember when but is if you have a if

1065
00:58:39,010 --> 00:58:42,670
anybody ever decides to try

1066
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:44,560
right not a protocol specification like

1067
00:58:42,670 --> 00:58:46,990
this they have to remember in those

1068
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:48,340
cases those big resolver clusters have

1069
00:58:46,990 --> 00:58:49,959
no ability whatsoever

1070
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:51,130
to look back in time and say why did

1071
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:53,470
that query come through and whether they

1072
00:58:51,130 --> 00:58:56,500
come from there is no such data for them

1073
00:58:53,470 --> 00:58:58,089
to do them so it's not a good mechanism

1074
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:59,380
when you're trying to identify behavior

1075
00:58:58,090 --> 00:59:03,400
of any sources that are multiple Hopf

1076
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:05,920
spine I agree 100% and the other

1077
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:07,810
question should be asked is is there any

1078
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:12,340
what should we have this signal in the

1079
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:14,410
first place that's not old enough so

1080
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:15,820
Warren Kumari just quickly following up

1081
00:59:14,410 --> 00:59:16,569
from your comment I'm not being able to

1082
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:19,540
recreate it

1083
00:59:16,570 --> 00:59:21,040
I believe that westdoor has his test

1084
00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:25,210
infrastructure set up and it was

1085
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:28,090
something like bind 11 9 11 for nine

1086
00:59:25,210 --> 00:59:29,350
eleven five or something from Fedora if

1087
00:59:28,090 --> 00:59:30,790
you reach out to him I'm sure he'll be

1088
00:59:29,350 --> 00:59:33,580
happy to give you configs and let you

1089
00:59:30,790 --> 00:59:36,850
test it some more yeah Evans has been

1090
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:39,640
working with Wes to try to do so but

1091
00:59:36,850 --> 00:59:44,529
it's not deterministic it doesn't always

1092
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:50,410
yeah you cannot reliably recreate the

1093
00:59:44,530 --> 00:59:52,180
conditions thank you Ray thank you a lot

1094
00:59:50,410 --> 01:00:05,649
for for this very interesting

1095
00:59:52,180 --> 01:00:09,190
presentation our next presenter is Duane

1096
01:00:05,650 --> 01:00:13,810
vessels from Verisign at the speech

1097
01:00:09,190 --> 01:00:17,560
speakers request this session is not

1098
01:00:13,810 --> 01:00:19,299
going to be live streamed so immediately

1099
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:22,180
after this the live stream is going to

1100
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:23,619
be paused this session is going to be

1101
01:00:22,180 --> 01:00:26,580
recorded and will be made available

1102
01:00:23,619 --> 01:00:26,580
later

1103
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:44,730
exciting okay yeah thanks thanks a lot

1104
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:46,260
so I'm Duane this is another

1105
01:00:44,730 --> 01:00:48,600
presentation very similar to what we

1106
01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:50,400
just saw it's about what was things

1107
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:53,940
we've observed relating to the KSK roll

1108
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:56,310
over so the reason that we requested

1109
01:00:53,940 --> 01:00:57,660
this not be live-streamed and you may

1110
01:00:56,310 --> 01:01:00,750
notice that the slides are not available

1111
01:00:57,660 --> 01:01:02,399
from the workshop web page is because

1112
01:01:00,750 --> 01:01:04,230
this work is also currently being

1113
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:08,460
submitted to a peer review conference

1114
01:01:04,230 --> 01:01:10,860
and after we had submitted this talk and

1115
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:12,060
after it had been accepted for O Ark we

1116
01:01:10,860 --> 01:01:14,280
learned from the conference that they

1117
01:01:12,060 --> 01:01:15,960
wanted to use double-blind review

1118
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:18,210
process which means it had to be

1119
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:23,250
anonymous so out of the interest of

1120
01:01:18,210 --> 01:01:25,050
caution we wanted to sort of not not

1121
01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:27,180
violate the terms of that conference and

1122
01:01:25,050 --> 01:01:30,750
and therefore requesting that this not

1123
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:32,600
be lifecasts the slides and the

1124
01:01:30,750 --> 01:01:36,210
recording will be available after the

1125
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:38,270
end of the conference exception period

1126
01:01:36,210 --> 01:01:40,200
so I appreciate the program committees

1127
01:01:38,270 --> 01:01:45,060
flexibility here and accommodating us

1128
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:47,490
and apologize for the situation so so

1129
01:01:45,060 --> 01:01:49,920
this like I said this is a joint work

1130
01:01:47,490 --> 01:01:52,890
this is based on a paper that we're

1131
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:54,840
submitting one of my one of the other

1132
01:01:52,890 --> 01:01:57,779
members of the the work is here in the

1133
01:01:54,840 --> 01:02:00,480
room Willem tore up some others involved

1134
01:01:57,780 --> 01:02:01,670
in this are moritz mueller roland van

1135
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:05,730
rice wick

1136
01:02:01,670 --> 01:02:10,830
Taeyang John Chung Wes Hart occur and

1137
01:02:05,730 --> 01:02:12,240
Matthew Thomas are all part of this so

1138
01:02:10,830 --> 01:02:14,509
yeah this is about the roll over here's

1139
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:17,839
the schedule of events that happened

1140
01:02:14,510 --> 01:02:19,800
mostly interested in last three events

1141
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:23,790
but I have a little bit to say about

1142
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:26,820
some of the preceding stuff so let's

1143
01:02:23,790 --> 01:02:30,750
talk more about RC 80 145 the protocol

1144
01:02:26,820 --> 01:02:32,940
everybody loves to hate this this

1145
01:02:30,750 --> 01:02:35,970
protocol first appeared as an internet

1146
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:39,390
draft in late 2015 was first implemented

1147
01:02:35,970 --> 01:02:41,129
in mid-2016 and sort of the first

1148
01:02:39,390 --> 01:02:42,299
recorded signals that at least I have

1149
01:02:41,130 --> 01:02:46,680
access to are

1150
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:48,900
January 2017 it became an RFC later that

1151
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:51,509
year so at this point we have more than

1152
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:53,670
two years of 80 145 data that we can

1153
01:02:51,510 --> 01:02:57,270
analyze the data that I'll show you is

1154
01:02:53,670 --> 01:02:58,710
from Vera signs root servers and if we

1155
01:02:57,270 --> 01:03:00,810
look at that we can see a couple things

1156
01:02:58,710 --> 01:03:02,700
we can see what are the percentage of

1157
01:03:00,810 --> 01:03:04,500
signal sources that indicate they have

1158
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:07,740
the old key and what what percent

1159
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:10,560
indicate they have the new key so here's

1160
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:14,250
that whole whole timespan of data you

1161
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:16,470
can see that so on the x-axis it's it's

1162
01:03:14,250 --> 01:03:19,890
the two plus your timespan on the y-axis

1163
01:03:16,470 --> 01:03:21,810
its fraction or percent of sources

1164
01:03:19,890 --> 01:03:24,569
source IP addresses sending the signals

1165
01:03:21,810 --> 01:03:26,610
and at the start essentially all of them

1166
01:03:24,570 --> 01:03:28,590
say they have the old key which is shown

1167
01:03:26,610 --> 01:03:31,560
in purple and none of them have the new

1168
01:03:28,590 --> 01:03:34,710
key shown in green so one of the first

1169
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:37,740
interesting things that happens is in in

1170
01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:39,960
sort of mid or early 2017 even before

1171
01:03:37,740 --> 01:03:41,430
the key appears in the root zone we

1172
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:43,470
start to see some evidence that the new

1173
01:03:41,430 --> 01:03:45,480
key is appearing as trust anchors this

1174
01:03:43,470 --> 01:03:47,220
is most likely due to software updates

1175
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:49,410
as people update their name server

1176
01:03:47,220 --> 01:03:51,089
software the key comes in may also be

1177
01:03:49,410 --> 01:03:52,980
that people are manually adding the key

1178
01:03:51,090 --> 01:03:57,570
I figured that's a little bit less

1179
01:03:52,980 --> 01:03:59,430
likely so after the key is published and

1180
01:03:57,570 --> 01:04:01,500
then the the hold-down timer ends you

1181
01:03:59,430 --> 01:04:05,669
see the the green line sort of jumps up

1182
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:09,750
quite a bit over over a 24 hours 48 hour

1183
01:04:05,670 --> 01:04:11,160
period that that line jumped up but you

1184
01:04:09,750 --> 01:04:12,510
know it didn't quite go all the way to

1185
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:15,230
the top that's what we were hoping for

1186
01:04:12,510 --> 01:04:18,690
there's this gap at the top of about 8%

1187
01:04:15,230 --> 01:04:20,540
so 8% of the sources still say they have

1188
01:04:18,690 --> 01:04:23,130
the old key and as we've discussed

1189
01:04:20,540 --> 01:04:24,150
there's this is this is the part that's

1190
01:04:23,130 --> 01:04:26,490
a little bit hard to interpret you know

1191
01:04:24,150 --> 01:04:28,200
we don't know if this is because they

1192
01:04:26,490 --> 01:04:31,200
they have a trust anchor but they're not

1193
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:33,990
actually validating or maybe there's

1194
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:36,149
mixed signals or whatnot but at this

1195
01:04:33,990 --> 01:04:39,180
point the decision was made by ICANN to

1196
01:04:36,150 --> 01:04:41,850
postpone the roll over until until

1197
01:04:39,180 --> 01:04:43,890
further time there's this really

1198
01:04:41,850 --> 01:04:46,470
mysterious thing that happens sort of in

1199
01:04:43,890 --> 01:04:48,600
the middle here where this that the

1200
01:04:46,470 --> 01:04:51,810
Green Line dropped way way down and that

1201
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:53,490
that that dip almost down to 50% as far

1202
01:04:51,810 --> 01:04:54,440
as I know this has never been explained

1203
01:04:53,490 --> 01:04:56,270
I don't really understand

1204
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:58,880
what's what happened here but eventually

1205
01:04:56,270 --> 01:05:03,950
it sort of kind of recovered and went

1206
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:05,690
back to its previous trends as Randolph

1207
01:05:03,950 --> 01:05:07,848
or showed at the rollover itself there

1208
01:05:05,690 --> 01:05:09,650
was this little blip where you know

1209
01:05:07,849 --> 01:05:10,970
shortly after the rollover that we saw a

1210
01:05:09,650 --> 01:05:13,220
little a little change in the way the

1211
01:05:10,970 --> 01:05:14,779
signals happened but again it's kind of

1212
01:05:13,220 --> 01:05:19,848
slowly recovered back to its its

1213
01:05:14,780 --> 01:05:22,400
previous trend at revocation the Purple

1214
01:05:19,849 --> 01:05:25,040
Line drops way down that happened very

1215
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:27,619
quickly as they said and then over the

1216
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:29,240
over the course of the following sort of

1217
01:05:27,619 --> 01:05:31,190
weeks and months it continued to trickle

1218
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:34,700
down a little bit but what's really

1219
01:05:31,190 --> 01:05:37,520
really interesting is when KSK 2010 was

1220
01:05:34,700 --> 01:05:40,848
removed from the root zone the old trust

1221
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:42,109
anchor count is creeping back up so my

1222
01:05:40,849 --> 01:05:44,030
theory is that this is again due to

1223
01:05:42,109 --> 01:05:45,920
software updates as people of updating

1224
01:05:44,030 --> 01:05:49,250
their software the old key is coming

1225
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:50,930
back in we have now to sort of processes

1226
01:05:49,250 --> 01:05:53,150
competing for control of the trust

1227
01:05:50,930 --> 01:05:54,980
anchor file one of them being 50 11 one

1228
01:05:53,150 --> 01:05:57,020
of them being software updates and here

1229
01:05:54,980 --> 01:05:59,540
we can see that you know software

1230
01:05:57,020 --> 01:06:04,369
updates are in some sense winning a

1231
01:05:59,540 --> 01:06:06,109
little bit so this is something that I

1232
01:06:04,369 --> 01:06:09,410
think Warren was was pointing out at the

1233
01:06:06,109 --> 01:06:11,119
mic line just just a minute ago that Wes

1234
01:06:09,410 --> 01:06:13,368
actually noticed that there was this

1235
01:06:11,119 --> 01:06:16,069
interesting behavior in in the 81 45

1236
01:06:13,369 --> 01:06:18,349
data he found about 16,000 source IP

1237
01:06:16,069 --> 01:06:21,050
addresses that were sending only one

1238
01:06:18,349 --> 01:06:23,420
trust anchor signal and probably these

1239
01:06:21,050 --> 01:06:24,829
were due to dynamic IP addresses right

1240
01:06:23,420 --> 01:06:27,619
so they're there I just changed from day

1241
01:06:24,829 --> 01:06:31,700
to day so we investigated further and he

1242
01:06:27,619 --> 01:06:33,500
found about 6700 of these in addition to

1243
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:36,439
sending that signal they they would only

1244
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:38,450
make a few other DNS queries that hit

1245
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:40,280
hit the root server system and this

1246
01:06:38,450 --> 01:06:42,470
table sort of shows what those what

1247
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:45,500
those queries were so in addition to the

1248
01:06:42,470 --> 01:06:46,669
signal query they also made a query for

1249
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:48,650
the root zone itself maybe like a

1250
01:06:46,670 --> 01:06:50,900
priming query and then there was these

1251
01:06:48,650 --> 01:06:53,720
VPN domain names that appeared analogues

1252
01:06:50,900 --> 01:06:56,540
at the counts that you can see here also

1253
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:59,328
there was this SIP sort of service

1254
01:06:56,540 --> 01:07:02,119
discovery your domain that was queried

1255
01:06:59,329 --> 01:07:03,950
so sowest is about reach and discovery

1256
01:07:02,119 --> 01:07:07,099
and investigation into this and found

1257
01:07:03,950 --> 01:07:08,180
that this smartphone VPN software was

1258
01:07:07,099 --> 01:07:12,740
using lib unbound

1259
01:07:08,180 --> 01:07:14,930
and had a hard-coded trust anchor and so

1260
01:07:12,740 --> 01:07:16,729
it was pretty easy to convince them that

1261
01:07:14,930 --> 01:07:19,129
this needs to be fixed and they they did

1262
01:07:16,730 --> 01:07:21,020
a bunch of software releases this graph

1263
01:07:19,130 --> 01:07:24,770
shows the the timing of those releases

1264
01:07:21,020 --> 01:07:26,869
and the the fraction of signalers that

1265
01:07:24,770 --> 01:07:29,509
reported having the old key so this

1266
01:07:26,869 --> 01:07:32,180
happens in mid 2018 and you can see if

1267
01:07:29,510 --> 01:07:39,980
sort of goes down over over that time

1268
01:07:32,180 --> 01:07:42,348
period ok so that's all I have to say

1269
01:07:39,980 --> 01:07:44,450
about the 81 45 data next I want to talk

1270
01:07:42,349 --> 01:07:47,569
about what we call the root canary data

1271
01:07:44,450 --> 01:07:50,230
the root canary project is is active

1272
01:07:47,569 --> 01:07:53,029
measurements using the ripe Atlas probes

1273
01:07:50,230 --> 01:07:56,539
for for the rollover

1274
01:07:53,029 --> 01:07:59,089
what we've done is every hour using the

1275
01:07:56,539 --> 01:08:01,609
Atlas probes local resolver send a

1276
01:07:59,089 --> 01:08:03,380
number of queries one of them is a query

1277
01:08:01,609 --> 01:08:06,109
for an a record that has a valid

1278
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:08,270
signature one is for an a record that

1279
01:08:06,109 --> 01:08:10,759
has a bogus signature and then the third

1280
01:08:08,270 --> 01:08:16,609
is a query for the the roots DNS key

1281
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:18,799
record set so via this this activity we

1282
01:08:16,609 --> 01:08:22,100
have more than 18-thousand vantage

1283
01:08:18,799 --> 01:08:24,799
points and actually more than 35,000

1284
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:27,739
resolver IP addresses that we could

1285
01:08:24,799 --> 01:08:29,380
measure the the first two queries allow

1286
01:08:27,738 --> 01:08:32,839
us to measure the validation state of

1287
01:08:29,380 --> 01:08:35,330
the the probes resolvers whether it's

1288
01:08:32,839 --> 01:08:37,600
secure insecure or bogus and the third

1289
01:08:35,330 --> 01:08:40,219
query lets us measure the uptake of

1290
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:44,089
signatures from the new ksk as the

1291
01:08:40,219 --> 01:08:46,670
rollover progresses so this graph shows

1292
01:08:44,089 --> 01:08:49,880
that that latter measurement here you

1293
01:08:46,670 --> 01:08:51,380
can see these these two lines the the

1294
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:54,949
red line that starts at the top left and

1295
01:08:51,380 --> 01:08:57,620
goes down that's the resolvers that have

1296
01:08:54,948 --> 01:08:59,509
the old the signature the key from the

1297
01:08:57,620 --> 01:09:02,630
the signature from the old key in their

1298
01:08:59,509 --> 01:09:05,420
caches and the blue line is the opposite

1299
01:09:02,630 --> 01:09:07,040
it's the one that have the signature

1300
01:09:05,420 --> 01:09:09,080
from the new key and you can see that

1301
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:11,689
they they cross in the middle the whole

1302
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:13,908
the whole time covered here was 48 hours

1303
01:09:11,689 --> 01:09:16,189
which is the the TTL of the DNS key are

1304
01:09:13,908 --> 01:09:17,870
set but you can see that this line

1305
01:09:16,189 --> 01:09:20,509
doesn't cross quite at the 24 hour

1306
01:09:17,870 --> 01:09:21,210
period it crosses where like at 16 hours

1307
01:09:20,509 --> 01:09:23,189
which

1308
01:09:21,210 --> 01:09:25,260
probably due to the fact that some

1309
01:09:23,189 --> 01:09:27,540
implementations and configurations would

1310
01:09:25,260 --> 01:09:30,780
enforce a smaller TTL than it is on the

1311
01:09:27,540 --> 01:09:31,859
data not actually shown here but we

1312
01:09:30,779 --> 01:09:35,029
talked about in our paper a little bit

1313
01:09:31,859 --> 01:09:37,350
is not all of the Atlas probe resolvers

1314
01:09:35,029 --> 01:09:38,939
completed this transition within the 48

1315
01:09:37,350 --> 01:09:40,830
hour period I think if I remember

1316
01:09:38,939 --> 01:09:42,839
correctly the last one took something

1317
01:09:40,830 --> 01:09:44,700
like eleven days to finally flip over

1318
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:46,740
which is a little bit strange and

1319
01:09:44,700 --> 01:09:51,059
unexplained but it was not a significant

1320
01:09:46,740 --> 01:09:53,840
number of those this is kind of the same

1321
01:09:51,060 --> 01:09:56,490
data but here we're showing the the

1322
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:59,700
breakdown of the probes using known

1323
01:09:56,490 --> 01:10:02,460
large recursive providers so the Green

1324
01:09:59,700 --> 01:10:03,389
Line which is marked by the one in the

1325
01:10:02,460 --> 01:10:05,400
circle

1326
01:10:03,390 --> 01:10:07,200
those are probes that use CloudFlare and

1327
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:09,599
you can see that CloudFlare made this

1328
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:12,389
switch very shortly after the rollover

1329
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:15,120
we heard anecdotally that somebody went

1330
01:10:12,390 --> 01:10:16,820
to the website where you can flush the

1331
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:19,320
cache of CloudFlare and they forced

1332
01:10:16,820 --> 01:10:20,730
ejection of the DNS key are set from

1333
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:24,570
from claude first system at that time

1334
01:10:20,730 --> 01:10:26,160
that seems to have worked the the second

1335
01:10:24,570 --> 01:10:28,950
one the one with the the number two in

1336
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:31,590
purple here this is from a large german

1337
01:10:28,950 --> 01:10:34,050
isp and you can see here that the the

1338
01:10:31,590 --> 01:10:36,870
transition was pretty pretty quick

1339
01:10:34,050 --> 01:10:39,390
happened over a couple of hours but was

1340
01:10:36,870 --> 01:10:42,170
again maybe twelve or sixteen hours

1341
01:10:39,390 --> 01:10:44,520
after the rollover itself and then the

1342
01:10:42,170 --> 01:10:46,770
the third line is from Google Public DNS

1343
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:53,040
which shows a very smooth transition

1344
01:10:46,770 --> 01:10:54,930
over the whole 48 hour period these

1345
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:57,420
graphs show changes in validation state

1346
01:10:54,930 --> 01:10:59,370
for individual ripe Atlas probes or

1347
01:10:57,420 --> 01:11:02,520
resolvers belonging to an official rep

1348
01:10:59,370 --> 01:11:05,550
Atlas probes the green represents times

1349
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:07,110
when the validation was secure the

1350
01:11:05,550 --> 01:11:10,050
yellow represents insecure and red

1351
01:11:07,110 --> 01:11:13,500
represents bogus and then the the red

1352
01:11:10,050 --> 01:11:15,450
line on top shows the count of DNS key

1353
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:19,680
queries for that resolver IP address

1354
01:11:15,450 --> 01:11:20,490
extracted from the didle data and so you

1355
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:22,410
can see here are some different

1356
01:11:20,490 --> 01:11:24,000
behaviors we're a little bit after the

1357
01:11:22,410 --> 01:11:25,920
rollover which is which is in the

1358
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:28,740
vertical bar they're like the top one

1359
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:30,570
had a spike in DNS key queries and it

1360
01:11:28,740 --> 01:11:32,019
went from security and secure and stayed

1361
01:11:30,570 --> 01:11:34,799
insecure for the remainder of

1362
01:11:32,020 --> 01:11:37,960
the the measurement period the next one

1363
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:40,750
the the there was a DNS key spike sort

1364
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:42,100
of earlier and then it went insecure and

1365
01:11:40,750 --> 01:11:45,670
then it went back to secure so they they

1366
01:11:42,100 --> 01:11:47,110
fixed it somehow the bottom one also you

1367
01:11:45,670 --> 01:11:49,600
know how to add a short transition it

1368
01:11:47,110 --> 01:11:51,670
got fixed it went from secure to bogus

1369
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:53,650
spec to secure but for whatever reason

1370
01:11:51,670 --> 01:11:58,180
the DNS key query rate did not go back

1371
01:11:53,650 --> 01:12:01,030
down to zero so those were first some

1372
01:11:58,180 --> 01:12:02,680
individual probes but this sort of this

1373
01:12:01,030 --> 01:12:06,240
chart captures the behavior of the

1374
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:10,470
probes in aggregate so of all the 35,000

1375
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:12,730
resolvers in that data set we found 970

1376
01:12:10,470 --> 01:12:16,510
resolvers that were secure before the

1377
01:12:12,730 --> 01:12:18,250
rollover and then bogus after plus 747

1378
01:12:16,510 --> 01:12:20,740
that were secure before and insecure

1379
01:12:18,250 --> 01:12:24,700
after and then from that set we

1380
01:12:20,740 --> 01:12:28,450
identified 519 that had a change or an

1381
01:12:24,700 --> 01:12:33,460
increase in DNS key queries and 360 had

1382
01:12:28,450 --> 01:12:37,929
more DNS queries after then before so

1383
01:12:33,460 --> 01:12:40,000
from that set of 359 we found that 218

1384
01:12:37,930 --> 01:12:42,070
of them sort of fixed themselves or were

1385
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:44,320
fixed within an hour after the rollover

1386
01:12:42,070 --> 01:12:47,320
or maybe within an hour of their their

1387
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:50,080
change 138 were fixed an hour afterwards

1388
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:52,290
and three of them were were never fixed

1389
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:52,290
at all

1390
01:12:55,410 --> 01:12:59,650
running out of time this this is very

1391
01:12:57,970 --> 01:13:02,050
similar to what Ray and Oliver just show

1392
01:12:59,650 --> 01:13:04,360
this is the the DNS key query data from

1393
01:13:02,050 --> 01:13:05,800
a root and J root here are our graphs

1394
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:07,480
are in millions of queries per day and

1395
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:10,630
it starts out at 15 million per day and

1396
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:14,429
jumps up to 75 million per day after the

1397
01:13:10,630 --> 01:13:17,620
rollover again a factor of five increase

1398
01:13:14,430 --> 01:13:19,810
this shows the the revocation period I

1399
01:13:17,620 --> 01:13:21,519
hear the the the trend line is a little

1400
01:13:19,810 --> 01:13:24,940
bit different I think then from what

1401
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:26,980
effort and root saw but you can see that

1402
01:13:24,940 --> 01:13:29,980
right at revocation we had this very

1403
01:13:26,980 --> 01:13:32,559
sharp jump and then it sort of slowly

1404
01:13:29,980 --> 01:13:35,080
your meandering lis changed and

1405
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:37,090
increased inconvenient increasing in in

1406
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:38,559
in various ways until by the end of

1407
01:13:37,090 --> 01:13:41,350
March we were getting more than a

1408
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:42,550
billion DNS key queries per day which

1409
01:13:41,350 --> 01:13:44,080
was about seven or eight percent of the

1410
01:13:42,550 --> 01:13:45,640
total root server traffic at that time

1411
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:48,070
again in it

1412
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:50,440
self not not necessarily something we

1413
01:13:48,070 --> 01:13:52,210
couldn't handle but looking at this we

1414
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:53,919
saw sort of no end in sight you know we

1415
01:13:52,210 --> 01:13:55,630
figured that this could just continue

1416
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:59,170
continue continue so we started to get a

1417
01:13:55,630 --> 01:14:01,360
little bit concerned again this this

1418
01:13:59,170 --> 01:14:03,100
shows the drop-off at the time that the

1419
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:05,110
key was removed from the zone at

1420
01:14:03,100 --> 01:14:10,480
unpublished time it dropped back down to

1421
01:14:05,110 --> 01:14:13,450
post rollover pre revocation levels we

1422
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:17,320
looked at the RSX ears or two data sort

1423
01:14:13,450 --> 01:14:19,720
of as a as a proxy for des key queries

1424
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:21,400
so this this is for all the receivers

1425
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:24,550
from there are six years or two data

1426
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:27,339
we've also overlaid in dash lines the

1427
01:14:24,550 --> 01:14:29,020
actual data from a root and J ready you

1428
01:14:27,340 --> 01:14:31,120
can see that it lines up quite quite

1429
01:14:29,020 --> 01:14:32,740
nicely so this is just to show that that

1430
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:35,620
essentially all the roots saw this DNS

1431
01:14:32,740 --> 01:14:38,080
key increase although they didn't sort

1432
01:14:35,620 --> 01:14:40,420
of all see it in the same way some had

1433
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:44,050
different trends and patterns in the way

1434
01:14:40,420 --> 01:14:45,280
the increase happened so we are

1435
01:14:44,050 --> 01:14:46,750
naturally curious about what could be

1436
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:49,179
the cause what could be behind some of

1437
01:14:46,750 --> 01:14:51,550
these DNS key query floods so we sent

1438
01:14:49,180 --> 01:14:54,610
hostname bind queries to about 18,000

1439
01:14:51,550 --> 01:14:57,400
query sources and got about 775 of them

1440
01:14:54,610 --> 01:14:59,620
to actually answer us and from from from

1441
01:14:57,400 --> 01:15:01,000
that set we saw that they were mostly

1442
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:02,920
older versions of bind as you can see

1443
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:07,030
here nine point eight nine point nine to

1444
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:08,830
nine point ten we did some outreach to

1445
01:15:07,030 --> 01:15:11,259
particular sources that we identified

1446
01:15:08,830 --> 01:15:13,090
one was a French cloud hosting company

1447
01:15:11,260 --> 01:15:14,620
and they confirmed that the source that

1448
01:15:13,090 --> 01:15:18,310
was sending the DNS key queries was

1449
01:15:14,620 --> 01:15:20,170
running by nine point eight on CentOS we

1450
01:15:18,310 --> 01:15:23,140
also got in touch with a large US

1451
01:15:20,170 --> 01:15:25,270
Midwestern university and they let us

1452
01:15:23,140 --> 01:15:28,330
know that the source is coming from this

1453
01:15:25,270 --> 01:15:29,470
DNS lab exercised by students that had

1454
01:15:28,330 --> 01:15:31,720
been left running in some virtual

1455
01:15:29,470 --> 01:15:34,770
machines and they were able to get us

1456
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:37,330
the bind configuration files from that

1457
01:15:34,770 --> 01:15:39,310
so again this is this is work that that

1458
01:15:37,330 --> 01:15:41,680
Wes had done that that warren talked

1459
01:15:39,310 --> 01:15:43,300
about he took those configs and

1460
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:46,210
basically was able to reproduce the

1461
01:15:43,300 --> 01:15:49,090
condition in his lab setting that in

1462
01:15:46,210 --> 01:15:51,580
what he found was that in order to sort

1463
01:15:49,090 --> 01:15:53,410
of trigger these these quarry floods you

1464
01:15:51,580 --> 01:15:55,000
have a DNS SEC managed keys file that

1465
01:15:53,410 --> 01:15:57,309
has the old key but not the new key of

1466
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:58,560
the DNS second able option is set to

1467
01:15:57,310 --> 01:16:01,440
false and the

1468
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:05,670
a sec validation option is set to its

1469
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:07,799
default which defaults to yes but what

1470
01:16:05,670 --> 01:16:10,170
he found was in doing repeated runs of

1471
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:11,790
this as Ray said it's not deterministic

1472
01:16:10,170 --> 01:16:13,760
sometimes you get this to happen and

1473
01:16:11,790 --> 01:16:16,440
sometimes you don't sometimes it happens

1474
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:17,250
more significantly than others and so

1475
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:19,139
that's what this graph at the bottom

1476
01:16:17,250 --> 01:16:21,120
shows that over over 20 runs of this

1477
01:16:19,140 --> 01:16:24,090
experiment you get you get different

1478
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:27,000
levels of DNS key query out of out of

1479
01:16:24,090 --> 01:16:28,620
the resolve or so a little bit hard to

1480
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:33,210
understand but also we think this

1481
01:16:28,620 --> 01:16:34,620
explains why why the the query rate

1482
01:16:33,210 --> 01:16:40,500
continued to grow and grow and grow over

1483
01:16:34,620 --> 01:16:41,519
time in sort of an unpredictable way so

1484
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:44,700
the last thing I want to talk about is

1485
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:46,500
we did some measurements of RFC 8509

1486
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:51,170
which is the root case case Sentinel

1487
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:53,250
protocol you probably know this but

1488
01:16:51,170 --> 01:16:56,490
recursive resolvers that implement this

1489
01:16:53,250 --> 01:16:59,760
do some special query processing if they

1490
01:16:56,490 --> 01:17:01,320
see a certain name than then they'll

1491
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:02,850
they'll answer differently and by

1492
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:04,740
sending specific queries to those

1493
01:17:02,850 --> 01:17:07,350
resolvers you can determine if the

1494
01:17:04,740 --> 01:17:09,210
resolver supports this protocol and if

1495
01:17:07,350 --> 01:17:12,510
it has specific keys or does not have

1496
01:17:09,210 --> 01:17:16,580
specific keys in its trust anchor so we

1497
01:17:12,510 --> 01:17:19,970
measured this using both ripe Atlas and

1498
01:17:16,580 --> 01:17:22,650
Illuminati proxy Network

1499
01:17:19,970 --> 01:17:26,520
this graph shows what the measurements

1500
01:17:22,650 --> 01:17:28,740
looked like the ripe Atlas also known in

1501
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:30,150
this case as Williams project DNS

1502
01:17:28,740 --> 01:17:37,200
thought I think it's your project right

1503
01:17:30,150 --> 01:17:39,120
yeah jointly your project okay anyway so

1504
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:42,990
at the start of the measurements we

1505
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:45,599
counted about 200 or so resolvers that

1506
01:17:42,990 --> 01:17:50,010
supported Sentinel and by the end it's

1507
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:50,880
up to 1500 and you can see that you know

1508
01:17:50,010 --> 01:17:53,130
it works

1509
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:55,770
as expected at the time of revocation

1510
01:17:53,130 --> 01:17:59,730
all those that were probed reported that

1511
01:17:55,770 --> 01:18:00,990
they no longer had the old key almost

1512
01:17:59,730 --> 01:18:02,370
all of them actually didn't it didn't

1513
01:18:00,990 --> 01:18:04,869
quite go down to 0 there's there's sort

1514
01:18:02,370 --> 01:18:06,670
of a little

1515
01:18:04,869 --> 01:18:10,089
a little bit left at the bottom there

1516
01:18:06,670 --> 01:18:12,000
but for the most part it works and this

1517
01:18:10,090 --> 01:18:18,219
this table just summarizes those results

1518
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:20,199
so via via DNS thought there were 10,000

1519
01:18:18,219 --> 01:18:21,849
vantage points whereas for the

1520
01:18:20,199 --> 01:18:22,719
loominatee proxy Network which is which

1521
01:18:21,849 --> 01:18:26,710
is much larger

1522
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:28,690
there was 385 vantage points but as it

1523
01:18:26,710 --> 01:18:31,239
turns out they both resulted in about

1524
01:18:28,690 --> 01:18:34,388
the same number of recursive resolvers

1525
01:18:31,239 --> 01:18:35,919
that that could be measured so in the

1526
01:18:34,389 --> 01:18:38,500
first case a little under 20,000 in the

1527
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:41,320
other case a little more than 20,000 so

1528
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:43,539
in the in the ripe Atlas set about 8% of

1529
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:46,058
the resolvers support the Sentinel

1530
01:18:43,539 --> 01:18:48,550
protocol Illuminati about 2.3 percent

1531
01:18:46,059 --> 01:18:51,190
and in both cases all of those that

1532
01:18:48,550 --> 01:18:53,559
support the protocol indicate that they

1533
01:18:51,190 --> 01:18:57,879
have the new key and very few indicate

1534
01:18:53,559 --> 01:19:00,369
that they have the old key so that's

1535
01:18:57,880 --> 01:19:03,130
yeah conclusions yeah

1536
01:19:00,369 --> 01:19:06,098
so the first-ever case Kay were all over

1537
01:19:03,130 --> 01:19:07,750
was an overall success especially in the

1538
01:19:06,099 --> 01:19:10,090
sense that there were very few reported

1539
01:19:07,750 --> 01:19:12,489
problems but we would say it was not

1540
01:19:10,090 --> 01:19:13,840
without its challenges we can see that

1541
01:19:12,489 --> 01:19:16,299
there were failures to update trust

1542
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:18,340
anchors I would say that in particular

1543
01:19:16,300 --> 01:19:20,530
revocation is not well understood at

1544
01:19:18,340 --> 01:19:23,429
this point we have these DNS key query

1545
01:19:20,530 --> 01:19:26,199
floods we have probably bugs in software

1546
01:19:23,429 --> 01:19:29,920
we have the revoked key reappearing now

1547
01:19:26,199 --> 01:19:31,210
in interest anchor files and we can

1548
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:34,119
observe that there were validation

1549
01:19:31,210 --> 01:19:36,159
failures via our active probing so

1550
01:19:34,119 --> 01:19:40,030
that's the end and I think we have time

1551
01:19:36,159 --> 01:19:41,980
for questions Oren Kumari Google thank

1552
01:19:40,030 --> 01:19:43,750
you this was awesome I did have a

1553
01:19:41,980 --> 01:19:47,468
question actually two quick questions

1554
01:19:43,750 --> 01:19:50,199
about your graph on slide 18 and if you

1555
01:19:47,469 --> 01:19:55,659
could actually stop on slide 17 explain

1556
01:19:50,199 --> 01:19:58,419
the question one more back the top one

1557
01:19:55,659 --> 01:20:00,848
which goes yellow yeah can you go to the

1558
01:19:58,420 --> 01:20:03,670
next slide then 18 where does that show

1559
01:20:00,849 --> 01:20:05,320
up does it that open never fixed or like

1560
01:20:03,670 --> 01:20:09,070
where would that be classified I don't

1561
01:20:05,320 --> 01:20:10,719
quite get thee I might need a Willam to

1562
01:20:09,070 --> 01:20:11,980
help answer this I think it shows up and

1563
01:20:10,719 --> 01:20:13,750
never fixed one thing I what I don't

1564
01:20:11,980 --> 01:20:15,369
remember Willem is how long these

1565
01:20:13,750 --> 01:20:16,420
measurements like I don't know how long

1566
01:20:15,369 --> 01:20:18,519
never is in this

1567
01:20:16,420 --> 01:20:21,310
example okay I remember how long we kept

1568
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:24,910
looking after the the end of the the

1569
01:20:21,310 --> 01:20:26,650
rollover but I think it but I mean in

1570
01:20:24,910 --> 01:20:29,170
theory it would sort of be done okay and

1571
01:20:26,650 --> 01:20:32,379
then very closely related question you

1572
01:20:29,170 --> 01:20:35,170
have 138 fixed after one hour but is

1573
01:20:32,380 --> 01:20:36,640
that like a day six months 15 year or

1574
01:20:35,170 --> 01:20:38,560
six well we didn't we didn't

1575
01:20:36,640 --> 01:20:41,980
differentiate well it's it's on the

1576
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:43,960
order of days yeah higher resolution

1577
01:20:41,980 --> 01:20:46,059
look into off to one hour you know like

1578
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:47,770
five hours ten hours three days right I

1579
01:20:46,060 --> 01:20:53,860
don't know how how did we do we do okay

1580
01:20:47,770 --> 01:20:57,460
yeah thanks Paul Hoffman um thank you

1581
01:20:53,860 --> 01:20:59,710
this is the most cogent of these I wish

1582
01:20:57,460 --> 01:21:08,410
I had had all this for when I wrote a

1583
01:20:59,710 --> 01:21:11,440
thing on slide 10 you're scaring me that

1584
01:21:08,410 --> 01:21:13,780
one in fact exactly that part of slide

1585
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:15,730
10 and well not that whole part of slide

1586
01:21:13,780 --> 01:21:19,150
10 the last little bit where it's going

1587
01:21:15,730 --> 01:21:22,419
up so I try to quickly eyeball the top

1588
01:21:19,150 --> 01:21:24,699
and it doesn't look like that the ratio

1589
01:21:22,420 --> 01:21:27,790
of 2017 s going down it looks like these

1590
01:21:24,699 --> 01:21:30,250
are new did you look at whether we're

1591
01:21:27,790 --> 01:21:34,600
actually in that last little scary bit

1592
01:21:30,250 --> 01:21:38,140
which is like now are we losing any 27

1593
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:40,239
teens or are we only gaining 2010 yeah I

1594
01:21:38,140 --> 01:21:41,800
don't think we're losing 2017 I didn't

1595
01:21:40,239 --> 01:21:44,320
and I didn't look for that but it I

1596
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:45,969
don't feel like in your copious free

1597
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:47,830
time if you can look at that because I

1598
01:21:45,969 --> 01:21:50,230
mean we wouldn't see it that much but I

1599
01:21:47,830 --> 01:21:53,019
was like eyeballing that is good you

1600
01:21:50,230 --> 01:21:55,269
know like if that's going down there

1601
01:21:53,020 --> 01:21:57,910
will be huge amounts of sadness this

1602
01:21:55,270 --> 01:22:01,900
going up is is probably we can live with

1603
01:21:57,910 --> 01:22:04,840
it right yeah and then on slide 29 the

1604
01:22:01,900 --> 01:22:05,500
same sort of worry came up is what's

1605
01:22:04,840 --> 01:22:12,880
going on

1606
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:13,030
now you a couple more at 29 that one you

1607
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:15,429
know

1608
01:22:13,030 --> 01:22:17,349
you said oh look it you know the red

1609
01:22:15,429 --> 01:22:20,199
line didn't go down to zero no big deal

1610
01:22:17,350 --> 01:22:24,070
I consider this to be a big deal given

1611
01:22:20,199 --> 01:22:27,210
that all Sentinel software is new so

1612
01:22:24,070 --> 01:22:29,330
this has to be on a recently deployed

1613
01:22:27,210 --> 01:22:31,430
possibly recently fixed

1614
01:22:29,330 --> 01:22:33,320
system the fact that that doesn't go

1615
01:22:31,430 --> 01:22:36,200
down to zero now it's not going up so

1616
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:39,440
it's not quite as worrisome that really

1617
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:42,470
really concerns me that means that there

1618
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:45,110
are configurations out there for

1619
01:22:42,470 --> 01:22:47,150
something that is a newly deployed

1620
01:22:45,110 --> 01:22:51,950
system where the configuration didn't

1621
01:22:47,150 --> 01:22:53,809
say 2010 not can't happen I'm I'm I I I

1622
01:22:51,950 --> 01:22:56,420
don't know how we can look into that

1623
01:22:53,810 --> 01:22:59,630
more but if someone here is looking to

1624
01:22:56,420 --> 01:23:02,510
follow up on your research that to me is

1625
01:22:59,630 --> 01:23:04,730
the worst indicator of anything that has

1626
01:23:02,510 --> 01:23:07,130
happened that we even on stuff we know

1627
01:23:04,730 --> 01:23:10,099
is not buying nine eight you know we

1628
01:23:07,130 --> 01:23:11,690
know it's it's really clear and the the

1629
01:23:10,100 --> 01:23:13,340
fact that it didn't go down to zero

1630
01:23:11,690 --> 01:23:16,549
immediately is about but the fact that

1631
01:23:13,340 --> 01:23:18,770
it didn't go down months later yeah I'm

1632
01:23:16,550 --> 01:23:20,090
unhappy so if someone would look into

1633
01:23:18,770 --> 01:23:21,860
that yeah I mean it's it's very close

1634
01:23:20,090 --> 01:23:22,940
right it's it's very low percentages but

1635
01:23:21,860 --> 01:23:26,179
you're right it did not go down to zero

1636
01:23:22,940 --> 01:23:30,980
right right yeah again thank you very

1637
01:23:26,180 --> 01:23:32,780
much I do mean Jonathan Frakes with the

1638
01:23:30,980 --> 01:23:35,540
domain name Association I have a

1639
01:23:32,780 --> 01:23:39,200
question about I think it's slide 23 and

1640
01:23:35,540 --> 01:23:41,540
I may have come to the answer as Paul

1641
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:43,670
was talking but I noticed right around

1642
01:23:41,540 --> 01:23:48,530
the March timeframe we start to see some

1643
01:23:43,670 --> 01:23:50,540
climbing there is that tie - what is it

1644
01:23:48,530 --> 01:23:52,880
tie to like what what would you what

1645
01:23:50,540 --> 01:23:55,100
would you explain that we don't have an

1646
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:56,720
explanation for that I mean that's

1647
01:23:55,100 --> 01:24:00,890
that's the same as this one right this

1648
01:23:56,720 --> 01:24:05,090
this sort of very very strong uptake we

1649
01:24:00,890 --> 01:24:07,100
don't have an explanation I I don't know

1650
01:24:05,090 --> 01:24:10,610
I think that this continues to go up

1651
01:24:07,100 --> 01:24:14,750
because as again as race and I said that

1652
01:24:10,610 --> 01:24:16,809
this behavior of the DNS key flooding is

1653
01:24:14,750 --> 01:24:18,530
sort of non-deterministic right

1654
01:24:16,810 --> 01:24:20,420
something happens it's a race condition

1655
01:24:18,530 --> 01:24:22,309
or something happens and then the

1656
01:24:20,420 --> 01:24:24,170
resolver will get into the state where

1657
01:24:22,310 --> 01:24:25,700
it starts sending the queries and it

1658
01:24:24,170 --> 01:24:29,780
never gets out of that state so over

1659
01:24:25,700 --> 01:24:31,580
time more and more of these resolves out

1660
01:24:29,780 --> 01:24:32,809
there will get into the state and and

1661
01:24:31,580 --> 01:24:35,510
continue to grow I don't know why it

1662
01:24:32,810 --> 01:24:37,990
went up with that shape though okay

1663
01:24:35,510 --> 01:24:37,990
thank you

1664
01:24:40,460 --> 01:24:46,380
this is on ray I see and Debian

1665
01:24:43,590 --> 01:24:49,980
developer so I even believe I can answer

1666
01:24:46,380 --> 01:24:51,719
pause questions because well the

1667
01:24:49,980 --> 01:24:55,739
ecosystem of the Linux distributions

1668
01:24:51,719 --> 01:24:57,150
like you know if you are sis up then you

1669
01:24:55,739 --> 01:24:59,519
want your software to never change

1670
01:24:57,150 --> 01:25:01,739
because that's a hassle if your

1671
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:05,670
developer you want the users to always

1672
01:25:01,739 --> 01:25:09,269
upgrade to the latest version so so with

1673
01:25:05,670 --> 01:25:11,100
the back fixes as the one in mind the I

1674
01:25:09,270 --> 01:25:13,020
didn't know that it's called going to

1675
01:25:11,100 --> 01:25:17,070
cause the operational problems otherwise

1676
01:25:13,020 --> 01:25:18,630
we would probably bucketed bug the

1677
01:25:17,070 --> 01:25:20,670
maintainer of the of the packages to

1678
01:25:18,630 --> 01:25:23,520
pull this particular fix because

1679
01:25:20,670 --> 01:25:25,650
otherwise even I as a Debian developer

1680
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:27,510
don't pull anything that doesn't have a

1681
01:25:25,650 --> 01:25:32,070
security check on it because it might

1682
01:25:27,510 --> 01:25:37,409
break users and it's more hassle so the

1683
01:25:32,070 --> 01:25:41,489
graph under slide 10 what might be

1684
01:25:37,409 --> 01:25:44,339
happening here it's it's a deployment of

1685
01:25:41,489 --> 01:25:46,888
some containers yeah and all

1686
01:25:44,340 --> 01:25:48,750
distribution it never get get updated

1687
01:25:46,889 --> 01:25:53,610
and that's much it might be the case of

1688
01:25:48,750 --> 01:25:56,489
the of the graph on the slide 29 to that

1689
01:25:53,610 --> 01:25:58,830
it's like they might have both trust

1690
01:25:56,489 --> 01:26:01,799
anchors somewhere in a configuration and

1691
01:25:58,830 --> 01:26:05,040
they they deploy a new new staff with

1692
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:06,570
the old containers yeah and yeah I think

1693
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:08,190
that's that's most probably the case and

1694
01:26:06,570 --> 01:26:10,259
the containers never get updated because

1695
01:26:08,190 --> 01:26:13,349
they might be running in limited

1696
01:26:10,260 --> 01:26:16,320
environment anyway but they deploy more

1697
01:26:13,350 --> 01:26:18,179
and more of them as they scale so yeah

1698
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:20,369
might be it's I think it's one of the

1699
01:26:18,179 --> 01:26:23,400
points that we make in the paper that

1700
01:26:20,369 --> 01:26:25,349
when 50 11 was written like containers

1701
01:26:23,400 --> 01:26:26,580
were not really a thing it's not

1702
01:26:25,350 --> 01:26:28,679
something people had to worry about you

1703
01:26:26,580 --> 01:26:32,100
you assumed that you assumed that the

1704
01:26:28,679 --> 01:26:34,969
recursive was just an static even if the

1705
01:26:32,100 --> 01:26:39,030
distributions have updated the keys

1706
01:26:34,969 --> 01:26:41,909
people are either using distribution

1707
01:26:39,030 --> 01:26:42,300
that are past end-of-life it happens all

1708
01:26:41,909 --> 01:26:46,920
the time

1709
01:26:42,300 --> 01:26:49,349
I maintain some like packages for PHP

1710
01:26:46,920 --> 01:26:50,440
and people complain all the time that I

1711
01:26:49,349 --> 01:26:52,390
don't have a packages

1712
01:26:50,440 --> 01:26:55,750
for this distribution that has been a

1713
01:26:52,390 --> 01:26:58,690
lot about like a year ago two years ago

1714
01:26:55,750 --> 01:27:00,610
and they don't care they just deployed

1715
01:26:58,690 --> 01:27:02,139
like this stuff that's stable even

1716
01:27:00,610 --> 01:27:05,139
though it's insecure so and they don't

1717
01:27:02,140 --> 01:27:12,010
care so I think this is okay thank you

1718
01:27:05,140 --> 01:27:14,199
I'm gonna cut the line after Roy Brian

1719
01:27:12,010 --> 01:27:15,940
Dixon go daddy could you go back to 29

1720
01:27:14,199 --> 01:27:19,780
again oh my gosh could you guys do this

1721
01:27:15,940 --> 01:27:21,339
Elise I can't next time I'm gonna put

1722
01:27:19,780 --> 01:27:28,210
bigger page numbers on the screen

1723
01:27:21,340 --> 01:27:31,239
because I cannot so the question I have

1724
01:27:28,210 --> 01:27:37,540
is I didn't necessarily catch the first

1725
01:27:31,239 --> 01:27:39,699
time through the the red systems is

1726
01:27:37,540 --> 01:27:43,719
there an indication that they only have

1727
01:27:39,699 --> 01:27:45,370
2010 or do they also have 2017 no they

1728
01:27:43,719 --> 01:27:47,260
also have 2017

1729
01:27:45,370 --> 01:27:49,330
yeah okay yeah yeah this is I mean this

1730
01:27:47,260 --> 01:27:50,620
is nothing well apart from what Paul

1731
01:27:49,330 --> 01:27:53,260
brought up this isn't not anything to be

1732
01:27:50,620 --> 01:27:57,969
alarmed about no I'm just curious yeah

1733
01:27:53,260 --> 01:27:59,500
yeah and this this was I mean really

1734
01:27:57,969 --> 01:28:01,420
this is here to sort of prove that the

1735
01:27:59,500 --> 01:28:03,040
Sentinel protocol is sort of working and

1736
01:28:01,420 --> 01:28:05,590
being deployed right yeah I think it

1737
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:10,120
gives better or more useful signal also

1738
01:28:05,590 --> 01:28:11,560
uh in the Sentinel probe did you I don't

1739
01:28:10,120 --> 01:28:14,559
remember if you mentioned this did you

1740
01:28:11,560 --> 01:28:23,800
grab grab the version behind information

1741
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:27,910
as well no okay oh boy least I know what

1742
01:28:23,800 --> 01:28:30,430
it looks like now so sadly I think the

1743
01:28:27,910 --> 01:28:33,130
thing going up at the end is also we did

1744
01:28:30,430 --> 01:28:35,110
a really really good job of pushing DNS

1745
01:28:33,130 --> 01:28:37,300
SEC and writing a bunch of pages and a

1746
01:28:35,110 --> 01:28:39,070
bunch of outreach and I recently went to

1747
01:28:37,300 --> 01:28:41,230
go find something to point someone at

1748
01:28:39,070 --> 01:28:44,019
and all of the configs I could find

1749
01:28:41,230 --> 01:28:46,030
listed 2010 and none of them listed 2017

1750
01:28:44,020 --> 01:28:48,100
so it's probably not a large contributor

1751
01:28:46,030 --> 01:28:50,139
but next time we do the sort of outreach

1752
01:28:48,100 --> 01:28:51,580
we should keep in mind you know mention

1753
01:28:50,140 --> 01:28:55,320
that this could change and eight

1754
01:28:51,580 --> 01:28:55,320
canonical place with you find it okay

1755
01:28:57,280 --> 01:29:03,860
my atoms with ICANN and this data it's

1756
01:29:02,090 --> 01:29:07,659
it's from all root servers are just a

1757
01:29:03,860 --> 01:29:10,789
and J this is just from a and J okay and

1758
01:29:07,659 --> 01:29:13,518
we have additional root server data from

1759
01:29:10,789 --> 01:29:18,050
and we asked at one point in time the

1760
01:29:13,519 --> 01:29:20,360
are check root server system Advisory

1761
01:29:18,050 --> 01:29:22,820
Committee if they were willing to run

1762
01:29:20,360 --> 01:29:29,058
the two that you wrote on all the root

1763
01:29:22,820 --> 01:29:32,209
servers they then did bearing one and it

1764
01:29:29,059 --> 01:29:35,840
shows a fairly similar data and I can

1765
01:29:32,209 --> 01:29:40,880
also not explain why you see that that

1766
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:43,249
that big dip in the middle and I noticed

1767
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:46,489
that various root server operators at

1768
01:29:43,249 --> 01:29:50,478
times did not I mean they upgrade their

1769
01:29:46,489 --> 01:29:54,049
stuff they changed their measurements

1770
01:29:50,479 --> 01:29:56,389
etc etc so the data that we got from all

1771
01:29:54,050 --> 01:30:02,659
root surface I know that this is just a

1772
01:29:56,389 --> 01:30:04,929
NJ it's not that consistent so I also

1773
01:30:02,659 --> 01:30:09,259
wanna make a similar points Brian made

1774
01:30:04,929 --> 01:30:10,939
questioned this is 22 when you sorry

1775
01:30:09,260 --> 01:30:14,030
this purple - purple

1776
01:30:10,939 --> 01:30:15,949
raised in the end that's not 2010 only

1777
01:30:14,030 --> 01:30:17,630
but still it's an inclusive right

1778
01:30:15,949 --> 01:30:20,388
because the Green Line nicely continues

1779
01:30:17,630 --> 01:30:31,669
yeah okay thank you for the

1780
01:30:20,389 --> 01:30:35,269
clarification okay thank you Thank You

1781
01:30:31,669 --> 01:30:38,300
Dwayne right so this brings us to the

1782
01:30:35,269 --> 01:30:39,800
end of our session this morning a couple

1783
01:30:38,300 --> 01:30:42,939
of announcements before we break for

1784
01:30:39,800 --> 01:30:46,340
coffee the next session will start

1785
01:30:42,939 --> 01:30:49,939
exactly at 11:00 so please be back in

1786
01:30:46,340 --> 01:30:53,989
time for that I would also like to

1787
01:30:49,939 --> 01:30:56,419
request all of you to please take the

1788
01:30:53,989 --> 01:30:58,968
survey and rate all the presentations

1789
01:30:56,419 --> 01:31:01,849
this helps the program committee to put

1790
01:30:58,969 --> 01:31:04,010
together a good program for future

1791
01:31:01,849 --> 01:31:07,479
meetings and you know gives us an idea

1792
01:31:04,010 --> 01:31:09,179
of how the presentations are doing and

1793
01:31:07,479 --> 01:31:11,130
finally

1794
01:31:09,179 --> 01:31:13,530
for the next session at eleven there is

1795
01:31:11,130 --> 01:31:15,449
a slight change in the agenda Paul vixie

1796
01:31:13,530 --> 01:31:20,849
