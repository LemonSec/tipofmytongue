1
00:00:29,289 --> 00:00:31,349
you

2
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:52,559
good afternoon everyone I'm Alan bhudev

3
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:55,589
I'm also part of the work program

4
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:59,608
committee and I'll be chairing this next

5
00:00:55,589 --> 00:01:02,699
session a reminder to the speakers when

6
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:05,309
the timekeeper indicates to you how many

7
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:06,990
minutes are left this is the number of

8
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:09,750
minutes left to the end of your

9
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:12,149
presentation excluding question time so

10
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:19,649
there's five minutes for questions at

11
00:01:12,149 --> 00:01:22,590
the end of your presentation reminder to

12
00:01:19,649 --> 00:01:26,069
all of you please fill out the DNS or

13
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:29,850
arc survey that helps the program

14
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:32,670
committee to put together a good program

15
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:35,458
for you your feedback is very important

16
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:37,409
to us in determining what kind of

17
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:41,880
presentations we put together for the

18
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:45,720
program so for our first presentation

19
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:49,560
for this session I would like to invite

20
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:51,959
Ulrich Visser with a presentation title

21
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:58,319
that describes me very aptly Forever

22
00:01:51,959 --> 00:02:02,459
Young Thank You Anne and of course only

23
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:04,470
thinking over here and okay okay today I

24
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:07,379
will talk about how to keep your DNS

25
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:09,269
data forever young' on the Internet my

26
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:12,090
name is Alissa and I work for the

27
00:02:09,269 --> 00:02:13,920
swedish internet foundation and as part

28
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:18,569
of the dns team it is my responsibility

29
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:21,599
to make sure that we deliver fast and

30
00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:26,429
reliable services to all users of the

31
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:29,819
disease own and yes

32
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:32,430
so TTL values in our sig lifetimes are

33
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:34,409
crucial to our mission and they have a

34
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:39,810
big influence on our ability to deliver

35
00:02:34,409 --> 00:02:44,819
our services and so that put me on a

36
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:48,510
path to investigate these values because

37
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:51,480
we actually want to make sure that we

38
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:53,340
have the right values and it took me

39
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:56,760
down a rabbit hole that you hope you

40
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,840
will follow me today and so we have four

41
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,899
main deliverables

42
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,959
and we believe that these will affect

43
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:05,459
the 30 L values and the RZ lifetimes and

44
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:08,610
I hope at the end of the talk you will

45
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:11,670
agree with me so the first is we need to

46
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:12,840
have a DeRose defense and a former DNS

47
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:16,350
or a conference

48
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:19,050
Giovani mover for Masada and labs showed

49
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:23,160
that longer TTL values will help with

50
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:26,540
the defense against DDoS attacks and of

51
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:29,640
course these ability to defend is really

52
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:34,109
essential to keeping dot se online at

53
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:36,450
all times then of course we have a goal

54
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:41,400
of happy users and happy users usually

55
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:44,339
means faster answers and the same

56
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:47,400
giovani mover presented at the last ENSO

57
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:52,500
arc that longer TTL values will keep

58
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:56,130
your data in cache and that this

59
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:57,750
mechanism can then give you so fast

60
00:03:56,130 --> 00:04:02,850
answer that you even beat any card

61
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:05,549
services and then we have happy

62
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:08,760
customers and our customers our

63
00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:11,610
registrants registrar's webmasters and

64
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:15,630
DNS service providers and they demand

65
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:18,930
faster updates and they demand faster

66
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:21,779
propagation times over the internet and

67
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:25,620
that in other word means shorter TTL

68
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:29,369
values and last but not least we have

69
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:32,250
disaster recovery and our sig lifetime

70
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:36,270
and so our values define the timeframe

71
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:39,330
for disaster recovery and therefore they

72
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:44,099
are really important to make sure that

73
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:47,250
we even in times of crisis can deliver

74
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:52,100
service to our all the users of the dot

75
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:55,650
a season so what is the state of the TTL

76
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:59,220
well in these following slides I will go

77
00:04:55,650 --> 00:05:02,849
through TTL values for actually for TLDs

78
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:06,300
and I choose these 40 alleys carefully

79
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:09,960
because the dot EU have actually online

80
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:11,730
updates so potentially every second they

81
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:14,070
update their zone

82
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:18,420
dot F all updates approximately every

83
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:21,210
ten minutes dot n L Box updates every

84
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:25,980
half hour and that dot s e since last

85
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:29,580
year we update every hour and so when

86
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:32,670
you look here the solar values you see

87
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:34,830
that none of these solar values are

88
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:38,610
really that short like our update cycles

89
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:40,260
and in case of the solar record for TLD

90
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:42,810
that might not be so interesting because

91
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:43,520
I mean resolve us now usually not going

92
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:46,140
to ask for it

93
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:48,060
the so of the restoring record is mainly

94
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:51,380
used in negative answers and then it

95
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:55,800
will get the negative at the minimum TTL

96
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:59,190
so but then we go to the NS record and

97
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:03,870
the glue records and these records are

98
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:08,250
delivered by route is usually to de TTL

99
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:12,270
and here you already see that there is

100
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:14,520
differences and I think most people

101
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:17,549
believe that resolvers are parent

102
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:22,049
centric there is still an ongoing

103
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:24,060
discussion about this but young and see

104
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:26,190
yeah yeah already here is the question

105
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:28,350
why dot e you think that they will

106
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:32,490
change their name servers faster than

107
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:34,590
the igloo records but you know I know

108
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:37,320
for example that for dot NL they have

109
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:39,390
deliberately changed this to one hour

110
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:42,450
for the a records because they want to

111
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:45,750
be able to change a records in when they

112
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:48,380
under attack and they won't not change

113
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:52,230
names but change a records faster and

114
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:54,990
then I looked at the txt records dot EU

115
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:57,420
doesn't have one at the apex but the

116
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:59,250
other threes have and to be all of three

117
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:02,750
of us use that actually it we update the

118
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:06,620
txt record when we update the zone and

119
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:11,460
here you see that the TTL values of the

120
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:15,510
txt record not really synchronized with

121
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:19,169
our update times which is strange if you

122
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:21,960
think about it and then we have the DNS

123
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:23,850
key and these are delivered by root the

124
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,180
DS records are delivered by rude with

125
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:29,639
one

126
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:30,300
de TTL and I honestly can say Y dot se

127
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:33,990
has one hour

128
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:38,520
I mean we we don't roll our KSK that

129
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:41,820
fast it's used between worlds so there's

130
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:43,770
really no need for this and the best

131
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:45,870
answer I could get for why do you have

132
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:48,210
these values is yeah because we always

133
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:52,259
did it that way

134
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:54,719
I get these answers a lot I'm in so

135
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:59,669
let's look at delegations and here it's

136
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:06,000
get even stranger you see that dot dot

137
00:07:59,669 --> 00:08:07,349
EU has delegations with one day TTL dot

138
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,630
fr has two days

139
00:08:07,349 --> 00:08:12,479
don't NL has one hour that is very close

140
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:16,409
to there update cycle actually and a dot

141
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:18,539
se we have one day again yep

142
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:23,580
at least we have the same for the a

143
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:25,650
records for DS records somehow at se we

144
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:28,380
decided again that this should be faster

145
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:30,570
I don't know I have really no good

146
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:32,939
explanation and that is actually what

147
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:35,580
took me down to this look in all these

148
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:37,349
Israelis and then we have the an SEC

149
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:41,459
records and this is of course is the

150
00:08:37,349 --> 00:08:47,970
minimum TTL from the solo record and you

151
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:53,150
see here that we're really not referring

152
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:55,230
update propagation over the Internet and

153
00:08:53,150 --> 00:09:00,930
that is something that we have to look

154
00:08:55,230 --> 00:09:03,720
into then we have these so our TTL

155
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:06,900
values and here we come to a point where

156
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:09,540
we could say that the refresh and the

157
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:12,449
retry value are not so important for

158
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:17,069
TLDs because obviously we send out

159
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:20,250
notifies whenever we do updates and so

160
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:22,260
these our slave servers usually won't do

161
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:25,620
a refresh or we try because you know

162
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:29,300
they are always there if we are not

163
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:31,980
there then they are not of much help

164
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:34,380
but then the expire time is really

165
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:37,230
interesting and here you see that EU and

166
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:41,400
Fri have 1000 hours

167
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:45,180
Enel has I think 30 days and dot se has

168
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:47,760
ten days and we come later back to this

169
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:49,770
when in together with the RS sig

170
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,410
lifetimes and then we have the minimum

171
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:54,540
TTL and he again it's like the an SEC

172
00:09:52,410 --> 00:10:01,079
records that we really not in sync with

173
00:09:54,540 --> 00:10:04,290
our update cycles and so before we make

174
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:07,350
any changes to our TTL values let's look

175
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:10,020
at negative answers and so I try to find

176
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:13,410
some guidance about you know what should

177
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:18,180
I choose here and so I couldn't find

178
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:21,810
much but so I found a really out RC 1033

179
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:28,140
and it says Oh at least day is a good

180
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:31,560
value and for the minimum TTL and that I

181
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:35,520
think things might have changed in them

182
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:38,000
so then we have our C 19:12 it says one

183
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:44,340
to five days our typical values which is

184
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:46,170
really and then we have the 23:08 which

185
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:49,140
actually defines the negative caching

186
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:53,579
and it says no no don't listen to these

187
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:58,410
others one two three hours are sensible

188
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:59,790
values and it even says values exceeding

189
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:02,670
one day have been found to be

190
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:05,579
problematic so I I couldn't agree more

191
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:10,229
but I think that even a value of one

192
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:12,960
hour might be too much so then we have

193
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:14,520
aggressive and sake and just as the

194
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:17,040
short reminder aggressive and SEC means

195
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:19,410
that the resolver will actually

196
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:23,160
synthesize a negative answer from its

197
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:28,469
cache to a question that itself has not

198
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:30,420
sent to the authoritative server and it

199
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:34,230
will do this of course with the help of

200
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:35,939
the encyc record but there's a few

201
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:37,590
things that the resolver actually need

202
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:40,500
to do this and the resolver needs a

203
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:43,350
negative answer in cache it needs a so a

204
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:47,040
record with a signature and it needs an

205
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:48,620
ensign record to send out and of course

206
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,780
these three records have TTLs

207
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:53,510
so a minimum

208
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:55,430
so I could help this so a TTL value and

209
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:57,680
then you have the an SEC record which

210
00:11:55,430 --> 00:12:00,199
usually has the so a minimum TTL value

211
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:03,770
and these are the values for the dot s a

212
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:06,680
zone which for example in this case

213
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:09,020
would give us to our cashing for

214
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:11,750
negative answers which in case if you

215
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:14,780
have a in a DDoS defense situation is

216
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:16,580
really good because then for two hours

217
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:18,439
anyway solver I can actually send out

218
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:23,030
answers without any contact to the

219
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:25,280
authoritative server but if you look at

220
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:27,890
propagation times for updates if you

221
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:29,900
know would have a new name in that in

222
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:32,270
the covered space that would obviously

223
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:38,510
be bad because now for two hours that

224
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:42,050
name is not operational and so before we

225
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:45,110
make any changes to our DNS let's look

226
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:48,500
at our sig lifetimes and our seek

227
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:50,570
lifetimes so the lifetime of an hour

228
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:53,240
seek record is obviously defined in the

229
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:55,130
record itself it has a time and day when

230
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,600
it starts to become valid and it has a

231
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:59,090
time in the date when it stops to be

232
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:03,020
valid and the time in between is its

233
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:05,060
lifetime simple but usually we don't use

234
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:08,420
the record for all its lifetime we

235
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:10,849
replace it actually quite fast so in

236
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:13,670
case of the dot s a zone our our sake

237
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:16,280
records have a 12-day lifetime and we

238
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:18,410
have but we replace them in the in the

239
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:20,660
run or four days actually so there's no

240
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:24,680
our sake records in our zone that are

241
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:29,420
older than four days and why we do this

242
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:31,939
well if things go sideways then we have

243
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:35,060
some time left where we have valid

244
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:36,770
signatures in the zone and if you see

245
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:39,829
you look on this picture you we have

246
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:41,840
eight days left that the that we have

247
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:45,380
all the signatures in the zone are still

248
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:51,050
valid so but when we then look at our so

249
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:55,910
record it said ten days expire time so

250
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:58,520
if we add the expire time to our our

251
00:13:55,910 --> 00:14:02,959
refresh time it means that we will serve

252
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:04,660
the zone today 14 but that means from

253
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:09,310
day 12 to day 14 we

254
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:11,889
we will have validation failures and not

255
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:16,839
the whole zone will fail on at once

256
00:14:11,889 --> 00:14:19,600
there will be a degradation over time

257
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:21,819
and actually after four days so after

258
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:31,060
day 16 the whole zone would be invalid

259
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:33,370
and so this is obviously not idiom well

260
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:38,589
what would be reasonable value then well

261
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:42,189
when in doubt ask your peers so and

262
00:14:38,589 --> 00:14:45,129
actually our peers we are ccTLD so I

263
00:14:42,189 --> 00:14:47,709
looked at we are very active in the

264
00:14:45,129 --> 00:14:51,759
center community so I thought let's look

265
00:14:47,709 --> 00:14:54,569
what the other CCD IDs are doing and yes

266
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:57,730
so there's a few of them that have

267
00:14:54,569 --> 00:15:00,759
longer RC lifetimes at least longer than

268
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:02,139
was there so evaluates the problem here

269
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:04,600
is that we really don't know what the

270
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:07,329
refresh time is for their signatures so

271
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:09,850
we can't actually decide if the so I

272
00:15:07,329 --> 00:15:15,060
spire together with the refresh time

273
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:17,649
actually cover all the the life time but

274
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:19,660
well at least in the beginning we see

275
00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:23,259
that the the life time is longer than

276
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:27,819
the expire time and so they seem to

277
00:15:23,259 --> 00:15:29,709
think at least in the way that we when

278
00:15:27,819 --> 00:15:35,560
we have people with incredible fast

279
00:15:29,709 --> 00:15:40,569
disaster recovery and aura four days is

280
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:43,540
ambitious I would say hungry I might

281
00:15:40,569 --> 00:15:46,149
expect that they kind of the era where

282
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:49,930
there is so expire time I meant 30 days

283
00:15:46,149 --> 00:15:52,149
but who knows and Lithuania I I just

284
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:55,620
want to go there and see what they doing

285
00:15:52,149 --> 00:15:55,620
that they can recover in one day

286
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:04,509
yes and then we have a lot of TLDs that

287
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:09,129
don't believe in the NSA core the

288
00:16:04,509 --> 00:16:11,319
validation is not used maybe I have no

289
00:16:09,129 --> 00:16:14,050
idea but obviously Canada for example

290
00:16:11,319 --> 00:16:18,360
you see that they they intend to serve

291
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:25,560
the the gods a zone from 40 days

292
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:32,829
but only have signatures for seven so

293
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:35,739
yeah but it makes your own domain even

294
00:16:32,829 --> 00:16:42,310
go dark yeah and that is sign there

295
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:44,170
isn't it yeah and and it okay you could

296
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:45,699
answer you could argue that Canada is

297
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:49,449
not signed but if you look at the last

298
00:16:45,699 --> 00:16:51,250
one in the list Norway actually no way

299
00:16:49,449 --> 00:16:55,508
the country with the I think they are

300
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:58,509
like 80% signed and they have like all

301
00:16:55,509 --> 00:17:01,750
large they have the largest amount of

302
00:16:58,509 --> 00:17:03,579
validation there in the world so for

303
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:08,980
Norway this obviously should be a

304
00:17:03,579 --> 00:17:11,079
problem and yes and then I have this

305
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:15,280
where I really could not think of any

306
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:16,928
explanation at all maybe somebody's in

307
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:21,339
the room and could explain this or maybe

308
00:17:16,929 --> 00:17:22,870
somebody knows someone and and just at

309
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:25,208
the side note I I don't think any of

310
00:17:22,869 --> 00:17:27,458
these values are wrong I just think that

311
00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:30,700
I would like what people were thinking

312
00:17:27,459 --> 00:17:32,860
so in case you know to learn something

313
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:39,790
and to make a better informed decisions

314
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:41,559
and so what is reasonable values well we

315
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:43,658
had this four objectives in the

316
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:46,658
beginning I told you and so let's see

317
00:17:43,659 --> 00:17:50,320
what our four objectives told us to do

318
00:17:46,659 --> 00:17:51,909
here and in fact ETLs rupees were

319
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:55,658
minimum them and you always get that

320
00:17:51,909 --> 00:18:00,130
automatically from your authority of the

321
00:17:55,659 --> 00:18:02,890
so our TTL should be so a minimum or

322
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:05,230
longer of course otherwise you get a

323
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:09,040
really strange caching for your negative

324
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:10,659
answers and so a minimum should be long

325
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:12,280
enough for caching and and that is

326
00:18:10,659 --> 00:18:15,400
something that we need to do think of

327
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:19,540
very slowly because caching really helps

328
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:22,870
us in case of defense and we want happy

329
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:26,950
users which means fast answers and so

330
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:28,870
here we want our apex details we should

331
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:30,880
really look at the parent and see what

332
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:33,669
you know the parent does

333
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:35,440
and the so minimum should be really

334
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:37,900
considerably shorter than our update

335
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:44,440
times because otherwise we can't just

336
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:48,610
get the the propagation delegations

337
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:50,700
should also be you know really in sync

338
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:52,540
with our update cycles otherwise

339
00:18:50,700 --> 00:19:00,370
propagation over the internet is just

340
00:18:52,540 --> 00:19:02,290
too short too slow and again we want

341
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:05,229
caching because our users really want

342
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:10,330
you know fast answers so and you see

343
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:14,350
already here there's and some conflict

344
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:16,870
between longer details for caching and

345
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:19,500
shorter TTL for propagation and we

346
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:22,179
really need to find a balance here and

347
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:23,070
happy customers of course is we want

348
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:26,220
fast

349
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:30,520
propagation and that means shorter TTL

350
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:32,890
and last but not least we have disaster

351
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:36,180
recovery and for disaster recovery we

352
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:42,550
really want that our so expire time

353
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:46,470
covers that our our seek lifetime covers

354
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:46,470
so our time and the refresh time

355
00:19:55,730 --> 00:20:01,070
the expire timers really only used when

356
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:03,110
you were doing some transfers to

357
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:04,939
transfer the zones yes if you are using

358
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:07,669
other mechanisms it really doesn't

359
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:10,400
matter no of course not but you know me

360
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:12,770
that's what we use for you know at least

361
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,450
from our master out to our but that

362
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:17,960
might be reason why others I mean have

363
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:20,450
weird absolutely that's why I say I I

364
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:23,390
can't say anything what the others are

365
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:26,290
do is wrong I just would you know I

366
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:29,720
think it would be interesting to hear

367
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:32,330
arguments about what they doing so that

368
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:34,550
you know informed decisions because I

369
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:37,030
mean we all get it that day's there is

370
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:40,940
no difference between an TTL value of

371
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:42,920
300 or 299 that is just insignificant I

372
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:47,150
imagine you know nobody could hear but

373
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:53,030
is would be an update a delegation of

374
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:57,440
300 or 3,000 be okay there's you know

375
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:59,450
there's arguments to be made and at

376
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:07,180
least that order orders of magnitude of

377
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:11,660
TTL values aligning the materials with

378
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:13,880
the actual update or the the cycles that

379
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:16,150
you do the recent resigning makes sense

380
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,150
to me

381
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:32,360
any more questions for all right okay

382
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:35,710
thank you sorry

383
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:35,709
[Applause]

384
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:45,760
our next speaker this afternoon is John

385
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:49,450
Christophe and he's going to talk about

386
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:54,740
some threat analysis with ipv6

387
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:57,020
transition mechanisms welcome John very

388
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:58,760
much an infinite introduction I'm gonna

389
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:00,500
only gave myself 15 minutes so I'm gonna

390
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:03,650
kind of get right into it but for those

391
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:05,210
of you who know me or knew me at one

392
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:07,220
time I'm starting to spend more time and

393
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:08,900
doing research I'm doing my PhD now you

394
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:10,940
may look at my face and my hair and I'm

395
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:12,710
a little bit older PhD student but

396
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:14,800
nonetheless that's happening for me now

397
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:16,880
but I still work at the Paul University

398
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:19,550
during the day as well and so I still

399
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,470
use that email as my my main contact so

400
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:24,800
this is some work that's trying to get

401
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:26,120
published it's largely done it's been

402
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:28,399
done for a little while the publishing

403
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:31,429
part turns out to be the hard part so

404
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:33,680
that part is in in progress how many of

405
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:35,780
you remember just by show of hands a

406
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:38,300
while back I think it was Dwayne Wessels

407
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:40,160
who kind of started did this work

408
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:41,659
initially on something called W Pat does

409
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:44,380
that ring any bells for any WPA you guys

410
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:44,380
know what that is

411
00:22:45,549 --> 00:22:49,970
interesting and they said well what else

412
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:51,500
is like that out there and there's this

413
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:53,570
other thing that's kind of like it in a

414
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:54,610
way this is thing called isatap and some

415
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:57,799
of you probably know what that is

416
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:59,479
cringing and so I went and like Dwayne

417
00:22:57,799 --> 00:23:02,629
had registered a bunch of WP had names I

418
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:04,370
registered a handful of isatap names and

419
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:06,230
I held on to them for years thinking I

420
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:09,949
would eventually do something like

421
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:12,169
Dwayne did and about to a year or so

422
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:14,330
into my PhD I had a class where I did

423
00:23:12,169 --> 00:23:16,490
your a research project and my professor

424
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:18,139
sat down with us and I had a few ideas

425
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:19,520
in one of his way I had these isatap

426
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,940
names we could maybe do something cool

427
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,129
with it

428
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:24,020
he said yeah let's do that so that's

429
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:26,360
kind of where this starting to grew into

430
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:28,070
something a little bit more into

431
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:29,870
something a little bit more general ipv6

432
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:33,678
automatic transition mechanisms and so

433
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:35,809
this is just a taste of that work isatap

434
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:38,030
being a piece of it but there's a couple

435
00:23:35,809 --> 00:23:39,289
of other things here as well so this is

436
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:41,330
I'm gonna kind of try to take you

437
00:23:39,289 --> 00:23:44,179
quickly through some of this this is

438
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:48,918
roughly the the bits I want to try to

439
00:23:44,179 --> 00:23:50,390
touch upon as fast as I can so when we

440
00:23:48,919 --> 00:23:52,370
conducted this work basically we ran

441
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:54,140
through a number of experiments and and

442
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:56,030
some research and we've basically found

443
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:57,770
from looking at this from a security

444
00:23:56,030 --> 00:24:00,110
perspective these transmission

445
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:03,289
transition mechanisms like isatap and

446
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:06,110
6to4 and traído pose a suite of

447
00:24:03,289 --> 00:24:08,929
potential security threats and probably

448
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:11,928
the most generic one through all of them

449
00:24:08,929 --> 00:24:15,049
in various forms and fashions is we can

450
00:24:11,929 --> 00:24:16,190
hijack people's v6 track traffic in some

451
00:24:15,049 --> 00:24:19,820
ways and we don't always have to even be

452
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:21,350
on path to do it and so we did a bunch

453
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:22,309
of experiments around this and we found

454
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:24,199
some other things that were quite

455
00:24:22,309 --> 00:24:25,940
interesting and this some of you may be

456
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,830
on a mailing list that saw something for

457
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:29,870
me recently that has to do with 6to4

458
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:31,668
which is another piece for this which I

459
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:35,870
won't talk about now but we can talk

460
00:24:31,669 --> 00:24:37,400
about it offline so I went registered a

461
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:40,309
whole bunch of these isatap names so

462
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:42,650
isatap dot US biz everything except for

463
00:24:40,309 --> 00:24:46,220
common net and or because those were

464
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:49,039
registered by the one of the people who

465
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:51,980
define the RFC for isatap when it was

466
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:54,760
first standardized so those essentially

467
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:57,350
the only three key Odie's I don't have

468
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:58,620
but then there's a handful of dynamic

469
00:24:57,350 --> 00:25:00,899
domains that I've read

470
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:02,879
I did some stuff within our educational

471
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:04,850
institutions so I've got I stab names

472
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:07,710
probably like a hundred different places

473
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:08,639
so it's a little bit expensive to you by

474
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:10,590
the way my wife doesn't really

475
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,510
appreciate that but I have a bunch of

476
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:14,760
these names and then some of this

477
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:18,120
infrastructure like six to four in

478
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:21,059
particular has what effectively anycast

479
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:22,620
addresses associated with them and these

480
00:25:21,059 --> 00:25:24,570
are prefixes that may or may not exist

481
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:26,040
in the routing tables and so we took a

482
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:27,600
look at doing some routing table

483
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:29,639
experiments so I did that that's not

484
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:33,360
particularly germane to this talk today

485
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:34,950
but we did some of that stuff some of

486
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,899
that's that's more relevant for today is

487
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:38,700
okay what if we make available these

488
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:41,100
names and actually associate them with

489
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:43,590
an actual gateway so then people do an

490
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:45,899
isatap name lookup will they actually

491
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:47,909
try to connect to our v4 v6 gateway and

492
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:50,100
route traffic through it so we did that

493
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:52,260
and of course I wouldn't probably be up

494
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:54,330
here if that didn't happen so yes we

495
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:56,370
were able to intercept and route traffic

496
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:59,159
for people who were trying to do these

497
00:25:56,370 --> 00:26:00,840
six and then I looked at a bunch of DNS

498
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:03,720
query data that I had for my own

499
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:05,610
authoritative servers for isatap for our

500
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:08,280
educational institutions and then I used

501
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:09,600
the dental data that DNS auric maintains

502
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:11,730
that's actually really helpful and it

503
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,500
was actually kind of useful for this

504
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:15,690
project as well if you haven't looked at

505
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:16,920
that data it's it's useful for for a lot

506
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:19,980
of things I think but it was helpful for

507
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:21,450
this in particular I'm actually gonna

508
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:22,710
skip over the slide that six to four

509
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:24,600
stuff is kind of interesting this is

510
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:25,650
kind of a crummy diagram we made another

511
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:28,050
one for the paper and I don't really

512
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:30,570
need to explain this here today so I'm

513
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:32,580
going to skip over six to fours and I'll

514
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:34,350
just focus on the isatap piece real

515
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:36,419
quick so what if you don't know the way

516
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:38,219
isatap works is primarily used by

517
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:40,950
Windows machines but there's clients for

518
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:43,260
other things and all Windows machines

519
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:45,300
practically going back to about XP up

520
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:47,670
until just recently it was and it was

521
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:49,889
installed by default any Windows

522
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:51,900
machines and up until recently enabled

523
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:53,940
by default what would happen is you

524
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:55,710
would if you didn't have native v6 you'd

525
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:58,170
issue a nice attack dot whatever your

526
00:26:55,710 --> 00:27:01,220
default domain was query if you got an a

527
00:26:58,170 --> 00:27:06,300
record response you would then issue

528
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:08,520
essentially an ICMP XJ i seen pv version

529
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:10,440
6 router ever browser solicitation

530
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,790
message

531
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,380
and see if you got a router

532
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:15,389
advertisement back you're just trying to

533
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:16,920
basically bootstrap with a dressing and

534
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:18,690
if you got that then you assumed that

535
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:21,420
was your isatap default gateway

536
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:22,770
that's your tunnel that's your v4 to v6

537
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:24,780
tunnel and you try to route traffic

538
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:26,850
through it now the way the happy L

539
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:30,210
eyeballs algorithms works if you've got

540
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:32,040
a nice attempt tunnel all your traffic

541
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:34,110
if you have a v6 destination for it

542
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:36,420
we'll take that tunnel over the v4 stuff

543
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:38,399
if it doesn't work Windows is pretty

544
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:40,620
good about falling back but all your v6

545
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:42,570
traffic would go through that time so

546
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:45,479
that's kind of how I step works in a

547
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:46,710
really quick nutshell if you care I

548
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,000
don't know how well you can make this

549
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:50,520
out a little bit small but you can look

550
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,140
at the slides online for Windows this is

551
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:54,570
kind of a rough idea of what it tries to

552
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:58,380
do for v6 if you don't have native v6 at

553
00:27:54,570 --> 00:28:01,830
try zhesan a series of alternatives from

554
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:04,740
isatap to 6to4 to Torito but there's all

555
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:06,720
sorts of ways for us to potentially grab

556
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:10,530
your v6 traffic if it's trying really

557
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:12,300
hard to get a v6 tunnel going so here's

558
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:16,020
some graphs that we took and I'll just

559
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:18,419
kind of give you an idea of what we were

560
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:19,620
doing don't pay too much attention to

561
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:20,940
these numbers here if you have

562
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:23,370
particular questions about what we saw

563
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:25,350
let's talk about it offline but for

564
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:26,879
instance the the bar chart here on the

565
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:28,860
left this is just looking at what are

566
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:31,560
the volumes of queries we saw for the

567
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:33,389
different type of mechanisms either an

568
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:36,320
educational institution versus a cable

569
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:38,910
modem ISP we tend to see more

570
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:41,250
unfortunately isatap queries versus

571
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:43,770
tirado at the educational institution

572
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:46,530
because we had all public ipv4 addresses

573
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:48,150
there and the cable modem environment

574
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:50,160
presumably everyone's behind Nats and so

575
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:52,110
they were trying to use traído more

576
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:55,170
often which was a mechanism that you'd

577
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:56,399
find if you're stuck behind it now some

578
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:58,740
of these other graphs are showing just

579
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:01,550
the volume of queries we're getting for

580
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:04,800
our isatap names then there's some

581
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:08,010
volume of queries on the different TLDs

582
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:12,659
that we have these in happen to have

583
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:14,700
isatap and dot uk' and co uk and co uk

584
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:16,560
turns out there's quite a few ISTEP

585
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:18,720
queries being made out of there one of

586
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:23,570
the the busier tale these that we

587
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:23,570
actually had along with 100 Raziel

588
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:28,139
so we did some experiments because we

589
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:29,520
were seeing people trying to query our

590
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:32,310
names we could actually set up a tunnel

591
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:34,230
for them so for those for those outside

592
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:35,970
of our educational institution we didn't

593
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:39,390
actually complete the tunnel and allow

594
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:42,420
them to fully use our tunnel to relay

595
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:44,550
all their traffic we did feel that was

596
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:46,110
within our rights to really do that but

597
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:48,659
we didn't want to see what they tried to

598
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:51,030
do so what we ended up doing is we'd say

599
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:54,330
okay we'll let them bootstrap so do the

600
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:56,910
IP icmpv6 exchange to get the addressing

601
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:59,370
we'll give you an address and then

602
00:29:56,910 --> 00:30:02,310
windows does this network connectivity

603
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:04,530
test we make sure that works and then

604
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:05,520
they will then try to use our tunnel all

605
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:07,590
the time

606
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:09,210
and so for every connection attempt

607
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:10,620
they'll send us whether they're going to

608
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:12,600
Google or whether they're going to their

609
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:14,760
their banking website if it's got a v6

610
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:16,469
address they'll try to use our tunnel

611
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:18,390
but we'll drop everything else and

612
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:19,590
windows is very good if it doesn't

613
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:23,070
actually work through the tunnel it'll

614
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:25,110
just fall back to v4 really quickly so

615
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:28,080
we got at least to see the v4

616
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:29,399
destinations they were trying a protocol

617
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,409
maybe a port number but we didn't

618
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:33,090
actually see any data content and you

619
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:35,010
you know the TCP handshakes didn't

620
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:36,179
complete so we we got a minimal view of

621
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:37,560
what they were trying to do but we got

622
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:39,660
an idea of what they were trying to do

623
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:41,610
so these graphs show a little bit of

624
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:44,250
what we saw so Google and Facebook and

625
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:48,600
all the kind of usual stuff we we did

626
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:50,390
see I don't think yeah so this other

627
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:52,590
graph shows some port of some of the

628
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:55,620
applications and some of the usual stuff

629
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:57,419
you'd expect like HTTP traffic but as we

630
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:59,159
dug through it and while it wasn't a lot

631
00:30:57,420 --> 00:31:00,690
of volume we saw all kinds of stuff we

632
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:02,130
saw a lot of DNS traffic going through

633
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:04,620
the tunnel

634
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:06,300
we saw some SNMP stuff and some telnet

635
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:09,360
stuff a lot of stuff that would use

636
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:11,850
these tunnels appeared to be a lot of

637
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:13,080
servers that were set up and default

638
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:16,110
domains and they ended up using their

639
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:19,199
tunnel so we saw more or less anything

640
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:20,760
you might imagine on the authoritative

641
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,580
servers for the names that we had

642
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:26,340
registered and were set up to answer

643
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:27,360
queries for I set up eating us client

644
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:29,429
subnet on it

645
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,449
which was kind of neat to see I hadn't

646
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:32,010
really had a chance to play with that

647
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:34,650
before and so this is just an example of

648
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:35,710
kind of what we saw so that just three

649
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:38,980
examples the top one is

650
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:43,600
just a Google resolver or a Google

651
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:45,070
server giving us the slash 24 some other

652
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:49,408
resolver that was looking up on my staff

653
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:53,950
named the middle one was someone in a

654
00:31:49,409 --> 00:31:55,840
resolver in Brazil and it was behind

655
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:57,370
them was a v6 client actually looking up

656
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,899
a nice tab name not sure why the v6

657
00:31:57,370 --> 00:32:02,289
clients actually looked up a name but it

658
00:31:58,899 --> 00:32:06,939
was and then the last one we saw a lot

659
00:32:02,289 --> 00:32:09,460
of these slash 32 from China this may be

660
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:11,260
well known by some of you but it wasn't

661
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:14,350
obvious to me and I thought why would

662
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:17,500
why they give me a slash 32

663
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:19,500
ECS data and it looks like from what I

664
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:21,279
could tell because all the the Chinese

665
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:23,799
resolvers that were doing this they all

666
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:25,630
ended in dot one and so I think what was

667
00:32:23,799 --> 00:32:27,940
happening here is they're reporting

668
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:30,340
probably a default router gateway

669
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:32,679
address that's not actually the client

670
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:33,789
address it's my guess I'm not sure if

671
00:32:32,679 --> 00:32:35,710
that's actually true or not if anyone

672
00:32:33,789 --> 00:32:40,419
wants to comment I'd be happy to hear

673
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:43,090
what you think that is or if you know so

674
00:32:40,419 --> 00:32:45,070
lastly I hope I'm right around about the

675
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:48,789
time to conclude I only had 15 minutes

676
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:51,279
but these are the questions or the the

677
00:32:48,789 --> 00:32:55,690
thoughts that we had about some of this

678
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:57,370
activity basis on this work I've

679
00:32:55,690 --> 00:33:00,250
recently been doing some work with ICANN

680
00:32:57,370 --> 00:33:02,020
and this came up there and things like

681
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:03,370
the isatap names and other names that

682
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:05,740
Microsoft duties in the operating

683
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:09,039
systems they would also issue queries

684
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:11,529
for 6to4 dot i pv 6 Microsoft com to

685
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:14,289
locate the 6to4 gateway that also issue

686
00:33:11,529 --> 00:33:16,809
with Teredo ipv6 microsoft compton

687
00:33:14,289 --> 00:33:19,658
lookup traído gateways so these

688
00:33:16,809 --> 00:33:22,240
hard-coded names this kind of comes up

689
00:33:19,659 --> 00:33:24,370
again and again starting perhaps at

690
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:27,549
least as far back as Duane's W pad stuff

691
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:30,489
this seems to be like maybe a bad idea

692
00:33:27,549 --> 00:33:32,200
in the general case or many cases we

693
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:34,210
heard this again today about Canary

694
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:35,799
domains is that a good idea I don't know

695
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:37,179
if that's such a great idea maybe this

696
00:33:35,799 --> 00:33:45,490
might come back to haunt us again at

697
00:33:37,179 --> 00:33:47,230
some point the the other thing that the

698
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:48,910
paper that we wrote

699
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:53,410
one of the things that we were trying to

700
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:56,050
draw conclusions on was the coupling of

701
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:57,520
domain name systems and IP addresses the

702
00:33:56,050 --> 00:34:01,300
bootstrapping into the routing system

703
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:03,190
were or to or to bootstrap your layer 3

704
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:06,700
that might not be such a great idea

705
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:08,260
either I may be decoupling those two in

706
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:10,630
the future forever to do transition

707
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:11,980
mechanisms again all these transits

708
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:14,880
mechanisms seem to be falling out of

709
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:16,719
favor they're not completely abandoned

710
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:20,890
but that was one of the other lessons

711
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:22,449
that that we sort of drew there's lots

712
00:34:20,889 --> 00:34:24,069
of queries for all this stuff so if you

713
00:34:22,449 --> 00:34:26,770
haven't looked like for example when I

714
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:28,840
looked at the diddled data the most

715
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:31,360
popular isatap name that's looked up is

716
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:32,800
isatap dot home and the reason is that's

717
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:35,260
the most common one is because dot home

718
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:37,600
is just a common TLD but it also doesn't

719
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:40,570
resolve so resolvers try it over and

720
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:42,850
over again but what if they didn't what

721
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:44,470
if some of these T's get registered by

722
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:47,440
somebody I'm gonna go register right

723
00:34:44,469 --> 00:34:50,918
stepped on home I'll tell you that now

724
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:52,120
it's more data it's my experiments so

725
00:34:50,918 --> 00:34:53,949
I'll leave it with some of these

726
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:55,750
questions and thoughts and conclude and

727
00:34:53,949 --> 00:34:59,350
hopefully enough time for question

728
00:34:55,750 --> 00:35:02,890
answers if they're already any questions

729
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:05,009
or answers thank you John

730
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:05,009
any

731
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:16,430
an array Apple very interesting research

732
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:18,440
John I'm just wondering when did you

733
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:22,669
take your measurements and experiments

734
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:23,870
for um as I have the impression that the

735
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:26,180
problem is going away

736
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:28,549
Microsoft has disabled a tunnel adapters

737
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:33,770
and latest releases since about a year

738
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:35,990
by default people start to include six

739
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:40,310
to four and here we do prefixes in there

740
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:43,729
Boggan lists and when I I did some look

741
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:47,000
at recent statistics at a high profile

742
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:50,420
ipv6 mantich points and what we saw at

743
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:55,030
the time maybe a month ago was half a

744
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:58,850
percent six to four T we do less than

745
00:35:55,030 --> 00:36:00,500
0.1 and practically no isotope so I I

746
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:03,830
have to impression that's this problem

747
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:07,520
while existent it's going away

748
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:09,350
um so there's almost no v6 traffic that

749
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:12,259
uses any of this stuff six to four a

750
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:13,670
little bit yep almost nothing for

751
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:17,150
isotopic trade-off because those are

752
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:18,590
essentially dead however and I did see

753
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:19,970
evidence that's the measurements that we

754
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:22,160
took so I looked at the didle data from

755
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:24,709
2017 and 2018

756
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:26,480
I think the 2019 just wasn't ready right

757
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:28,490
at the time I did this I'm sure it's

758
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:31,870
ready by now about there was a drop in

759
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:34,250
the query volume a little bit from

760
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:35,870
2017-2018 so it was dropping just at

761
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:38,360
least from there

762
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:42,710
and some of the query volume we did this

763
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:44,060
study over probably nine to thirteen

764
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:45,620
months depending on what we were

765
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:47,509
actually looking at and the isatap query

766
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:50,029
volume is definitely slowly declining

767
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:52,460
largely at least we believe in part

768
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:54,230
because in the recent Windows 10 release

769
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:57,980
probably within the last couple years

770
00:36:54,230 --> 00:37:00,100
they did disable isatap completely or

771
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:01,940
there's still I think the last I looked

772
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:03,140
there's still all these other Windows

773
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:04,280
machines that haven't been updated that

774
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:06,470
still has the stuff so there's still

775
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:07,880
plenty of it out there now most of it

776
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:10,310
isn't used because it doesn't please

777
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:11,630
don't resolve to any address

778
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:12,710
same thing with six to four and when

779
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:14,600
those machines they don't resolve to an

780
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:17,780
address but they're there to be use

781
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:19,370
potentially still so if I add a name and

782
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:22,010
you happen to crew for that name and it

783
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:23,279
resolves then you will use it so there's

784
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:25,380
still the potential

785
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:27,290
and so that's part of the little

786
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:29,400
research I spend a lot of time

787
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:30,990
previously my PhD but still do is

788
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,670
finding these weird things under the rug

789
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:34,350
that just still sort of exist so this is

790
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:36,000
kind of just a little bit of a theme for

791
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:38,520
me finding these these cobwebs that

792
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:45,960
before forgotten about so I'm not that

793
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:46,320
it's just partying okay thank you all

794
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,540
right

795
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:50,550
Dwayne Russell's from Verisign yeah so

796
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:53,480
the similarities to the W pad stuff is

797
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:56,040
kind of spooky especially given that

798
00:37:53,480 --> 00:38:01,860
both of these ideas came out of

799
00:37:56,040 --> 00:38:03,390
Microsoft in the case of W pad you know

800
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:06,570
that was written up as an internet draft

801
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:09,600
and it never was standardized in RFC and

802
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:13,110
the draft was very vague about how you

803
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:14,880
stopped the domain name searching right

804
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:17,700
and so you get a lot of leaks that way

805
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:19,530
now I'm curious if isatap was the same

806
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:21,839
way I mean I assume my setup was a was a

807
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:24,330
proper RFC so was it just bad

808
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:26,550
specification or was it bugs or is it

809
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:28,860
domain search lists causing this

810
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:31,410
so isatap doesn't do that devolve search

811
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:33,690
like w pad does it's basically it'll use

812
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:35,370
your default domain that you're given

813
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:38,100
that you that your host is already ends

814
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:40,140
so it doesn't do any searching beyond

815
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:43,020
that so that's kind of good news I guess

816
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:45,029
so there is an RFC I'm not sure I would

817
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:47,580
initially classified as a bug I think

818
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:49,800
maybe again I I might suggest that the

819
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:51,660
general lesson of using what is

820
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:53,190
effectively a relative name collision

821
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:55,950
it's maybe just a bad idea in general

822
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:57,750
right yeah I think that is maybe a

823
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:59,700
lesson I don't necessarily would blame

824
00:38:57,750 --> 00:39:01,920
anyone for having designed it this way

825
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:04,410
necessarily at the time and by the way

826
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:06,240
yes this this particular piece is a

827
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:07,649
Microsoft thing that we saw that there's

828
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,270
some other stuff in this research that

829
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:11,010
we did that Microsoft had nothing to do

830
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:13,860
it that's a problem especially with 6to4

831
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:17,100
we can talk about later some other

832
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:18,120
vendors got a whack on the head a little

833
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:20,700
bit

834
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:23,990
Thanks

835
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:23,990
okay it looks like our things

836
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:29,449
[Applause]

837
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:37,310
you're very much John so this brings us

838
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:40,190
to the end of our standard presentations

839
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:43,009
for this afternoon and we'll be moving

840
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:45,050
towards the lightning talks but before

841
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:48,770
we get there I'd like to remind everyone

842
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:52,160
that if you would like to attend the

843
00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:54,230
social event this evening and haven't

844
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,920
yet registered registration is still

845
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:58,160
open

846
00:39:54,920 --> 00:40:02,200
so please do that as soon as possible

847
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:05,839
and with that I would like to welcome

848
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:08,540
Paul Hoffman for the first lightning

849
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:13,340
talk and he's going to talk about some

850
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:19,460
tools from the our sac caucus work

851
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:20,840
parties so for those who non didn't say

852
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:22,730
but all these lightning talks are five

853
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:25,820
minutes or less and I normally talk too

854
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:26,840
fast anyway so this should be okay so

855
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:30,320
for those of you who are not familiar

856
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:32,840
the our sac caucus is not our sac it is

857
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:35,240
a group of volunteers that our sac has

858
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:37,250
chosen to do additional work and such

859
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:39,560
like that I'm a member of the caucus I'm

860
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:40,700
not a member of our sac and so these two

861
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:43,220
tools that I'm talking about are things

862
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:48,649
I've done in the last year for the

863
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:50,509
caucus so the first one which is the

864
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:53,119
first tools reel the second one isn't

865
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:54,260
yet you'll see that so this tool a lot

866
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:56,660
of people say oh well how did these

867
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:58,070
resolvers work and and especially one of

868
00:40:56,660 --> 00:41:00,109
the things we've been hearing today is

869
00:40:58,070 --> 00:41:02,840
that different configurations in

870
00:41:00,109 --> 00:41:07,790
resolvers can do can cause resolvers two

871
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:09,830
very interesting things so the design

872
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:12,140
goal here was I was going to make a tool

873
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:14,210
that would allow a researcher to run

874
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:17,210
through for example all the open source

875
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:20,240
resolvers all the versions of bind and

876
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:23,210
unbound and such like that send queries

877
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:24,560
through them to you know control the

878
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:26,420
authoritative service just you know

879
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:29,779
pretty much to watch the peek house see

880
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:32,290
what see what's going on so I did that

881
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:34,270
as a testbed

882
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:36,640
the github is at the bottom there but

883
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:39,069
basically you are able to create your

884
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:41,680
own tests and so for example the reason

885
00:41:39,069 --> 00:41:45,009
that our sac had asked our sac caucus to

886
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:48,460
work on this was they wanted to see for

887
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:52,390
example how do resolvers do priming and

888
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:54,579
re priming so in order to do that of

889
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:57,790
course you don't we couldn't just send

890
00:41:54,579 --> 00:41:59,440
things out to the regular routes because

891
00:41:57,790 --> 00:42:02,950
we would have to wait two days for each

892
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:04,599
one for them to reprime so this testbed

893
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:07,689
has a whole bunch of VMs in and one of

894
00:42:04,599 --> 00:42:10,660
which are servers that are able to serve

895
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:13,089
the route but a fake route you know with

896
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:14,828
like a 60 second TTL and such like that

897
00:42:13,089 --> 00:42:17,020
so anyways the whole testbed is there

898
00:42:14,829 --> 00:42:18,700
everything runs under VirtualBox so if

899
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:22,299
you're interested in doing this kind of

900
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:23,890
research within about an hour of setting

901
00:42:22,299 --> 00:42:26,079
it up and there's full instructions and

902
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:27,970
such like that you should be able and

903
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:29,890
you know as long as you have VirtualBox

904
00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:35,230
and such you should be able to start

905
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:38,460
doing things pick your own open source

906
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:40,780
software and such like that what I did

907
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:43,480
tentatively is the open source software

908
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:45,940
that's in there is sort of the last Reb

909
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:49,089
of each major version so the last Rev of

910
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:51,099
nine of bind 9:10

911
00:42:49,089 --> 00:42:53,380
the last Revit bind 9/11 but you can put

912
00:42:51,099 --> 00:42:54,970
anything in there that you want so do if

913
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:59,890
that sounds interesting to you come and

914
00:42:54,970 --> 00:43:02,379
see me or go look at the github repo the

915
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:05,520
second project which hasn't been done

916
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:08,079
because our sac has not finished is

917
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:10,240
something the our sac caucus was working

918
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:12,339
on in the forum of metrics for root

919
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:14,558
servers and the reason why our sac

920
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:16,450
caucus was looking at this was our sac

921
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:20,460
itself published our SAC what's called

922
00:43:16,450 --> 00:43:24,279
our Saco 37 last year which basically

923
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:26,290
says we need to look at the root server

924
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:28,900
system who should be in it who shouldn't

925
00:43:26,290 --> 00:43:30,220
be in it such like that and one of the

926
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:37,180
things that might go with that are some

927
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:39,069
metrics so that our sac caucus has

928
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:40,750
almost finished or has finished their

929
00:43:39,069 --> 00:43:42,710
view but our sac hasn't finished a

930
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:46,100
metrics document

931
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:48,170
and so as we were as we were occurring

932
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:50,690
the metrics document I did a proof of

933
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:54,800
concept implementation for collecting

934
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:57,260
some of this data if our sack ends up

935
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:59,300
going forwards and saying yes we want an

936
00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:01,390
actual initial implementation I'll be

937
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:04,520
working on that so there's no github yet

938
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:06,440
but hopefully that happens and later in

939
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:07,700
the year and I will do the same thing it

940
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:09,710
will be all be on github

941
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:12,080
except I'll actually be developing it on

942
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:15,380
github so people can shoot arrows at me

943
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:18,140
during the development process and I'll

944
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:19,370
announce that on DNS operations and such

945
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:24,339
like that so the people will know about

946
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:24,339
that so that was it I think I lightning

947
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:34,670
thank you John is there time for

948
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:36,500
questions yes a lightning question Wes

949
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:38,600
her decor is I I will talk really fast

950
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:40,250
the our site caucus actually has a whole

951
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:42,410
bunch of tools and they all exist at

952
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:45,140
github Secaucus can I get you to push

953
00:44:42,410 --> 00:44:46,700
yours there too was that good we talked

954
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:48,470
about that once and you weren't sure so

955
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:50,419
yeah so I would imagine if nothing else

956
00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:51,890
we can push pointer to that okay yeah

957
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:54,950
how create everything yeah and and so

958
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:56,390
just if we saw another 30 seconds what

959
00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:58,009
Wes was saying is that there are other

960
00:44:56,390 --> 00:45:00,740
tools that people have created in the

961
00:44:58,010 --> 00:45:02,900
past and they're all on in one github

962
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:05,509
what do you call this organizations

963
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:15,830
group yes okay great

964
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:18,230
thanks thanks Paul and for our next

965
00:45:15,830 --> 00:45:19,970
lightning talk we have Schumann Huck who

966
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:23,860
is going to talk about DNS SEC

967
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:23,859
provisioning with third-party providers

968
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:33,760
okay thank you and so I'm a shoe man

969
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:36,670
Huck and I'm going to talk about this

970
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:39,610
topic I'm channeling Steve Crocker a bit

971
00:45:36,670 --> 00:45:41,950
who I'm going to say is spearheading

972
00:45:39,610 --> 00:45:43,570
this initiative with a number of

973
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:45,460
colleagues from the DNS industry

974
00:45:43,570 --> 00:45:48,870
including myself and what we're trying

975
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:52,300
to do is come up with some ways to

976
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:55,810
improve some aspects of the DNS SEC

977
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:58,090
provisioning ecosystem all right so two

978
00:45:55,810 --> 00:46:00,430
issues we're looking at the first one

979
00:45:58,090 --> 00:46:03,610
comes up pretty frequently actually and

980
00:46:00,430 --> 00:46:07,029
this is that when using a third-party

981
00:46:03,610 --> 00:46:09,060
DNS provider or operator that is signing

982
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:12,790
the zone for you there is no

983
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:15,670
well-defined friction-free path today to

984
00:46:12,790 --> 00:46:18,730
convey the DES record up all the way up

985
00:46:15,670 --> 00:46:22,540
to the registry now some cctlds are

986
00:46:18,730 --> 00:46:25,240
using mechanisms like RSC 80-78 which is

987
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:27,850
CDNs the DNS key but there doesn't seem

988
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:30,970
to be any indication yet of widespread

989
00:46:27,850 --> 00:46:33,400
adoption of this mechanism so we may

990
00:46:30,970 --> 00:46:36,220
need to come up with new methods to

991
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:38,500
augment the system and importantly I

992
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:42,640
want to state that we are trying to

993
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:45,700
accommodate solutions for most use cases

994
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:47,950
so ranging from the non-technical

995
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:50,830
registrar that may have very little clue

996
00:46:47,950 --> 00:46:54,129
about what DNS SEC actually is all the

997
00:46:50,830 --> 00:46:56,319
way to the sophisticated enterprise the

998
00:46:54,130 --> 00:46:59,200
second issue is a little bit newer and

999
00:46:56,320 --> 00:47:01,960
that is the situation where multiple

1000
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:04,330
distinct DNS operators are cooperatively

1001
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:06,400
serving the same zone signing and

1002
00:47:04,330 --> 00:47:08,620
serving the same zone data so the

1003
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:10,810
general scheme for doing this is already

1004
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:14,259
defined in a document multi signer DNS

1005
00:47:10,810 --> 00:47:16,060
SEC models but there's follow-up work

1006
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:18,700
that could be done and people are

1007
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:20,620
interested in so for example there is no

1008
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:23,529
well-defined protocol today for the

1009
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:26,049
providers today to directly communicate

1010
00:47:23,530 --> 00:47:29,350
and coordinate the key sharing and cross

1011
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:31,540
signing etc so this slide I'm

1012
00:47:29,350 --> 00:47:35,799
essentially going to gloss over we I'm

1013
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:37,960
just listing the the main actors and the

1014
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:39,160
functional roles that they play in the

1015
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:42,130
ecosystem today

1016
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:43,720
and who may be impacted and who may need

1017
00:47:42,130 --> 00:47:47,110
to be involved in some of the solutions

1018
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:50,649
that we come up with so regarding

1019
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:52,810
conveying a new DNS DSS record there are

1020
00:47:50,650 --> 00:47:54,970
a number of possibilities of course so

1021
00:47:52,810 --> 00:47:58,350
there's the pull model which is already

1022
00:47:54,970 --> 00:48:02,319
been defined in RFC 1878 but we think

1023
00:47:58,350 --> 00:48:06,100
there's work that could possibly be done

1024
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:09,490
to extend the push model and we want to

1025
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:12,160
figure out is there a way to involve the

1026
00:48:09,490 --> 00:48:15,040
DNS operator directly in this mechanism

1027
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:19,450
in a more meaningful and more automated

1028
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:23,850
way and some of the possible work that

1029
00:48:19,450 --> 00:48:27,220
could happen in this area is for example

1030
00:48:23,850 --> 00:48:31,890
formally designating the DNS operator in

1031
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:35,109
the RRR system the use of delegated

1032
00:48:31,890 --> 00:48:39,540
authorization schemes whereby the dns

1033
00:48:35,110 --> 00:48:42,700
operator can act on behalf of the

1034
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:44,650
registrant for performing some limited

1035
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:47,589
well defined scoped functions such as

1036
00:48:44,650 --> 00:48:51,460
des updates and things of that nature

1037
00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:53,680
so this diagram just talks about some of

1038
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:56,830
the possible models and which directions

1039
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:58,629
the workflow goes that we've thought

1040
00:48:56,830 --> 00:49:00,190
about there's more I don't have time to

1041
00:48:58,630 --> 00:49:02,740
talk about this right now but in the

1042
00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:05,080
appendix to this deck we sketch out some

1043
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:08,439
of the models in more detail and the

1044
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:13,000
cross signing part with multicenter DNS

1045
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:16,330
SEC today at least the D cross signing

1046
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:19,180
involves the registrant of the zone

1047
00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:20,980
owner in some kind of coordination

1048
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:23,859
activities sometimes it's done manually

1049
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:26,110
and what we're thinking of is extending

1050
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:27,940
the protocol so that the DNS providers

1051
00:49:26,110 --> 00:49:29,530
themselves can run a protocol between

1052
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:33,730
themselves that can coordinate some of

1053
00:49:29,530 --> 00:49:37,150
this stuff and so this is my last slide

1054
00:49:33,730 --> 00:49:38,530
I think we have a mailing list it's

1055
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:40,720
called the nsx provisioning action

1056
00:49:38,530 --> 00:49:43,780
Kirkham so if you'd like to join us you

1057
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:46,629
can email steve crocker at steve at you

1058
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:49,930
were calm we are looking for a few more

1059
00:49:46,630 --> 00:49:50,660
DNS providers and registrar's and even

1060
00:49:49,930 --> 00:49:54,680
registries actual

1061
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:57,440
and I want to give a brief advertisement

1062
00:49:54,680 --> 00:50:00,049
for a DNS SEC provisioning panel on this

1063
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:02,450
topic that will be convened at the

1064
00:50:00,049 --> 00:50:06,410
upcoming ICANN meeting in Cancun next

1065
00:50:02,450 --> 00:50:10,359
month and Steve I think is is convenient

1066
00:50:06,410 --> 00:50:13,009
is moderating that panel and lastly

1067
00:50:10,359 --> 00:50:14,930
there's a few people if you want to talk

1068
00:50:13,009 --> 00:50:16,789
to us here we're on site a few people

1069
00:50:14,930 --> 00:50:18,348
are already involved so I'm gonna name

1070
00:50:16,789 --> 00:50:20,150
them and if you could raise your hand

1071
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:22,369
and identify user poll ypres and I see

1072
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:24,859
and Gavin Brown is here somewhere where

1073
00:50:22,369 --> 00:50:27,319
is he all the way over there so you can

1074
00:50:24,859 --> 00:50:28,848
come up and talk to us and we can fill

1075
00:50:27,319 --> 00:50:31,220
you in and let us know how to

1076
00:50:28,849 --> 00:50:36,950
participate and do we have time for

1077
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:39,230
questions okay john reed Akamai is this

1078
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:41,000
how does this relate to the DNS off

1079
00:50:39,230 --> 00:50:43,250
draft is this an extension of that is

1080
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:45,740
this yeah I would say it's probably

1081
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:47,329
follow-on work for that so originally

1082
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:48,229
when we were developing that draft so

1083
00:50:47,329 --> 00:50:50,660
you're talking about the multicenter

1084
00:50:48,230 --> 00:50:54,019
right so we actually had a section in

1085
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:56,149
that talking about inter provider

1086
00:50:54,019 --> 00:50:58,519
handoff and developing some mechanisms

1087
00:50:56,150 --> 00:51:00,650
to kind of make this more automated and

1088
00:50:58,519 --> 00:51:03,769
smooth where the operator had an active

1089
00:51:00,650 --> 00:51:06,529
role in the end we decided to take that

1090
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:08,629
out out because it sounded like more

1091
00:51:06,529 --> 00:51:11,029
work than we needed to do to get this

1092
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:13,940
out of the door and so that may still

1093
00:51:11,029 --> 00:51:15,500
happen in a follow up draft but in the

1094
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:18,079
meantime I think it's important to at

1095
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:19,849
least convene the principal set of

1096
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:21,140
actors that can actually make a workable

1097
00:51:19,849 --> 00:51:23,630
solution in the space and get them

1098
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:25,129
talking and then figure out where there

1099
00:51:23,630 --> 00:51:27,140
are points of agreement how we can move

1100
00:51:25,130 --> 00:51:29,329
forward once we've determined that I

1101
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:31,430
think we can write a specification so

1102
00:51:29,329 --> 00:51:33,819
actual implementation in details yeah

1103
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:36,379
yeah that's right

1104
00:51:33,819 --> 00:51:38,390
Paul Obermann new start um just as a

1105
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:39,589
following with that part of why we're

1106
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:41,930
trying to get as many different

1107
00:51:39,589 --> 00:51:44,450
operators registries registrar's and the

1108
00:51:41,930 --> 00:51:46,788
rest is there are ICANN contracts other

1109
00:51:44,450 --> 00:51:48,410
contracts all sorts of other things

1110
00:51:46,789 --> 00:51:51,019
beyond the technology that have

1111
00:51:48,410 --> 00:51:53,000
complicated the issue so that's well

1112
00:51:51,019 --> 00:51:54,740
we're sort of taking offline in solving

1113
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,329
that problem outside the draft I think

1114
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:57,769
yeah yeah yeah that's a good point Paul

1115
00:51:56,329 --> 00:52:00,109
I mean you're totally right I mean this

1116
00:51:57,769 --> 00:52:01,970
is I mean some people often come up and

1117
00:52:00,109 --> 00:52:03,700
says why doesn't everyone deploy just

1118
00:52:01,970 --> 00:52:05,470
deploys EDS and CDNs keen will

1119
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:07,569
done with that but I mean really it's

1120
00:52:05,470 --> 00:52:09,578
not entirely a technical problem there

1121
00:52:07,570 --> 00:52:12,339
are business models and interests that

1122
00:52:09,579 --> 00:52:15,099
have to be accommodated and frankly we

1123
00:52:12,339 --> 00:52:17,440
need to understand and get those players

1124
00:52:15,099 --> 00:52:24,820
involved okay I think that's it for me

1125
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:28,150
thank you Thank You Simon

1126
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:30,490
our next speaker is Paul vixie and he's

1127
00:52:28,150 --> 00:52:33,730
going to talk about DNS operator

1128
00:52:30,490 --> 00:52:43,118
feedback on fujiwara sans draft about

1129
00:52:33,730 --> 00:52:45,300
avoiding fragmentation thank you very

1130
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:45,300
much

1131
00:52:45,329 --> 00:52:51,400
I've got three topics that I'm going to

1132
00:52:48,609 --> 00:52:53,650
jam into about six minutes which means

1133
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:55,630
I'm gonna do a poor job but I am gonna

1134
00:52:53,650 --> 00:52:57,430
be here through the social the rest of

1135
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:59,290
the night so I'm really trying to

1136
00:52:57,430 --> 00:53:00,430
preload with the schedule for all the

1137
00:52:59,290 --> 00:53:04,349
things that we should be talking about

1138
00:53:00,430 --> 00:53:07,960
once this thing ends so first

1139
00:53:04,349 --> 00:53:10,240
fujiwara sun decided that he would write

1140
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:13,480
a draft to try to describe what it is

1141
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:17,200
that the so called Flag Day will do in

1142
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:19,540
October you know and actually make it a

1143
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:21,220
change to the protocol or at least

1144
00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:23,980
changed the recommendations on how its

1145
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:26,049
operated he signed me on as a co-author

1146
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:29,260
because I sent him quite a quite a bit

1147
00:53:26,050 --> 00:53:31,750
of feedback really trying to incentivize

1148
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:33,730
all of you please read the draft it's

1149
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:35,950
gonna expire in March which means that

1150
00:53:33,730 --> 00:53:37,810
we're gonna be posting an update we'd

1151
00:53:35,950 --> 00:53:39,490
like to get it adopted we'd like to turn

1152
00:53:37,810 --> 00:53:41,710
it into what the community believes

1153
00:53:39,490 --> 00:53:43,509
should be done right now it probably

1154
00:53:41,710 --> 00:53:44,980
represents a little bit too strongly

1155
00:53:43,510 --> 00:53:48,490
what I think should be done or what

1156
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:51,640
fujiwara think should be done we did

1157
00:53:48,490 --> 00:53:54,308
however get some operator feedback from

1158
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:57,578
somebody who

1159
00:53:54,309 --> 00:54:02,499
is very abbreviated version of the

1160
00:53:57,579 --> 00:54:04,569
comment I find it amazing that somebody

1161
00:54:02,499 --> 00:54:06,189
knows that they're using DNS SEC they're

1162
00:54:04,569 --> 00:54:08,259
doing it on purpose and they can tell

1163
00:54:06,189 --> 00:54:11,739
when it's not working I think that's a

1164
00:54:08,259 --> 00:54:14,140
major milestone given that this is not

1165
00:54:11,739 --> 00:54:15,579
you know and one of the normal people

1166
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:17,439
who would be in this room because all of

1167
00:54:15,579 --> 00:54:19,689
you fit that qualification but you

1168
00:54:17,439 --> 00:54:23,589
there's some selection bias on getting

1169
00:54:19,689 --> 00:54:28,509
into this room I find it interesting

1170
00:54:23,589 --> 00:54:32,920
that this operator cares a lot about TCP

1171
00:54:28,509 --> 00:54:35,349
state and I think our answer on that has

1172
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:37,479
to be and I'm asking you for guidance on

1173
00:54:35,349 --> 00:54:40,089
this has to be you know we've been on

1174
00:54:37,479 --> 00:54:42,038
web service with a massive amount you

1175
00:54:40,089 --> 00:54:45,489
know gigabytes tens of gigabytes of

1176
00:54:42,039 --> 00:54:48,479
kernel memory for TCP state on the web

1177
00:54:45,489 --> 00:54:51,489
and it's not even all that expensive so

1178
00:54:48,479 --> 00:54:55,359
you probably need that anyway and right

1179
00:54:51,489 --> 00:54:57,759
now they are only allowing TCP on ipv6

1180
00:54:55,359 --> 00:54:59,619
and as they say that's working fine but

1181
00:54:57,759 --> 00:55:02,589
I can tell you they're not getting very

1182
00:54:59,619 --> 00:55:04,420
much ipv6 so the fraction that is TCP is

1183
00:55:02,589 --> 00:55:07,808
so small of course they wouldn't worry

1184
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:09,729
if v6 takes off they're gonna have to

1185
00:55:07,809 --> 00:55:11,829
turn it off they'll be turning off TCP

1186
00:55:09,729 --> 00:55:14,769
so they really don't want to do that the

1187
00:55:11,829 --> 00:55:16,779
other answer to give is well most of the

1188
00:55:14,769 --> 00:55:20,218
things that you're worrying about here

1189
00:55:16,779 --> 00:55:22,029
are things that you can avoid by not

1190
00:55:20,219 --> 00:55:23,499
implementing this particular

1191
00:55:22,029 --> 00:55:26,469
recommendation in other words you're an

1192
00:55:23,499 --> 00:55:28,988
authority server so just levy DNS buffer

1193
00:55:26,469 --> 00:55:33,279
size the way it is and they offered in

1194
00:55:28,989 --> 00:55:35,109
TCP and and do all those things however

1195
00:55:33,279 --> 00:55:37,359
what's clear from this is that the

1196
00:55:35,109 --> 00:55:39,549
messaging is weak and that we need at

1197
00:55:37,359 --> 00:55:41,439
least another page of text describing

1198
00:55:39,549 --> 00:55:45,059
use cases and describing various

1199
00:55:41,439 --> 00:55:49,149
operator roles for stub resolver x'

1200
00:55:45,059 --> 00:55:53,459
recursive resolver x' and authorities so

1201
00:55:49,150 --> 00:55:59,630
if you have can't be down to two already

1202
00:55:53,459 --> 00:56:04,580
sorry sorry all right moving on

1203
00:55:59,630 --> 00:56:07,730
we have been using 1,500 byte I am to

1204
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:10,850
use ever since the mid 80s when we got

1205
00:56:07,730 --> 00:56:14,020
10 megabit Ethernet and the number of

1206
00:56:10,850 --> 00:56:17,930
packets per second that we're seeing on

1207
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:21,590
even a 10 gigabit link little only 400

1208
00:56:17,930 --> 00:56:24,529
Gigabit link is insane because of that

1209
00:56:21,590 --> 00:56:27,170
maximum not changing so we used to get

1210
00:56:24,530 --> 00:56:29,090
about 14,000 packets per second on 10

1211
00:56:27,170 --> 00:56:32,810
mega Ethernet if they were minimum sized

1212
00:56:29,090 --> 00:56:36,200
back-to-back minimum spaced packets and

1213
00:56:32,810 --> 00:56:38,570
10 gig we're getting 14 million 900 gig

1214
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:41,839
we're gonna get 140 million that's a lot

1215
00:56:38,570 --> 00:56:44,480
of packets and I gotta say that where

1216
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:46,670
the bits per second scales with circuit

1217
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:48,560
density how smart how small can you make

1218
00:56:46,670 --> 00:56:51,020
your components and how closely can you

1219
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:53,060
put them to each other the packets per

1220
00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:55,850
second does not it scales with the power

1221
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:58,190
of the heat and the complexity which

1222
00:56:55,850 --> 00:57:00,500
means that we are inevitably going to

1223
00:56:58,190 --> 00:57:04,990
have to raise the MTU we're not going to

1224
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:10,160
get to 10 terabit or 40 terabit networks

1225
00:57:04,990 --> 00:57:12,470
with packets that won't fit in the in a

1226
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:14,839
single electron or something like that

1227
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:16,520
we're just gonna run out so this is

1228
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:20,570
inevitable we should probably have

1229
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:22,130
already been at around 64 K by now and

1230
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:23,900
you were all in a position to know how

1231
00:57:22,130 --> 00:57:29,450
hard that is because path MTU discovery

1232
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:32,720
doesn't work and we're gonna have to do

1233
00:57:29,450 --> 00:57:35,450
something and we should be doing it now

1234
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:37,430
because the underlying protocols don't

1235
00:57:35,450 --> 00:57:39,109
permit greater than 2 to the 16th and

1236
00:57:37,430 --> 00:57:41,330
we're gonna be changing those in our

1237
00:57:39,110 --> 00:57:44,210
lifetime is what I think I believe we're

1238
00:57:41,330 --> 00:57:48,650
gonna see multi megabyte packet sizes on

1239
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:50,240
networks 30 years from now and I realize

1240
00:57:48,650 --> 00:57:52,970
that's insane but that's where we're

1241
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:57,169
going that's you know the scale requires

1242
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:59,299
a certain on a compromise and I'm not

1243
00:57:57,170 --> 00:58:01,370
asking for path MTU discovery you just

1244
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:03,050
look at your own route it's got an MTU

1245
00:58:01,370 --> 00:58:04,940
if using your gateway route it's

1246
00:58:03,050 --> 00:58:07,880
probably gonna say 1500 but if you're

1247
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:09,999
using something in your LAN or your your

1248
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:14,439
your Metropolitan Network your

1249
00:58:09,999 --> 00:58:16,988
a company network it might be 64k and

1250
00:58:14,439 --> 00:58:18,368
that's that would be enough and we have

1251
00:58:16,989 --> 00:58:20,169
to look at that even though it's hard

1252
00:58:18,369 --> 00:58:23,349
and we don't get paid more for solving

1253
00:58:20,169 --> 00:58:26,888
that problem now let me talk to you

1254
00:58:23,349 --> 00:58:28,479
about this 12:32 thing a lot of folks

1255
00:58:26,889 --> 00:58:32,049
have said that

1256
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:36,218
12:32 is the v6 equivalent to 576 it's

1257
00:58:32,049 --> 00:58:39,129
not the way that we got 576 is to first

1258
00:58:36,219 --> 00:58:41,529
determine 68 which is 60 bytes of IP

1259
00:58:39,129 --> 00:58:45,729
header that's if all the options are

1260
00:58:41,529 --> 00:58:48,029
used h95 no it's Len 715 whatever it is

1261
00:58:45,729 --> 00:58:51,189
the maximum sized IP packet is 60

1262
00:58:48,029 --> 00:58:56,469
maximum the minimum sized IP payload is

1263
00:58:51,189 --> 00:58:58,598
an ICMP header which is 8 and so 68 is

1264
00:58:56,469 --> 00:59:02,769
the minimum size and that's the actual

1265
00:58:58,599 --> 00:59:05,889
IP version 4 and to you you could you

1266
00:59:02,769 --> 00:59:10,238
know potentially have to fragment a 576

1267
00:59:05,889 --> 00:59:11,709
byte IP packet into 68 bit chunks that

1268
00:59:10,239 --> 00:59:14,469
was what they were thinking and that's

1269
00:59:11,709 --> 00:59:17,919
what the spec still allows so then we

1270
00:59:14,469 --> 00:59:20,019
took that 68 added it to 512 as a nice

1271
00:59:17,919 --> 00:59:22,658
convenient G that's the size of the page

1272
00:59:20,019 --> 00:59:26,038
on my disk drive and said that is the

1273
00:59:22,659 --> 00:59:28,449
minimum reassembly capacity that you are

1274
00:59:26,039 --> 00:59:30,219
expecting the other end have if they

1275
00:59:28,449 --> 00:59:32,679
can't reassemble at least a packet of

1276
00:59:30,219 --> 00:59:34,539
576 they can't speak on the internet

1277
00:59:32,679 --> 00:59:37,539
that's what that and that means it's

1278
00:59:34,539 --> 00:59:41,019
very different from what 1280 and 12 32

1279
00:59:37,539 --> 00:59:44,159
I mean 1280 is the established minimum

1280
00:59:41,019 --> 00:59:47,888
MTU it is more like 68 than it is like

1281
00:59:44,159 --> 00:59:49,959
576 and it's a lot bigger than 68 but

1282
00:59:47,889 --> 00:59:51,759
it's still not as big as it could be so

1283
00:59:49,959 --> 00:59:54,368
right now we're having a big discussion

1284
00:59:51,759 --> 00:59:56,679
around what to do in October and whether

1285
00:59:54,369 --> 00:59:58,569
we should be just everybody defaulting

1286
00:59:56,679 --> 01:00:02,919
to 12 32 let me tell you why that's a

1287
00:59:58,569 --> 01:00:07,389
bad idea it doesn't leave any room for

1288
01:00:02,919 --> 01:00:11,019
IP version 6 extensions whereas the IP

1289
01:00:07,389 --> 01:00:13,089
number of 68 presumes all extensions are

1290
01:00:11,019 --> 01:00:16,689
present they're all possible options are

1291
01:00:13,089 --> 01:00:22,089
there this presumes none and it turns

1292
01:00:16,689 --> 01:00:23,180
out that the IP extensions are not all

1293
01:00:22,089 --> 01:00:28,400
that uncommon

1294
01:00:23,180 --> 01:00:30,290
and so whereas TCP knows it's available

1295
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:32,540
space because it's already built the IP

1296
01:00:30,290 --> 01:00:34,220
or ipv6 header and it's already built

1297
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:35,779
the TCP header and it already knows

1298
01:00:34,220 --> 01:00:38,029
everything it needs to know to know how

1299
01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:39,620
much is left and then it'll just pull a

1300
01:00:38,030 --> 01:00:41,210
certain amount out of the reliable

1301
01:00:39,620 --> 01:00:42,710
stream and make a segment out of it

1302
01:00:41,210 --> 01:00:44,510
that's because it's Colonel resident

1303
01:00:42,710 --> 01:00:47,150
we're not we're we're nameservers we

1304
01:00:44,510 --> 01:00:50,090
don't know how big the IP where IP six

1305
01:00:47,150 --> 01:00:52,160
header is gonna be and the quick people

1306
01:00:50,090 --> 01:00:54,530
are now pushing for I remember the UDP

1307
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:56,450
options as a possibility so eight may

1308
01:00:54,530 --> 01:00:58,810
not be a good assumption on the size of

1309
01:00:56,450 --> 01:01:03,770
a UDP header for very many more years

1310
01:00:58,810 --> 01:01:05,960
what that means is we have to guess how

1311
01:01:03,770 --> 01:01:09,710
many payload bytes we have and if we

1312
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:12,560
guess 12:32 then that is only going to

1313
01:01:09,710 --> 01:01:15,680
work if there are no extensions or if

1314
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:19,220
there are no actual MTU 1280 links

1315
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:21,830
between us and the destination so I want

1316
01:01:19,220 --> 01:01:25,669
to say that's those are bad assumptions

1317
01:01:21,830 --> 01:01:27,770
we actually the actual MTU is 1,500 that

1318
01:01:25,670 --> 01:01:30,350
is what you can fit and the way I know

1319
01:01:27,770 --> 01:01:32,240
that is because people sending 1200 and

1320
01:01:30,350 --> 01:01:34,759
32 byte packets never have a problem

1321
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:37,640
doing it and that would not be working

1322
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:39,980
in today's internet if the actual MTU

1323
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:42,379
weren't more like 1500 than it is like

1324
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:44,930
1280 it's time to be honest about that

1325
01:01:42,380 --> 01:01:48,530
and I think that what that means is that

1326
01:01:44,930 --> 01:01:49,879
we should leave some room for tunnels we

1327
01:01:48,530 --> 01:01:52,640
our packets are going to get

1328
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:54,530
encapsulated by somebody and leave some

1329
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:56,870
room for IP extension headers and that's

1330
01:01:54,530 --> 01:01:59,360
around a hundred so we need to assume

1331
01:01:56,870 --> 01:02:01,339
that it's about 1500 is what we really

1332
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:03,350
have and about a hundred is what we

1333
01:02:01,340 --> 01:02:06,590
really ought to leave on the table for

1334
01:02:03,350 --> 01:02:09,319
people above us in the stack or below

1335
01:02:06,590 --> 01:02:12,770
depending on how you account and so I'm

1336
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:15,020
currently recommending around 1400 this

1337
01:02:12,770 --> 01:02:17,420
matter is a discussion item in the

1338
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:20,210
fujiwara draft it will be discussed in

1339
01:02:17,420 --> 01:02:22,310
the DNS off working group if they decide

1340
01:02:20,210 --> 01:02:24,560
to adopt that draft and turn it into

1341
01:02:22,310 --> 01:02:26,210
what the community wants I am really

1342
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:30,590
trying to get you to talk to me about it

1343
01:02:26,210 --> 01:02:32,270
today and read the draft thank you thank

1344
01:02:30,590 --> 01:02:38,770
you Paul

1345
01:02:32,270 --> 01:02:38,770
[Applause]

1346
01:02:43,420 --> 01:02:48,130
thanks Paul our next speaker is Susanne

1347
01:02:46,750 --> 01:02:52,170
wolf and she's going to talk about

1348
01:02:48,130 --> 01:02:52,170
algorithm rollover in org

1349
01:02:54,210 --> 01:03:00,039
hi I'm Susanna I work for PIR and we're

1350
01:02:57,220 --> 01:03:02,529
the folks responsible for org as part of

1351
01:03:00,039 --> 01:03:07,000
our operational main maintenance of the

1352
01:03:02,529 --> 01:03:09,390
zone we manage the the dana sec signing

1353
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:11,740
parameters and it's time to revisit some

1354
01:03:09,390 --> 01:03:15,190
of those and one of the things we need

1355
01:03:11,740 --> 01:03:17,740
to do this year we hope is take a look

1356
01:03:15,190 --> 01:03:21,099
at the current signing parameters decide

1357
01:03:17,740 --> 01:03:25,019
whether we need some updates decide how

1358
01:03:21,099 --> 01:03:28,299
we want to evolve what we're doing and

1359
01:03:25,019 --> 01:03:31,240
since we are we are internet people

1360
01:03:28,299 --> 01:03:32,619
we're looking for ways both to benefit

1361
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:35,919
from the experience of others who have

1362
01:03:32,619 --> 01:03:37,900
done updates of DNA signing parameters

1363
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:40,000
for your zones and also we want to make

1364
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:43,710
sure that we are sharing as much of our

1365
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:43,710
experience as we can to benefit others

1366
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:51,519
so basic technical characteristics of

1367
01:03:49,509 --> 01:03:55,269
the zone ten million names one of the

1368
01:03:51,519 --> 01:03:59,919
larger TLDs first one signed in 2009

1369
01:03:55,269 --> 01:04:01,598
with sha-1 and and SEK three opt out our

1370
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:03,750
back-end registry services are supplied

1371
01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:07,089
by a filius have been since the

1372
01:04:03,750 --> 01:04:09,779
beginning they do the technical

1373
01:04:07,089 --> 01:04:11,950
operations including the DNS SEC signing

1374
01:04:09,779 --> 01:04:15,009
we're working together on planning an

1375
01:04:11,950 --> 01:04:17,230
execution we've done this before so you

1376
01:04:15,009 --> 01:04:21,369
know the bases are covered but we're

1377
01:04:17,230 --> 01:04:24,069
looking for additional insight we'd like

1378
01:04:21,369 --> 01:04:26,920
to do the role this year but we have no

1379
01:04:24,069 --> 01:04:29,019
urgency about it if that turns out not

1380
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:30,279
to be the right way to go about it if it

1381
01:04:29,019 --> 01:04:34,779
turns out we need to take longer we

1382
01:04:30,279 --> 01:04:36,250
won't we have some basic technical

1383
01:04:34,779 --> 01:04:39,220
decisions that again you know that were

1384
01:04:36,250 --> 01:04:42,220
last made in 2009 that we need to review

1385
01:04:39,220 --> 01:04:43,779
and revisit algorithm choice obviously

1386
01:04:42,220 --> 01:04:45,220
shall one is over there's been some

1387
01:04:43,779 --> 01:04:47,529
actually discussion on the mailing list

1388
01:04:45,220 --> 01:04:50,529
about yeah getting rid of shell one

1389
01:04:47,529 --> 01:04:52,380
we're doing that do we want do we want

1390
01:04:50,529 --> 01:04:56,570
to go without or the mate algorithm 13

1391
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:58,190
is ends x3 with opt-out still though

1392
01:04:56,570 --> 01:05:01,220
they got the best choice for what we

1393
01:04:58,190 --> 01:05:03,830
need there is somebody pointed out to me

1394
01:05:01,220 --> 01:05:07,850
yesterday an insect three dependency on

1395
01:05:03,830 --> 01:05:11,450
sha-1 but we have to decide how much

1396
01:05:07,850 --> 01:05:13,160
done walking actually matters to us is

1397
01:05:11,450 --> 01:05:16,819
there a chain a concern about so its

1398
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:19,700
size of the zone or signing time if we

1399
01:05:16,820 --> 01:05:21,170
if we lose opt-out so on just but these

1400
01:05:19,700 --> 01:05:23,689
are the basic sort of technical

1401
01:05:21,170 --> 01:05:28,040
parameters we are willing to revisit and

1402
01:05:23,690 --> 01:05:31,250
change if that improves the situation so

1403
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:33,770
what input are we looking for we want to

1404
01:05:31,250 --> 01:05:37,640
talk to Deanna's validator vendors and

1405
01:05:33,770 --> 01:05:39,170
operators to help us test and to help

1406
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:40,910
ensure that we have strong operational

1407
01:05:39,170 --> 01:05:43,790
contact during the key events of the

1408
01:05:40,910 --> 01:05:47,270
role so we know what's happening and if

1409
01:05:43,790 --> 01:05:49,400
there are there issues developing we are

1410
01:05:47,270 --> 01:05:52,700
interested in hearing from researchers

1411
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:54,950
who are who want to have data I want to

1412
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:58,089
measure what happens when a very large

1413
01:05:54,950 --> 01:06:01,370
zone changes some of these parameters

1414
01:05:58,090 --> 01:06:02,960
and we're looking for experience about

1415
01:06:01,370 --> 01:06:04,580
timelines you know again it would like

1416
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:05,900
to do this this year but if there turns

1417
01:06:04,580 --> 01:06:09,980
out there would be a reason why it needs

1418
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:11,450
to take longer we'll do that and we're

1419
01:06:09,980 --> 01:06:14,720
just looking for advice from others

1420
01:06:11,450 --> 01:06:15,799
experience how do we how do we make sure

1421
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:17,720
that we're providing the most

1422
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:18,640
transparency we can and our planning and

1423
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:21,379
our execution

1424
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:23,660
what should we plan to share what would

1425
01:06:21,380 --> 01:06:27,890
benefit others from our experience of

1426
01:06:23,660 --> 01:06:31,250
doing those you know where to find it

1427
01:06:27,890 --> 01:06:34,520
would be it's either me or Joe ably our

1428
01:06:31,250 --> 01:06:35,900
CTO and when I when Joe and I were

1429
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:37,460
talking about what this presentation

1430
01:06:35,900 --> 01:06:38,810
should be he's a bait look the message

1431
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:40,580
here is we want to do this the internet

1432
01:06:38,810 --> 01:06:43,130
way not from the basement of some ivory

1433
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:46,250
tower so we're looking for your input

1434
01:06:43,130 --> 01:06:52,120
and I think that's less than five

1435
01:06:46,250 --> 01:06:52,120
minutes great Thank You Suzanne

1436
01:06:52,640 --> 01:07:03,308
oh I allow one question or comment is

1437
01:07:01,670 --> 01:07:06,440
this close

1438
01:07:03,309 --> 01:07:10,010
this is always room that I see so

1439
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:13,970
obviously we have done a role two years

1440
01:07:10,010 --> 01:07:16,940
ago actually yeah I'm happy to tell

1441
01:07:13,970 --> 01:07:20,000
whatever we did and then I would be

1442
01:07:16,940 --> 01:07:24,079
really interested in what do you think

1443
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:27,349
of the changing insec because we do also

1444
01:07:24,079 --> 01:07:29,470
one dot and you and we doing it and we

1445
01:07:27,349 --> 01:07:31,670
do any and thick three mm-hmm and

1446
01:07:29,470 --> 01:07:35,299
everybody tells me oh if you want to do

1447
01:07:31,670 --> 01:07:38,359
n sake it's just changing but nobody has

1448
01:07:35,299 --> 01:07:40,130
ever done it yeah and that would be

1449
01:07:38,359 --> 01:07:41,750
really interesting because I mean we

1450
01:07:40,130 --> 01:07:45,079
publish our zones so we obviously don't

1451
01:07:41,750 --> 01:07:46,369
need and say three well and this is in

1452
01:07:45,079 --> 01:07:47,420
fact one of the things like I said this

1453
01:07:46,369 --> 01:07:48,109
is one of the things we have to revisit

1454
01:07:47,420 --> 01:07:50,240
yeah

1455
01:07:48,109 --> 01:07:56,328
do we just got Anzac but I have really

1456
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:57,950
no idea how to change and say wow we

1457
01:07:56,329 --> 01:07:59,839
should have some discussion and hear

1458
01:07:57,950 --> 01:08:01,848
from anybody who does have the direct

1459
01:07:59,839 --> 01:08:04,210
experience preferably without too many

1460
01:08:01,849 --> 01:08:04,210
scars

1461
01:08:06,819 --> 01:08:14,390
thank you very much Suzanne our next

1462
01:08:10,220 --> 01:08:19,809
speaker is Ed Lewis who is going to talk

1463
01:08:14,390 --> 01:08:19,809
about how

1464
01:08:24,729 --> 01:08:32,149
hello again so what I have here is a

1465
01:08:29,149 --> 01:08:33,769
talk fragment well one things I do quite

1466
01:08:32,149 --> 01:08:34,700
often as I look at observations of

1467
01:08:33,770 --> 01:08:36,140
what's going on in the Internet

1468
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:38,149
try different types of statistics a

1469
01:08:36,140 --> 01:08:39,680
gathering and different questions out

1470
01:08:38,149 --> 01:08:42,109
there in fact I have charts from two

1471
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:43,430
different talks in here but while

1472
01:08:42,109 --> 01:08:46,009
they're gonna focus here is something

1473
01:08:43,430 --> 01:08:49,420
called DNS houses and this the title

1474
01:08:46,010 --> 01:08:49,420
here is actually it's actually incorrect

1475
01:08:49,540 --> 01:08:56,390
so I'm not explaining in a second so the

1476
01:08:53,660 --> 01:08:58,880
idea here is that I do lots of different

1477
01:08:56,390 --> 01:09:00,110
work out there and when I take these

1478
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:02,569
observations I don't like to name names

1479
01:09:00,109 --> 01:09:03,769
I don't like to rank individual items

1480
01:09:02,569 --> 01:09:06,229
for one reason or another sometimes it's

1481
01:09:03,770 --> 01:09:09,380
misleading and something just comes off

1482
01:09:06,229 --> 01:09:11,059
wrong if you say who's doing what but I

1483
01:09:09,380 --> 01:09:12,470
want to still get some meaning out of

1484
01:09:11,060 --> 01:09:14,000
the internet what was what's going on

1485
01:09:12,470 --> 01:09:16,760
with the the packs what do you see out

1486
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:19,160
there and in particular I discovered

1487
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:22,190
that if you understand how the

1488
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:24,559
operations of the Internet are co-hosted

1489
01:09:22,189 --> 01:09:26,419
or co-located you can find out places

1490
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:28,490
where if like if one engineer makes a

1491
01:09:26,420 --> 01:09:31,550
decision and they run one zone you might

1492
01:09:28,490 --> 01:09:33,139
see one one thing go left to right but

1493
01:09:31,550 --> 01:09:35,029
if that same engineer is working for a

1494
01:09:33,140 --> 01:09:38,120
large organization one little tick might

1495
01:09:35,029 --> 01:09:40,040
influence 250 zones it doesn't make the

1496
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:41,510
second one any more impactful you really

1497
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:45,080
want to it was still one decision made

1498
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:45,980
by one person or one committee and you

1499
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:48,710
really want to get into this when you

1500
01:09:45,979 --> 01:09:50,299
start doing the analysis here so I come

1501
01:09:48,710 --> 01:09:53,029
up with this idea I call em DNS houses

1502
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:55,610
you look at all the TLD and if you look

1503
01:09:53,029 --> 01:09:58,610
at TL DS picture in this way a lot of

1504
01:09:55,610 --> 01:10:00,440
places T oldies might be managed but in

1505
01:09:58,610 --> 01:10:03,290
buckets I might have six of them might

1506
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:04,730
have 250 of them and they might be gTLDs

1507
01:10:03,290 --> 01:10:07,610
or cctlds

1508
01:10:04,730 --> 01:10:09,349
and I divide this way because the

1509
01:10:07,610 --> 01:10:12,799
policies for each are a little bit

1510
01:10:09,350 --> 01:10:15,890
different so how do you determine a

1511
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:18,020
house and this is this is how I think

1512
01:10:15,890 --> 01:10:19,790
about this one is you could go out and

1513
01:10:18,020 --> 01:10:21,530
ask all the operators you know you

1514
01:10:19,790 --> 01:10:23,000
operate this TLD what other ones do you

1515
01:10:21,530 --> 01:10:25,370
do now they may not want to answer that

1516
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:26,690
I don't like doing surveys they take

1517
01:10:25,370 --> 01:10:28,970
longer usually out-of-date pretty

1518
01:10:26,690 --> 01:10:30,110
quickly so I like trying to try to find

1519
01:10:28,970 --> 01:10:31,120
something that's more automatic out

1520
01:10:30,110 --> 01:10:33,110
there

1521
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:35,330
what then think one thing I've been

1522
01:10:33,110 --> 01:10:36,920
using is I use the are name in the SOA

1523
01:10:35,330 --> 01:10:37,229
record for those you don't know the es

1524
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:40,260
way

1525
01:10:37,229 --> 01:10:42,599
my heart we have the M name the master

1526
01:10:40,260 --> 01:10:44,070
server our name is responsible name for

1527
01:10:42,599 --> 01:10:47,489
that it's supposed to point to the RP

1528
01:10:44,070 --> 01:10:49,440
record and and and I mentioned this in

1529
01:10:47,489 --> 01:10:50,940
one at one of my meetings at first thing

1530
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:53,610
I heard well you can't trust the our

1531
01:10:50,940 --> 01:10:55,320
name is totally arbitrary it turns out

1532
01:10:53,610 --> 01:10:57,239
that when I do this in some cases

1533
01:10:55,320 --> 01:11:00,509
actually gives me some some useful

1534
01:10:57,239 --> 01:11:02,339
information and for the TLDs it seems

1535
01:11:00,510 --> 01:11:06,150
were pretty good and some of the in the

1536
01:11:02,340 --> 01:11:07,800
reverse map of dns also so I can also do

1537
01:11:06,150 --> 01:11:09,150
the NS set I tried that it's a little

1538
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:10,949
more bulky out there but that give you

1539
01:11:09,150 --> 01:11:12,719
some hints working with the IP address

1540
01:11:10,949 --> 01:11:13,829
there ways to figure out who's doing

1541
01:11:12,719 --> 01:11:16,019
what on the internet and you just try to

1542
01:11:13,829 --> 01:11:20,728
use that to find out what's what's the

1543
01:11:16,019 --> 01:11:22,260
structure of the Internet so so this is

1544
01:11:20,729 --> 01:11:23,940
from one talks I'm not giving this time

1545
01:11:22,260 --> 01:11:26,670
round and this is an example what comes

1546
01:11:23,940 --> 01:11:29,489
out of here I have this at the top 13

1547
01:11:26,670 --> 01:11:32,940
operators counting by DNS zone and I

1548
01:11:29,489 --> 01:11:34,739
don't know a mouse to point here I and

1549
01:11:32,940 --> 01:11:36,150
this is this is a sea of numbers I like

1550
01:11:34,739 --> 01:11:38,489
this stuff that's better than grass for

1551
01:11:36,150 --> 01:11:42,509
me number one is it is the number one

1552
01:11:38,489 --> 01:11:45,570
TLD operator out there whereas 241 GTL a

1553
01:11:42,510 --> 01:11:47,340
zones only gTLDs they went into there

1554
01:11:45,570 --> 01:11:48,808
they're invested that area but we're

1555
01:11:47,340 --> 01:11:51,900
having this other complex servers they

1556
01:11:48,809 --> 01:11:53,940
use for NS records the NS records for

1557
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:56,759
each of the NS set for each of their

1558
01:11:53,940 --> 01:11:59,098
zones identical these just for them and

1559
01:11:56,760 --> 01:12:01,260
they have eight addresses one v4 one v6

1560
01:11:59,099 --> 01:12:04,979
address and they have so many routes and

1561
01:12:01,260 --> 01:12:07,159
I was in a support of a row of coverage

1562
01:12:04,979 --> 01:12:09,690
tests and they have all of those

1563
01:12:07,159 --> 01:12:11,098
recovered by row I I'm not going to go

1564
01:12:09,690 --> 01:12:13,499
through all the lines here but the top

1565
01:12:11,099 --> 01:12:15,449
couple weren't interesting operators two

1566
01:12:13,499 --> 01:12:19,199
and three you can see they they have

1567
01:12:15,449 --> 01:12:20,489
cctlds and gTLDs they do both in this

1568
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:22,888
card gives you a starts giving a hint

1569
01:12:20,489 --> 01:12:25,169
that sometimes a ccTLD world the GTA

1570
01:12:22,889 --> 01:12:29,219
word are not completely separate they

1571
01:12:25,170 --> 01:12:32,099
they work together operate number five

1572
01:12:29,219 --> 01:12:35,219
is an AR AR this is actually not TLDs is

1573
01:12:32,099 --> 01:12:37,860
also the reverse map has 102 reverse map

1574
01:12:35,219 --> 01:12:41,219
zones that refers to delegations out of

1575
01:12:37,860 --> 01:12:42,690
ip6 ARPA or in at at ARPA and you can

1576
01:12:41,219 --> 01:12:45,059
see up and down the line that the number

1577
01:12:42,690 --> 01:12:46,678
of servers used a number of names they

1578
01:12:45,059 --> 01:12:48,689
vary gives you different idea what what

1579
01:12:46,679 --> 01:12:51,030
their policies are for operator number

1580
01:12:48,689 --> 01:12:52,860
three they usually use

1581
01:12:51,030 --> 01:12:55,349
and it's records per name server or

1582
01:12:52,860 --> 01:12:57,030
prepares own and if you multiply 6 times

1583
01:12:55,349 --> 01:13:01,020
the number of zones you get almost the

1584
01:12:57,030 --> 01:13:03,690
right number there 664 so much for

1585
01:13:01,020 --> 01:13:05,280
somebody salt by 2 but they have done

1586
01:13:03,690 --> 01:13:08,250
that everybody's the same sieves the

1587
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:10,800
same idea of 6 unique names for that

1588
01:13:08,250 --> 01:13:13,829
each zone they they're kind of vanity

1589
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:16,920
names the second chart here this is the

1590
01:13:13,829 --> 01:13:18,900
same chart but filtered so to speak for

1591
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:20,699
on the first chart I didn't see any CCT

1592
01:13:18,900 --> 01:13:23,159
I didn't see where my ccTLD so this one

1593
01:13:20,699 --> 01:13:25,980
shows all the top operators I'd have

1594
01:13:23,159 --> 01:13:27,449
ccTLDs more than two of them and you

1595
01:13:25,980 --> 01:13:29,250
notice that also knows the charts not

1596
01:13:27,449 --> 01:13:32,460
very long this is everything everyone

1597
01:13:29,250 --> 01:13:34,079
above two cctlds it's a the longtail

1598
01:13:32,460 --> 01:13:38,340
from there it goes pretty far out but we

1599
01:13:34,079 --> 01:13:42,179
have a lot of combining of authorities

1600
01:13:38,340 --> 01:13:43,619
and tested a few houses and to give you

1601
01:13:42,179 --> 01:13:46,110
an idea I've used this for another

1602
01:13:43,619 --> 01:13:48,570
purpose that was for for looking at our

1603
01:13:46,110 --> 01:13:50,098
PK coverage of routes this was from a

1604
01:13:48,570 --> 01:13:53,699
talk that was talked about DNS second

1605
01:13:50,099 --> 01:13:54,960
option in the ccTLD space and I did the

1606
01:13:53,699 --> 01:13:56,129
same thing here the numbers are a little

1607
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:57,420
bit different because different set of

1608
01:13:56,130 --> 01:13:59,280
data a different way I've added things

1609
01:13:57,420 --> 01:14:02,880
up but I have the operators down there

1610
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:04,619
the total teach TLDs and again see non

1611
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:07,199
ccTLD is way i call it that at that time

1612
01:14:04,619 --> 01:14:09,360
versus ccTLD what's interesting to me is

1613
01:14:07,199 --> 01:14:12,598
the last column it just shows in DNS SEC

1614
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:14,848
world was only one unsigned zone run by

1615
01:14:12,599 --> 01:14:18,179
any of these top TLD houses out there

1616
01:14:14,849 --> 01:14:23,159
which your main thing is we there's

1617
01:14:18,179 --> 01:14:26,219
about 200 or 150 or 200 TLD is not yet

1618
01:14:23,159 --> 01:14:28,259
signed of that hundred 50 our only one

1619
01:14:26,219 --> 01:14:29,699
is run by a large house that means all

1620
01:14:28,260 --> 01:14:31,710
the other ones are run by individual

1621
01:14:29,699 --> 01:14:32,879
houses which means for those who want to

1622
01:14:31,710 --> 01:14:34,590
go out and do deployment you've got a

1623
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:36,510
long a lot of walking to do from house

1624
01:14:34,590 --> 01:14:38,940
to house and that's kind of what this

1625
01:14:36,510 --> 01:14:40,320
kind of helps me focus is what efforts

1626
01:14:38,940 --> 01:14:44,789
need to push things through the rest of

1627
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:46,289
the system out there so I have a if you

1628
01:14:44,789 --> 01:14:47,940
if anyone has any comments about how to

1629
01:14:46,289 --> 01:14:49,170
divide some two houses I'm I'm

1630
01:14:47,940 --> 01:14:50,789
interested in that because I'm still

1631
01:14:49,170 --> 01:14:53,400
working on the day on the studies that

1632
01:14:50,789 --> 01:14:54,809
I'm using this in and also what you can

1633
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:56,070
find out from this is really interesting

1634
01:14:54,809 --> 01:14:58,020
and I like to talk to you about that if

1635
01:14:56,070 --> 01:14:59,840
they want to and hopefully at some point

1636
01:14:58,020 --> 01:15:02,610
I'll have enough to put into a real talk

1637
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:04,900
this is a lightning talk no offense it's

1638
01:15:02,610 --> 01:15:10,299
a longer talk about a particular

1639
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:11,860
topic somewhere so that thank said we

1640
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:20,050
don't really have any time for questions

1641
01:15:11,860 --> 01:15:23,049
or comments so we're gonna move on our

1642
01:15:20,050 --> 01:15:24,190
final speaker for this session is Brian

1643
01:15:23,050 --> 01:15:30,010
Dixon from GoDaddy

1644
01:15:24,190 --> 01:15:37,900
and he's gonna talk about d-o-t our

1645
01:15:30,010 --> 01:15:41,890
favorite topic okay hi so this is some

1646
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:44,469
stuff I've been working on not directly

1647
01:15:41,890 --> 01:15:48,610
in my day job role but with support of

1648
01:15:44,469 --> 01:15:51,400
GoDaddy I'm interested in finding out if

1649
01:15:48,610 --> 01:15:53,830
we want to actually have clients that

1650
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:56,650
learn and want to be able to do upgrade

1651
01:15:53,830 --> 01:16:00,400
to their regular resolvers but doing it

1652
01:15:56,650 --> 01:16:03,129
up to encrypted using do t what what's

1653
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:04,059
the real blocks and how can we do it so

1654
01:16:03,130 --> 01:16:05,469
that's what this is about

1655
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:08,500
there's two sets of presentation

1656
01:16:05,469 --> 01:16:10,840
materials one is the slides for me just

1657
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:13,929
jabbering very quickly the other is a

1658
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:15,520
much longer set of slides that are a

1659
01:16:13,929 --> 01:16:18,580
little bit better and there's also a

1660
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:22,320
proof of concept up on github that can

1661
01:16:18,580 --> 01:16:26,140
be downloaded and played around with so

1662
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:28,389
the the basic issue is there's a couple

1663
01:16:26,140 --> 01:16:31,330
of standards for client to resolve a

1664
01:16:28,390 --> 01:16:36,400
privacy they'll both use TLS there's doe

1665
01:16:31,330 --> 01:16:38,800
and dot don't 53 uses IP addresses not

1666
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:41,469
names so how can a client upgrade to

1667
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:43,659
dodge the objective here that I'm trying

1668
01:16:41,469 --> 01:16:45,790
to do come up with a solution for a

1669
01:16:43,659 --> 01:16:49,389
great to dot without selecting a

1670
01:16:45,790 --> 01:16:52,269
different resolver and the problems are

1671
01:16:49,390 --> 01:16:57,250
basically DNS resolvers don't require a

1672
01:16:52,270 --> 01:16:58,900
name Venis fqdn but for TLS a server

1673
01:16:57,250 --> 01:17:00,510
name is actually mandatory you can't use

1674
01:16:58,900 --> 01:17:03,670
an IP address you have to use a name

1675
01:17:00,510 --> 01:17:07,300
public CAS limit you have to be public

1676
01:17:03,670 --> 01:17:10,179
DNS names the signing the number of CAS

1677
01:17:07,300 --> 01:17:11,860
you need for validation as large the

1678
01:17:10,179 --> 01:17:15,040
signing process for signing a

1679
01:17:11,860 --> 01:17:17,769
certificate is complex the lifetime is

1680
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:20,019
an issue could be purchases

1681
01:17:17,770 --> 01:17:22,120
and then there's the validation of the

1682
01:17:20,020 --> 01:17:25,480
request being dumb on the CA so it

1683
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:28,170
pretty much rules out using CAS for that

1684
01:17:25,480 --> 01:17:33,160
simply because of these restrictions

1685
01:17:28,170 --> 01:17:36,630
some partial solution ideas deign TLS a4

1686
01:17:33,160 --> 01:17:39,849
certificates which lets you publish

1687
01:17:36,630 --> 01:17:43,330
fingerprints in DNS and that allows you

1688
01:17:39,850 --> 01:17:45,730
to do private CA usage or self-signed

1689
01:17:43,330 --> 01:17:48,460
certificates but it does require DNS SEC

1690
01:17:45,730 --> 01:17:50,860
and the question about where you can

1691
01:17:48,460 --> 01:17:55,420
publish this stuff ROI Erin's has a

1692
01:17:50,860 --> 01:17:57,730
great proposal on using ISO 33 61 - one

1693
01:17:55,420 --> 01:18:02,100
reserved to letter codes the one I'm

1694
01:17:57,730 --> 01:18:04,269
picking up on is Zed Zed or it's easy

1695
01:18:02,100 --> 01:18:06,460
forwarders complicate the whole thing

1696
01:18:04,270 --> 01:18:08,260
because if a client talks to a forwarder

1697
01:18:06,460 --> 01:18:09,760
and then the forwarder talks to the

1698
01:18:08,260 --> 01:18:13,090
resolver it's a client wants to learn

1699
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:14,350
about the resolver there's no direct

1700
01:18:13,090 --> 01:18:17,380
communication from the client to the

1701
01:18:14,350 --> 01:18:19,990
resolver you can't use e dns so the

1702
01:18:17,380 --> 01:18:21,610
result is you have to use in-band with

1703
01:18:19,990 --> 01:18:23,830
DNS queries and responses for that

1704
01:18:21,610 --> 01:18:26,620
communication that's actually not a

1705
01:18:23,830 --> 01:18:29,590
horrible thing if you publish

1706
01:18:26,620 --> 01:18:32,380
information in DNS on the same resolver

1707
01:18:29,590 --> 01:18:34,750
so the same resolver is publishing

1708
01:18:32,380 --> 01:18:36,760
information on itself about itself

1709
01:18:34,750 --> 01:18:39,040
now solves a client reach ability issue

1710
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:41,650
it's in band it's compatible with

1711
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:44,860
private use and the resolvers name is

1712
01:18:41,650 --> 01:18:47,049
the name of the DNS zone the reserved

1713
01:18:44,860 --> 01:18:49,150
space you can serve it authoritative

1714
01:18:47,050 --> 01:18:50,950
Leon the resolver and the only things

1715
01:18:49,150 --> 01:18:52,570
that can reach it or that are guaranteed

1716
01:18:50,950 --> 01:18:54,190
to be able to reach it are the resolver

1717
01:18:52,570 --> 01:18:57,490
clients that's actually a really

1718
01:18:54,190 --> 01:18:59,889
positive thing and you can do TLS a in

1719
01:18:57,490 --> 01:19:03,190
that signed with DNS SEC you still have

1720
01:18:59,890 --> 01:19:05,920
issues of trust anchors there is a

1721
01:19:03,190 --> 01:19:07,929
bootstrap aspect to it but the result

1722
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:09,610
would need to have two zones that it

1723
01:19:07,930 --> 01:19:11,710
would serve one is a well-known zone

1724
01:19:09,610 --> 01:19:13,929
which is necessary to bootstrap the

1725
01:19:11,710 --> 01:19:16,420
whole process and the second be a unique

1726
01:19:13,930 --> 01:19:17,770
name for the the resolver itself which

1727
01:19:16,420 --> 01:19:20,830
would be a unique name within that

1728
01:19:17,770 --> 01:19:23,380
private space I'm suggesting using

1729
01:19:20,830 --> 01:19:25,780
something that's got a lot of entropy 12

1730
01:19:23,380 --> 01:19:28,420
character name from base 32 hex gives

1731
01:19:25,780 --> 01:19:30,780
you about a trillion trillion names so

1732
01:19:28,420 --> 01:19:32,790
collisions are unlikely

1733
01:19:30,780 --> 01:19:36,210
hopefully significant but global unique

1734
01:19:32,790 --> 01:19:38,100
no collisions using the resolver name

1735
01:19:36,210 --> 01:19:40,260
DARPA and that's the suggested name that

1736
01:19:38,100 --> 01:19:42,660
I came up with would let you bootstrap

1737
01:19:40,260 --> 01:19:44,610
the whole process you would do a

1738
01:19:42,660 --> 01:19:47,670
bootstrap using the trust anchor for

1739
01:19:44,610 --> 01:19:49,620
resolver named DARPA do it once use that

1740
01:19:47,670 --> 01:19:51,750
to get the trust anchor for the unique

1741
01:19:49,620 --> 01:19:53,460
game once you have that then everything

1742
01:19:51,750 --> 01:19:57,000
else you can get it's gonna be DNS ex

1743
01:19:53,460 --> 01:19:58,470
signed gets you a TLS a record then you

1744
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:00,570
can get other information out of that

1745
01:19:58,470 --> 01:20:02,250
and effectively you have all the

1746
01:20:00,570 --> 01:20:05,670
information you need to validate the TLS

1747
01:20:02,250 --> 01:20:07,110
search the actually make the

1748
01:20:05,670 --> 01:20:10,110
communication you know you already know

1749
01:20:07,110 --> 01:20:13,110
the name of the resolver you're able to

1750
01:20:10,110 --> 01:20:15,809
get there and that gets you to DNS over

1751
01:20:13,110 --> 01:20:19,110
TLS to the resolver with or without a

1752
01:20:15,810 --> 01:20:21,150
forward or in the middle some additional

1753
01:20:19,110 --> 01:20:23,400
things this actually facilitates or is

1754
01:20:21,150 --> 01:20:25,349
compatible with would be using a private

1755
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:27,839
CA for a centrally managed certs and

1756
01:20:25,350 --> 01:20:30,720
centrally managed zones that usable in

1757
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:32,670
the case of a franchise or no CA but

1758
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:35,700
managed trust anchor so you have a

1759
01:20:32,670 --> 01:20:39,300
centralized trust anchor saw assigning

1760
01:20:35,700 --> 01:20:42,179
at tsk-tsk for all the resolver name

1761
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:44,540
DARPA instances that would let you do

1762
01:20:42,180 --> 01:20:47,370
head office branch office with

1763
01:20:44,540 --> 01:20:48,660
independent local operations within the

1764
01:20:47,370 --> 01:20:51,809
branch offices but you're still

1765
01:20:48,660 --> 01:20:53,070
controlling it centrally and then there

1766
01:20:51,810 --> 01:20:55,230
are some interesting things you can make

1767
01:20:53,070 --> 01:20:56,700
it more complex for handling forwarders

1768
01:20:55,230 --> 01:20:59,730
that upgrade that would otherwise blind

1769
01:20:56,700 --> 01:21:02,340
the the actual discovery using resolver

1770
01:20:59,730 --> 01:21:03,809
name DARPA and this goes into the

1771
01:21:02,340 --> 01:21:08,220
different issues that can show up in

1772
01:21:03,810 --> 01:21:10,170
that to do that you would add a server

1773
01:21:08,220 --> 01:21:12,750
function and some upstream information

1774
01:21:10,170 --> 01:21:15,330
for the forwarders and the

1775
01:21:12,750 --> 01:21:17,700
proof-of-concept that's up there now it

1776
01:21:15,330 --> 01:21:20,640
can be downloaded and used it uses

1777
01:21:17,700 --> 01:21:23,730
loopback address it's only builds a

1778
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:25,260
bunch of different instances and

1779
01:21:23,730 --> 01:21:28,919
launches them within a particular

1780
01:21:25,260 --> 01:21:33,860
proof-of-concept model and you can play

1781
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:37,070
with it questions comments I know it's

1782
01:21:33,860 --> 01:21:37,070
lightning but

1783
01:21:39,790 --> 01:21:45,010
Tom who's Atari I remember Martin

1784
01:21:41,860 --> 01:21:46,809
Thompson talking about this and that ITF

1785
01:21:45,010 --> 01:21:49,030
and he said there's no problem issuing

1786
01:21:46,810 --> 01:21:51,850
certificates for IP addresses and

1787
01:21:49,030 --> 01:21:53,500
there's actually quite a few not

1788
01:21:51,850 --> 01:21:57,180
everyone will issue them but there are

1789
01:21:53,500 --> 01:22:00,220
quite a few places they show up directly

1790
01:21:57,180 --> 01:22:02,110
understood but this bypasses that as

1791
01:22:00,220 --> 01:22:07,660
being an issue and provides other

1792
01:22:02,110 --> 01:22:10,120
benefits my pound set I I think if

1793
01:22:07,660 --> 01:22:12,930
you're trying to specify a globally

1794
01:22:10,120 --> 01:22:15,460
unique name in sort of a user defined

1795
01:22:12,930 --> 01:22:17,980
address space you're gonna run into

1796
01:22:15,460 --> 01:22:20,230
problems unless unless you're also

1797
01:22:17,980 --> 01:22:23,290
defining a registry somewhere no it's

1798
01:22:20,230 --> 01:22:25,570
just globally unique by accident yeah

1799
01:22:23,290 --> 01:22:28,330
the name space is so gigantic that if

1800
01:22:25,570 --> 01:22:30,219
you collide it's got to be by design

1801
01:22:28,330 --> 01:22:32,019
yeah by accident except that I think

1802
01:22:30,220 --> 01:22:33,400
what you're gonna find if people

1803
01:22:32,020 --> 01:22:34,510
actually start using this is that

1804
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:35,769
they're going to use natural language

1805
01:22:34,510 --> 01:22:37,840
names in there which are almost

1806
01:22:35,770 --> 01:22:40,480
certainly going to : no I'm specifying

1807
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:44,470
as part of the standard random has to be

1808
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:45,879
random yeah okay yeah I'm I'm not sure

1809
01:22:44,470 --> 01:22:48,810
how much people will stick to that just

1810
01:22:45,880 --> 01:22:51,460
because it's in the specification yeah

1811
01:22:48,810 --> 01:22:54,400
it can be explained to them you use

1812
01:22:51,460 --> 01:22:56,910
random or you run significant risk and I

1813
01:22:54,400 --> 01:23:00,190
also include stuff about don't reuse

1814
01:22:56,910 --> 01:23:07,320
names don't reuse keys don't reuse

1815
01:23:00,190 --> 01:23:13,349
anything great thank you very much Brian

1816

a reminder to fill in the survey because

1856
01:25:14,540 --> 01:25:21,650
that helps the OU art program committee

1857
01:25:19,119 --> 01:25:24,380
prepare a good program for you in the

1858

future and the feedback is always very

1859
01:25:24,380 --> 01:25:33,110
valuable then the next part workshop is

1860
01:25:29,869 --> 01:25:36,320
going to be held in Paris work 33 next

1861
01:25:33,110 --> 01:25:40,699
two ideas so please register for that

01:25:40,699 --> 01:25:47,570
this event in Paris so if anyone is

1864
01:25:43,929 --> 01:25:49,699
thinking about sponsorship please speak

1865
01:25:47,570 --> 01:25:53,090
to Dinesh or any one of the org staff

1866

01:26:00,660 --> 01:26:06,960
so that's my announcements done I'm now

1870
01:26:04,260 --> 01:26:09,080
going to hand over the mic to Suzanne

1871
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:17,280
who would like to say something about

1872
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:18,360
bill bill Manning this is lots harder

1873
01:26:17,280 --> 01:26:25,349
than getting up here and talking about

1874
01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:29,280
the NSA and I won't take too long here

1875
01:26:25,350 --> 01:26:32,700
but many of us here new bill Manning

1876
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:35,610
some of us for a very long time as a

1877
01:26:32,700 --> 01:26:39,559
friend and a colleague and he was very

1878
01:26:35,610 --> 01:26:42,990
much a part of the DNS and networking

1879
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:44,370
communities and I believe most people

1880
01:26:42,990 --> 01:26:48,300
have heard by now he passed a couple of

1881
01:26:44,370 --> 01:26:49,830
weeks ago and because he was a colleague

1882
01:26:48,300 --> 01:26:53,340
to so many of us because he was so much

1883
01:26:49,830 --> 01:26:55,290
a part of the communities that are here

1884
01:26:53,340 --> 01:26:58,350
for Ark and nano this week some of his

1885
01:26:55,290 --> 01:27:00,080
friends wanted to to have a little bit

1886
01:26:58,350 --> 01:27:03,870
of it you have an event just in a

1887
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:05,340
remembrance for him primarily thanks to

1888
01:27:03,870 --> 01:27:07,470
Louie Lee who actually did something

1889
01:27:05,340 --> 01:27:10,560
about this idea we've got a room

1890
01:27:07,470 --> 01:27:13,530
reserved tomorrow evening from 7:00 to

1891
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:19,620
9:00 at Perry's which is a bar a few few

1892
01:27:13,530 --> 01:27:22,400
steps away we'll be able to have you

1893
01:27:19,620 --> 01:27:25,010
know some some snacks some drinks and

1894
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:28,290
share some memories of a unique person

1895
01:27:25,010 --> 01:27:30,150
if you want to be there there's actually

1896
01:27:28,290 --> 01:27:32,640
an invitation page on Facebook that

1897
01:27:30,150 --> 01:27:33,780
Louise Lee put up or just see me and

1898
01:27:32,640 --> 01:27:36,210
I'll get you on the list

1899
01:27:33,780 --> 01:27:37,800
please do RSVP if you plan to be there

1900
01:27:36,210 --> 01:27:40,350
because you know we do have limited

1901
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:43,680
space the other thing is that so far

1902
01:27:40,350 --> 01:27:47,310
it's me and Louie handing credit cards

1903
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:49,650
to the to the bar so I you know we

1904
01:27:47,310 --> 01:27:54,600
appreciate any help but that's the

1905
01:27:49,650 --> 01:27:57,110
important thing is that show up share

1906
01:27:54,600 --> 01:28:00,110
some memories be there for our friend

1907
01:27:57,110 --> 01:28:00,110
thanks

1908
01:28:04,380 --> 01:28:13,179
[Applause]

1909
01:28:08,609 --> 01:28:14,559
all right so um first of all some thanks

1910
01:28:13,179 --> 01:28:16,389
out to everybody thanks to all of you

1911
01:28:14,559 --> 01:28:18,159
for attending this is what makes these

1912
01:28:16,389 --> 01:28:21,129
meetings worthwhile I'm seeing everybody

1913
01:28:18,159 --> 01:28:23,108
here the speakers who you know come with

1914
01:28:21,129 --> 01:28:25,989
their own volition and on their own dime

1915
01:28:23,109 --> 01:28:29,769
to share their knowledge with us

1916
01:28:25,989 --> 01:28:32,138
DC his usual did a great job we have the

1917
01:28:29,769 --> 01:28:33,699
volunteers and the full-time v NSO Ark

1918
01:28:32,139 --> 01:28:36,639
staff who I think have done a great job

1919
01:28:33,699 --> 01:28:38,619
with the conference and of course would

1920
01:28:36,639 --> 01:28:41,489
like to thank our sponsors a Verisign

1921
01:28:38,619 --> 01:28:44,039
it's basically and Comcast for the event

1922
01:28:41,489 --> 01:28:46,449
and the last thing before we head off

1923
01:28:44,039 --> 01:28:51,119
have a little something Dave Lawrence

1924
01:28:46,449 --> 01:28:51,119
would you pop one up here

1925
01:28:57,060 --> 01:29:02,730
so many of us have known Dave for a

1926
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:06,030
number of years more usually as tailed

1927
01:29:02,730 --> 01:29:08,370
than Dave but he has been an active

1928
01:29:06,030 --> 01:29:10,259
member in our community and had a couple

1929
01:29:08,370 --> 01:29:12,660
years with our board doing an awful lot

1930
01:29:10,260 --> 01:29:16,320
of work for work and so I'm in

1931
01:29:12,660 --> 01:29:24,900
recognition of that we are presenting

1932
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:27,349
him with a plaque and that completes

1933
01:29:24,900 --> 01:29:27,349
this

1934
01:29:28,970 --> 01:29:36,220
[Applause]
