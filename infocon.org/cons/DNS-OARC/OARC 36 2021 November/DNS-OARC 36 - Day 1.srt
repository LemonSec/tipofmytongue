00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,759
um importantly through

123
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,360
cooperation between operators and

124
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,080
researchers including data sharing um

125
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,880
generating useful tools and testers and

126
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,720
open source software that

127
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,560
is usable it's about relationship

128
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,680

and we've certainly had some excellent

173
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,400
content

174
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,319
um personal goal of mine which has taken

175
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,919
a while to achieve is we exceeded one

176
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,160
million revenue we haven't spent all as

177
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,680
well which is also good um up to a point

178
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,080
um and we completed our annual day in

179
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,919
the life of the internet data collection

180
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,240
um so that that data is now available to

181
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,159
our members and researchers

182
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,120
um on our systems front um the work is

183
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,799
never done but there's been significant

184
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,958
progress on cleaning up and automating

185
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,559
and so our infrastructure is more

186
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,839
scalable

187
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,519
um the other thing that matters systems

188
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,959
engineer has been working on and has

189
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,959
nearly completed is our new sf data

190
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:47,839
store

191
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,080
um the hardware and software already

192
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,000
it's a case of bringing it online and we

193
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,240
hope we will we'll complete that around

194
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,680
the end of the year

195
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,920
um many of you have already had um

196
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,800
contact with our our new membership

197
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,200
coordinator steve sullivan um steve is

198
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,360
is online and available to to take your

199
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,440
comments during the workshop and help

200
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,720
you out

201
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,600
um

202
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,120
there's been some interesting outages in

203
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,600
which the dns was um well blamed to some

204
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,440
extent which was perhaps not the same as

205
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,360
the extent to which he was responsible

206
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,880
but it's been great to see the community

207
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,959
come together during these outages and

208
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,480
use some of the platforms that we have

209
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,160
available to try and

210
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,720
mitigate and resolve these issues indeed

211
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,200
we have a talk about that later on

212
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,680
um jerry has been doing some um learning

213
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,880
sessions um the the dna dsc graffana

214
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,200
crash course how to make use of our

215
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,120
domain statistics collector open source

216
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,680
software together with rafana to present

217
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,640
telemetry from your dns platforms

218
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,399
um the next talk

219
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,000
is going to be about the progress that

220
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,959
the privacy community has made and

221
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,040
including a charter to better define

222
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,240
their mission

223
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,720
um and despite all the challenges that

224
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,560
the pandemic has brought to all aspects

225
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,320
of all life we have maintained

226
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,600
operational continuity

227
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,800
so i don't regard that as a small thing

228
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,200
um our technical resources are largely

229
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,120
unchanged um

230
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,200
the as i say the data store is very

231
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,360
nearly live our our core infrastructure

232
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,880
in fremont california has been having

233
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,120
humming along pretty nicely despite the

234
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,480
fact that we haven't been able to visit

235
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,560
it as often as we would like

236
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,160
um if you want to find more about the

237
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,839
various open source tools that we have

238
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,760
there you can look at that website we

239
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,560
run various dns testers

240
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,320
and we have a couple of secondary sites

241
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,480
in auto and stockholm provided by two of

242
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,360
our members um to um help diversify our

243
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,120
infrastructure and we've just done a

244
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,800
server upgrade and in stockholm

245
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,079
if you're interested in becoming a what

246
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:45,600
member and you're not already there are

247
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,040
a range of membership categories

248
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,240
depending on the size of your

249
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,320
organization there are a couple of entry

250
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,880
level categories which have additional

251
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,120
criteria other than just money for

252
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,079
joining

253
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,000
um steve will be very happy to talk to

254
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,480
you if you're interested in joining or

255
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,079
indeed upgrading if you're an existing

256
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,240
member

257
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,560
a little bit about how we operate work

258
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,680
um it's um i consider it best to breed

259
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,920
as far as this type of organization that

260
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,440
our space is concerned we are a

261
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,440
non-profit neutral membership

262
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,200
organization we have an independent

263
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,720
legal entity

264
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,000
um our diver member base is very diverse

265
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,040
we succeed in actually being non-profit

266
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,560
as opposed to

267
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,560
running on a deficit basis

268
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,959
um we're self-governed by the board

269
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,600
being elected by the members um our

270
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,360
staff are contracted

271
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,519
um and a lot of how we operate is

272
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,160
contributed by by volunteers and the

273
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,160
most notable committees being the the

274
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,079
programme committee that generates the

275
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,399
content for these workshops privacy

276
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,720
committee um and lots of other people

277
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,880
who help out as part of our crew

278
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,639
formally we have um

279
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,200
501 c 3 federal nonprofit status in the

280
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,920
u.s where we're incorporated

281
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,360
a month ago we had our annual general

282
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,399
meeting

283
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:01,920
i'm pleased to welcome two new board

284
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,160
members i'm sure they will be familiar

285
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,079
to many of you in the industry i'm ray

286
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,560
bellis from isc and joel damas from from

287
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,040
ap nick and the four existing board

288
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,240
members continue to serve

289
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,519
um staff um as i said one change there

290
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,079
i'm sorry to see sue graves go but we're

291
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:21,279
very welcome

292
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,519
to see steve join the team

293
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,040
um and we'd really like to hire some

294
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,200
more people um it's a challenging hiring

295
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,639
environment so we haven't succeeded in

296
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,720
doing that this year uh but ideally we

297
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,639
like another couple of engineers and an

298
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,040
an office administrator so if you're

299
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,880
interested in any of these positions or

300
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,480
know anybody or

301
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,480
would be willing to spread the word we'd

302
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,200
very much appreciate that

303
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,760
program committee um

304
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,040
one of the first things that the board

305
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,120
does once it's elected is to select the

306
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,560
following calendar your program

307
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,519
committee

308
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,000
i think that the 2021 program committee

309
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,519
has done an awesome job so i'm very

310
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,120
pleased to see that four of them will be

311
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,399
continuing

312
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,920
um two were term limited um so um we

313
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,240
have three new members i'd like to

314
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,800
welcome hazel smith um john todd from

315
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,279
court9 and suzanne wolf

316
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,360
one of these is still subject to

317
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,000
employer verification but um they will

318
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,839
be hitting the ground very shortly to

319
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,320
generate the program for the uh the next

320
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,519
workshop and for 2022.

321
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,320
um and i'd like to thank um

322
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,760
the various people who have made

323
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,760
considerable service to orc in

324
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,760
particular andre suri who served five

325
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,639
years on the board um and joe abele who

326
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,240
served one year in the board would have

327
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,000
served longer if circumstances had

328
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,040
permitted

329
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,519
um a special thank you to john bledchak

330
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,839
who served three years in the pc um and

331
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,240
the past year as its chair

332
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,079
jake zack has also served three years in

333
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,399
the pc and brett carr at this point we

334
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,079
would have a you know a nice round of

335
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:53,760
applause um

336
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,519
if this was a physical meeting it's not

337
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,040
resume isn't really very good for that

338
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,279
but i hope you will join me and um and

339
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,120
thanking them all for for what they've

340
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,560
done for a while and i hope we'll be

341
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,000
able to show that appreciation more

342
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,079
tangibly when we return to physical

343
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,560
meetings

344
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,079
so what are we doing in terms of

345
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,560
returning to physical meetings um well

346
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,079
this slide was done before thursday's

347
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:15,680
omicron news

348
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,480
so everything is is subject to you know

349
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,120
how how the pandemic unfolds but it

350
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,920
means our plan to um have a hybrid

351
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,120
workshop

352
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,560
um for

353
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,720
37 in february we realize a lot of

354
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,639
people will not be able to attend or not

355
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,720
feel safe attending so we will certainly

356
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,800
be supporting an online element that we

357
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,639
hope that we will be able to do a

358
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,959
physical element as well donation and i

359
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:40,399
are doing a site visit to austin next

360
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,160
week in which we will be gathering a lot

361
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,079
of information so that we can then be

362
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,079
very clear about what precautions we

363
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:47,920
will put in place what is feasible what

364
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,399
not what's not feasible if we can't do a

365
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,000
physical meeting then we will fall back

366
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,639
to an online one just like this one

367
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,240
but we should have

368
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,399
the call for presentation registration

369
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,160
and exactly what we'll be doing in terms

370
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,160
of pandemic precautions announced no

371
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,240
later than early january

372
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,560
um and then for later in the year we

373
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,800
hope to get back to co-locating um the

374
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,199
may workshop with the icann ids workshop

375
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:12,880
for 138

376
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,560
and um in the um in the autumn um or 39

377
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,920
co-located with right 85 and center tech

378
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,330
um

379
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:22,079
[Music]

380
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,720
so um why become a network member i hope

381
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,040
that the next couple of days content

382
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,320
will convince you that this is the

383
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,000
world's premier community of dns

384
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,560
technical experts um there's a chance if

385
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,959
you remember to influence what tools and

386
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,199
services we develop you have access to

387
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:38,959
our unique data set

388
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,759
um access to community coordination

389
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,240
resources when incidents happen

390
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,639
and um very much because the work is a

391
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,320
is a neutral party which is free of

392
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,959
vested interest in the dns space

393
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,360
um i won't batch on about it more but

394
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,720
just to share with you some of the

395
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,639
testimonials that we've had from members

396
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,639
recently about about how they find value

397
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,120
in the organization

398
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,800
and that is all i have to say for this

399
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,839
workshop

400
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,210

[Music]

00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,600
let's see sorry oh

456
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,360
yeah there we go

457
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,240
uh

458
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,039
so

459
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:20,400
the zenith privacy committee and our

460
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,720
survey we were running so

461
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,320
let's get

462
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,799
get some context here so

463
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,919
org so operations analysis and resource

464
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:30,960
center

465
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,360
actually encourages the the collection

466
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,280
of of data so and and the data is made

467
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,760
available to the researchers

468
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,880
for analysis and publication answer and

469
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,280
and by doing by enabling excuses by

470
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,520
enabling this research analysis it

471
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,919
contributes as as keith just mentioned

472
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,919
with the introduction of arc it really

473
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:54,240
contributes to the mission of

474
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,360
org

475
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,760
so it's important part of

476
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,559
our is the collection of data and making

477
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,880
this data available to researchers

478
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,200
and maybe unknown to most of the people

479
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,320
here

480
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,480
in the room in the virtual room is that

481
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,640
with a membership there's also a data

482
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,320
sharing agreement

483
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,960
it's it's an annex to the membership

484
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,880
and the organization signed for that and

485
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,120
that sets a number of requirements to

486
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,080
either contribute data or use data

487
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,360
for the researchers

488
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,559
and

489
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:27,760
currently

490
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,320
we are reviewing this

491
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,000
data sharing agreement

492
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,559
in the light of the well the european

493
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:35,919
gdpr

494
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,720
or the californian customer privacy act

495
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,440
so and with that with this review if

496
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,760
it's still all the legal uh

497
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,520
uh

498
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,720
sorry uh well it's it's within the legal

499
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,559
regulations sorry that how org

500
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:53,919
offers data

501
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,200
to its members to its uh to the users

502
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,799
it is also an opportunity to evaluate

503
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:01,760
how

504
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,080
the members are using the users are

505
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,960
using the data the data storage

506
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,880
is a room for improvement

507
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,840
how many people are using the data

508
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,360
is the flexibility etc etc so this is

509
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,600
kind of the context of the of this of

510
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,559
the

511
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,400
of our work as the privacy

512
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,240
committee

513
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,679
um so

514
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,880
to get this to to start this evaluation

515
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,360
we are running a survey so during the

516
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,640
agm last month we announced that we will

517
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,120
run a survey we shared the link

518
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,320
on a couple on two three

519
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,880
oak mailing lists

520
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,520
to ask the community to fill in

521
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,400
the survey and it's it it

522
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,320
consists of two parts one for the

523
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,440
contributing data so the organizations

524
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,039
contributing the data

525
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:56,000
and the second part individual users

526
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
using data for analysis

527
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,320
we did run that for two weeks until last

528
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,520
week

529
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,640
we got 16 responses

530
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,679
so five responses for contributing data

531
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,280
and 11

532
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,880
for data

533
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,520
while using data so we know that 21

534
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,760
organizations are contributing data for

535
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,799
our work

536
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:21,280
but we don't know how many

537
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,400
well users we have in the past using our

538
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,480
data so we don't know how large this

539
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,919
sample set is

540
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,799
so with all the results um we have a

541
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,679
relatively small sample set but it's a

542
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:35,280
good start and

543
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,360
i'm looking forward to a discussion with

544
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,600
you in the room and with the community

545
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,640
at large

546
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,280
so first going to the

547
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,320
organizations that do contribute data

548
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,159
so what are the concerns with the

549
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:51,760
current data sharing agreement

550
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,880
and also about atomizing data so the

551
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,200
privacy concerns so two out of five

552
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,440
organizations are modifying anonymizing

553
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,679
data the others are

554
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:05,120
contributing raw data to the data set

555
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,320
um

556
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,480
another question we had is what are the

557
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,240
what are your major concerns with the

558
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,480
current

559
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,400
data sharing agreement

560
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,480
and of course is the compliance with the

561
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,400
data protection that's that's important

562
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,320
that is the gdpr or the ccpa

563
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,440
but also

564
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,840
we didn't ask explicitly for that this

565
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,080
one has a concern with the future use of

566
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,080
data of cloud storage so that's

567
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,840
something we have to

568
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,039
discuss

569
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:35,200
in more detail here

570
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,679
so what are the blockers for these

571
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:39,520
organizations

572
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,000
looking into the future so what changes

573
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,919
do the current

574
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:45,679
data sharing agreement with the current

575
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:47,600
future contribution

576
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,960
and

577
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,960
again

578
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,799
there's some flexibility here so where

579
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:55,200
to store the data either on the orac or

580
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,520
on or excerpts on the cloud source would

581
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,640
improve

582
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,039
uh would be improvement to them but also

583
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:03,120
how the data is used because that's also

584
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,480
being considered

585
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,559
important not only contributing data but

586
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:09,360
you want to have you want to have users

587
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,679
that use this data your contribution and

588
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,480
this also mentioned is for example

589
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,640
anonymized data in the temporary in the

590
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,960
cloud for analysis and then is being

591
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,480
removed again

592
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,039
these are opportunities uh also for the

593
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,520
community

594
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,880
so

595
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,080
um

596
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,840
again he's it's called a limited

597
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,640
conclusion so

598
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,520
flexibility increased flexibility seems

599
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,280
to be useful for the data contributors

600
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,120
good so

601
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,880
organizations that do not contribute

602
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,880
so what are their concerns well of

603
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,240
course the gdpr the ccpa

604
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,760
compliance is important

605
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,039
but also and that's we have highlighted

606
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:58,960
it in blue so

607
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,760
the concern is future cloud of storage

608
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,000
so it's kind of a negative result so

609
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,799
none of them call that being blocker so

610
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,720
that's that's there's an opportunity in

611
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,320
that respect

612
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,120
um that's why we highlighted here

613
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,600
and also here what changes do the dsa

614
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,080
would cause future contribution l again

615
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,240
there's the flexibility here so where

616
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,279
can we

617
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:24,480
so how data can be used

618
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,240
temporarily in the cloud and anonymize

619
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,200
data so that users can use it from

620
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,840
different places

621
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,640
there's more detail in the in the raw

622
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,440
data in the in the survey we can publish

623
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,640
that later but

624
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,640
we skip that for time

625
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,120
for time considerations so again

626
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,600
the limited conclusion here is that

627
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,279
compliance data compliance issue but

628
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:48,640
flexibility

629
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,720
to increase data usage is very useful

630
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:57,200
good the people who the individuals

631
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,279
that access and use data for the

632
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:00,720
analysis

633
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,000
for the study

634
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,840
so

635
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,440
we asked the

636
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,080
the individuals the users so what kind

637
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,840
of data out of the data sets org has

638
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,480
they use and one of the most important

639
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,200
data sets is mostly used data sets is

640
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,400
digital it's a day in life of dns

641
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,240
it's far out the most important we also

642
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,000
ask how often

643
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,080
data is being used by the researchers

644
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,600
and that's

645
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,640
just 50 50 monthly or

646
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,279
one or two times a year

647
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:34,480
and also

648
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,600
quite often there so item three

649
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,159
data is derived from raw data and being

650
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:43,520
used in papers published and shared with

651
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,480
other

652
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,080
other researchers five that's item four

653
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,400
so it's important also for our research

654
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,679
community

655
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:54,480
the data sets

656
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:59,039
yeah okay this is already set

657
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,240
again

658
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,200
we ask also the users so

659
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,000
how easy is it to access data and use

660
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,320
the data for the analysis

661
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,480
and that's kind of evenly distributed

662
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,279
about

663
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,520
around average and uh there's certainly

664
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,039
room for improvement here that's that

665
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:16,640
might be clear

666
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,080
um also again we looked into what are

667
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,679
what are the specific

668
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:25,039
barriers blockers for for users

669
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,679
and the two one i want to highlight here

670
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:29,679
out of all of them is the limited

671
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:32,480
excesses or work only service

672
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,360
again and a limited resource to process

673
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,159
data it's also under our work service so

674
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:41,200
if people here not familiar with the

675
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,200
oarc

676
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,400
data sets

677
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,880
they are stored on the owx services and

678
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,120
can only be analyzed on our work service

679
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,840
that's part of the data sharing

680
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,200
agreement and only

681
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,640
derived data is allowed to move

682
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,120
after review by a board

683
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,159
to move from the work service to your

684
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,559
own server and being used in

685
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:07,039
scientific papers or research papers

686
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:08,720
so that seems to be

687
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,559
one of the two largest blockers limited

688
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:13,120
access and limited resources

689
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,320
so we call it nls analysis environment

690
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,880
is is highly constrained one of the

691
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,679
conclusions um how do

692
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:25,200
i time-wise john

693
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,520
you're good i think we have two minutes

694
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,520
before questions okay excellent i will

695
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:33,279
speed up a bit but i'm fine so

696
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:36,240
this is about anonymization i will go a

697
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,000
little bit faster here so full

698
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
anonymization seems to be a blocker for

699
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,159
the for the researchers but pseudo

700
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:45,679
ammunitization with some uh well with

701
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:48,640
some limits so it's the second bullet

702
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,600
point here only the 24

703
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,840
the slash 24 and

704
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,399
there's a one-to-one map with from real

705
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:57,360
to an

706
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,039
anonymous ip

707
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:02,159
the data set is still useful

708
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:03,760
so there's there's certainly room for

709
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,559
positive itemization and that it's still

710
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:09,039
a good data set for researchers

711
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:10,960
uh access

712
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,039
what are the blockers for individuals

713
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:16,080
that do not use

714
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,600
our data yet well again

715
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,000
access is difficult to arrange so the

716
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,480
flexibility to access and processing is

717
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,840
too slow so the limited

718
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,679
resource actually uh available uh to to

719
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:33,520
the researchers

720
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,279
so going to the coming to the key

721
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:36,960
conclusions here

722
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,080
again it's it's a small set for the data

723
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:43,039
the organization's contributing data

724
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:44,720
it's 5 out of

725
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,000
21.

726
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,600
um

727
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,840
so

728
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
well the the the conclusion can we said

729
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
well there is the data compliance is

730
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,080
issue but we're looking into that that's

731
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,000
one of the tasks of the data of the

732
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,960
privacy committee

733
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,799
and there's no strong objects in

734
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:05,279
providing more flexibility in storage

735
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:07,600
and access methods to the users so

736
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,240
that's good that gives us opportunities

737
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,279
and on the data access and usage

738
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:15,520
again it's a small set 11 out of we

739
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:19,039
don't know how large this set is

740
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:20,480
but

741
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,159
well the main thing is here that they

742
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:24,240
full they feel limited by the current

743
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,600
access model

744
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,039
and

745
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:29,600
providing more processing resources

746
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,880
would be good

747
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,679
and also describing the data better so

748
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:36,880
that the resource sorry researchers

749
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,720
know which data is available and how to

750
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,320
use that again well this this runs into

751
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,120
the

752
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,880
well our actions and

753
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,320
next steps

754
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,640
um of course we would like to have more

755
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,640
responses from the community

756
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,720
we can come back to that later

757
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,399
um

758
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:56,000
we will reach out to the 21

759
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,919
organizations contributing data so we

760
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:00,720
get more a complete

761
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,120
view of the organization's contributing

762
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,000
data

763
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,840
and in

764
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,840
in in discussion and dialogue with the

765
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,600
community

766
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,240
we want to create a data catalog

767
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,799
describing the data

768
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:17,919
and actively review ways to

769
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:20,399
ease well to lower the barrier to access

770
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:22,640
data analyze data and we also would

771
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,640
generate a report to this for discussion

772
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,720
it's a brief update but i hope we still

773
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,799
have some minutes for discussion and

774
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:32,960
questions

775
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,960
okay i will leave up this

776
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,679
for the audience maybe that triggers

777
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:39,039
some questions from the audience

778
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:41,600
otherwise i have some questions

779
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,200
thank you ben

780
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,399
awesome

781
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:45,200
so

782
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,399
please send in your questions by the q a

783
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:49,360
button

784
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,960
at the bottom of your

785
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,720
zoom window

786
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,520
i will read the questions for benno in

787
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,360
the meantime there should be paul

788
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,360
showing up on your screens where you can

789
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,120
write this presentation

790
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,039
and also if you want to ask your

791
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:04,880
question

792
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,039
in words without typing them please

793
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:09,039
raise your hand and i will allow you to

794
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:10,640
speak

795
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,640
so we don't have any questions

796
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,840
uh so far um

797
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,159
written and i'm checking if someone

798
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:20,640
wants to pass questions

799
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,000
so

800
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,120
so in the meantime i'm happy to hear any

801
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,120
experience from from one of the from the

802
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,039
researchers in the room

803
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:30,880
so in the audience

804
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,600
what went well what could be improved

805
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,200
and also think

806
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,519
well some of the researchers

807
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:39,200
can they share well

808
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,679
positive of good experience with other

809
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:43,919
external data sets so not their own data

810
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:45,600
sets but other external data sets they

811
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,120
have used for research research papers

812
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,519
so we can learn from that

813
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:53,440
and we as a community and privacy

814
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,679
company specifically yeah

815
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:58,880
okay so i see one question already

816
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,279
by rafale summers so

817
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:03,039
rafael you should be able to

818
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:04,720
ask your question

819
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,600
okay

820
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,320
uh so i've used actually indiana sort

821
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:12,000
data set in two occasions once i use the

822
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,640
zoom file for um

823
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,480
top-level domain another one zone file

824
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,960
for root data things that i found most

825
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,399
difficult to to use uh was due to the

826
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,480
fact that basically i cannot i need to

827
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,200
analyze all the data on the dns arc

828
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,559
server and limiting that it's not

829
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:33,120
the processing power like the

830
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,039
you know the the tool available on the

831
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:37,039
nsworks server but with more the fact

832
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:37,679
that

833
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:39,519
if i need to join the data with external

834
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:41,279
data sources

835
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:44,399
that then are under nda

836
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:46,320
i cannot basically bring that external

837
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,080
data sources to work

838
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,640
so i cannot join the data with arc data

839
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,480
and let's start to create a sort of

840
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,120
barrier so maybe a

841
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,919
result of mechanisms where you can grant

842
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:00,480
access to people that can process like

843
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,200
data you know like s3 packets or

844
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,120
something similar

845
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,799
that people can process packet from

846
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:09,039
external software but not downloading a

847
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:12,399
factory later that would be useful

848
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:13,440
okay

849
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,360
thank you thank you for your feedback

850
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,600
yeah

851
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:21,840
are there other people if we still have

852
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,760
time of course we have a label running

853
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,840
out of time probably

854
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,000
sharing you might have a minute uh one

855
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,279
more minute

856
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:32,640
i don't see any further questions and

857
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,480
yeah i also see that sarah doesn't want

858
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,399
to add any comment

859
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:38,320
so okay yeah let's conclude this

860
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,159
presentation thank you very much thank

you want to contribute or give feedback

866
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,440
on the data usage

867
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,519
would be very worthwhile and useful for

868
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:58,480
us thank you thank you all

869
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,720
thank you bernard

870
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,480
and with that i would like to

871
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,880
invite our next speaker who is rafael

872
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,880
somers from university of tuente with

873
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,560
his presentation

874
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,639
characterization of any cast adoption in

875
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,399
the dns authoritative

876
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:13,599
infrastructure

877
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:16,639
so rafael please share slides and i will

878
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,079
just give you a quick confirmation that

879
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:21,199
we can see it

880
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:23,199
i can see the slides

881
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:25,199
okay great and i can hear you okay

882
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,399
you're good to go

883
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:30,239
okay thanks uh so good morning everyone

884
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:33,280
i'm professor nisa third year phd

885
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,159
student at the university of trenton

886
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,480
and uh today basically i want to present

887
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,040
you this work that we uh published in a

888
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,040
tma conference this year it's basically

889
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,079
our transition of nes option the united

890
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:47,520
states

891
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,199
is our collaboration between us and

892
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:51,918
university of twente segen labs uh ucs

893
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:55,918
in ufc san diego and keda

894
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:58,640
let me start first a bit on the idea of

895
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,520
the dns so dns basically as most of you

896
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,440
knows was originally designed to

897
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,599
distribute the design of dns was

898
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:07,119
originally designed to distribute load

899
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:09,040
and responsibility among different

900
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,680
server and the way that the resilience

901
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,000
was archived in

902
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,839
dns was basically defined multiple

903
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:17,920
authoritative evidence through multiple

904
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,480
ns records to basically uh implement

905
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,720
these resilience mechanisms over time or

906
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,440
there

907
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,520
was another network layer microsoft

908
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,160
emerged that was

909
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:31,280
used the epm uh ip address for

910
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,280
geographical diverse server geography

911
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,040
levers instance and it's a

912
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,599
responsibility of the routing system to

913
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:38,880
route

914
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,960
the packet to the topologically closest

915
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,119
replica

916
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:44,960
in case of failure it's always

917
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,480
responsibility of the internet routing

918
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,040
process to read out the packets to the

919
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,800
other closest replica

920
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,680
um

921
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,760
what we see here is that compared to the

922
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,320
original way that basically uh dns

923
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,079
worked with a multipleness record the

924
00:35:58,079 --> 00:35:59,680
replica selection shifts or something

925
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,200
that was an explicit choice from the

926
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,560
resolver to something that is an

927
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,800
implicit choice of the routing system

928
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,560
bgp routing

929
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,000
so um

930
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,480
this mechanism over was adopted in

931
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,640
in

932
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,680
firstly for overcoming basically

933
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,160
limitation of 13 root servers in fact

934
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,240
angus was widely

935
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,720
deployed and adopted the amount server

936
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,800
but also in uh interplay domain not

937
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,240
really

938
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,680
uh in 2013 there was a study that found

939
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,560
that basically from that between 56 and

940
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,560
72 percent of top level domain of the

941
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,960
review server adopted amicus

942
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,040
the idea of this work is basically to

943
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,040
perform a new census of the this

944
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,520
adoption and also target second level

945
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,200
domain adoption

946
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,599
so uh the contribution that we give is

947
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:49,359
basically investigate the top-level

948
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:50,800
domain and second level don't mean any

949
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,359
gas adoption try to shed light basically

950
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:56,400
on the changes between 2017 and 2021 and

951
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,160
the reason why we used this today was

952
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,000
the date of the anika senses that we had

953
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,440
available

954
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,560
um

955
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,880
analyze the reason why we see a sort of

956
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,200
increase during the years of these

957
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,880
gas adoption and

958
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,960
compare this to any gas adoption across

959
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,359
different top-level domains and assess

960
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:15,280
basically indication of any gas adoption

961
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,359
for the other dns resilience risk

962
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:19,040
profiles

963
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,599
so the dataset that we use are the open

964
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:23,520
intel measurement data uh it's a large

965
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,359
scale measurement process project that

966
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:27,680
we run here at the university of puente

967
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,480
that contains 187 million responsive

968
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,359
domain across 153 top-level domain

969
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:34,960
period of

970
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,000
21. 2017-21 use the historical root zone

971
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,680
file from dns or

972
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,640
from 2017 to 2021

973
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,400
and we use one engage sensor that was

974
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,880
performed in 2017 with the eye green

975
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,040
software by

976
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,880
another chicago's senses that we

977
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,440
performed in 2021 with the similar

978
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,160
methodology uh with another software the

979
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,599
similar methodologies called manga

980
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:00,480
square and also ibd software

981
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,000
so

982
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,240
first result that we look was this i we

983
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,000
revisited this adoption of top level

984
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,160
domain given the critical role that they

985
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,480
played in dns here

986
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,480
the result that we obtained shows that

987
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,040
basically from 2013 there was a large

988
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,200
increase in terms of deployment in any

989
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,640
global domain authoritarian servers in

990
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:23,040
2017 95 of top-level domains were using

991
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,880
any gas in wool or in part that means

992
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,640
that part of the server could be any

993
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,800
gasoline part can be unicast

994
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,760
and this percentage in 2021 reached the

995
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,640
97 percent so almost all top level

996
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,720
domain author equipment server nowadays

997
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,280
are deployed on nfs infrastructure and

998
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,440
also we see that uh this increase is

999
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,920
mainly related to cctv so these that

1000
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,560
usually are smaller so many ccdl is

1001
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:50,079
moved from using unicast using any cast

1002
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:52,079
we also seen a clear expansion in terms

1003
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,079
of a number of replicas correcting so

1004
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:55,920
number of anycast sites that were

1005
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,760
deployed for uh for this algorithm

1006
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,320
um however we found also some bad

1007
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,440
results

1008
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,720
if we

1009
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,040
that way for example the dot key

1010
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,880
body a couple of domains which is for

1011
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,520
using uh fubianicus

1012
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,440
setup so instead of having old name

1013
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,040
server as

1014
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,119
anybody's name server they start to to

1015
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:18,800
include some name service universe name

1016
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,680
server and three cctlds that are

1017
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,079
the venezuela panama

1018
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:27,119
the democratic republic of congo

1019
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:30,320
which is basically from mix of anycast

1020
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,560
to unicast um

1021
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,359
the reason for venezuela and panama uh

1022
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:36,880
was released with the fact that they use

1023
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:37,920
a

1024
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,240
secondary authoritative server provided

1025
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,960
by ic the internet system consortium

1026
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,359
that was shut down on 31 uh january of

1027
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:48,000
2012 and this was the only anycast name

1028
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,079
server that they use

1029
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:51,280
um

1030
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,359
we also says basically the adoption of

1031
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:56,400
any casting in second level domain and

1032
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,800
we see that basically more than half of

1033
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,000
the

1034
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,599
responsive segment level domain that we

1035
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:04,720
see in uh in our data over intel dataset

1036
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,640
use any gas for the deployment of daily

1037
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,520
name server to compare to 2017 there was

1038
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,359
like an increase of eleven point seven

1039
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:13,359
percent so also in secondary domain the

1040
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:14,560
trend is

1041
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,800
uh increasing usage of any gas in the

1042
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,240
other infrastructure and uh um

1043
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,560
however what we see is also that only

1044
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:26,160
2.3 of name server are anycast and he

1045
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,240
suggested us a sort of a concentration

1046
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,880
towards some any gas provider we look to

1047
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,880
the fact if uh is energized blowing

1048
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,160
implies a sort of concentration

1049
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,240
concentration inside dns and we found

1050
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,839
that this new top 10 enemies

1051
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:41,200
organization in 2017 and 2021 were

1052
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,839
responsible for 92 percent of the domain

1053
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:45,440
adopting any gas

1054
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,520
and these four universes is not the same

1055
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,839
because for units just 60 percent of the

1056
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:52,160
top 10 responsible for the total number

1057
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,839
of unique deployments

1058
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:56,079
and if we look to the to this top 10

1059
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:58,480
basically of the nhs organization in

1060
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,200
2017 21 we see that good idea alone

1061
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,040
accounted for half of the domain

1062
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,359
adopting so that he was responsible for

1063
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:06,880
the domain in

1064
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,720
the global space of dns for adopting

1065
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:11,118
anyways

1066
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,839
the other question that we asked

1067
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:16,800
ourselves is that if domain owners

1068
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,240
if the truth of any has something that

1069
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,160
domain owners choose or it's something

1070
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,000
just that it's given by the fact that

1071
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
people register their domain names and

1072
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,319
use the the service provided by the the

1073
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:27,599
registrar

1074
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:29,760
and what we see it's basically that obh

1075
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,440
it's a popular european announcing

1076
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,440
provider offer anyways as an optional

1077
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,160
service you need to pay one euro 21 per

1078
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,040
year

1079
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,359
and nearly all second level domain using

1080
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:41,280
vh algorithm infrastructure again use

1081
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,520
unicast name server we measure four

1082
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,760
million domain using ovh unicast

1083
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,480
infrastructure for just 130

1084
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,079
uh thousand domain that we're using

1085
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:52,000
anyway so if people need to pay for any

1086
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,760
gas at the end they will not use it will

1087
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,480
not choose it that is optional service

1088
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,760
um

1089
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:00,880
we also look to the role of registrar in

1090
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,119
any gas adoption in particular comparing

1091
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:06,079
the case of sweden and netherlands

1092
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:07,839
uh we see that uh

1093
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:09,760
sweden netherlands are

1094
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,920
too similar cctlds

1095
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,160
however we see a great difference in

1096
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,800
terms of adoption of uh

1097
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,960
of any gases we know was really high and

1098
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,640
alone was pretty low

1099
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,400
and we looked to the to the reason and

1100
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,000
basically the reason was that the most

1101
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,720
popular registrar in uh is will

1102
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,960
see that sweden um

1103
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,160
it was lucky added as a adopted animus

1104
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,160
by default where uh

1105
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,800
transit that was the largest register

1106
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,960
of any guess so basically the rule of

1107
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,640
register plane from november or in the

1108
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,400
adoption especially when we lose a small

1109
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:46,240
market like one of ccdlis

1110
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,800
last thing that we try to assess

1111
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,119
basically is the implication of any gas

1112
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:54,160
adoption for the dns risk profiles

1113
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,200
so

1114
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,280
originally

1115
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,920
we dns basically when the name server

1116
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,599
fail uh it's the resolver it's

1117
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:03,680
responsibility on the resolver to check

1118
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,440
there is another name server available

1119
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,839
in instead with any as the resilience is

1120
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:09,839
not any more explicit inside dns but

1121
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:12,720
it's in routing system so any gas high

1122
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,880
with this mechanism of the selection of

1123
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,440
another replica from the client it's all

1124
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,960
in routing system

1125
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,040
imagine a situation where all dns

1126
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,040
entries for specific domain points would

1127
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:27,839
say might be or seems like 24

1128
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,640
so if a server or subnet will file will

1129
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,200
fail silently then basically everyone is

1130
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,480
routed to that

1131
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,880
advertiser is affecting the code or in

1132
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,880
case or attack for example

1133
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,880
there could be like

1134
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,240
a part of the world that completely

1135
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:49,200
cannot reach a specific animus distance

1136
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:52,240
we also look to the impact on of any gas

1137
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,240
on on diversity and we see that

1138
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,960
basically uh any gas deployments tend to

1139
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,119
use uh algorithmic server with any gas

1140
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:01,040
development that we use fewer address

1141
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,200
given that basically they provide

1142
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:06,400
uh redundancy via the routing system and

1143
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,240
usually also that any gastroparesis are

1144
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,800
concentrated with single asm so domain

1145
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,880
that use any gaston to trust for example

1146
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,560
a single company and provide the tender

1147
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:17,200
service and not multiple companies uh

1148
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:20,720
in using for example dns services

1149
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,640
uh or there is a good point that

1150
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:25,040
basically it's uh deployment tend to be

1151
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,880
usually more globally distributed so the

1152
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,560
number of countries where this server

1153
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,079
deployed are

1154
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:31,760
wider than for example in unicast

1155
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,520
deployments

1156
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:34,319
uh

1157
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:37,839
timekeeper you have five minutes left

1158
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:40,319
the things that basically we want to to

1159
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:43,119
stress for operator is trying to do not

1160
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:44,800
use any gas

1161
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,599
as a holy grail of resilience and what i

1162
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:49,680
mean with that we have this case of

1163
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,240
lubio lupia serve around 5000 domain

1164
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,880
names um

1165
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,040
and they serve it from a single slash

1166
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,599
24. so all these domains were routed

1167
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:02,800
from a single session before

1168
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,520
minimum prefix that you can announce on

1169
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:08,240
the global bgp routing system that means

1170
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,079
that it's minimum traffic that you can

1171
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:12,400
announce

1172
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:20,000
foreign this network will fail for some

1173
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:20,880
reason

1174
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,680
all the given that loopy realize uh as

1175
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,440
only resilience mechanism

1176
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:28,960
uniquely on any because all the uh

1177
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,480
basically all the server of blooper will

1178
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,960
be offline because the network will fail

1179
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,200
for example for a misconfiguration of

1180
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,359
the operators everything will uh will

1181
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:39,520
not work anymore because that's the the

1182
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,440
only resilient matrices that they put in

1183
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:42,319
place

1184
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:44,960
and uh the same somehow applies also to

1185
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,960
one on one uh

1186
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,560
was responsible for six point eight

1187
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:49,920
million domain

1188
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,680
and where we see basically that they are

1189
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,760
announced their anagas network from uh

1190
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,480
single routers 22 block and we see that

1191
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,560
this block was single routed from the

1192
00:45:58,560 --> 00:45:59,599
right

1193
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:00,560
piece

1194
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,880
announcement

1195
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,520
so basically to to conclude a bit this

1196
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,359
overview we found that basically there

1197
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:09,119
is a high adoption

1198
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:11,760
of any gas as a resilience mechanism and

1199
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,280
in this

1200
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,680
this option reached 97 of top level

1201
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:18,480
domain and 62 second level domain in

1202
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,160
2021

1203
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,160
uh however it is an option it's mostly

1204
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:23,200
uh

1205
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:26,480
done by uh mostly driver by engineering

1206
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:28,319
choice of very few large dns

1207
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:30,160
infrastructure providers so it's not the

1208
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,560
choice of the user but choice of dns

1209
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,160
providers that

1210
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:37,119
decide to adopt any gas and it's not

1211
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:39,599
something that users want to choose

1212
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:41,200
um

1213
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,359
also that we see that any as an option

1214
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:46,160
change the way that uh and dns can fail

1215
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:48,000
and sometimes

1216
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,359
make it worse because maybe the uh

1217
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:53,760
the failure of dns uh completely

1218
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:56,160
separate from yes original resilience

1219
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,359
mechanism

1220
00:46:57,359 --> 00:46:59,599
uh the future work that we want to to

1221
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:01,440
perform from here will be try to

1222
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,440
characterize the resilience of venice

1223
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:04,960
and universal mixed with development

1224
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,839
under attack and try to understand what

1225
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:10,240
is the implication for performance uh

1226
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,480
medics of enemies deployment such as for

1227
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:15,680
example the resolution agency for uh

1228
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:16,880
for the

1229
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:20,160
any gas deployment or unicast deployment

1230
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,520
and

1231
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:22,319
this

1232
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:24,240
basically concludes my talk and if you

1233
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,160
have any questions you are welcome to

1234
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:27,520
answer that

1235
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:28,640
one

1236
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,800
thank you rafael um

1237
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:31,920
thank you for very interesting

1238
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:36,240
presentation and yes um again um paul

1239
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,000
should show up on your screens where you

1240
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,640
can create a presentation and uh

1241
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:42,720
in the meantime you can also fill in the

1242
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:46,480
questions using the q a feature of zoom

1243
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,400
uh i don't see any

1244
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,240
questions flowing in

1245
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:53,119
if you want to ask questions um

1246
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:55,520
vocally please raise your hand

1247
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:59,359
there's a button for that as well

1248
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,400
so we have a first question here

1249
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,319
um

1250
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:10,160
how did you very uh it's a question by

1251
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,240
walter de vries how did you verify that

1252
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:15,200
the name server is anycasted

1253
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,800
uh okay we

1254
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:20,079
for 2017 we rely on any consensus that

1255
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:21,599
was performed at

1256
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:24,000
mythology that's high greedy i basically

1257
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,640
use the speed of life emulation by

1258
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,720
performing

1259
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:30,720
probes

1260
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,800
by performing basically icmp measurement

1261
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:35,040
with tripodless probes so the idea was

1262
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,440
that they try to ping

1263
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,520
um an address from different

1264
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,440
geographical location in the world if

1265
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:44,160
the run trip time for that progress

1266
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,480
violates the speed of light that means

1267
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,880
that that address should uh be it's any

1268
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:51,200
gas because it should have to instance

1269
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,920
in uh into different parts of the world

1270
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:57,520
and they publish a dataset in 2017 and

1271
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:59,599
we use that dataset for the

1272
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:02,400
2021 with the first

1273
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,160
uh analysis with the software that we

1274
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,920
love that's called domenica square

1275
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:08,240
basically relies on the idea of uh

1276
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,800
using any gas to measure any gas we send

1277
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,760
proof from any gas ips and we try to

1278
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,680
check if we see all multiple locations

1279
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:17,599
that it's an indication that the

1280
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:19,599
answering id is an animus and then we

1281
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:23,200
refine with same methodology of uh 2017.

1282
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:24,839
so it's basically mixed approach to

1283
00:49:24,839 --> 00:49:27,359
1021. but yeah it's a essentials

1284
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:31,200
basically on the entire uh

1285
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,440
ipv4 space

1286
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:36,720
that we publish on online

1287
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:40,079
and we join that with uh yes data

1288
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:42,319
okay thank you um

1289
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:44,160
and we have two more questions and then

1290
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:47,118
we will uh

1291
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:49,680
well we have two more questions and we

1292
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,760
will have to uh have to finish before we

1293
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:54,319
uh before we break so the first question

1294
00:49:54,319 --> 00:49:58,319
uh is asked by uh given mccoy

1295
00:49:58,319 --> 00:49:59,839
did you investigate any of the

1296
00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:02,400
limitations on use of any gas globally

1297
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,240
as a reason not to use it my

1298
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:05,599
understanding is there are some

1299
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:07,920
countries within which authorities do

1300
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,920
not allow advertisement of a global any

1301
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:13,200
casted ip range

1302
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,439
so

1303
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,720
yes i mean we

1304
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,079
we have seen

1305
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:23,040
that for example we have limited

1306
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,440
visibility in any gas deployment of

1307
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,839
specific country this was not actually

1308
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:29,760
literally so this work but worked before

1309
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,440
the one where we are basically assessed

1310
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,040
uh

1311
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:35,520
we did the census of any custom in

1312
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:37,440
global energy for space

1313
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,200
we have limited visibility work on some

1314
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,800
countries but that's more related to the

1315
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,119
fact that this country have uh different

1316
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:45,760
bgp connectivities the world

1317
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:47,280
different way that they're approached by

1318
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,119
going to the working team for example

1319
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:50,800
china

1320
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,720
and that's

1321
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:55,119
challenging to to address for some cases

1322
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:57,920
we basically don't impress that kind of

1323
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:01,440
we just accept that this limitation

1324
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,280
okay thank you

1325
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:08,240
and the last question uh is asked by

1326
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,559
if i mispronounce the name

1327
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:14,720
what are the risks associated with any

1328
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:17,359
gas eruption

1329
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,240
one of the risk it's a it's this one

1330
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:23,599
it's to trust only any caste i mean any

1331
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:25,680
guys per se it's a really good

1332
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,839
technology for the deployment for

1333
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:30,720
deploying uh resilient service

1334
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:33,040
it's that the traditional resilience

1335
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:35,040
mechanism of dns so deploying names are

1336
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:37,200
very different yes and blowing in server

1337
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,160
in

1338
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:39,440
different geographical elevation

1339
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,920
different ipv4 space

1340
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:44,480
should be keeping on running i mean

1341
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:46,880
they should not just rely we implement

1342
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:49,440
the data and that's it that's the

1343
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:50,960
message that

1344
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:53,359
we found

1345
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:56,160
okay thank you rafael uh thank you for

1346
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:57,760
further contribution

1347
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:59,520
and um

1348
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,920
with that we will take a short break uh

1349
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:04,559
we have 11 minutes i guess and we will

1350
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:08,480
start at 15 uh udc shark with our next

1351
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:10,240
presentation

1352
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:12,000
thank you

1353
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,480
welcome back everyone

1354
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,880
we are about to start um

1355
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,480
and in this

1356
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:19,680
session block we'll have three

1357
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:22,400
presentations uh and then

1358
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:25,359
the day one will be wrapped up by keith

1359
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:27,839
and our first speaker in the session is

1360
00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:29,599
casey dco from

1361
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:31,839
birmingham young

1362
00:52:31,839 --> 00:52:33,119
and

1363
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:34,640
his presentation

1364
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:36,480
is called

1365
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,240
advertising dns protocol used to

1366
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:40,480
mitigate ddos attacks

1367
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:43,200
so casey if you can share your screen i

1368
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,119
can see it

1369
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:46,240
all right you're seeing things and

1370
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:48,400
hearing me yes very well thank you

1371
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:51,280
you're good to go perfect all right

1372
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:53,599
well um as was said my name is casey

1373
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:55,200
decio um

1374
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:58,800
and this this research was done with

1375
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,559
one of my graduate students who recently

1376
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:02,559
graduated and is now working at sandia

1377
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:04,640
national laboratories and i'm currently

1378
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:07,680
working at brigham young university

1379
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:09,920
so um to set the stage for this this is

1380
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,000
just a brief recap of

1381
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,240
the rules and the dns we have two client

1382
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:15,599
server pairs

1383
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:17,920
of course we have typically the stub to

1384
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:20,079
the recursive resolver with the stub

1385
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:21,440
making queries there and then we have

1386
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:24,319
the recursive resolver contacting the

1387
00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:26,160
various authoritative servers to track

1388
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,559
down a given answer following referrals

1389
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:30,000
and so forth

1390
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,559
now typically as we know the dns runs

1391
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:34,319
over udp of course there are some

1392
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:35,680
standards in place which we'll talk

1393
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:37,520
about in just a minute

1394
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:39,680
but supporting udp continues to be

1395
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:41,520
something that for the foreseeable

1396
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:43,119
future

1397
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:44,880
and one of the problems with that is the

1398
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:48,240
lack of identity management um with udp

1399
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,960
alone and so we have uh

1400
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:54,480
for example an attack where um you would

1401
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:57,040
send something um we have two types of

1402
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,880
attacks in terms of identity and one of

1403
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:02,079
them is uh cash poisoning where um the

1404
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:03,839
victim doesn't know the

1405
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:05,599
an attacker impersonates the identity of

1406
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:07,599
the server and is able to trick a victim

1407
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:09,680
into putting something into its cache

1408
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:12,319
that is invalid um and on the other side

1409
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:13,760
of things we have

1410
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:14,960
um

1411
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:17,520
an attacker that is uh spoofing some

1412
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:20,079
spoofing a a packet claiming to be from

1413
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:22,240
the victim and making uh servers you

1414
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:24,160
know maybe thousands of servers uh

1415
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:26,319
return these unsolicited responses to

1416
00:54:26,319 --> 00:54:28,079
victims and overwhelming them and of

1417
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:29,760
course we know this is a denial of

1418
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:31,520
service beer reflection and

1419
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:33,280
amplification type attack so those are

1420
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:35,440
just two examples of where identity

1421
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:37,520
management really matters

1422
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:40,240
in the dns now we have some existing

1423
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:42,480
security protocols that help with that

1424
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,319
with the identity management

1425
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:46,559
so first of all in this first bullet we

1426
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:50,160
talk about dns over tcp

1427
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:51,760
and and i don't know that anyone's doing

1428
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:53,599
this in particular but there is the idea

1429
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:55,680
that what if you did just dns over tcp

1430
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:58,079
only okay um and and so that you could

1431
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:00,640
actually say uh hey we just want the

1432
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:02,400
identity management that goes along with

1433
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,480
this and so we're going to use tcp only

1434
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:06,880
uh dns cookies is sort of a lighter

1435
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:09,040
weight doing a way of doing identity

1436
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:10,559
identity management

1437
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:12,000
that allows the client and server to

1438
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,040
mutually

1439
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:16,240
authenticate um using cookies

1440
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:18,960
um using a a secret that only the other

1441
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,720
one knows effectively

1442
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:22,960
um we also familiar and becoming more

1443
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:25,440
familiar with dns over tls and dns over

1444
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,760
https which

1445
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:30,400
provide encryption as well as the

1446
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:33,119
identity management between the two

1447
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:36,799
the client server parties and then

1448
00:55:36,799 --> 00:55:39,119
we have dns sec which can help at least

1449
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:40,559
on the

1450
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:42,640
the cash poisoning model for origin

1451
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:44,559
authentication

1452
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:46,720
the problem is that none of these

1453
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:49,200
by themselves prevents a denial of

1454
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:52,079
service attack um in in the sense that

1455
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:56,079
if a dns server x receives a udp query

1456
00:55:56,079 --> 00:55:59,839
it's going to respond um to that source

1457
00:55:59,839 --> 00:56:02,880
um and and what we don't have right now

1458
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:04,960
uh because we have to support this quote

1459
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:08,000
unquote least secure option of udp um we

1460
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,400
don't know what the the victim should be

1461
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:13,440
supporting um in terms of like oh well

1462
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:15,040
you should have supported we know that

1463
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:16,640
you should have supported dns cookies so

1464
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:18,160
we're not actually going to return that

1465
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:20,799
right now we have to assume um that that

1466
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:23,520
it didn't um and and that

1467
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:25,760
we return things over this least secure

1468
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:29,119
option if queried from from udp

1469
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:30,559
so we're going to introduce something

1470
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:32,799
here to help with enforcement of some of

1471
00:56:32,799 --> 00:56:34,640
these secure protocols and we focus on

1472
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:37,119
dns cookies as our primary use case but

1473
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:39,440
really could apply to any one of these

1474
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:42,240
and so um we call this the dns protocol

1475
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:45,599
advertisement records or dpar

1476
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:48,480
and the goal is to cut protect the

1477
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:52,400
clients the would-be victims

1478
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,880
in in sort of a two-step process

1479
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:57,200
so they sort of have to upgrade the

1480
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:58,640
protocol that they use and then they

1481
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:00,799
create an advertisement record

1482
00:57:00,799 --> 00:57:02,880
and i guess the third step is for a

1483
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:05,280
server to actually check that

1484
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:07,119
so it might be dns cookies it might be

1485
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:08,400
tcp

1486
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,960
and again the goal is to help

1487
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:13,520
the identity management in terms of a

1488
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:15,440
would-be

1489
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:17,680
ddos via reflection

1490
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:19,520
so let's talk a little bit about

1491
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:20,799
how that works

1492
00:57:20,799 --> 00:57:21,520
so

1493
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:24,640
our initial idea for specification comes

1494
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:28,960
in posting policies in the reverse dns

1495
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:32,079
and so we have for example in the ipv4

1496
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:35,760
world um we have the on the the right an

1497
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:37,200
example of what the tree might look like

1498
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,520
where we have arpa and in adder and then

1499
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:41,599
working our way downward uh in the ten

1500
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:44,799
dot tree um and so you might say hey at

1501
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:45,599
um

1502
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:48,319
in our excuse me four dot ten dot in

1503
00:57:48,319 --> 00:57:50,799
honor to arpa uh we would throw in a d

1504
00:57:50,799 --> 00:57:53,520
par record there um and we'll explain to

1505
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:54,720
you what this means here in just a

1506
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:56,079
minute but there's a way to basically

1507
00:57:56,079 --> 00:57:59,040
say hey um at the slash 16 level for

1508
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:02,480
ipv4 and with uh possible optional

1509
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:05,520
delegation you entered this policy uh at

1510
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:08,559
this location and there are with our

1511
00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:11,359
specification this initial draft um we

1512
00:58:11,359 --> 00:58:13,359
would put in um

1513
00:58:13,359 --> 00:58:15,920
uh udp acts as the default where that's

1514
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:18,319
sort of the lowest uh bar of entry and

1515
00:58:18,319 --> 00:58:19,839
it basically means hey things are

1516
00:58:19,839 --> 00:58:21,599
exactly the way they are we don't have

1517
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:24,160
any more secure options

1518
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:26,079
none is actually a special option which

1519
00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:27,280
means that

1520
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:29,359
if you receive a query from this given

1521
00:58:29,359 --> 00:58:30,400
subnet

1522
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,880
this this prefix space

1523
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:34,240
then you can say hey wait a minute there

1524
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:36,559
wasn't supposed to be any dns uh

1525
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:38,480
requests coming from this given location

1526
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:40,799
and it says so right here in the dns so

1527
00:58:40,799 --> 00:58:43,200
therefore we shouldn't put uh we

1528
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:45,440
shouldn't answer any of these queries um

1529
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:46,960
the other options that aren't shown here

1530
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:47,760
are

1531
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:50,079
tcp if you wanted to specify that you

1532
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:52,079
should be receiving things from tcp only

1533
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:54,559
if they come from a given address space

1534
00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:55,680
or

1535
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:58,000
a cookie which means that

1536
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,680
you should receive

1537
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:01,440
things over

1538
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:02,880
you should be expecting cookies in your

1539
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:05,440
udp packets okay and again i mentioned

1540
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:07,200
that you would have these at a slash 16

1541
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:09,760
and a slash 24 rather than guessing any

1542
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:11,040
given level

1543
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:12,400
especially that's especially important

1544
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:15,040
for the ipv6 world we have those at two

1545
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:16,880
different locations the slash 40 and the

1546
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:19,119
slash 48 rather than going down the

1547
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:21,040
different nibbles

1548
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:22,720
and we'll talk about the reasons behind

1549
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:24,799
those in just a minute so the idea

1550
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:28,079
behind it then is is this okay so you uh

1551
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:30,640
for a given server it has an incoming

1552
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:33,119
query and and you check the client

1553
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:35,520
associated with that incoming query

1554
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:37,520
okay and if you have something in your

1555
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:40,240
cache um for that record then you'll

1556
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:42,880
apply that um policy that's associated

1557
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:45,200
with that record that you have um

1558
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,680
you'll you'll cue the query and we

1559
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:49,119
actually have a provision in there that

1560
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:52,480
says hey answer so many queries um while

1561
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:55,760
the lookup of this policy is pending um

1562
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:57,599
but if there turns out if it turns out

1563
00:59:57,599 --> 01:00:00,400
there is no policy for a given

1564
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,000
prefix for which this client is

1565
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,480
associated then yields a default policy

1566
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:06,640
which is basically the same as it is now

1567
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:09,440
that as we accept from anyone

1568
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:11,200
so the question is

1569
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:13,680
if the query does conform to composite

1570
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:15,440
then we just respond like normal if not

1571
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:17,040
we drop the packet and now we actually

1572
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:19,440
have the teeth to do it because we see

1573
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:21,440
what the client advertised

1574
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:24,160
that to be clear the client ip address

1575
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:25,200
space

1576
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:27,119
what was advertised in terms of what

1577
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:28,960
should be expected

1578
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:30,000
by a

1579
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,520
server that's receiving an incoming

1580
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:33,359
query from there but it does require the

1581
01:00:33,359 --> 01:00:35,200
authoritative servers to perform some

1582
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:37,599
dns queries maybe not themselves but at

1583
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:39,760
least to use a recursive resolver to do

1584
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:42,160
that for them we did um think about a

1585
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:44,960
few other uh alternative designs uh so

1586
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:46,480
one of them which i sort of mentioned in

1587
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:48,400
passing was the idea that well what if

1588
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,640
you had something at any given ipv4

1589
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:52,000
subnet level you know with the slash

1590
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,319
eight sixteen slash twenty four

1591
01:00:54,319 --> 01:00:56,960
um but doing that really increases the

1592
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:59,119
effort for a server to find you know

1593
01:00:59,119 --> 01:01:01,359
sort of going back and forth so he made

1594
01:01:01,359 --> 01:01:04,480
two definitive places you go to the 16

1595
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:06,720
uh and and with possible delegation to

1596
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:09,839
the slash 24. that's and and for ipv6 is

1597
01:01:09,839 --> 01:01:12,720
similar at the slash 40 and slash 48.

1598
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:13,520
um

1599
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:15,119
having uh

1600
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:18,000
another alternative design is is um

1601
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,280
letting the

1602
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:21,359
server infer the client protocol by just

1603
01:01:21,359 --> 01:01:22,960
seeing what they do

1604
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:24,559
and there's a couple shortcomings with

1605
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:25,920
that one is that an attacker could

1606
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:27,520
actually send spoof queries to make it

1607
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:29,760
look like the the client um has a

1608
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:32,799
certain lower level um that that uh to

1609
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:34,480
match the server's expectations the

1610
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:36,640
server will still um you know do

1611
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:38,720
whatever malicious things it would

1612
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:41,839
it's effectively a downgrade attack um

1613
01:01:41,839 --> 01:01:43,200
and the other thing is it may not be

1614
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:44,559
that there's actually a client on the

1615
01:01:44,559 --> 01:01:47,200
other end this may be address space um

1616
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:49,119
that that doesn't have a dns client so

1617
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:51,119
you may never see anything from that

1618
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:53,200
that address space until the attack

1619
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:54,559
begins

1620
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:56,079
and that addresses this third bullet

1621
01:01:56,079 --> 01:01:58,160
point as well i'm having clients

1622
01:01:58,160 --> 01:01:59,680
advertise support and their query does

1623
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:01,680
not actually protect them um because you

1624
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:03,599
may not have ever communicated with that

1625
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:05,039
client so you need to

1626
01:02:05,039 --> 01:02:07,200
have some assertion from the client

1627
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,520
address space that this is what the

1628
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:11,839
client actually supports

1629
01:02:11,839 --> 01:02:13,280
so we wanted to actually dig into this a

1630
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:15,359
little bit and see how feasible this is

1631
01:02:15,359 --> 01:02:17,280
on the administrative side

1632
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:19,599
looking at prefixes and and for example

1633
01:02:19,599 --> 01:02:24,240
given a a 16 or a slash 24 prefix um you

1634
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:26,799
know how much that's really uh that that

1635
01:02:26,799 --> 01:02:28,799
given address space is announced by

1636
01:02:28,799 --> 01:02:30,079
different autonomous systems that was

1637
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:33,119
the heuristic we use to determine hey

1638
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:34,720
how much would you have to coordinate

1639
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:37,599
efforts of a given policy if multiple

1640
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:39,440
organizations were involved in

1641
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:41,520
determining that policy since we only

1642
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:44,520
have granularity at the um

1643
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:46,640
16-24 level

1644
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:48,720
so what we did is we looked at the

1645
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:52,400
advertised prefixes um uh using a

1646
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:56,240
a a recent look at um announcements and

1647
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:59,440
um and on average what we found was that

1648
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:02,480
16 had about 8.4 prefixes so roughly

1649
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:03,920
eight um

1650
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:06,240
organizations using our heuristic um

1651
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:09,359
that might be uh sharing that slash 16

1652
01:03:09,359 --> 01:03:11,839
address space and so it would you know

1653
01:03:11,839 --> 01:03:13,520
coordination might have to be managed

1654
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:16,319
there um at the size 16 level uh

1655
01:03:16,319 --> 01:03:17,440
possibly across those eight

1656
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:19,119
organizations

1657
01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:21,760
um and uh in terms of ipv6 we found that

1658
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:25,920
74 of ipv6 40s have only one uh prefix

1659
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:27,359
announcement so that's good that makes

1660
01:03:27,359 --> 01:03:29,440
it a lot easier to coordinate on on that

1661
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:31,680
end

1662
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:32,880
and

1663
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:35,440
in terms of uh

1664
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:37,760
thinking about that that cut off there

1665
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:40,960
we found that most autonomous systems

1666
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:43,760
because of a large announcing a a larger

1667
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:46,559
prefix size or a shorter prefix length

1668
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:47,440
most

1669
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:49,440
autonomous systems require at most four

1670
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:52,400
records um and then ten percent of ipv6

1671
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:55,359
autonomous systems would require a

1672
01:03:55,359 --> 01:03:57,039
larger number of records to sort of

1673
01:03:57,039 --> 01:03:59,680
cover their their bases at the um slash

1674
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:01,760
40 level

1675
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:03,760
but again all these can can go down to

1676
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:05,599
the slash 24 level

1677
01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:08,000
at which level there's much

1678
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,880
less coordination required because as

1679
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:12,720
you can see on the chart on the right

1680
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:14,799
once you get to slash 24 there's there's

1681
01:04:14,799 --> 01:04:17,440
hardly any sharing

1682
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:19,760
okay

1683
01:04:19,839 --> 01:04:20,640
so

1684
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:23,759
we wanted to look at

1685
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:26,720
the what the policy might be adopted at

1686
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:29,599
these different um levels given the way

1687
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:31,119
things are right now so this is where we

1688
01:04:31,119 --> 01:04:33,359
use the digital data and by the way to

1689
01:04:33,359 --> 01:04:37,119
to sort of uh refer back to benno's um

1690
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:38,720
excellent talk about digital data we

1691
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:41,359
were one of the the survey respondents

1692
01:04:41,359 --> 01:04:43,359
and for us it's actually really really

1693
01:04:43,359 --> 01:04:45,599
important to have

1694
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:47,520
de-anonymized data so we can understand

1695
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:50,079
not only um what we're seeing at the at

1696
01:04:50,079 --> 01:04:52,079
the root level but associated with

1697
01:04:52,079 --> 01:04:54,480
different regions and and diversity of

1698
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:56,480
uh client ip addresses and so forth so

1699
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:58,960
we can actually see do we have um you

1700
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:01,200
know great deployment of this technology

1701
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:04,000
here um or you know is it is it evenly

1702
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,160
distributed things like that so so um

1703
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:08,160
just to put sort of a plug in there for

1704
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:09,760
uh how in

1705
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:11,200
one way that we use the data that's

1706
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:13,680
actually very important um to looking at

1707
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:16,000
uh deployment of different protocols so

1708
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,720
okay so this is uh the data that we used

1709
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:21,680
and we found that 42 of slash 16s and

1710
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:24,160
nearly all of slash 40s uh and again

1711
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:26,240
that's in the ipv4 ipv6 world

1712
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:29,200
respectively have no querying ip at all

1713
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:30,799
according to the digital data in that

1714
01:05:30,799 --> 01:05:31,760
capture

1715
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:34,240
and can adopt therefore a nun policy so

1716
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:35,440
this is sort of similar if you're

1717
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:37,200
familiar with spf in the email world

1718
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:39,359
again that just says hey you shouldn't

1719
01:05:39,359 --> 01:05:41,440
be seeing any queries from us and that

1720
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:43,599
protects the victim because the server

1721
01:05:43,599 --> 01:05:45,200
if they're doing their job should then

1722
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:46,079
uh

1723
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:47,680
you know just drop any queries coming

1724
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:49,039
from these spaces

1725
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:53,039
um 47 of the remaining slash 16 so

1726
01:05:53,039 --> 01:05:55,520
everything else have a dominant policy

1727
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:59,520
of of none meaning um that uh in in most

1728
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:02,240
cases there are um most of their ip

1729
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:04,960
addresses uh when when considering all

1730
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:07,200
the slash 24s within them most of those

1731
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:09,680
slash 24 um

1732
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:11,680
subnets have no querying ip addresses so

1733
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:13,200
you could actually put a

1734
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:15,599
policy at that 16 of none and then

1735
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:17,280
delegate further down to say oh by the

1736
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:18,480
way there's an exception so this is

1737
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:20,480
still looking at sort of how complicated

1738
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:23,039
this might be to deploy um in this case

1739
01:06:23,039 --> 01:06:25,200
you can just say well keep the policy

1740
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:27,440
the default policy of none and then make

1741
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:30,720
exceptions to it the slash 24. okay um

1742
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:32,319
and then we looked at sort of what it

1743
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:34,640
might on average take to delegate

1744
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:36,640
further down from the slash 16 level to

1745
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:39,280
the slash 24 or the uh

1746
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:41,200
40 to the slash 48

1747
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:42,640
and we found that the average

1748
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:44,240
delegations that would be needed given

1749
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:47,280
the current landscape are 57 for ipv4

1750
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:50,880
and 3.4 so very few for ipv6 um and then

1751
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:53,520
we calculated uh given you know the

1752
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:54,559
entire

1753
01:06:54,559 --> 01:06:55,839
space this

1754
01:06:55,839 --> 01:06:58,640
um this must include both ipv4 and ipv6

1755
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:00,079
but i have to go back and check about

1756
01:07:00,079 --> 01:07:02,160
2.3 million records overall for all the

1757
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:04,400
ip addresses so just some some sample

1758
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:06,559
numbers and this is just to sort of see

1759
01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:09,359
the exceptions you know given um

1760
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:11,760
uh hey if we had this this given policy

1761
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:14,960
to 16 how many exceptions would we have

1762
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:19,119
so again in 83 of slash 24's overall

1763
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:20,880
would use none meaning we have no

1764
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:23,280
clients that are issuing dns queries

1765
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:25,760
and almost all of slash 48s would have a

1766
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:30,160
default policy of none um and in 35

1767
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:32,240
percent and 59

1768
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:35,920
for ipv4 and ipvp ibv6 respectively they

1769
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:37,520
have just a single client so there is no

1770
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:39,680
discrepancy between you know what's the

1771
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:42,079
preferred secure protocol

1772
01:07:42,079 --> 01:07:44,079
um and then when you look at when you

1773
01:07:44,079 --> 01:07:46,000
have multiple clients uh so there

1774
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,760
actually has to be some decisions made

1775
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:48,640
um

1776
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:51,119
only 10 percent of slash 24's and 6 of

1777
01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:53,599
48s don't have a favorite meaning some

1778
01:07:53,599 --> 01:07:56,880
sort of dominant protocol um

1779
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:58,960
they're sort of equally uh you see some

1780
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:00,559
sort of equal

1781
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:02,559
representation of you know udp only

1782
01:08:02,559 --> 01:08:04,240
versus udp with cookies or something

1783
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:06,240
like that uh that's again giving the

1784
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:07,680
current digital data and so that's where

1785
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:09,039
we sort of had to say well it's not

1786
01:08:09,039 --> 01:08:10,880
really clear what you might do but we

1787
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:12,880
hope you just upgrade your policy and

1788
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:15,920
and uh and do the more secure one

1789
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:18,158
okay now thinking about server adoption

1790
01:08:18,158 --> 01:08:18,960
and

1791
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:20,640
we know we have a lot of developers and

1792
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:23,439
operators on the authoritative side um

1793
01:08:23,439 --> 01:08:25,520
we we uh took some liberties with

1794
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:27,520
speculation here but it because of

1795
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:30,960
course it requires um both the uh the

1796
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:33,040
client side or should say the potential

1797
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:34,799
victim ip address space to be published

1798
01:08:34,799 --> 01:08:35,920
and we think that's actually not a

1799
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:38,319
problem uh because the the victims would

1800
01:08:38,319 --> 01:08:40,158
want to be protected but it's the

1801
01:08:40,158 --> 01:08:41,920
authoritative servers and potentially

1802
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:43,920
the recursive servers that would want to

1803
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:46,238
uh that would need to be relied upon to

1804
01:08:46,238 --> 01:08:48,640
implement this on that side um and just

1805
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:50,080
some numbers out here from previous

1806
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:52,399
research 3.7 percent of authoritative

1807
01:08:52,399 --> 01:08:54,479
servers produce um the largest

1808
01:08:54,479 --> 01:08:56,399
amplification so if we can at least

1809
01:08:56,399 --> 01:08:59,439
target these ones um you know this 3.7

1810
01:08:59,439 --> 01:09:01,120
percent this could potentially reduce

1811
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:03,679
the overall amplification from 40 40

1812
01:09:03,679 --> 01:09:05,679
times uh to six times and so a

1813
01:09:05,679 --> 01:09:07,759
significant reduction even if we had

1814
01:09:07,759 --> 01:09:10,158
just you know um these uh high

1815
01:09:10,158 --> 01:09:12,238
contributors uh implementing something

1816
01:09:12,238 --> 01:09:14,799
like this um this is your timekeeper you

1817
01:09:14,799 --> 01:09:17,920
have three minutes to q a okay thank you

1818
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:18,880
so much

1819
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:20,479
um and uh

1820
01:09:20,479 --> 01:09:22,399
obviously um support by major software

1821
01:09:22,399 --> 01:09:25,198
could really lead to adoption um if 30

1822
01:09:25,198 --> 01:09:27,359
of servers performed enforcement uh the

1823
01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:29,759
attack volume would re reduced uh would

1824
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:31,359
be reduced on average we're missing the

1825
01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:33,279
number there i'm sorry up to you have to

1826
01:09:33,279 --> 01:09:35,679
find that our paper maybe um but we'll

1827
01:09:35,679 --> 01:09:37,439
have to take it would take a significant

1828
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:39,679
effort to determine if if a server is is

1829
01:09:39,679 --> 01:09:42,000
using enforcement that's um you know

1830
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,120
those of you that are more familiar with

1831
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:44,640
the authoritative server software will

1832
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:46,719
have a better idea of how to do that

1833
01:09:46,719 --> 01:09:49,359
efficiently in the server software okay

1834
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:50,158
um

1835
01:09:50,158 --> 01:09:52,560
i am going to uh

1836
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:54,480
i'll briefly go over just the bottom

1837
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:56,800
bullets here um out of sake of time so

1838
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:59,120
we just did an analysis of byu my

1839
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:01,280
employer our authoritative server data

1840
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:03,520
we shows about uh queries from about 15

1841
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:05,679
000 ip addresses per day which means we

1842
01:10:05,679 --> 01:10:08,159
would be doing that many lookups um

1843
01:10:08,159 --> 01:10:09,520
and it would take

1844
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:11,520
about one to five thousand queries is

1845
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:14,400
all um to do that and and given the you

1846
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:16,640
know the recursive reserver uh recursive

1847
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:18,560
reserver volume sorry can't talk

1848
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:20,640
recursive resolver server volume we're

1849
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:22,480
performing about 8.6 million queries in

1850
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:24,640
12 hours we think that's completely

1851
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:26,239
doable you know if the authoritative

1852
01:10:26,239 --> 01:10:28,560
server to offload that

1853
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:30,960
i'm i'm gonna out of sake of time i'm

1854
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:33,040
gonna uh skip this slide

1855
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:34,480
and um

1856
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:36,400
just to show some of the limitations we

1857
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:38,480
have a few things left undefined uh we

1858
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:40,159
don't have an official draft at this

1859
01:10:40,159 --> 01:10:42,400
point um you know like how long do you

1860
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:45,120
cache things with ttl etc

1861
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:48,239
we've only analyzed this so far with um

1862
01:10:48,239 --> 01:10:50,400
with our own authoritative server data

1863
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:52,000
it would take you know looking at

1864
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,679
third-party data you know especially

1865
01:10:53,679 --> 01:10:55,840
from from big names to see how feasible

1866
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:57,360
this is and what other tweaks might need

1867
01:10:57,360 --> 01:10:59,280
to be made and of course we need other

1868
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:01,040
testing and so we're continuing to do

1869
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:02,560
development we would look forward to if

1870
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:03,920
anyone has any

1871
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:05,600
contributions either

1872
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:07,840
volunteer contributions or even monetary

1873
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:10,080
contributions to support this work

1874
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:11,440
that would be grateful to support the

1875
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:13,679
students that are working on this so um

1876
01:11:13,679 --> 01:11:15,920
in short dns is vulnerable at least

1877
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:18,159
traditional dns to identity management

1878
01:11:18,159 --> 01:11:20,480
we have things like cookies and doh

1879
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:22,800
but they currently cannot be enforced as

1880
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:25,679
to say you know hey you we must respect

1881
01:11:25,679 --> 01:11:27,520
that this is what you support and so we

1882
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:29,360
propose dns protocol advertisement

1883
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:31,520
records or dpar to allow segments to

1884
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:33,280
state the protocol the most secure

1885
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:35,679
protocol that they support um and we've

1886
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:38,000
we've talked about some of that protocol

1887
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,440
and if you have any questions you're

1888
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:42,080
welcome to uh send us email at uh to

1889
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:44,080
either jacob or myself and hear our

1890
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:45,520
email addresses i will leave the slides

1891
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:48,480
up for questions thank you

1892
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:49,920
thank you casey

1893
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:52,400
so we actually have a few questions

1894
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:54,560
already submitted

1895
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,000
i see four

1896
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,560
so and more are coming

1897
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:00,880
so yeah um as i will be reading

1898
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:02,560
questions the poll should pop up on your

1899
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:05,040
screen again please give some feedback

1900
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:08,560
uh to the program committee and casey

1901
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:10,719
and i will just start reading the

1902
01:12:10,719 --> 01:12:12,560
questions so there is a couple that are

1903
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:15,280
more comments than questions um

1904
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:17,920
rick charles uh his question was sent

1905
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:19,360
pretty early at the beginning of the

1906
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:20,960
talk what about

1907
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:24,560
32 or slash or 128 for much finer

1908
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:27,040
granular is it possible to uh express

1909
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:28,400
that

1910
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:30,320
yeah it's a great question um you know

1911
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:31,440
this was a

1912
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:32,880
sort of um

1913
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:34,880
with our initial design we considered

1914
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:36,080
something like this but we were really

1915
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:38,560
concerned about you know a server having

1916
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:40,159
to do so much work and we really wanted

1917
01:12:40,159 --> 01:12:42,320
to make it lightweight and say hey these

1918
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:43,679
are the two places where we should go

1919
01:12:43,679 --> 01:12:45,280
rather than sort of dancing around and

1920
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:47,840
saying um which one has it there's a lot

1921
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:48,480
of

1922
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:49,360
uh

1923
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:51,280
in our initial specification there was

1924
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:52,719
like a lot of dancing around that i have

1925
01:12:52,719 --> 01:12:54,239
to do jumping around to find out which

1926
01:12:54,239 --> 01:12:57,199
one was which so could you sure um but

1927
01:12:57,199 --> 01:12:58,800
with the way we proposed it we made it

1928
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:00,560
we decided to stick to a couple

1929
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:03,679
different places uh for simplicity

1930
01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:05,440
okay thank you we can talk more offline

1931
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:07,679
if you have more questions there

1932
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:10,640
uh peter van dijk is asking or

1933
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:12,800
commenting i'm afraid this protocol will

1934
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:14,560
cause home users

1935
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:16,400
of the type that sometimes type dick

1936
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:18,480
commands will become second class

1937
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:20,640
internet citizens uh the specific steps

1938
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:23,040
all the query uh then queue policy

1939
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:25,199
lookup will make things even more

1940
01:13:25,199 --> 01:13:28,080
confusing to the back for such users

1941
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:30,080
and yes i can actually extend this to a

1942
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:31,120
question

1943
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:33,440
are there any considerations to support

1944
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:35,280
clients like this or even roaming

1945
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:37,600
clients or changing ips

1946
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:39,360
yeah it's a great question and it's

1947
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:40,480
something we haven't completely

1948
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:42,239
considered although you know i will

1949
01:13:42,239 --> 01:13:44,159
mention that at least the latest version

1950
01:13:44,159 --> 01:13:47,120
of digg for example um uses cookies by

1951
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:48,640
default

1952
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:51,440
and and so potentially uh

1953
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:52,400
you know

1954
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:54,480
i know you just use that as an example

1955
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:56,960
um but but these tools are becoming more

1956
01:13:56,960 --> 01:13:59,440
advanced to include things like that so

1957
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:01,280
um so you're right but that would be a

1958
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:03,679
potential conflict conflict excuse me

1959
01:14:03,679 --> 01:14:05,520
and uh could potentially

1960
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:08,239
make things a little bit trickier um and

1961
01:14:08,239 --> 01:14:09,840
i haven't given much more thought to it

1962
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:11,360
than that other than that the client

1963
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:13,600
would have to behave at the same level

1964
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:16,000
the recursive server um

1965
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
would given a well i should more

1966
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
importantly say given that a policy for

1967
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,640
that that given uh ip address space

1968
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:24,640
whatever that might be

1969
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:26,880
okay thank you

1970
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:29,280
and thanks for that great comment

1971
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:31,120
michael samberg uh

1972
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:33,679
asks or comments again as the operator

1973
01:14:33,679 --> 01:14:35,600
of authoritative server i would like our

1974
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:37,840
software to introduce some sort of state

1975
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:40,239
cache forward subnets has what status

1976
01:14:40,239 --> 01:14:43,520
related to how to allow paris

1977
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:46,239
yeah that sounds a like a great idea and

1978
01:14:46,239 --> 01:14:47,920
if it's anything like we talked about in

1979
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:49,840
the like i mentioned in the talk then

1980
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:51,040
and then of course that would be the

1981
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:53,120
idea you you'd want to cache as much as

1982
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:54,719
possible with enough flexibility that

1983
01:14:54,719 --> 01:14:57,280
something changed you could fold back

1984
01:14:57,280 --> 01:14:58,400
you know

1985
01:14:58,400 --> 01:14:59,840
but i don't know what to say much more

1986
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:01,760
about it than that i think it's a great

1987
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:03,199
comment it certainly makes things more

1988
01:15:03,199 --> 01:15:04,640
efficient

1989
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:06,159
the implementals will have an idea a

1990
01:15:06,159 --> 01:15:07,520
better idea of how to make that

1991
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:08,960
efficient than i will

1992
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:10,239
not being a thought date of server

1993
01:15:10,239 --> 01:15:11,679
vendor

1994
01:15:11,679 --> 01:15:12,640
okay

1995
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:15,440
john todd is asking two questions

1996
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:17,520
is there any thought to having a way to

1997
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:19,360
distinguish authoritative and recursive

1998
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:21,679
egress traffic in your records and what

1999
01:15:21,679 --> 01:15:24,080
is the incentive for address owners to

2000
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:26,239
register anything at all and is that the

2001
01:15:26,239 --> 01:15:28,640
incentive incentive sufficient to drive

2002
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:31,280
enough adoption to make this idea useful

2003
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:32,719
okay can you leave the question up too

2004
01:15:32,719 --> 01:15:35,120
if you would yes um yeah that's okay for

2005
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:37,840
this one so um john i hadn't i actually

2006
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:39,760
hadn't thought about that on the

2007
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:41,840
authoritative and recursive side i'll

2008
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:43,360
have to give that some more thought and

2009
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:44,480
maybe that's something we could talk

2010
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:46,239
about offline to see you know where else

2011
01:15:46,239 --> 01:15:47,440
this could go

2012
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:49,280
but let me answer your second one this

2013
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:50,880
is actually the most important point of

2014
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:52,400
this model

2015
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:53,520
other

2016
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:56,080
other incentive models are sort of

2017
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:57,760
difficult because it's difficult for the

2018
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:00,800
client to have any leverage anywhere

2019
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:02,320
you know let me give you a quick example

2020
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:04,800
so bcp38 is wonderful and we expect

2021
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:06,239
people to do it but there is very little

2022
01:16:06,239 --> 01:16:09,040
incentive for people to deploy that one

2023
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:11,199
because it doesn't benefit the network

2024
01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:13,520
that's deploying it that's where the you

2025
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:16,000
know the the attackers

2026
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,440
live effectively these compromise

2027
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:18,960
machines that would send out the the

2028
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:20,880
queries to initiate the ddos uh

2029
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:22,960
reflection attack but in this case it's

2030
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:24,800
the victims that are doing it uh

2031
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:26,640
potentially protecting themselves so

2032
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:28,320
we'd actually expect that since the

2033
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:30,560
tables are turned and the natural

2034
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:33,360
incentive is i want to protect myself

2035
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:35,760
and this is this model is unique in that

2036
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:38,159
aspect because of that and so so the

2037
01:16:38,159 --> 01:16:40,080
servers you know might require they're

2038
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:42,159
sort of the secondary uh who might who

2039
01:16:42,159 --> 01:16:43,600
might become benefit from the

2040
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:45,760
secondarily but we expect the victims uh

2041
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:48,000
would want to do this actually so um but

2042
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,239
let's take the first question offline uh

2043
01:16:50,239 --> 01:16:51,600
i probably need a little bit more

2044
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:53,199
context and discussion on that one

2045
01:16:53,199 --> 01:16:55,760
thanks so much for the question

2046
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:58,000
yeah so we have quite a lot of questions

2047
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:59,920
here actually i'm sure we won't be able

2048
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:02,000
to answer them all

2049
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,520
so

2050
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:05,840
let's take a few more

2051
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:07,440
um

2052
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:09,679
david feldman is asking an attacker

2053
01:17:09,679 --> 01:17:11,440
would be able to determine if server was

2054
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:13,360
implementing the protection no

2055
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:15,920
if so if only 30 of the servers

2056
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:17,760
implemented the protection the attackers

2057
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:20,560
have 70 of available servers to move to

2058
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:22,239
it seems like it might reduce it

2059
01:17:22,239 --> 01:17:24,880
initially until the attackers change

2060
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:26,640
their attack

2061
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:28,159
so you're saying let's see an attack

2062
01:17:28,159 --> 01:17:29,920
reveal to determine if the server i'm

2063
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:31,440
trying to process this

2064
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:32,239
um

2065
01:17:32,239 --> 01:17:34,320
i mean yes anyone could determine what

2066
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:36,000
what sort of level of protection someone

2067
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,840
else could use just like spf has done

2068
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:40,400
today uh 30 of servers implement the

2069
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:42,080
protection the attackers have 70 percent

2070
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:44,320
of available servers to move to

2071
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:46,400
potentially yeah but part of the thing

2072
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:48,239
is um what we've seen in the past in

2073
01:17:48,239 --> 01:17:50,080
attacks and i don't have any numbers in

2074
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:51,440
front of me but i know there's previous

2075
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:54,159
work in in this is that attackers don't

2076
01:17:54,159 --> 01:17:55,920
just pick any server

2077
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:57,360
they'll look for server with large

2078
01:17:57,360 --> 01:17:59,040
response sizes you know something dns

2079
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:00,159
signed

2080
01:18:00,159 --> 01:18:01,600
something that uh

2081
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:03,440
has high bandwidth so they can really

2082
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:06,400
have a large impact so you're right

2083
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:08,080
if all servers were created equally you

2084
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:09,920
could just move right over but the idea

2085
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:12,080
is if we can get the big names uh to

2086
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:13,440
implement this the most vulnerable

2087
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:15,920
servers in terms of their response sizes

2088
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:17,520
uh we we feel that that could really

2089
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:20,640
make a larger impact so so um

2090
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:21,920
sort of on a

2091
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:24,239
more biased level as opposed to a

2092
01:18:24,239 --> 01:18:25,679
even playing field level if that makes

2093
01:18:25,679 --> 01:18:27,440
sense and we can take that one offline

2094
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:29,120
too it's a great question

2095
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:32,320
yeah okay uh thank you casey uh we have

2096
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:35,040
six more questions uh they're all

2097
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:36,800
like related uh it's always about

2098
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:38,800
adoption so i will post these questions

2099
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:40,880
into the workshop channel you can uh you

2100
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:42,800
can answer the questions there uh for

2101
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:45,199
for uh who asked

2102
01:18:45,199 --> 01:18:46,960
and thank you again uh very much for

2103
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:48,239
this interesting presentation and this

2104
01:18:48,239 --> 01:18:51,120
interesting protocol uh proposal

2105
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:52,880
and uh we should move to the next

2106
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:56,000
presentation uh in sake of time

2107
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:59,120
so our uh next speaker is shoi hao from

2108
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:00,960
old dominion university

2109
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:02,719
and his presentation

2110
01:19:02,719 --> 01:19:04,159
is called measurement based

2111
01:19:04,159 --> 01:19:07,440
investigation of dns hijacking

2112
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:12,080
social you should be ready to go

2113
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:17,120
i can see your screen i can hear you

2114
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:18,400
okay thank you

2115
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:21,199
so hello everyone here i'm gonna present

2116
01:19:21,199 --> 01:19:23,520
our study a measurement based

2117
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:26,239
investigation of dns hijacking

2118
01:19:26,239 --> 01:19:28,080
this talk is based on our recent

2119
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:30,560
published paper or joined work with the

2120
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:33,280
researchers from palo alto networks you

2121
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:35,840
see urban universal delaware and

2122
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:38,640
virginia tech

2123
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:43,600
so i'm

2124
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:46,159
currently an assistant professor of

2125
01:19:46,159 --> 01:19:48,239
computer science at the dominion

2126
01:19:48,239 --> 01:19:49,360
university

2127
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:51,760
before that i was a postdoc in cada at

2128
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:54,800
uc san diego so my research industries

2129
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:58,000
generally lie in internet and security

2130
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:01,040
issues with the focus on measuring and

2131
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:02,320
understanding the internet

2132
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:05,600
infrastructure and vulnerabilities

2133
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:07,280
so in today's talk we will start with

2134
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:09,280
some background then discuss our

2135
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:12,480
measurements of domain hijacking attacks

2136
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:14,560
we will then briefly discuss our

2137
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:16,639
experiments in detecting those domain

2138
01:20:16,639 --> 01:20:18,639
hijacking then wrap up with the

2139
01:20:18,639 --> 01:20:21,600
discussion and conclusion

2140
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:23,120
so generally

2141
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:26,159
the dns related hijacking attacks could

2142
01:20:26,159 --> 01:20:28,239
be achieved with different forms

2143
01:20:28,239 --> 01:20:30,639
including spoofing or intercepting the

2144
01:20:30,639 --> 01:20:32,400
valid responses

2145
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:34,320
which all resulting in

2146
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:36,480
the victims being redirected to

2147
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:38,560
malicious web services

2148
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:40,880
we are particularly interested on a

2149
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:44,400
domain hijacking case where the attacker

2150
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:46,639
is able to change the record by

2151
01:20:46,639 --> 01:20:48,800
compromising the target domain owner's

2152
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:50,880
account with the third party

2153
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:53,920
such as a registrar or dns management

2154
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:55,280
services

2155
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:58,840
to gain control of the dns solution for

2156
01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:00,800
domain

2157
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:04,239
so this type of hijacking is common and

2158
01:21:04,239 --> 01:21:06,400
could cause more serious damage than

2159
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:09,199
others the well-known instance

2160
01:21:09,199 --> 01:21:12,159
include include the angular

2161
01:21:12,159 --> 01:21:15,440
the spammy bear and the sea turtle sea

2162
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:18,000
turtle domain hijacking campaign

2163
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,800
the angular attack used thousands of

2164
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:22,960
hijacked domains to distribute the

2165
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:24,159
malware

2166
01:21:24,159 --> 01:21:24,960
and

2167
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:27,600
the spammy bear attack leverage hijacked

2168
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:30,800
domains to send spam emails including

2169
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:32,800
bomb threats that lead to multiple

2170
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:33,920
building

2171
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:35,360
evacuations

2172
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:39,040
the and the sea turbo was a nationwide

2173
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:40,480
attack campaign

2174
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:41,199
that

2175
01:21:41,199 --> 01:21:43,600
the several governments as well as some

2176
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:46,880
private organizations

2177
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:48,800
to go our

2178
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:52,000
study is to conduct and comprehensive

2179
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:55,280
analysis based on the confirmed thing as

2180
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:58,719
hijacking events to characterize the dns

2181
01:21:58,719 --> 01:22:00,239
hijacking attack

2182
01:22:00,239 --> 01:22:03,600
and to identify features for potential

2183
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:07,520
defined defines or monitoring mechanism

2184
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:09,120
this is

2185
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:11,840
our study to leverage the passive dns

2186
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:14,639
database to perform the measurement

2187
01:22:14,639 --> 01:22:17,920
analysis on the captured dns information

2188
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:20,639
that related to this known thing as

2189
01:22:20,639 --> 01:22:21,840
hijacking

2190
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:24,320
so the passive dns is used to capture

2191
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:26,719
and install the dns response

2192
01:22:26,719 --> 01:22:28,719
where the sensors

2193
01:22:28,719 --> 01:22:31,199
uh deployed in global distributed

2194
01:22:31,199 --> 01:22:32,400
network

2195
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:35,360
collect collected dns responses between

2196
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:37,280
recursive resolvers and the

2197
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:39,520
authoritative name servers

2198
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:42,239
extract the relevant fields and store

2199
01:22:42,239 --> 01:22:43,199
this

2200
01:22:43,199 --> 01:22:44,960
information in their database for

2201
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:47,920
further analysis

2202
01:22:50,239 --> 01:22:51,280
so for

2203
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:54,320
our measurements we use the most popular

2204
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:56,800
passive dns data site from farsighted

2205
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:58,000
security

2206
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:01,840
again the data is correctly taken

2207
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:04,880
from a global network of sensors and

2208
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:06,400
from the zone files

2209
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:08,880
the data has been collected from over 10

2210
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:11,800
years and contain over

2211
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:16,239
130 billion set of records

2212
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:19,280
for the passive dns database the fields

2213
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:21,600
that are most intriguing yesterday that

2214
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:23,520
are illustrated here

2215
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:25,440
the first three fields are taken

2216
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:28,400
directly from the captured dns response

2217
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:30,639
indicating the name and the types of the

2218
01:23:30,639 --> 01:23:33,280
request resources as well as the data

2219
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:35,199
from the responses

2220
01:23:35,199 --> 01:23:37,920
the next three fields

2221
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:40,400
are edited by the tool created in the

2222
01:23:40,400 --> 01:23:42,560
dns database including the first

2223
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:45,360
analysis and the last scene time steps

2224
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:48,000
and the count which indicates the total

2225
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,719
number of times these responses was seen

2226
01:23:50,719 --> 01:23:54,159
in the in the input

2227
01:23:54,719 --> 01:23:57,280
we first manually identified the dns

2228
01:23:57,280 --> 01:23:59,840
hijacking events from different sources

2229
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:01,520
including the news

2230
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:04,320
tech blogs and academic papers and

2231
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:06,320
finally we obtained

2232
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:08,000
34 such

2233
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,280
instance

2234
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:12,560
next for the passive dns database we

2235
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:15,760
retrieve the indicator of compromise for

2236
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:18,400
short iocs for the evidence of the

2237
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:19,600
attacks

2238
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:21,679
including the fully qualified domain

2239
01:24:21,679 --> 01:24:24,239
names known to be targeted in this

2240
01:24:24,239 --> 01:24:26,880
hijacking as well as the name servers

2241
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:31,600
and ip addresses used by the attackers

2242
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:34,880
we use the passive dns data to

2243
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:36,480
examine

2244
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:38,880
different criterias of the attack

2245
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:40,880
including attacker

2246
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:42,480
infrastructure

2247
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:44,480
the new qualified domain names

2248
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:46,960
associated with the hijacking domain

2249
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:49,120
and the types of requirements that

2250
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:51,760
attacker target

2251
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:54,560
attacker changed

2252
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:57,280
so first we examined the infrastructure

2253
01:24:57,280 --> 01:25:00,239
used by the attackers including the

2254
01:25:00,239 --> 01:25:03,360
ais and the hosting services but there's

2255
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:04,960
no particular

2256
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:07,280
no particular titan is useful for

2257
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:09,280
identifying such attacks

2258
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:11,360
one interesting pattern is that

2259
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:13,679
the attackers are using the same machine

2260
01:25:13,679 --> 01:25:16,880
to host both their malicious

2261
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:19,760
name servers and the web server

2262
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:22,639
we observe this in different attacks

2263
01:25:22,639 --> 01:25:25,040
especially in the c turbo hijacking

2264
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:27,520
campaign in this example we can see

2265
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:29,440
record both

2266
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:31,360
both the malicious name servers and

2267
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:33,600
hijacked domains are resolved to the

2268
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:36,320
same ip addresses during the attack

2269
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:38,400
unfortunately although we do see this

2270
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:40,800
pattern is much common

2271
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:43,040
in the attacks than the on than the

2272
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:45,360
normal cases but still is not

2273
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:49,520
sufficiently used as a strong indicator

2274
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:52,159
of malicious activities because it's

2275
01:25:52,159 --> 01:25:54,880
also common in many deployment of small

2276
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:57,440
business

2277
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:00,560
next interesting pattern is the new

2278
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:03,120
fully qualified domain names created in

2279
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:05,440
the a record for domain

2280
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:09,239
so as an example suppose gear the

2281
01:26:09,239 --> 01:26:12,000
demo.example.net has a synonym record

2282
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:15,840
pointing to pointing to the example.com

2283
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:19,040
and zoom and attacker can only hijack

2284
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:22,280
the example.net

2285
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:25,199
the head the attacker cannot control of

2286
01:26:25,199 --> 01:26:27,880
the traffic associated with the

2287
01:26:27,880 --> 01:26:31,520
demo.exam.net if the c name record stay

2288
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:32,560
in place

2289
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:35,520
so instead the attacker can maintain

2290
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:38,320
this control by placing an a record

2291
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:40,719
containing the ip addresses of

2292
01:26:40,719 --> 01:26:43,520
its own server so we found that this

2293
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:46,320
behavior was sufficiently common that we

2294
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:49,040
could consider is worth examining when

2295
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:52,080
trying to detect the domain hijacking

2296
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:54,800
so for example in the attack hijacking

2297
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:56,960
the clock list in

2298
01:26:56,960 --> 01:27:00,639
2014 we observe a significantly higher

2299
01:27:00,639 --> 01:27:02,239
number of new

2300
01:27:02,239 --> 01:27:05,600
r names mostly caused by the wildcard a

2301
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:09,600
record created by the attackers

2302
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:14,000
so

2303
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:15,840
this is your time keeper you have three

2304
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:17,440
minutes to q a

2305
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:18,560
okay

2306
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:19,360
so

2307
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:20,480
well the

2308
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:23,199
final goal in hijacking is to redirect

2309
01:27:23,199 --> 01:27:25,280
the user to new name servers which

2310
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:28,080
generally involved change to a record in

2311
01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:31,199
many of the dns hijackings we noted that

2312
01:27:31,199 --> 01:27:33,280
different multiple record types were

2313
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:35,840
changed here we can see most of the tags

2314
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:39,360
tend to manifest themselves in change

2315
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:40,800
to multiple

2316
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:43,600
record type now the most interesting

2317
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:46,400
observation from this table is that the

2318
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:49,360
change of ns record with the attack

2319
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:53,520
generally the change in s is a

2320
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:56,000
relatively rare so this behavior is

2321
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,639
expected but it could be a promising

2322
01:27:58,639 --> 01:28:01,280
approach in recognizing potential domain

2323
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:04,800
hijacking activities

2324
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:08,080
so having gained some insight into the

2325
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:10,880
domain hijacking attack we want to

2326
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:11,920
test

2327
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:12,840
those

2328
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:14,480
insights

2329
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:16,960
you also use those observations for

2330
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:19,600
domain hijacking detection so in our

2331
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:22,239
experiments we replace the passive dns

2332
01:28:22,239 --> 01:28:24,800
status of the system and use the time

2333
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:28,000
step to determine what what other record

2334
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,440
should appear

2335
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:30,320
and

2336
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:32,080
in our design

2337
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:35,040
an instance is extracted all the new

2338
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:38,239
record seen for given domain or given

2339
01:28:38,239 --> 01:28:39,040
day

2340
01:28:39,040 --> 01:28:41,360
so the status of this group of new

2341
01:28:41,360 --> 01:28:44,880
records are extracted and then compared

2342
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:46,000
to the

2343
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:49,040
statistics on previous day in order to

2344
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:52,000
obtain those features

2345
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:55,280
for the experiments we use passive dnds

2346
01:28:55,280 --> 01:28:58,080
data for several domains in addition to

2347
01:28:58,080 --> 01:29:01,440
those known to have been hijacked so we

2348
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:02,320
also

2349
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:04,159
describe data for

2350
01:29:04,159 --> 01:29:06,639
alex top domains as well as the domains

2351
01:29:06,639 --> 01:29:08,800
in categories and

2352
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:11,840
in the business

2353
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:14,400
of the domains

2354
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:17,040
in our study of hijacked domains

2355
01:29:17,040 --> 01:29:19,520
so for the classification we test to

2356
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:22,239
fundamental classified random forest and

2357
01:29:22,239 --> 01:29:23,600
the svm

2358
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:26,800
we divided the data side by the years

2359
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:29,840
for each attack campaign

2360
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:32,159
occurred in our data set for the result

2361
01:29:32,159 --> 01:29:34,159
the false positive error are very low as

2362
01:29:34,159 --> 01:29:37,679
expected but that recall is somewhat

2363
01:29:37,679 --> 01:29:39,679
somewhat high because

2364
01:29:39,679 --> 01:29:42,480
the length of the attack campaign is

2365
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:45,360
relatively long so it introduces some

2366
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:48,639
noise for the detection

2367
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:52,639
this brings us to the final discussion

2368
01:29:52,639 --> 01:29:53,840
of our work

2369
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:57,840
so first the person bs data was went for

2370
01:29:57,840 --> 01:30:00,880
but it will allowed us to work with data

2371
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:03,679
for real attacks but it does not allow

2372
01:30:03,679 --> 01:30:06,159
us to allow us to see how well our

2373
01:30:06,159 --> 01:30:08,480
approach to detect

2374
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:10,080
to detect uh

2375
01:30:10,080 --> 01:30:11,360
the hijacking

2376
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:13,920
work in real time so understanding this

2377
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:16,320
would require further testing in the

2378
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:17,679
live environment

2379
01:30:17,679 --> 01:30:20,239
so yeah interesting further direction is

2380
01:30:20,239 --> 01:30:22,239
that we could leverage the real deal

2381
01:30:22,239 --> 01:30:24,880
exercises collected from the security

2382
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:26,000
products

2383
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,560
deployed in global inter

2384
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:31,520
enterprise networks from our industry

2385
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:32,639
partners

2386
01:30:32,639 --> 01:30:35,120
and another direction is to explore more

2387
01:30:35,120 --> 01:30:38,080
active problems to augmented detection

2388
01:30:38,080 --> 01:30:40,400
when passive analysis

2389
01:30:40,400 --> 01:30:42,800
promotes some alerts for potential dns

2390
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:44,639
hijacking

2391
01:30:44,639 --> 01:30:46,719
finally to conclude

2392
01:30:46,719 --> 01:30:49,679
this study illustrated our preliminary

2393
01:30:49,679 --> 01:30:52,080
effort for characterizing the domain

2394
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:54,480
hijacking and exploring the potential

2395
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:56,800
detection

2396
01:30:56,800 --> 01:30:59,199
so the changes in dns response do

2397
01:30:59,199 --> 01:31:02,400
provide some key indicators about domain

2398
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:04,719
hijacking events so the information

2399
01:31:04,719 --> 01:31:06,880
information could be leveraged to build

2400
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:09,199
a lightweight filter based on the

2401
01:31:09,199 --> 01:31:11,360
passive clock passively clicking the

2402
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:12,400
data

2403
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:13,520
and

2404
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:15,280
the authoritative name server in

2405
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:17,600
particular provides some important

2406
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:20,639
insights and developing some mode around

2407
01:31:20,639 --> 01:31:23,040
the features could be useful

2408
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:23,840
in

2409
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:25,840
to improve the detection of domain

2410
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:28,480
hijacking

2411
01:31:29,199 --> 01:31:31,520
so thank you all for your attention and

2412
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:35,440
i will be happy to take questions

2413
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:38,960
thank you uh thank you for presentation

2414
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:41,520
we haven't received any question yet if

2415
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:44,000
you have questions please send them in

2416
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,560
or raise your hand and you will be

2417
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:48,239
allowed to ask horrible

2418
01:31:48,239 --> 01:31:50,719
verbally

2419
01:31:50,719 --> 01:31:53,520
in the meantime again paul should pop up

2420
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:55,600
on your screen and please provide

2421
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:58,320
feedback to the program committee and

2422
01:31:58,320 --> 01:32:01,280
also to the speaker

2423
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:03,840
uh we are running running a little bit

2424
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:04,800
late

2425
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:05,679
but

2426
01:32:05,679 --> 01:32:08,719
i will allow a minute or so

2427
01:32:08,719 --> 01:32:10,719
if anyone has a question

2428
01:32:10,719 --> 01:32:12,400
um

2429
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:16,638
i don't see any raised hand

2430
01:32:21,520 --> 01:32:24,159
and i don't see any incoming questions

2431
01:32:24,159 --> 01:32:26,719
so okay thank you uh thank you again uh

2432
01:32:26,719 --> 01:32:28,320
if uh our attendees have questions

2433
01:32:28,320 --> 01:32:29,600
please post them into the workshop

2434
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:32,000
channel on mother most i'm sure choi how

2435
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,320
will be able to answer there uh thank

2436
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:36,239
you again for the presentation

2437
01:32:36,239 --> 01:32:38,320
okay thank you

2438
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:41,199
uh in our next presentation uh which is

2439
01:32:41,199 --> 01:32:43,040
uh actually the last presentation from

2440
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:45,120
from the program committee or selected

2441
01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:46,320
by the program committee is a

2442
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:48,960
presentation by rafael de alvera from

2443
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:51,760
slack and he will talk about the recent

2444
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:54,480
slack outage outage in his presentation

2445
01:32:54,480 --> 01:32:57,040
titled slack's dns rollout the third

2446
01:32:57,040 --> 01:32:59,840
time's the outage

2447
01:33:00,080 --> 01:33:01,679
so raphael

2448
01:33:01,679 --> 01:33:03,760
can you hear me well i can hear you well

2449
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:05,280
you're good to go

2450
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:07,040
awesome hello everyone

2451
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:08,960
so in this presentation we're going to

2452
01:33:08,960 --> 01:33:10,960
talk about slack's dns secret rollout

2453
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:12,880
and the others that we had on september

2454
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:14,320
30th

2455
01:33:14,320 --> 01:33:16,560
i'll start by introducing myself my name

2456
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:18,480
is rafael delvira and i'm a senior

2457
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:20,080
software engineer on the traffic team at

2458
01:33:20,080 --> 01:33:21,199
slack

2459
01:33:21,199 --> 01:33:23,120
our team looks after ingreso balancing

2460
01:33:23,120 --> 01:33:24,719
tls and ssl

2461
01:33:24,719 --> 01:33:26,880
dns cdn and dealer protection and slack

2462
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:29,120
among other things and during this talk

2463
01:33:29,120 --> 01:33:31,440
i'm going to pretend to be a dns expert

2464
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:33,360
but that's something i'm clearly not so

2465
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:35,840
yeah let's go

2466
01:33:35,840 --> 01:33:38,800
what's what's the nsx uh the nsx is a

2467
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:40,560
suite of extensions intended for

2468
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:42,239
securing data exchange by the dns

2469
01:33:42,239 --> 01:33:43,440
protocol

2470
01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:45,120
the protocol provides cryptographic

2471
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:46,960
authentication of data authenticated

2472
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:49,199
analytic systems and data integrity but

2473
01:33:49,199 --> 01:33:53,360
not availability or confidentiality

2474
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:55,040
these are the record

2475
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:57,440
and key types used by dnsec

2476
01:33:57,440 --> 01:33:59,520
which i will be referencing to later on

2477
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:02,000
so first the ds record this is the

2478
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:03,840
delegation signer used to secure

2479
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:05,760
delegations between name servers also

2480
01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:07,840
referenced as the chain of trust

2481
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:10,080
the dns key record holds a public key

2482
01:34:10,080 --> 01:34:12,560
that resolvers can use to verify the dns

2483
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:15,280
signatures in rrc records

2484
01:34:15,280 --> 01:34:18,639
and this rstc record uh hold a dns

2485
01:34:18,639 --> 01:34:20,400
signature for a record set which

2486
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:22,480
resolvers can verify the signature with

2487
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:25,920
a public key stored in a dns key record

2488
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:28,960
the nsec or and and nsec3 records can be

2489
01:34:28,960 --> 01:34:30,560
used by resolvers to verify the

2490
01:34:30,560 --> 01:34:33,760
non-existence of a record name and type

2491
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:35,679
and then in terms of keys we have the

2492
01:34:35,679 --> 01:34:37,360
zone signing key which is the private

2493
01:34:37,360 --> 01:34:38,880
portion of the key

2494
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:41,280
which digitally signs each record set in

2495
01:34:41,280 --> 01:34:43,119
the zone while the public portion the

2496
01:34:43,119 --> 01:34:45,520
dns key verifies the signature

2497
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:48,400
the key signing key signs the public key

2498
01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:51,040
which is the dns key record creating an

2499
01:34:51,040 --> 01:34:55,440
rrc for for the dns key specifically

2500
01:34:56,080 --> 01:34:58,320
here's a successful dns record request

2501
01:34:58,320 --> 01:35:00,639
sequence where the user will make a

2502
01:35:00,639 --> 01:35:02,800
request to the recursive resolver and

2503
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:04,560
then this recursive resolver will be an

2504
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:07,119
attempt to track down the dns record

2505
01:35:07,119 --> 01:35:09,119
it does this by making a series of

2506
01:35:09,119 --> 01:35:10,719
requests until it reaches the

2507
01:35:10,719 --> 01:35:12,880
authoritative dns name server for the

2508
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:15,280
requested record which is lac.com in

2509
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:16,719
this case

2510
01:35:16,719 --> 01:35:18,800
so this is a very basic interpretation

2511
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:21,760
of a dns record request

2512
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:22,960
the sequence is the same when the

2513
01:35:22,960 --> 01:35:25,520
resolver does dns validation and the

2514
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:26,880
only difference being the additional

2515
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:28,639
records requested and returned to

2516
01:35:28,639 --> 01:35:30,639
perform set validation

2517
01:35:30,639 --> 01:35:31,440
um

2518
01:35:31,440 --> 01:35:33,600
we should keep in mind that dns tech

2519
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:35,440
only validates the dns responses

2520
01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:37,840
received by the recursive resolver

2521
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:39,760
has you know the requests have not been

2522
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:41,440
tampered with in transit

2523
01:35:41,440 --> 01:35:43,280
and is legitimately what the authority

2524
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:44,960
technique server has in the in the zone

2525
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:46,560
so bad actors can still man in the

2526
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:48,320
middle between the recursive resolver

2527
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:50,000
and the end user

2528
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,480
as shown in this in this slide

2529
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:54,960
um so yeah now that we've briefly

2530
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:57,520
touched based on on dns tech let's go to

2531
01:35:57,520 --> 01:36:00,560
our dns journey at slack

2532
01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:01,920
back in may

2533
01:36:01,920 --> 01:36:03,520
we started off by doing a proof of

2534
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:05,600
concept where we replicated most of our

2535
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:07,440
dns use cases on a controlled and

2536
01:36:07,440 --> 01:36:08,960
isolated environment

2537
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:10,480
and in this environment we created

2538
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:12,719
multiple tests where we gained knowledge

2539
01:36:12,719 --> 01:36:14,719
on how to operate the nsx

2540
01:36:14,719 --> 01:36:16,080
once our proof of concept was

2541
01:36:16,080 --> 01:36:18,159
successfully completed we worked on an

2542
01:36:18,159 --> 01:36:20,080
internal rfc that outlined all the

2543
01:36:20,080 --> 01:36:22,480
necessary work to enable dns signing on

2544
01:36:22,480 --> 01:36:24,480
all slack domains

2545
01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:25,280
then

2546
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:27,920
prior to enabling dns signing on any of

2547
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:30,000
our domains we spent significant time

2548
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,159
simplifying our dns setup and making

2549
01:36:32,159 --> 01:36:34,000
necessarily some changes in preparation

2550
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,080
for dnsec

2551
01:36:36,080 --> 01:36:37,840
i won't be talking about this today but

2552
01:36:37,840 --> 01:36:39,600
feel free to reach out after talk if

2553
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:42,239
you're interested in any of this

2554
01:36:42,239 --> 01:36:44,320
so then once we deemed our zones to be

2555
01:36:44,320 --> 01:36:46,560
ready for dnsec uh we started with the

2556
01:36:46,560 --> 01:36:48,960
actual royal plan which you know by

2557
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:51,280
design dns can only be enabled on a per

2558
01:36:51,280 --> 01:36:52,639
domain basis

2559
01:36:52,639 --> 01:36:54,800
making it impossible to enable dns per

2560
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:57,520
sub-domain or sub-zone of a given domain

2561
01:36:57,520 --> 01:36:59,679
so this design choice significantly

2562
01:36:59,679 --> 01:37:03,119
increases the risk of any dns rollouts

2563
01:37:03,119 --> 01:37:05,679
so to overcome this we categorized our

2564
01:37:05,679 --> 01:37:08,639
domains by the risk low medium and high

2565
01:37:08,639 --> 01:37:10,560
and in this way in the case of failed

2566
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:12,480
attempt or any bugs in early stages we

2567
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:14,159
would only impact domain star use for

2568
01:37:14,159 --> 01:37:16,719
like monitoring or other non-critical or

2569
01:37:16,719 --> 01:37:19,760
less impactful slack features

2570
01:37:19,760 --> 01:37:22,159
for each of those domains we followed

2571
01:37:22,159 --> 01:37:23,520
the same extensive testing and

2572
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:25,440
validation steps making sure all our

2573
01:37:25,440 --> 01:37:27,600
domains were still resolving correctly

2574
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:30,159
after the nsx signing was was enabled so

2575
01:37:30,159 --> 01:37:32,080
you must be thinking yeah yeah but like

2576
01:37:32,080 --> 01:37:33,440
you know how did it all go wrong after

2577
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:35,280
all this um

2578
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:36,159
so yeah

2579
01:37:36,159 --> 01:37:38,000
as you might have guessed uh slack.com

2580
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:39,520
was the last domain

2581
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:41,920
on our dns echology and prior to doing

2582
01:37:41,920 --> 01:37:44,239
slack.com we rolled out the nsx to all

2583
01:37:44,239 --> 01:37:46,400
others like public domain successfully

2584
01:37:46,400 --> 01:37:49,440
with no internal or customer impact

2585
01:37:49,440 --> 01:37:51,199
but obviously slack.com had to be

2586
01:37:51,199 --> 01:37:52,080
different

2587
01:37:52,080 --> 01:37:54,159
so in this section we're going to cover

2588
01:37:54,159 --> 01:37:55,760
the three times that we failed to roll

2589
01:37:55,760 --> 01:37:59,600
out dnsx signing to slack.com

2590
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,159
on september 7th we did our first

2591
01:38:02,159 --> 01:38:04,320
attempt to enable dnsx signing

2592
01:38:04,320 --> 01:38:07,040
uh on slack.com however prior to

2593
01:38:07,040 --> 01:38:09,280
publishing the slack.com ds record at

2594
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:10,560
the registrar

2595
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:12,800
a large isp in the u.s had an outage and

2596
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:14,400
many of our customers reporting being

2597
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:17,440
unable to access slack as a result so

2598
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:19,760
early in that incident before we even

2599
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:22,080
even aware of the isp issue this

2600
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:24,239
lag.coming changes were rolled back as a

2601
01:38:24,239 --> 01:38:26,480
precaution

2602
01:38:26,480 --> 01:38:28,800
one day later on september 7th

2603
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:30,960
we enabled dnsx signing on slack.com

2604
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:32,480
following the same procedure as on a

2605
01:38:32,480 --> 01:38:33,840
previous attempt

2606
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:35,679
and then prior to publishing the ds

2607
01:38:35,679 --> 01:38:37,520
record again our customer experience

2608
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:39,360
team noticed a small number of users

2609
01:38:39,360 --> 01:38:41,760
reporting dns resolution problems

2610
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:44,560
so we decided to stop there and we

2611
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:46,639
started an investigation and realized

2612
01:38:46,639 --> 01:38:48,400
most of the affected users were

2613
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:50,719
accessing slack through a vpn provider

2614
01:38:50,719 --> 01:38:52,320
and then once again we decided to roll

2615
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:54,080
back signing on this lag.com as a

2616
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:55,280
precaution

2617
01:38:55,280 --> 01:38:57,199
so in this case it turned out that some

2618
01:38:57,199 --> 01:38:59,840
resolvers become more strict

2619
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:01,920
when the nsx signing is enabled at the

2620
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:04,400
authorities name servers even before the

2621
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:06,400
ds records were published to the dot com

2622
01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:08,639
name servers so this strict dns pack

2623
01:39:08,639 --> 01:39:10,639
enforcement will reject the cname record

2624
01:39:10,639 --> 01:39:12,719
at the apex of the zone including the

2625
01:39:12,719 --> 01:39:15,040
apex of a sub-delegated zone which was

2626
01:39:15,040 --> 01:39:16,239
our case

2627
01:39:16,239 --> 01:39:18,080
so this was the reason that customers

2628
01:39:18,080 --> 01:39:19,440
using vpn providers were

2629
01:39:19,440 --> 01:39:22,080
disproportionately affected and many vpn

2630
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:23,520
providers use

2631
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:25,520
resolvers with with this behavior so to

2632
01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:27,280
overcome this problem all our

2633
01:39:27,280 --> 01:39:29,199
sub-delegated zones were updated to

2634
01:39:29,199 --> 01:39:32,080
alias records

2635
01:39:32,639 --> 01:39:34,719
so then after migrating all these cnames

2636
01:39:34,719 --> 01:39:37,119
at the apex of substance to alias we

2637
01:39:37,119 --> 01:39:39,199
were ready for another attempt so then

2638
01:39:39,199 --> 01:39:41,840
on september 30th and after a careful

2639
01:39:41,840 --> 01:39:43,280
planning we made our third attempt to

2640
01:39:43,280 --> 01:39:47,280
enable dnsx signing on slack.com

2641
01:39:47,280 --> 01:39:48,960
so we first enabled signing on the

2642
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:50,960
authority name server and the delegated

2643
01:39:50,960 --> 01:39:52,960
sub-zones leaving us so time in between

2644
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:54,880
prior to publishing the ds record at the

2645
01:39:54,880 --> 01:39:56,320
registrar

2646
01:39:56,320 --> 01:39:57,920
as we had seen issues

2647
01:39:57,920 --> 01:39:59,679
on pre on the other two previous

2648
01:39:59,679 --> 01:40:02,000
attempts

2649
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,159
and then after a three hour soak time

2650
01:40:04,159 --> 01:40:05,760
and successful validations we were

2651
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:08,000
confident to publish the slack.com ds

2652
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,239
record at the registrar which instructed

2653
01:40:10,239 --> 01:40:12,159
resolvers to start validating dns

2654
01:40:12,159 --> 01:40:14,719
requests for slack.com

2655
01:40:14,719 --> 01:40:17,040
at this point we had fully enabled dns

2656
01:40:17,040 --> 01:40:20,159
signing for slack.com

2657
01:40:20,560 --> 01:40:22,400
everything looked great for a while all

2658
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:24,320
our tests external probes and more

2659
01:40:24,320 --> 01:40:26,639
detailing were successful and we were

2660
01:40:26,639 --> 01:40:28,239
really happy to have cutting this far in

2661
01:40:28,239 --> 01:40:30,639
the robot but then you know a short

2662
01:40:30,639 --> 01:40:32,400
while later things started to look a bit

2663
01:40:32,400 --> 01:40:33,199
best

2664
01:40:33,199 --> 01:40:35,520
less idyllic

2665
01:40:35,520 --> 01:40:37,600
so then our our customer experience team

2666
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:39,199
started getting reports from users

2667
01:40:39,199 --> 01:40:40,800
seeing dns resolution errors in their

2668
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:42,719
slack clients

2669
01:40:42,719 --> 01:40:44,880
and to give you some context uh slack

2670
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:47,360
applications are based on chromium an

2671
01:40:47,360 --> 01:40:49,199
integrated way to export the netlog

2672
01:40:49,199 --> 01:40:50,719
capture

2673
01:40:50,719 --> 01:40:53,040
netlog is an event logging mechanism for

2674
01:40:53,040 --> 01:40:55,600
chrome's network stack and will help you

2675
01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:57,840
debug problems and analyze performance

2676
01:40:57,840 --> 01:40:59,440
networks are extensively used at

2677
01:40:59,440 --> 01:41:01,280
slidebar engineering and customer

2678
01:41:01,280 --> 01:41:02,560
experience team

2679
01:41:02,560 --> 01:41:04,639
so on the left on on this slide you will

2680
01:41:04,639 --> 01:41:06,719
find the dns configuration of a client

2681
01:41:06,719 --> 01:41:08,960
available inside the network capture and

2682
01:41:08,960 --> 01:41:10,480
on the right you can see an attempt to

2683
01:41:10,480 --> 01:41:12,880
resolve app.slack.com with all the

2684
01:41:12,880 --> 01:41:15,119
relevant information

2685
01:41:15,119 --> 01:41:17,280
during our initial investigation all

2686
01:41:17,280 --> 01:41:20,400
reports were caused by no data empty dns

2687
01:41:20,400 --> 01:41:22,880
responses from some dns recursive

2688
01:41:22,880 --> 01:41:24,080
resolvers

2689
01:41:24,080 --> 01:41:26,639
most of which were from a large customer

2690
01:41:26,639 --> 01:41:29,440
using a private corporate dns resolver

2691
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:31,600
and google public resolver as well which

2692
01:41:31,600 --> 01:41:33,199
is quite eight

2693
01:41:33,199 --> 01:41:35,280
so we were both surprised and kind of

2694
01:41:35,280 --> 01:41:36,719
confused by this

2695
01:41:36,719 --> 01:41:38,480
as google dns failing to resolve

2696
01:41:38,480 --> 01:41:40,639
slack.com should mean a much larger

2697
01:41:40,639 --> 01:41:42,239
impact that our monitoring and customer

2698
01:41:42,239 --> 01:41:45,280
reports indicated

2699
01:41:45,280 --> 01:41:47,760
so given the data we had at the time we

2700
01:41:47,760 --> 01:41:49,760
decided to roll back our changes for

2701
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:52,560
slack.com

2702
01:41:53,520 --> 01:41:55,920
we did so by attempting to pull in the

2703
01:41:55,920 --> 01:41:58,080
ds record from the dns registrar

2704
01:41:58,080 --> 01:42:00,880
effectively removing the slot.com brake

2705
01:42:00,880 --> 01:42:04,080
ds record at the dot com zone

2706
01:42:04,080 --> 01:42:06,320
this is our way to stop the bleeding so

2707
01:42:06,320 --> 01:42:08,400
we could later focus on the no data dns

2708
01:42:08,400 --> 01:42:11,040
responses reported by customers

2709
01:42:11,040 --> 01:42:13,040
so after nearly an hour there were no

2710
01:42:13,040 --> 01:42:14,800
signs of improvement and never remained

2711
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:15,920
stable

2712
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:18,000
then our traffic team was you know we

2713
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
were confident that reverting the ds

2714
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,080
record published in the register was

2715
01:42:22,080 --> 01:42:24,000
sufficient to eventually resolve the dns

2716
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,239
resolution problems but as things were

2717
01:42:26,239 --> 01:42:27,920
not getting any better and given the

2718
01:42:27,920 --> 01:42:30,000
severity of the incident we decided to

2719
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:33,199
roll back one step further

2720
01:42:33,199 --> 01:42:35,520
which is we roll back the nsi sex

2721
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:37,840
signing on our slack.com other different

2722
01:42:37,840 --> 01:42:40,159
delegated zones wanting to recover our

2723
01:42:40,159 --> 01:42:42,080
dns configuration to the last previous

2724
01:42:42,080 --> 01:42:43,520
healthy state

2725
01:42:43,520 --> 01:42:46,560
which we we hoped uh would allow us to

2726
01:42:46,560 --> 01:42:49,119
completely rule out the nsx as a problem

2727
01:42:49,119 --> 01:42:51,440
and then as as soon as the roll back was

2728
01:42:51,440 --> 01:42:54,880
pushed out things got much worse

2729
01:42:54,880 --> 01:42:57,199
so our traffic team was paged due to the

2730
01:42:57,199 --> 01:42:59,600
nsx resolution issues for slack.com from

2731
01:42:59,600 --> 01:43:01,440
multiple resolvers and probes around the

2732
01:43:01,440 --> 01:43:02,400
world

2733
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:04,320
oh

2734
01:43:04,320 --> 01:43:05,840
um

2735
01:43:05,840 --> 01:43:07,520
so yeah our our understanding at the

2736
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:09,840
time was that you know we expected that

2737
01:43:09,840 --> 01:43:12,000
ds records at the dot com zone were

2738
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:13,520
never cached

2739
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:15,199
so pulling it from the registrar would

2740
01:43:15,199 --> 01:43:16,880
cause resolvers to immediately stop

2741
01:43:16,880 --> 01:43:19,040
performing dns validation

2742
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:20,880
uh this assumption turned out to be

2743
01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:22,960
somewhat untrue as the dot com sound

2744
01:43:22,960 --> 01:43:24,719
will ask resolvers to cache the

2745
01:43:24,719 --> 01:43:27,199
slack.com ps record for a 24 hour by

2746
01:43:27,199 --> 01:43:28,400
default

2747
01:43:28,400 --> 01:43:30,960
um so when you stop signing the

2748
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:32,719
authoritative zone in you know it's a

2749
01:43:32,719 --> 01:43:34,639
high risk operation unless the ds record

2750
01:43:34,639 --> 01:43:37,119
is not published anymore however the

2751
01:43:37,119 --> 01:43:38,400
assumption of

2752
01:43:38,400 --> 01:43:40,560
no cash ds record at the dot com zone

2753
01:43:40,560 --> 01:43:42,239
made us think we were in the same state

2754
01:43:42,239 --> 01:43:44,320
as in the previous two drawbacks having

2755
01:43:44,320 --> 01:43:47,040
the same end results however

2756
01:43:47,040 --> 01:43:50,159
unlike our other previous two attempts

2757
01:43:50,159 --> 01:43:51,840
this time resolvers some of the

2758
01:43:51,840 --> 01:43:53,760
resolvers had cached the ds record for

2759
01:43:53,760 --> 01:43:56,080
up to 24 hours once the rollback was

2760
01:43:56,080 --> 01:43:58,000
complete and then at this point all

2761
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,080
validating resolvers that had recently

2762
01:44:00,080 --> 01:44:02,639
cached this ds record for slack.com

2763
01:44:02,639 --> 01:44:04,480
started returning sir failed to

2764
01:44:04,480 --> 01:44:07,839
slack.com lookups

2765
01:44:08,880 --> 01:44:10,480
we quickly realized the mistake we had

2766
01:44:10,480 --> 01:44:12,239
just made and we started contacting

2767
01:44:12,239 --> 01:44:14,000
major isps and operators that weren't

2768
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:15,840
public dns resolvers asking them to

2769
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:18,800
flush all the cash records for slack.com

2770
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:21,440
additionally we practically floss caches

2771
01:44:21,440 --> 01:44:23,280
for resolvers that offer a public site

2772
01:44:23,280 --> 01:44:25,440
like google's cloud 8 or cloud for squad

2773
01:44:25,440 --> 01:44:26,400
9

2774
01:44:26,400 --> 01:44:28,400
and then as resolvers float their caches

2775
01:44:28,400 --> 01:44:30,719
we slowly saw signs of improvement on

2776
01:44:30,719 --> 01:44:32,719
our internal monitoring uh

2777
01:44:32,719 --> 01:44:34,719
we yeah slack so to give you some

2778
01:44:34,719 --> 01:44:36,719
context slack clients in terms of

2779
01:44:36,719 --> 01:44:38,159
monitoring select clients send their

2780
01:44:38,159 --> 01:44:39,920
telemetry to a different domain called

2781
01:44:39,920 --> 01:44:40,960
slack b

2782
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:43,119
and thanks to this isolation that we

2783
01:44:43,119 --> 01:44:45,280
built between our domains we were still

2784
01:44:45,280 --> 01:44:47,119
able to receive all the client metrics

2785
01:44:47,119 --> 01:44:48,800
that helped us quantify the impact of

2786
01:44:48,800 --> 01:44:51,520
this outpage which ironically slack b's

2787
01:44:51,520 --> 01:44:53,920
is a dns enabled domain

2788
01:44:53,920 --> 01:44:56,560
at this point

2789
01:44:56,639 --> 01:44:59,119
so in terms of keys throughout the

2790
01:44:59,119 --> 01:45:01,199
incident we consider resigning the

2791
01:45:01,199 --> 01:45:04,080
slack.com zone without publishing again

2792
01:45:04,080 --> 01:45:06,400
the ds record as restoring would

2793
01:45:06,400 --> 01:45:08,560
slightly improve the situation for some

2794
01:45:08,560 --> 01:45:10,239
users but it wouldn't have solved the

2795
01:45:10,239 --> 01:45:11,920
issues with all the users that were

2796
01:45:11,920 --> 01:45:14,320
initially getting the no data responses

2797
01:45:14,320 --> 01:45:17,199
after signing was enabled so for us to

2798
01:45:17,199 --> 01:45:19,440
restore signing uh we would have had to

2799
01:45:19,440 --> 01:45:21,520
recover the key signing key

2800
01:45:21,520 --> 01:45:23,040
that had been deleted when we rolled

2801
01:45:23,040 --> 01:45:25,760
back the changes to the slack.com zone

2802
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:28,080
in raw 53 which is our authoritative

2803
01:45:28,080 --> 01:45:30,880
name server the ksk key signing key is

2804
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:34,320
managed via an aws kms key

2805
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:36,400
this kms key is recoverable as per

2806
01:45:36,400 --> 01:45:38,159
configuration meaning that the key

2807
01:45:38,159 --> 01:45:39,440
signing key

2808
01:45:39,440 --> 01:45:41,840
will be the same after the recovery but

2809
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:43,440
we were uncertain if the zone signing

2810
01:45:43,440 --> 01:45:44,960
key would have been the same or

2811
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:46,719
different as the zone signing key is

2812
01:45:46,719 --> 01:45:49,520
fully managed by rough 83 internally and

2813
01:45:49,520 --> 01:45:51,840
we have no visibility into that

2814
01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:53,920
after the incident the amazon graphic

2815
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:55,360
three team confirmed that the zone

2816
01:45:55,360 --> 01:45:57,360
signing key would have been different

2817
01:45:57,360 --> 01:45:59,199
and when re-enabling signing on a zone

2818
01:45:59,199 --> 01:46:00,800
the zone signing key will be generated

2819
01:46:00,800 --> 01:46:03,119
with a new key pair meaning that all the

2820
01:46:03,119 --> 01:46:04,880
nsx validating resolvers we have

2821
01:46:04,880 --> 01:46:07,199
continued failing to validate

2822
01:46:07,199 --> 01:46:09,520
so we decided not to restore signing due

2823
01:46:09,520 --> 01:46:11,600
to a lack of confidence and we now know

2824
01:46:11,600 --> 01:46:14,000
it wouldn't it wouldn't have helped

2825
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:15,760
at all for for us

2826
01:46:15,760 --> 01:46:17,520
so at this point and some hours into the

2827
01:46:17,520 --> 01:46:19,520
incident we were in a situation where

2828
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:21,280
slack was resolving correctly for the

2829
01:46:21,280 --> 01:46:23,199
vast majority of customers but a long

2830
01:46:23,199 --> 01:46:26,080
tail of users of smaller dns resolvers

2831
01:46:26,080 --> 01:46:28,000
which had not flushed their slack.com

2832
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:28,960
records

2833
01:46:28,960 --> 01:46:31,840
were still impacted

2834
01:46:32,080 --> 01:46:34,239
then as as public resolvers caches were

2835
01:46:34,239 --> 01:46:36,639
flashed and the 24-hour ttl record on

2836
01:46:36,639 --> 01:46:38,639
slack.com expired

2837
01:46:38,639 --> 01:46:39,520
uh

2838
01:46:39,520 --> 01:46:41,679
the error rates went back to normal so

2839
01:46:41,679 --> 01:46:43,840
at this point all we had left was a

2840
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:46,880
mystery to solve

2841
01:46:47,440 --> 01:46:48,320
so

2842
01:46:48,320 --> 01:46:49,679
once the impact is

2843
01:46:49,679 --> 01:46:51,040
the impact to slack customers was

2844
01:46:51,040 --> 01:46:53,199
mitigated we aim to determine the root

2845
01:46:53,199 --> 01:46:55,520
cause of this outage and prior prior to

2846
01:46:55,520 --> 01:46:58,480
attempting uh dns iconslack.com again

2847
01:46:58,480 --> 01:47:00,719
our team had successfully enabled the

2848
01:47:00,719 --> 01:47:02,880
nsx on on all other

2849
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:05,040
slack public domains so we kind of had a

2850
01:47:05,040 --> 01:47:06,800
lot of questions like you know

2851
01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:09,119
so how is luck.com different to all the

2852
01:47:09,119 --> 01:47:10,960
other domains and why they did not we

2853
01:47:10,960 --> 01:47:12,159
see

2854
01:47:12,159 --> 01:47:14,480
we didn't see any issues on any of the

2855
01:47:14,480 --> 01:47:16,400
other previous domains and

2856
01:47:16,400 --> 01:47:18,800
you know why did it only impact some

2857
01:47:18,800 --> 01:47:20,639
corporate internal dns resolvers and

2858
01:47:20,639 --> 01:47:24,239
some of google public dns but not all

2859
01:47:24,239 --> 01:47:26,400
so yeah to understand this

2860
01:47:26,400 --> 01:47:27,679
and what happened

2861
01:47:27,679 --> 01:47:29,840
we replicated the broad steps using a

2862
01:47:29,840 --> 01:47:32,639
test zone setup identical to slack.com

2863
01:47:32,639 --> 01:47:34,400
and used a resolver that when he had

2864
01:47:34,400 --> 01:47:37,040
problems during the rollout surprisingly

2865
01:47:37,040 --> 01:47:38,560
all our attempts to reproduce the

2866
01:47:38,560 --> 01:47:40,880
behavior were unsuccessful

2867
01:47:40,880 --> 01:47:43,679
so at this point we decide to okay let's

2868
01:47:43,679 --> 01:47:45,679
go back to the net logs that we have

2869
01:47:45,679 --> 01:47:47,760
received from many of our customers

2870
01:47:47,760 --> 01:47:49,440
during the outlets and let's let's take

2871
01:47:49,440 --> 01:47:50,639
a look at them

2872
01:47:50,639 --> 01:47:52,239
and this is where we found an extremely

2873
01:47:52,239 --> 01:47:54,639
interesting clue uh clients were able to

2874
01:47:54,639 --> 01:47:58,000
resolve slack.com successfully uh but

2875
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:01,360
failed to resolve app.slack.com so why

2876
01:48:01,360 --> 01:48:03,760
um this indicated that is likely a

2877
01:48:03,760 --> 01:48:06,480
problem with the star.slack.com wildcat

2878
01:48:06,480 --> 01:48:08,800
record since we didn't have a wildcard

2879
01:48:08,800 --> 01:48:11,040
record in any of the other domains where

2880
01:48:11,040 --> 01:48:12,719
we had rolled out the nsa console this

2881
01:48:12,719 --> 01:48:15,360
was clearly an oversight

2882
01:48:15,360 --> 01:48:17,600
uh that and and we did not test a domain

2883
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:18,880
that had a welcome record before

2884
01:48:18,880 --> 01:48:22,000
attending slack.com

2885
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,080
so we collected all the evidence we

2886
01:48:24,080 --> 01:48:25,320
could and reached out to the

2887
01:48:25,320 --> 01:48:27,440
amazonbreak53 team who jumped on a call

2888
01:48:27,440 --> 01:48:29,679
with us to figure it out and after

2889
01:48:29,679 --> 01:48:31,199
walking them through the evidence we had

2890
01:48:31,199 --> 01:48:33,360
they quickly correlated this behavior to

2891
01:48:33,360 --> 01:48:35,840
an issue with nsec responses that drop53

2892
01:48:35,840 --> 01:48:38,560
generated on on wildcard records

2893
01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:40,719
so basically when a request is made to a

2894
01:48:40,719 --> 01:48:43,280
dns enabled domain for a wildcard record

2895
01:48:43,280 --> 01:48:45,679
which type does not exist for example a

2896
01:48:45,679 --> 01:48:48,800
quad a record for an ipv6 address

2897
01:48:48,800 --> 01:48:51,040
the answer is a signed insect record

2898
01:48:51,040 --> 01:48:52,800
confirming that while the domain name

2899
01:48:52,800 --> 01:48:55,760
exists the requested type does not

2900
01:48:55,760 --> 01:48:57,679
this signed insect record response can

2901
01:48:57,679 --> 01:48:59,119
include some additional information

2902
01:48:59,119 --> 01:49:00,719
specifically designed to not break

2903
01:49:00,719 --> 01:49:02,320
walter records

2904
01:49:02,320 --> 01:49:04,239
but roughly three was not returning this

2905
01:49:04,239 --> 01:49:06,480
additional information

2906
01:49:06,480 --> 01:49:08,560
what this means is that a request for a

2907
01:49:08,560 --> 01:49:10,639
record at the same level say at quad

2908
01:49:10,639 --> 01:49:12,960
lookup for app.slack.com

2909
01:49:12,960 --> 01:49:15,119
would correctly return a signed insect

2910
01:49:15,119 --> 01:49:17,760
saying there is no record for that

2911
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:19,040
and this is correct since we don't

2912
01:49:19,040 --> 01:49:21,199
publish any quality records

2913
01:49:21,199 --> 01:49:23,119
but then the the expected kind behavior

2914
01:49:23,119 --> 01:49:24,880
is to fall back to requesting an a

2915
01:49:24,880 --> 01:49:29,119
record but since raw53 isn't returning

2916
01:49:29,119 --> 01:49:30,719
that extra information some public

2917
01:49:30,719 --> 01:49:33,599
resolvers including google public dns

2918
01:49:33,599 --> 01:49:35,599
will take that response to mean

2919
01:49:35,599 --> 01:49:37,599
no other record type exists for that

2920
01:49:37,599 --> 01:49:39,360
record name so there is no need to query

2921
01:49:39,360 --> 01:49:41,040
for an a record

2922
01:49:41,040 --> 01:49:43,599
so this nc response is cached which

2923
01:49:43,599 --> 01:49:45,679
effectively meant that impacted dns

2924
01:49:45,679 --> 01:49:47,599
resolvers were unintentionally being

2925
01:49:47,599 --> 01:49:48,880
cast positioned

2926
01:49:48,880 --> 01:49:50,880
by clients innocently checking for the

2927
01:49:50,880 --> 01:49:53,199
existence of of quality records

2928
01:49:53,199 --> 01:49:55,760
when the nsx was enabled on this rough

2929
01:49:55,760 --> 01:49:58,239
53 zone with a wildcard record

2930
01:49:58,239 --> 01:50:01,199
so luckily this cache poisoning would

2931
01:50:01,199 --> 01:50:03,520
only affect the regional cache of some

2932
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:06,000
of the resolvers meaning that one

2933
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:07,520
regional cache of a larger impacted

2934
01:50:07,520 --> 01:50:09,679
resolver could be temporarily poisoned

2935
01:50:09,679 --> 01:50:11,840
and anyone else hitting that same cache

2936
01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:13,840
would see the failure but those hitting

2937
01:50:13,840 --> 01:50:15,599
all the regional caches on the same

2938
01:50:15,599 --> 01:50:17,920
resolver would not unless they did a

2939
01:50:17,920 --> 01:50:19,599
quad a lookup

2940
01:50:19,599 --> 01:50:21,520
interestingly

2941
01:50:21,520 --> 01:50:23,199
we were able to reproduce this issue

2942
01:50:23,199 --> 01:50:25,040
with one of her test zones against

2943
01:50:25,040 --> 01:50:26,800
google public dns but not against

2944
01:50:26,800 --> 01:50:29,360
clutter public dns for example or other

2945
01:50:29,360 --> 01:50:30,719
resolvers

2946
01:50:30,719 --> 01:50:32,880
so we had a second mystery that you know

2947
01:50:32,880 --> 01:50:34,719
which was whether or not one of these

2948
01:50:34,719 --> 01:50:37,440
major public resolvers was out of spec

2949
01:50:37,440 --> 01:50:38,560
possibly

2950
01:50:38,560 --> 01:50:40,239
so we investigated this and found out

2951
01:50:40,239 --> 01:50:42,639
that it is protocol compliant to reuse

2952
01:50:42,639 --> 01:50:44,800
the cash insect record to decide a

2953
01:50:44,800 --> 01:50:46,800
subsequent response and in fact that's

2954
01:50:46,800 --> 01:50:49,040
what aggressive anzac does

2955
01:50:49,040 --> 01:50:51,280
but this is an optional spec which

2956
01:50:51,280 --> 01:50:54,080
google implements with others others not

2957
01:50:54,080 --> 01:50:56,560
so in the end we concluded that both

2958
01:50:56,560 --> 01:50:58,480
options were acceptable

2959
01:50:58,480 --> 01:51:00,560
and the only real way to avoid being in

2960
01:51:00,560 --> 01:51:03,280
this ambiguous situation is for our

2961
01:51:03,280 --> 01:51:05,280
authoritative name server to correctly

2962
01:51:05,280 --> 01:51:07,920
return existing record types in the nsec

2963
01:51:07,920 --> 01:51:11,040
type bitmap

2964
01:51:11,280 --> 01:51:13,840
so at this point or mystery was finally

2965
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:15,840
solved and at the time of the writing

2966
01:51:15,840 --> 01:51:17,119
this uh

2967
01:51:17,119 --> 01:51:19,520
like this this talk the rough 53 team

2968
01:51:19,520 --> 01:51:21,440
has rolled out a fix to the insect type

2969
01:51:21,440 --> 01:51:23,520
box which is described above

2970
01:51:23,520 --> 01:51:25,119
so you know we are very sorry for the

2971
01:51:25,119 --> 01:51:27,040
impact this outage had on on everyone

2972
01:51:27,040 --> 01:51:28,880
who uses slack and we hope that this

2973
01:51:28,880 --> 01:51:30,880
talk will shed some light on some of the

2974
01:51:30,880 --> 01:51:33,599
corner cases with with the nsx and maybe

2975
01:51:33,599 --> 01:51:35,119
just maybe we will prevent someone else

2976
01:51:35,119 --> 01:51:36,960
from from having this similar issue or

2977
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:39,440
committing the same mistakes

2978
01:51:39,440 --> 01:51:42,159
so before we jump into into a bit of a q

2979
01:51:42,159 --> 01:51:43,119
a i would like to do some

2980
01:51:43,119 --> 01:51:44,560
acknowledgements

2981
01:51:44,560 --> 01:51:46,719
i would like to thank the amazon rad53

01:51:46,719 --> 01:51:48,480
team for their collaboration and for the

2983
01:51:48,480 --> 01:51:49,760
rapid fix

2984
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:52,000
the salesforce public dns team for their

2985
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:53,520
you know kindness their support and

2986

invaluable help in rapidly flushing

2989
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,719
cases trying to blink bring slack

2990
01:52:02,719 --> 01:52:04,159
back to everyone affected by this

2991
01:52:04,159 --> 01:52:05,119
problem

2992
01:52:05,119 --> 01:52:07,679
and last but not least uh really huge

customers and our engineering teams and

2997
01:52:14,560 --> 01:52:16,159
you know we couldn't have done it with

2998
01:52:16,159 --> 01:52:18,400
without them

2999
01:52:18,400 --> 01:52:20,560
so yeah that's that's it uh feel free to

3000
01:52:20,560 --> 01:52:22,480
go ahead and read a more detailed uh

3001
01:52:22,480 --> 01:52:24,480
write write up about this in our

3002
01:52:24,480 --> 01:52:26,800
engineering blog it's over that's laptop

3003
01:52:26,800 --> 01:52:28,960
engineering and i am not ready to take

3004
01:52:28,960 --> 01:52:32,880
any answers you might have thank you

3005
01:52:32,880 --> 01:52:34,560
thank you rafael that was really

3006
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:35,679
exciting

3007
01:52:35,679 --> 01:52:37,679
and thank you for going through all the

3008
01:52:37,679 --> 01:52:38,800
details and

3009
01:52:38,800 --> 01:52:40,239
the whole story

3010
01:52:40,239 --> 01:52:41,840
uh with us

3011
01:52:41,840 --> 01:52:43,599
so we have quite a lot of questions here

3012
01:52:43,599 --> 01:52:44,639
um

3013
01:52:44,639 --> 01:52:45,520
so

3014
01:52:45,520 --> 01:52:47,840
i'll just start reading them out uh

3015
01:52:47,840 --> 01:52:50,159
hazel smith is asking what was the dtl

3016
01:52:50,159 --> 01:52:53,360
on your ds records

3017
01:52:53,440 --> 01:52:54,320
so

3018
01:52:54,320 --> 01:52:56,880
the the ttl and the ds record is not

3019
01:52:56,880 --> 01:52:58,880
mandated by us it's

3020
01:52:58,880 --> 01:53:01,679
we publish the ds record via our dns

3021
01:53:01,679 --> 01:53:03,199
registrar which in our case is smart

3022
01:53:03,199 --> 01:53:05,599
monitor then mark monitor takes that as

3023
01:53:05,599 --> 01:53:08,000
and publishes it to the dot-com zone so

3024
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,480
the dpl of the ds record is managed by

3025
01:53:10,480 --> 01:53:12,400
the dot com zone owner which i think

3026
01:53:12,400 --> 01:53:14,960
it's it's very sign uh so we don't have

3027
01:53:14,960 --> 01:53:17,440
any any means to actually like modify

3028
01:53:17,440 --> 01:53:21,679
the ttl or like have it be lower and in

3029
01:53:21,679 --> 01:53:22,960
in the case of the rollout and then

3030
01:53:22,960 --> 01:53:24,880
increase it so we we do not have the

3031
01:53:24,880 --> 01:53:28,239
means to to touch that

3032
01:53:28,480 --> 01:53:29,920
okay thank you

3033
01:53:29,920 --> 01:53:31,040
um

3034
01:53:31,040 --> 01:53:32,880
i will also remind everyone to rate this

3035
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:34,480
presentation there should be paul

3036
01:53:34,480 --> 01:53:36,320
already showing up on your screen so

3037
01:53:36,320 --> 01:53:37,679
please do that

3038
01:53:37,679 --> 01:53:39,360
sort of piece of

3039
01:53:39,360 --> 01:53:42,239
some information about like which talks

3040
01:53:42,239 --> 01:53:44,639
you like next time you might like next

3041
01:53:44,639 --> 01:53:46,400
time

3042
01:53:46,400 --> 01:53:48,560
the next

3043
01:53:48,560 --> 01:53:51,760
comment is by peter alexis uh thanks for

3044
01:53:51,760 --> 01:53:53,760
sharing this horror story i can imagine

3045
01:53:53,760 --> 01:53:55,840
the stress you had that day and now the

3046
01:53:55,840 --> 01:53:58,320
question uh when do you expect to sign

3047
01:53:58,320 --> 01:54:01,199
slack.com again and will you then update

3048
01:54:01,199 --> 01:54:03,760
or make a new block about how easy it

3049
01:54:03,760 --> 01:54:06,639
was eventually

3050
01:54:06,639 --> 01:54:07,760
yeah so

3051
01:54:07,760 --> 01:54:09,599
thank you peter uh

3052
01:54:09,599 --> 01:54:12,080
you know we we expect to enable the nsx

3053
01:54:12,080 --> 01:54:14,960
signing on slack.com again i do not have

3054
01:54:14,960 --> 01:54:17,119
or i cannot share the date with with you

3055
01:54:17,119 --> 01:54:18,159
yet

3056
01:54:18,159 --> 01:54:21,520
um so we are planning on a new draft to

3057
01:54:21,520 --> 01:54:23,119
to enable dns exciting again on

3058
01:54:23,119 --> 01:54:25,360
slack.com and most of our work is done

3059
01:54:25,360 --> 01:54:27,599
after this the rough 83 bug is solved at

3060
01:54:27,599 --> 01:54:28,880
this point

3061
01:54:28,880 --> 01:54:31,760
um so i'm not sure if we will update the

3062
01:54:31,760 --> 01:54:33,679
blog post or or make a new one it

3063
01:54:33,679 --> 01:54:36,239
depends on if if we have a you know a

3064
01:54:36,239 --> 01:54:38,239
nice story to tell or if it will be a

3065
01:54:38,239 --> 01:54:40,560
kind of a boring thing uh but i am

3066
01:54:40,560 --> 01:54:42,560
considering keeping the dns our

3067
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:44,560
community in in the loop when we enable

3068
01:54:44,560 --> 01:54:46,480
the nsx so you know we have all this

3069
01:54:46,480 --> 01:54:48,000
this great community

3070
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:49,840
uh you know take a look at it while we

3071
01:54:49,840 --> 01:54:51,760
do it or and report back any anything

3072
01:54:51,760 --> 01:54:53,599
that they might be seeing on their on

3073
01:54:53,599 --> 01:54:56,000
their dns resolvers

3074
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,239
thank you and the next question uh will

3075
01:54:58,239 --> 01:55:00,639
be asked by anand buddha dave and he

3076
01:55:00,639 --> 01:55:02,159
will actually ask the question by

3077
01:55:02,159 --> 01:55:05,599
himself so you should be able to speak

3078
01:55:05,599 --> 01:55:07,920
hello yan thank you very much

3079
01:55:07,920 --> 01:55:10,159
um this is more of a comment rather than

3080
01:55:10,159 --> 01:55:11,920
a question

3081
01:55:11,920 --> 01:55:14,159
rafael's presentation about

3082
01:55:14,159 --> 01:55:15,599
this outage

3083
01:55:15,599 --> 01:55:17,119
reminded me of

3084
01:55:17,119 --> 01:55:19,119
one issue that i've been thinking about

3085
01:55:19,119 --> 01:55:20,159
which is

3086
01:55:20,159 --> 01:55:24,560
uh high values of ttl on the ds records

3087
01:55:24,560 --> 01:55:27,280
these days most registries

3088
01:55:27,280 --> 01:55:29,599
set very high ttls on ds records

3089
01:55:29,599 --> 01:55:32,639
including common net which have one day

3090
01:55:32,639 --> 01:55:35,199
uh and i think that low ttls on ds

3091
01:55:35,199 --> 01:55:37,360
records would really help

3092
01:55:37,360 --> 01:55:39,840
and in fact i have just sent an email

3093
01:55:39,840 --> 01:55:42,239
this afternoon to the ripe dns working

3094
01:55:42,239 --> 01:55:44,560
group mailing list proposing to lower

3095
01:55:44,560 --> 01:55:45,760
the ds

3096
01:55:45,760 --> 01:55:48,719
record ttl to one hour in the reverse

3097
01:55:48,719 --> 01:55:52,400
dns tree maintained by ripen cc

3098
01:55:52,400 --> 01:55:54,320
thanks

3099
01:55:54,320 --> 01:55:56,400
yeah that would be great

3100
01:55:56,400 --> 01:56:00,000
thank you for the comment yeah

3101
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:03,040
you so uh so yeah we have a few more

3102
01:56:03,040 --> 01:56:04,480
questions and we have quite a lot of

3103
01:56:04,480 --> 01:56:07,119
time um so

3104
01:56:07,119 --> 01:56:09,760
next uh comment or question or is the

3105
01:56:09,760 --> 01:56:12,560
question randickinson is asking how many

3106
01:56:12,560 --> 01:56:14,719
real records are necessary at the apex

3107
01:56:14,719 --> 01:56:17,440
of slack versus below the apex which

3108
01:56:17,440 --> 01:56:20,400
delegating all non-ipex names and

3109
01:56:20,400 --> 01:56:22,719
starting slow with insecure delegations

3110
01:56:22,719 --> 01:56:24,320
be something you have considered for the

3111
01:56:24,320 --> 01:56:26,320
next attempt not sure if you have

3112
01:56:26,320 --> 01:56:29,639
already deployed

3113
01:56:29,840 --> 01:56:31,520
yeah well

3114
01:56:31,520 --> 01:56:34,239
so i most of them are necessary at the

3115
01:56:34,239 --> 01:56:38,239
apex i would say we only have a few

3116
01:56:38,239 --> 01:56:39,440
delegation

3117
01:56:39,440 --> 01:56:41,440
or records that we delegate

3118
01:56:41,440 --> 01:56:42,400
um

3119
01:56:42,400 --> 01:56:44,320
i think you know testing and validation

3120
01:56:44,320 --> 01:56:47,760
was mostly fine the only problem was

3121
01:56:47,760 --> 01:56:49,520
you know

3122
01:56:49,520 --> 01:56:51,920
actually enabling dns signing and and

3123
01:56:51,920 --> 01:56:55,599
getting like that weird nsa um

3124
01:56:55,599 --> 01:56:59,199
bug in in rough 53 so i'm not sure how

3125
01:56:59,199 --> 01:57:01,440
much would it it helped us uh it's

3126
01:57:01,440 --> 01:57:03,199
definitely a good idea and something

3127
01:57:03,199 --> 01:57:04,880
that we can investigate so yeah

3128
01:57:04,880 --> 01:57:08,320
appreciate your comment brian

3129
01:57:09,199 --> 01:57:10,960
thank you brian

3130
01:57:10,960 --> 01:57:12,719
uh peter funding

3131
01:57:12,719 --> 01:57:15,040
is adding and i recommend uh the dns key

3132
01:57:15,040 --> 01:57:18,080
ttl was only one hour so our new zone

3133
01:57:18,080 --> 01:57:20,320
signing key would start working after an

3134
01:57:20,320 --> 01:57:22,880
hour of course you would still be stuck

3135
01:57:22,880 --> 01:57:24,639
with the no data and issue with google

3136
01:57:24,639 --> 01:57:26,880
and that enterprise customer then which

3137
01:57:26,880 --> 01:57:29,119
i suspect could be solvable with google

3138
01:57:29,119 --> 01:57:31,519
at least

3139
01:57:31,679 --> 01:57:33,360
yeah so that that's a that's a fair

3140
01:57:33,360 --> 01:57:34,880
point peter

3141
01:57:34,880 --> 01:57:37,119
there's a bit more context about this on

3142
01:57:37,119 --> 01:57:39,840
the blog post i think um

3143
01:57:39,840 --> 01:57:41,760
but at that point we were not confident

3144
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:42,960
so we

3145
01:57:42,960 --> 01:57:46,000
we're not entirely sure like how

3146
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:47,440
uh you know

3147
01:57:47,440 --> 01:57:49,679
in terms of the ds record ttl like how

3148
01:57:49,679 --> 01:57:52,400
responsible we were for those and if

3149
01:57:52,400 --> 01:57:54,159
at the time of enabling the signing on

3150
01:57:54,159 --> 01:57:56,080
the zone that had something to do with

3151
01:57:56,080 --> 01:57:58,560
the ttl of the ds record so we were not

3152
01:57:58,560 --> 01:58:01,040
confident at all like reverting the

3153
01:58:01,040 --> 01:58:03,280
incident to a state where you know we

3154
01:58:03,280 --> 01:58:05,360
need to go back and ask all the isps and

3155
01:58:05,360 --> 01:58:08,159
all the operators to flush again because

3156
01:58:08,159 --> 01:58:10,239
we did a mistake again so at this point

3157
01:58:10,239 --> 01:58:12,719
rather than going like after the hours

3158
01:58:12,719 --> 01:58:14,639
in the incident that we were uh we

3159
01:58:14,639 --> 01:58:16,800
decided to continue with her plan of

3160
01:58:16,800 --> 01:58:17,920
okay let's

3161
01:58:17,920 --> 01:58:20,159
finish the the flushes that we have left

3162
01:58:20,159 --> 01:58:22,080
we only have few hours until the ttl

3163
01:58:22,080 --> 01:58:24,880
expires and let's investigate that line

3164
01:58:24,880 --> 01:58:26,080
of line of

3165
01:58:26,080 --> 01:58:28,639
work for for future outages if if any

3166
01:58:28,639 --> 01:58:30,400
happened but that that is a very good

3167
01:58:30,400 --> 01:58:32,960
point video

3168
01:58:32,960 --> 01:58:34,320
and peter actually dropped another

3169
01:58:34,320 --> 01:58:36,239
comment yes i understand how this is

3170
01:58:36,239 --> 01:58:38,320
easy and inside uh you had a tough call

3171
01:58:38,320 --> 01:58:40,719
to make

3172
01:58:41,199 --> 01:58:43,280
so thank you peter uh and few more

3173
01:58:43,280 --> 01:58:45,920
questions uh panitsuit is asking what

3174
01:58:45,920 --> 01:58:48,239
does thank you adding to catch problems

3175
01:58:48,239 --> 01:58:50,960
like this in the future

3176
01:58:50,960 --> 01:58:52,239
yeah so

3177
01:58:52,239 --> 01:58:54,320
not not a lot that's changing in terms

3178
01:58:54,320 --> 01:58:58,480
of testing i think our testing was

3179
01:58:58,480 --> 01:59:00,159
pretty good the only thing that we

3180
01:59:00,159 --> 01:59:02,239
didn't do and it's ultimately could have

3181
01:59:02,239 --> 01:59:04,639
caught this problem is

3182
01:59:04,639 --> 01:59:07,760
in in dns vist which is a tool to to run

3183
01:59:07,760 --> 01:59:11,119
uh like dns tests and dns tests uh

3184
01:59:11,119 --> 01:59:12,880
there's a

3185
01:59:12,880 --> 01:59:15,440
check for like non-existence records and

3186
01:59:15,440 --> 01:59:17,679
that definitely caught the rock 53 block

3187
01:59:17,679 --> 01:59:19,920
but we were unaware of that option in

3188
01:59:19,920 --> 01:59:22,159
indiana space so that's definitely a

3189
01:59:22,159 --> 01:59:23,760
lesson learned for us

3190
01:59:23,760 --> 01:59:26,320
and something that changed in our in our

3191
01:59:26,320 --> 01:59:30,239
testing uh in you know runbooks um what

3192
01:59:30,239 --> 01:59:32,239
else i don't think that

3193
01:59:32,239 --> 01:59:34,960
much is is changing other than

3194
01:59:34,960 --> 01:59:37,280
you know we now have a written down

3195
01:59:37,280 --> 01:59:39,119
process and broad books in terms of like

3196
01:59:39,119 --> 01:59:40,800
okay how that how can we restore the

3197
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:43,679
keys and all the risks of each step and

3198
01:59:43,679 --> 01:59:45,280
how to repair it from each step so we

3199
01:59:45,280 --> 01:59:47,360
don't can like make the same mistakes as

3200
01:59:47,360 --> 01:59:50,320
we did in the past but not a lot of like

3201
01:59:50,320 --> 01:59:52,159
new learnings in terms of like you know

3202
01:59:52,159 --> 01:59:54,159
testing cases that that we have learned

3203
01:59:54,159 --> 01:59:57,199
so far i would say

3204
01:59:57,280 --> 01:59:59,119
okay thank you

3205
01:59:59,119 --> 02:00:01,760
uh peter uh is asking are you using

3206
02:00:01,760 --> 02:00:03,760
dynasty validating resolvers internally

3207
02:00:03,760 --> 02:00:06,320
in production

3208
02:00:06,320 --> 02:00:08,800
so i i think this means

3209
02:00:08,800 --> 02:00:11,679
if our own infrastructure uses

3210
02:00:11,679 --> 02:00:14,000
validating resolvers and the answer is

3211
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
no as far as i know

3212
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,320
this is coming from a fedramp

3213
02:00:18,320 --> 02:00:19,360
requirement

3214
02:00:19,360 --> 02:00:20,560
and you know

3215
02:00:20,560 --> 02:00:21,360
very

3216
02:00:21,360 --> 02:00:23,119
important customers that require this

3217
02:00:23,119 --> 02:00:25,760
feature to be enabled so it's not a

3218
02:00:25,760 --> 02:00:26,880
something that we wanted for our

3219
02:00:26,880 --> 02:00:28,400
infrastructure internally but more as a

3220
02:00:28,400 --> 02:00:30,560
customer facing kind of thing

3221
02:00:30,560 --> 02:00:32,639
yeah this only applied to like slack

3222
02:00:32,639 --> 02:00:34,639
public domains and not the internal ones

3223
02:00:34,639 --> 02:00:36,719
managed by players

3224
02:00:36,719 --> 02:00:38,400
okay thank you

3225
02:00:38,400 --> 02:00:41,280
alison mankin uh is adding a command or

3226
02:00:41,280 --> 02:00:44,239
question question i believe that we uh

3227
02:00:44,239 --> 02:00:46,080
salesforce public dns have found another

3228
02:00:46,080 --> 02:00:48,560
example of uh no data and sec issue in a

3229
02:00:48,560 --> 02:00:50,480
different and uncommon stack

3230
02:00:50,480 --> 02:00:52,320
do we think we need to clarify the

3231
02:00:52,320 --> 02:00:54,719
specification or rather should the ietf

3232
02:00:54,719 --> 02:00:57,920
clarify the specification

3233
02:00:58,639 --> 02:01:00,159
well i think that's a very good question

3234
02:01:00,159 --> 02:01:02,239
alison if it's something that i

3235
02:01:02,239 --> 02:01:03,679
definitely don't have the knowledge

3236
02:01:03,679 --> 02:01:05,119
about

3237
02:01:05,119 --> 02:01:09,799
uh yeah but yeah good good

3238
02:01:11,360 --> 02:01:12,800
so i don't see any more questions in

3239
02:01:12,800 --> 02:01:15,360
zoom uh i do see a lot of people typing

3240
02:01:15,360 --> 02:01:17,040
in the workshop channel on our letter

3241
02:01:17,040 --> 02:01:20,000
most though so uh you definitely uh

3242
