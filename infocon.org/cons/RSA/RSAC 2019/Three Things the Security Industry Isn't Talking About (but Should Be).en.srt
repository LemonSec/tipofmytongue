1
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:13,260
please welcome chief executive officer
VMware Pascal singer

2
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:21,180
oh I'm glad I have at least one fan here
this is good thank you

3
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:26,850
thank you hey it's a great pleasure to
be here great pleasure to be at RSA 2019

4
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:31,800
yeah over my career I've been here maybe
eight times or so I know some of you

5
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,239
have been here like 25 times so I'm
still a rookie but it's great to be able

6
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,510
to spend time you know like you I've
been following a number of the

7
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:43,470
announcements have come this week you
know and the fantastic innovation that's

8
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:47,040
coming from the event you know and the
things that we're focused on and how

9
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:52,830
we're continuing to move our industry
forward but I believe there's a much

10
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:59,820
deeper reality collectively we have
failed our customers more and more of

11
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:05,190
humanity of Industry of business society
personal information all of the things

12
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:10,649
that we do are coming online and we have
not met up to the expectations of our

13
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,729
customers they're spending more in
security and we're having more an

14
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:20,130
increased rate of breaches it is
fundamentally wrong and I don't believe

15
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:24,509
we need to take incremental steps I
believe we need to make radical steps

16
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:29,550
major steps forward far beyond the
incremental gains that we've been making

17
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:34,759
and to do that I like to maybe discuss
what I think are these three

18
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:41,160
observations provocative that maybe
allow us to step forward in a more

19
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:46,920
fundamental way the first of which I say
is that the security industry has gotten

20
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:52,860
so focused on security threats and that
this in fact is one of our greatest

21
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:58,830
weaknesses that the threat of security
and this hyper focus on addressing those

22
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:05,000
trends has prevented us from really
building a much more cyber security

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,110
capability and furthermore we're rushing
rapidly into a domain of diminishing

24
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:16,860
returns and by comparison we believe we
need to fundamentally be reducing the

25
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:21,719
attack surface as opposed to chasing
after the latest threat as Ben Franklin

26
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:24,780
said an ounce of prevention is worth a
pound of cure

27
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,180
you know fundamentally we think you can
sort of break

28
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,860
the world into these two boxes one is
reactive or chasing threats and I sort

29
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:36,540
of think about this like a bad attorney
right you follow the ambulance and then

30
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:41,548
you show up because when can you get
security budget approved right after an

31
00:02:41,549 --> 00:02:45,629
attack so that's when you show up you
know new budget and you know life is

32
00:02:45,629 --> 00:02:51,209
good and what happens you're relying on
the next set of inadequate solutions

33
00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:57,390
versus preventative proactive building
hardening patching segmentation some of

34
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:04,170
that boring stuff like a good builder
you start with a great foundation and as

35
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:07,888
we you know think about that you know we
look at this picture you know the bulk

36
00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:14,609
of our time we'd estimate 80% of our
time is spent on reactive between the

37
00:03:14,609 --> 00:03:19,620
products the technologies the people the
investments and the picture of the

38
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:25,230
future ain't no better folks because we
look to this bubbling cauldron of

39
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:32,929
innovation in the venture capital
community 72% of it is spent on reactive

40
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:38,099
fundamentally we believe you have to
turn that triangle upside down we have

41
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:42,119
to say where do we get the greatest
impact and that's where we need to make

42
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,690
our investments dollar for dollar we
need to put it where we're gonna get

43
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:51,150
radical returns and if we overlay that
picture with the Gartner framework it

44
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:55,650
agrees exactly you know they rank - all
the controls to protect the workload in

45
00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:00,120
order of how much risk it addresses and
guess what the greens a whole lot better

46
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:05,129
than the blue without trying to exhaust
the picture it says exactly this picture

47
00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:09,000
you know we need to do things like
segmenting applications reorienting

48
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,930
controls from an applications
perspective encrypting at the

49
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:17,880
application rather the level rather than
at the network link and this leads me to

50
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:23,789
my second provocative observation
application awareness lacks awareness of

51
00:04:23,789 --> 00:04:29,130
applications you know now here at RSA
this week we've probably seen 50 maybe a

52
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:33,659
hundred new product announcements I
talked about application awareness and

53
00:04:33,659 --> 00:04:38,669
the reality is they're just protocol
analyzers they have no understanding of

54
00:04:38,669 --> 00:04:42,750
the application itself and this is a
especially true when you think about

55
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:46,110
where applications are going you'll and
you know let's just take a simple

56
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:50,180
example how many of you have ever had a
hard hat do you ever wear a hard hat

57
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:54,630
right you know what's the hard hat
supposed to do protect your head right

58
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:59,969
you know pretty simple this is a modern
hard hat right and with it right you're

59
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:04,050
getting real-time information around the
machineries that you're in or the supply

60
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:07,320
chain of the factories that you're in
how many of you when you were kids

61
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:11,490
wanted to have x-ray vision yeah I know
I did I want to look at some things I

62
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:17,280
should have known but anyways right
right but think about the application

63
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:24,119
that goes behind a modern hard hat it's
a complex solution you know it isn't

64
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,200
just like one protocol going over a
couple of services that are talking to

65
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:34,380
each other it's a rich network of
different services maybe a two decade

66
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:39,450
old database of your building code maybe
some new micro services the new AR VR

67
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:46,020
capabilities that are going on a complex
application network and inside of that

68
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:51,719
right you have to say how do I go be
application-centric and understand the

69
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:58,650
application by just looking at some wire
protocol impossible it doesn't work this

70
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:03,539
leads me to my third observation your
most important security product won't be

71
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:07,800
a security product in the future you an
item at you know just think about this

72
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,690
for a second how many of you if you were
a human system a biological system right

73
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:17,310
you know do you carry around your
respirator your dialysis machine you put

74
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:23,190
yourself in a bubble to prevent viruses
no it's built in right it's part of the

75
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:29,310
system and you only go to the respirator
or dialysis when an emergency all of the

76
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:34,110
security systems need to be built in
this is my favorite security picture

77
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:40,980
this is the industry we have wrought
isn't that awesome it's a nightmare

78
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:48,030
I was meeting with the suit the CIO of
citi bank and I said to him Don

79
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:55,818
how many server vendors do you use to
how many storage vendors do you use -

80
00:06:55,819 --> 00:07:02,389
how many networking vendors do you use
campus wireless I think it's for how

81
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:11,360
many security vendors that you use 250
this complexity is killing us we have an

82
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,550
opportunity to change this picture you
know we've begun to shift this picture

83
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:20,259
in a dramatic way and you know we're in
this journey I run a large company

84
00:07:20,259 --> 00:07:26,539
25,000 people almost 9,000 billion in
revenue we are changing our model of how

85
00:07:26,539 --> 00:07:34,039
we run VMware is IT when we started in
2015 we have 75 products we have halved

86
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:38,360
it and we're on a journey to have it
again our objective is to get to less

87
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:44,180
than 25 security products because we're
building more of the security systems

88
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:49,270
into our infrastructure into the network
into the storage systems into the

89
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:55,008
operations of our end-users building it
into the infrastructure and for us this

90
00:07:55,009 --> 00:08:00,080
idea of simplifying reducing because how
in the world do you take 250 products

91
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,530
and keep them patched update and make
sure right they're working with each

92
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:07,900
other validated with each other just
insanity we have to decrease that

93
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:13,698
complexity and this is our focus at
VMware is building this model where

94
00:08:13,699 --> 00:08:18,770
we're consistently reducing the attack
surface we're securing the applications

95
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:24,380
and the data and we're making security
intrinsic and as we think about this you

96
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:29,030
know it's not taking a security box
turning it into a blade and stuffing it

97
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:33,380
into a router and calling it intrinsic
security you know that's packaged it may

98
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:36,099
be good for the sales guys but it
doesn't change your security

99
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:40,909
architecture it doesn't help you in this
problem you know it needs to become a

100
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:46,189
distributed service that follows and is
aware of the applications that it is

101
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:50,870
delivering the data and the services you
put another way our goal is to leverage

102
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:56,270
the power of the cloud in order to
secure the cloud you know what does this

103
00:08:56,270 --> 00:09:01,930
shift look like in practice how would we
you know go implement to that scale now

104
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:06,469
we are refactoring and reconsidering
this basic notion of a fire

105
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:10,820
wall and we all understand a firewall
you know largely around north-south

106
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:16,450
traffic right at the edge right of your
environment but in today's multi-cloud

107
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:21,770
micro-service world
there ain't no edge there's no place to

108
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:26,540
block and it still serves a purpose but
minimally so let's look back at this

109
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:32,150
application picture that we started that
before how do you see your

110
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:37,340
infrastructure through the lens of the
apps that are running on it you know

111
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:41,600
what we would say is we need to have
known good what is the services and the

112
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,280
relationship of those services that form
that application the roles and the

113
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:50,600
intended behaviors of each of those
machines and how they're supposed to

114
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:55,160
communicate we would then say you know
by that understanding right you know

115
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:59,990
what are the core things that are
supposed to be happening rather than the

116
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:05,300
50 million that aren't supposed to be
happening and when we understand those

117
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:11,120
good behaviors and force known good and
do it at the networking level how

118
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:16,580
they're communicating with each other as
well as at the application level and at

119
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:20,930
the if we do it at those two levels and
we have those working with each other

120
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:26,390
we believe we've cracked the problem in
a fundamental way and as we think about

121
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:29,840
what we're doing with the virtual
machine level and at the Software

122
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:34,670
Defined Networking level we can leverage
the infrastructure in a powerful way as

123
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:38,930
never before
think about the virtual machine as we

124
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:44,599
launch that application we know the DNA
we know the birth certificate of the

125
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,860
application itself we know what it's
running how its provision what it's

126
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:54,890
supposed to be doing you know and it
sits outside the host the virtual

127
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:58,250
machine right you know it can't be
tampered with you can't simply turn off

128
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:03,260
a virus protection right agent that's
added into the kernel right it sits

129
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:08,420
outside of it but it has full knowledge
of what is going on at the application

130
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:13,670
level and it's distributed it's
everywhere and it moves with the

131
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:19,699
application and the services that are
running inside of it and it

132
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:23,810
from all the hosts we were also building
a network service that allows all of

133
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:27,890
that information across all applications
that are running everywhere to be

134
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:32,900
working learning and applying that it's
a completely distributed machine

135
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:38,420
learning application from birth through
life and the execution of that entire

136
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:43,099
environment and we simply call that a
service defined firewall

137
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:49,400
it's a firewall reimagined done fully
and software with the considerations of

138
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:53,959
an entirely distributed and complex set
of apps and services

139
00:11:53,960 --> 00:12:01,490
it's the firewall for the cloud era we
simply say this is enormous impact

140
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:05,810
because we're dramatically reducing the
attack surface we're building a

141
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:11,119
foundation that has us looking at tens
or hundreds of things as opposed to

142
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:18,760
billions of things not only does it make
it easier for you to harden your surface

143
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:22,910
anybody who attempts to attack it
becomes more more difficult without

144
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:29,140
exposing themselves this is the journey
that we're on to build and deliver a

145
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:35,240
software-defined agile machine learning
infrastructure that builds at intrinsic

146
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:41,810
security into the infrastructure itself
to truly build a firm foundation for a

147
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:47,959
secure future but I'd like to take a
moment and hear from a practitioner and

148
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:53,900
see if they agree on how this world
could and should be so it's my pleasure

149
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:58,520
now to be joined on stage by san-chan
and leach Lietz

150
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:03,020
and Shannon is a practitioners
practitioner she's lived in the trenches

151
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:07,910
a deep understanding of how modern
attacks work she's the leader of into

152
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:12,380
its red team she's also the leader of
their dev SEC Ops function she's also

153
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:17,180
the founder of the dev sac ops
foundation and beyond her day-to-day

154
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:21,199
responsibilities and Intuit she's
helping to chart the course for where

155
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:26,450
the security industry needs to go next
please join me in welcoming Shannon

156
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:29,860
leads to the stage Shannon

157
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:39,100
thanks fat hey so good to have you here
with a shammy very good

158
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:43,120
so Shayna and I sort of laid out these
three provocative questions sort of

159
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,260
picking on everybody in the audience
making sure nobody likes me so maybe you

160
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:51,730
can join me in this do you sort of agree
with these perspectives maybe starting

161
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:56,200
out with this you know reducing the
attack surface yeah you know a reducing

162
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:00,970
attack surface is a great thing for the
industry to think about I can't agree

163
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:05,770
more with a lot of the things that you
guys were talking about earlier and the

164
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:09,850
vision and the mission is something I'm
very spirited about reducing attack

165
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:14,770
surface and changing the way that we're
doing things is really something that's

166
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:19,510
near and dear to my heart
effectively I remember when I was trying

167
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:24,040
to reduce attack surface and I'll tell a
little bit of a story here please do you

168
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:28,660
know chasing attacks at one point in my
career actually was a big letdown I

169
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:35,500
remember about eight years ago in April
2011 during a crisis when many of the

170
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:41,410
great methods for security really didn't
help effectively I ended up sleeping on

171
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:49,449
a cot for 45 days tripod right yeah
sleeping on a cot for 45 days and as you

172
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:53,550
can imagine that was great I had an 18
month old at the time it was really

173
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:57,550
disheartening and the reason why that
happened is because the great methods

174
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:04,050
that we all know and love firewalls IDs
laughs everybody knows those ones right

175
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:08,770
let me see pen testing all of the things
that you could even imagine were applied

176
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:13,240
they got applied and even those things
weren't helpful for chasing down attacks

177
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:17,830
and I think that that's essentially one
of the reasons why we have to change our

178
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:22,810
approach because when we started to put
things back together we didn't start

179
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:26,709
thinking about it from a firewalling
perspective or adding on security or or

180
00:15:26,709 --> 00:15:30,699
doing those things but essentially how
much could we actually reduce the attack

181
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:35,800
surface get down to some bare basic
component parts gets a secured

182
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,750
components so things that were actually
into the applications and effectively

183
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:43,810
get down to known paths how could we
actually reduce what an attacker was

184
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:47,800
going to do so I think you know from
overall

185
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,969
for me that meant that chasing down
threats was essentially a big deal

186
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:55,570
uh-huh
so it's fundamentally right you know

187
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:59,380
didn't work you got to spend a whole lot
of lace right sleeping out of your cot

188
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:03,790
and somebody said chase down threats was
so important right so how about the

189
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:08,439
second one focus on the apps versus the
infrastructure and devices do you agree

190
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:12,370
yeah I think so and and this one was
another one where you know there's a lot

191
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:17,470
of pain that goes into putting together
security for applications when you're

192
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:22,899
doing things for infrastructure devices
securing those infrastructure devices if

193
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:27,760
you can imagine we're gonna focus all of
our energy on let me see routers and

194
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:33,370
servers and switches but that doesn't
seem to be right because essentially we

195
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:39,660
build technology now to solve for
customers with applications and data and

196
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:44,290
by focusing on infrastructure we just
have the wrong frame of mind the wrong

197
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:49,209
vision or the wrong mission as well and
I think that that also creates silos and

198
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:54,760
divisions and our companies that are
truly disempowering and they make it

199
00:16:54,760 --> 00:17:00,010
hard for us to do the right thing
ultimately that's led to lots of people

200
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:03,819
who don't know how to come together on
securing the applications and data that

201
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:08,020
they have it means that you've got
developers and security working not

202
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:12,400
hand-in-hand to be able to make
adversaries go away but essentially on

203
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:17,050
the things that actually may not matter
so that's number two and number three

204
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:21,849
this idea of intrinsic my are bolted on
my favorite picture of the security

205
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:28,480
landscape what do you think this one
breaks my heart actually not because the

206
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,620
technology isn't awesome there's a lot
of awesome technology out there but I

207
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:36,879
feel like we've gotten to a point in the
industry where complexity has really

208
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,890
become the enemy of security and what I
mean by that is if you look at this it's

209
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:46,419
wonderful to see so many people
dedicated to the mission of securing the

210
00:17:46,419 --> 00:17:53,380
technology that we have but with so many
boxes and so much breakup it means that

211
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:58,990
people and context can't come together
and for me that's just a big flaming

212
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:04,179
mess and I think essentially
we have to come up with a different

213
00:18:04,179 --> 00:18:08,380
approach and for the deficit cops
movement what we've really focused on is

214
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:14,500
taking security features moving them
closer to developers moving those into

215
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:19,150
the developer tools and platforms and
helping security to become more

216
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:24,850
intrinsic agents are on a sprawl at this
point there's so much complexity if you

217
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:28,449
ask a developer to go leverage one of
these tools they have to be a

218
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:33,250
practitioner with lots of years of
experience and frankly we're seeing this

219
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:37,240
change not come to bear so I really the
one thing I would tell you that I'm

220
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:41,980
really encouraged about is seeing those
security features go into the develop

221
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:46,419
platforms seeing that somebody who is
using one platform to be able to move

222
00:18:46,419 --> 00:18:50,860
their code all the way through us the
OSD ICD pipeline is able to do it with

223
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:56,080
security in tow is really something I
think is going to be a leading mission

224
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:01,510
for this industry for the next ten years
and frankly one additional thing to keep

225
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:04,809
in mind is that as we move security
features into these workloads it means

226
00:19:04,809 --> 00:19:08,860
that there's lots of data that we can
use at our disposal to make adversaries

227
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:14,559
jobs a lot harder so for me the
developer voice has to become triumphant

228
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:18,580
and that we need to get them to really
want to see more security features at

229
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:22,389
their disposal that they can use that
are easier and that we put customers

230
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:28,150
applications and data first well so
three provocative ideas I think you

231
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:31,330
agree with all three of them so do you
think we can pull these together and

232
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:35,500
make a major step forward I couldn't
agree more and if I could inspire anyone

233
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:39,820
here in the audience to simply take that
next step forward to look at all these

234
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:43,149
solutions and to realize that they need
to get built into the platforms that

235
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:47,980
everybody's using to create software on
a daily basis I feel like we've got a

236
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:52,360
big win that'll help to move this tide
forward I think in 10 years we're gonna

237
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:57,520
see a lot more capabilities that are out
there with feature sets that we've all

238
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,270
put into these workloads and we're gonna
feel really good that we've changed the

239
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:07,150
next generation of computing by putting
it into a more secure place and if not

240
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:10,960
for ourselves we need to be able to do
this for our children and most

241
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,130
importantly I am out here because I
believe that my girls deserve this

242
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:18,160
well thank you so much ladies and
gentlemen please thank Shane elites

243
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:28,510
thank you so much so I'd suggest these
three simple steps as calls to action as

244
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:34,030
you look forward first it's time to flip
the security model on its head stop

245
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:38,710
chasing threats start investing in
protection build the house and the

246
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:44,980
foundation move beyond the latest attack
focus all your best minds and people and

247
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:50,080
investments into reducing the attack
surface build the foundation second it's

248
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:56,020
about the applications I would say fire
all of you CISOs fire all of your

249
00:20:56,020 --> 00:21:02,350
security people tomorrow and hire them
back after they've built an application

250
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:09,549
and every one of your apps people have
them go live in the sock for a while you

251
00:21:09,549 --> 00:21:14,530
have to make this shift how you think
about application centric and we believe

252
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:18,158
some of the capabilities that we're
announcing here such as service defined

253
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:22,659
firewalls we believe a radical step
forward fundamentally changes how you do

254
00:21:22,659 --> 00:21:28,210
this and as we said security must become
intrinsic set a goal to cut your

255
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:32,799
security products in half and when
you've done that do it again and then it

256
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:37,240
might be simple enough that you actually
can make it operational scale and robust

257
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:43,789
enough to change your security vector
for the future thank you very much

258
00:21:43,789 --> 00:21:45,850
you

259
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,340
you
