1
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:14,610
yeah I always thought the most revealing
question was Robert DeNiro or Brad Pitt

2
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:19,029
but I learned a lot sitting backstage
and watching who stood up and who didn't

3
00:00:19,029 --> 00:00:22,600
so I've got a good feel for the crowd
I consider it absolutely an honor and a

4
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,990
privilege to be able to speak to you for
the next there's no counter next

5
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:30,729
seventeen and a half minutes and I'll be
joined a little bit later by sander Joy

6
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:33,970
so I'm gonna give a little bit of a
historical perspective of my experience

7
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:39,670
in cybersecurity since 1993 to 2017
sander Joyce is going to come up and

8
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:44,170
give so what did we witness in 2018 and
then we're going to talk about what do

9
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:47,739
we think is next based on what we've
witnessed one of the things I also want

10
00:00:47,739 --> 00:00:51,699
to do at the front is just thank all the
men and women that are here at RSA that

11
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:56,860
cybersecurity is your calling and I
appreciate all the work that you do and

12
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:02,649
let's hope that that work becomes easier
to do every single year and everything

13
00:01:02,649 --> 00:01:05,830
I'm speaking about is based on direct
observable just things I've experienced

14
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:09,910
I may be wrong I may have had different
experiences than many of you as you were

15
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:13,840
practitioners over the last several
decades or even before I started doing

16
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,910
this my first job was computer security
at the Pentagon and I have to admit it

17
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:22,390
wasn't my first choice
I got stationed as a second lieutenant

18
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:26,800
to the Pentagon and the best I can
recall all the other choices didn't seem

19
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:31,630
very enticing so I chose computer
security as the least bad of the other

20
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:38,560
five choices and 27 years later here I
stand can't do math very well 26 years

21
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,330
later so the first generation of cyber
incidents that I saw comes from that

22
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:48,849
perspective of I was in United States
Air Force and at that time when we saw

23
00:01:48,849 --> 00:01:55,630
intrusions between and the first one
that I saw was in 1995 from 1995 to 1998

24
00:01:55,630 --> 00:02:00,310
the intrusions that we saw where servers
being compromised they were on the

25
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:05,319
Internet it was UNIX systems being
compromised ultimately when we did the

26
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:10,330
forensics the exploits were publicly
available the code to do the exploits

27
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:15,219
were usually publicly available it was a
technical challenge we didn't have

28
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:18,220
lawyers showing up we didn't have
business line owners showing up

29
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:24,100
yet and anything we saw was either
government on government or it was in

30
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:28,660
fact an attractive nuisance and probably
the first case that ever worked was in

31
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:34,450
the summer of either 96 or 97 I should
say the first case where I saw evidence

32
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:38,950
that made me go okay this is going to
change things was I was doing network

33
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:46,450
security monitoring I had a site where
back then whenever we did consensual

34
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:49,630
monitoring we did have to brief the
Judge Advocate General that we're

35
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:54,459
getting fruitful responses to our
monitoring on a daily basis so for those

36
00:02:54,459 --> 00:02:56,860
yeah I think the government watches
everything all the time

37
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:00,940
at least when I worked for the US
government we did not and we had to go

38
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:05,230
through lots of approvals to do so and
it was pretty aggressive when we did we

39
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:09,940
would monitor and minimize as much as
possible and on the first day that we

40
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:14,440
did this network monitoring at a
university the first thing I witnessed

41
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:19,209
was well as the next day because at a
post process and get this it was lippy

42
00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:24,370
cap format files had to replay them and
write on replay we saw somebody come in

43
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:29,290
from at that time it was registered that
a Beijing communications Bureau come

44
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:33,070
into this university use an account that
will used to belong to a student that

45
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:37,600
graduated a year before and from that
account they did nothing more than back

46
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:44,920
then telnet and they tell NetID to at
least 25 military bases in the first

47
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,820
connection that I saw and what was
amazing about this session what made it

48
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:53,310
different and other things I'd responded
to when I was in the Air Force was I

49
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:56,950
already solved division of labor
somebody was logging in they would hit

50
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:01,268
wright-patterson air force base then
Brookhaven then Oak Ridge and Los Alamos

51
00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:05,709
National Labs just they were just
validating credentials so whoever was

52
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:08,739
telling it through site and the very
first command they did when I got a

53
00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:12,239
prompt to just go to next one and all
the user accounts and passphrases

54
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,200
weren't the same so they already had in
my opinion someone over there had

55
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,950
figured out let's vet the accounts we
have let's make sure they work and then

56
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:24,099
it was like a different person or a
different group potentially that was

57
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:29,770
coming in behind using those counts to
do things but bottom line 1993 that's

58
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:34,448
when I started doing this by nineteen
95-96 we're seeing at least the cases

59
00:04:34,449 --> 00:04:39,489
that I worked we would have attributed
at that time to Russia or China but I

60
00:04:39,489 --> 00:04:44,638
have a very us centric set of
experiences at that stage right around

61
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,239
1996 is one I think Windows NT starts to
propagate you can now point-and-click to

62
00:04:49,239 --> 00:04:53,529
do a server people are going online to
make money and you're starting to get

63
00:04:53,529 --> 00:04:59,558
web servers running NT 3.86 you have is
web servers going out there and you're

64
00:04:59,559 --> 00:05:03,669
having the databases storing credit
cards either on the same machine or just

65
00:05:03,669 --> 00:05:07,209
you know one hop away with no
segmentation in between and we see

66
00:05:07,209 --> 00:05:11,979
cybercrime hit this so you have the
ongoing state versus state but now you

67
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:17,860
enter new operating system you enter new
way to make money and wherever money

68
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:22,539
goes crime follows and we started
responding to much more incidents that

69
00:05:22,539 --> 00:05:26,349
involved making money and just yesterday
I was talking to a reporter Joseph man

70
00:05:26,349 --> 00:05:29,469
he wrote a book on the cult of the dead
cow and I started thinking about it in

71
00:05:29,469 --> 00:05:33,759
the 90s everybody starts hearing about
hacking because of things like what they

72
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,959
did at loft crack what they do at the
cold a dead cow with back orifice and I

73
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:42,539
remember my war story from that era
they're never really that fun because I

74
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:47,199
remember a lot of times when an attack
came out there wasn't an available patch

75
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:52,539
we didn't get that battle rhythm yet as
a community finds erode a patch quickly

76
00:05:52,539 --> 00:05:57,878
good to go I remember an attack called
the MDOC attack in 2000 there's a dll

77
00:05:57,879 --> 00:06:01,839
that shipped with Windows NT is web
servers that was vulnerable and just

78
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:05,379
somebody was spraying the whole Internet
and I remember spending my Halloween

79
00:06:05,379 --> 00:06:11,439
which in my 20s is still great holiday
and I had to go from computer computer

80
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:16,269
at a major bank just patching machines
to make sure it didn't happen so cyber

81
00:06:16,269 --> 00:06:19,779
crimes here to stay
it's changed more recently but again I

82
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:24,249
didn't see a change so the third phase
in my career of just responding to

83
00:06:24,249 --> 00:06:28,479
breach is figuring out what happened and
what to do about it came when I got a

84
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:33,369
phone call from somebody and I could
tell that the groups that I was

85
00:06:33,369 --> 00:06:38,050
responding to in the US military that
were hacking the US military had pivoted

86
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:42,399
to the United States defense industrial
base and at that time it was a targeted

87
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:47,119
Spearfish there was no defense for it
I felt that the private sector were

88
00:06:47,119 --> 00:06:51,110
sitting ducks for what we were gonna see
if this pivot occurred that pivot did

89
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:55,339
occur and we saw espionage units
starting to broaden their targeting

90
00:06:55,339 --> 00:07:00,080
broaden to scout which they operated and
now we have a tax that our government on

91
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,789
government and government versus private
sector which I always said equated to

92
00:07:04,789 --> 00:07:08,808
your grandparents in an Ultimate
Fighting Championship bout

93
00:07:08,809 --> 00:07:13,039
it's not pretty the government's will
beat the private sector when they start

94
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,308
doing that and we have to live with that
even today and you're gonna see an

95
00:07:16,309 --> 00:07:22,459
acceleration then of phases because for
the first 20 years of my career of doing

96
00:07:22,459 --> 00:07:29,119
computer security at only three phases
in August of 2013 all of a sudden were

97
00:07:29,119 --> 00:07:32,539
starting to deal with something called
the Syrian electronic army we hadn't

98
00:07:32,539 --> 00:07:36,649
heard of them before and it was it took
me that long 18 years of responding to

99
00:07:36,649 --> 00:07:41,029
breaches before I saw a pattern between
geopolitical conditions and what

100
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:44,719
attackers were doing and I had to hear
it from somebody else in fact I just

101
00:07:44,719 --> 00:07:47,779
would show up as a nerd and go here's
what happened here's what to do about it

102
00:07:47,779 --> 00:07:52,759
let's get out of Dodge suddenly we're
responding to media they're being

103
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:55,969
compromised the Syrian electronic army
and at that time

104
00:07:55,969 --> 00:08:01,969
there's use of chemical weapons in
August of 2013 by Assad troops against

105
00:08:01,969 --> 00:08:07,610
Syrian rebels and the United States had
a doctrine to intervene in the use of

106
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:11,689
chemical weapons anywhere in the world
so there was basically a threat of armed

107
00:08:11,689 --> 00:08:16,490
conflict at that point and we saw
whoever to see an electronic army was

108
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:19,639
they were using hacking to get their
message out and I know I miss plenty of

109
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:23,300
examples on that hacktivism has been
around a lot longer but what I want to

110
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:27,769
show you is the acceleration of phase
changing because in 2014 something else

111
00:08:27,769 --> 00:08:33,409
also happened and we'll get back to 2018
in 2014 November that year right before

112
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:37,399
Thanksgiving I got a call about the Sony
breach and one of our frontline folks

113
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:42,979
respond a priest says it thinks it's
North Korea 2015 August of 2015

114
00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:48,110
something I've never seen in my whole
career happens all in one month we see

115
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:53,300
in August of 2015 Chinese cyber
espionage campaigns come way down and

116
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:56,899
they didn't change their methods they
just literally decreased volume of

117
00:08:56,899 --> 00:09:00,530
attack against United States one
month before our head of state met with

118
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:04,760
their head of state to have a treaty
signed and at the same time frame we saw

119
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:09,530
Russia do three things differently one
start targeting universities not for

120
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:14,540
defensive purposes but to steal the
email of anti-putin professors second

121
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:17,750
they stopped doing the count of
forensics and OPSEC that I was used to

122
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:21,800
seeing in forensics and third we were
responding to breaches putting eyes on

123
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:26,060
target they knew we were watching them
and it didn't cease their activities

124
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:30,170
which meant they were getting a little
bit more bold so a lot of change in 15

125
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:36,560
in 2016
we saw additional changes in 2017 I kind

126
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,660
of dubbed it the year of Iran and the
year of the self-propagating spreaders

127
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:45,199
you know you have one a cry of non petia
and petea and these are things that are

128
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,210
indiscriminate go out and hack what you
can and create lots of collateral damage

129
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:54,380
so you're seeing an acceleration of the
phases that were going through in

130
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:59,240
cybersecurity now I'd like to welcome to
the stage our senior vice president of

131
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:03,590
threat intelligence sander Joyce she's
gonna take the lessons we learned from

132
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:08,570
frontline responders from over 150
threat analysts that speak 32 languages

133
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:13,070
that reside in 19 countries and from
thousands of our product customers and

134
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:18,130
she's going to bring that to light so
sundar would you please join me

135
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:29,020
sandir yeah 9 minutes and 48 seconds
right so let's get right to the point

136
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:32,860
okay
2018 let's see some of the observables

137
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:37,030
there of what you saw and what the team
concluded well as the head of threat

138
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:40,990
intelligence I never get to tell good
news but I actually have some good news

139
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:46,990
for you today we publish M trends every
year and these are the indicators and

140
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:52,330
the the events that are happening as we
do our incident responses and what we

141
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:56,590
learn from there and what we saw was
that dwell times continue to drop

142
00:10:56,590 --> 00:11:01,510
globally and this is very important
because most incidents that happen

143
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:04,900
actually start with legitimate
credentials so you really need to pay

144
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:09,370
attention to what's happening post
breach and what we saw was the median

145
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:17,260
global dwell time drop in 2011 from 416
days down to 78 in 2018 so that's good

146
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:23,170
news we have more good news later but we
want to spread it out so I want to get

147
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:26,650
right to some of the modern nations and
by the way we're not anti China we're

148
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:31,120
not anti Russia we go where the breaches
are we do attribution because we think

149
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,050
if you hold people accountable you can
at least impose risks or repercussions

150
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:40,030
or at least have dialogue about rules of
engagement it just so happens that the

151
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:43,120
first country I would like to talk about
is North Korea and some of the

152
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:48,220
observables we have on what they did in
2018 right so we have two groups I want

153
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:53,050
to talk to you about North Korea that we
looked at in 2018 very specifically so

154
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:58,209
one of them is apt 37 and this is a
North Korean sponsored group and the

155
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:02,470
reason it was really interesting to us
in 2018 and we wanted to tell the global

156
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:07,480
security community about it was because
we watched this group we used to call it

157
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:12,820
Reaper just target very locally to the
peninsula but then we watched it evolve

158
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:18,700
over time we watched it become more
technically and sophisticated started to

159
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:23,890
use it and exploit zero-days they
started to target internationally and

160
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:28,300
they even had some evidence that they
had destructive malware they hadn't used

161
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:31,599
it yet but we thought this was
definitely something we needed to keep

162
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,830
an eye on and North Korea continues to
punch above its weight class definitely

163
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:38,950
and there's
four out of North Korea I'm fascinated

164
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:43,780
by the next group right the next group
is apt 38 and the reason this is really

165
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:49,180
interesting as before we used to always
think of nation-states really as purely

166
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:53,680
espionage doing the things that carry
out national security goals and what we

167
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:59,410
saw was a group abt 38 that was actually
financially motivated remember the North

168
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:03,969
Korea exists pretty much outside of the
international financial system they have

169
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:09,880
the pressure of sanctions and they're a
p38 was incredibly sophisticated using

170
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:14,920
espionage skills to steal money from
financial institutions all around the

171
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:20,979
world so this was basically bank robbers
with the skills of spies and they not

172
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:25,120
just that once they would move the money
out and I'm talking hundreds of millions

173
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,840
of dollars once they would do that they
would deploy destructive malware to

174
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:32,830
distract our incident responders so this
was something we definitely wanted to

175
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:37,270
put out publicly so that people could be
aware of it that's fantastic and now

176
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:40,750
North Korea is not alone a lot of other
nations are developing offensive

177
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:44,710
capability and following so you know
it's not like they published their cyber

178
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:49,210
doctor and here's what we will do and
here's what we won't do what did Iran do

179
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:54,730
in 2018 Iran was really interesting
because in apt 39 is a group we've also

180
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:58,570
been tracking for a while but what we
saw with this one that was really unique

181
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:02,920
was that it was carrying out national
security goals that were really targeted

182
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:09,040
to individuals so telecommunications
industry travel industry the word less

183
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,310
about the organization's they were
targeting and more about actual

184
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:19,060
individuals that were of interest to the
Iranian government okay and again I did

185
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:23,739
Doug 2017 from my perspective inside of
the walls of fire I the year of Iran it

186
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:27,010
was a year where we responded to
breaches from Iranian threat actors or

187
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:30,939
what we would have attributed to Iranian
threat actors almost as much as from

188
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:34,540
Russia or China so I think they're
getting much more active and by the way

189
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:38,439
we have internal bets on what's the next
nation we're going to start seeing out

190
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:43,600
there as we do our attribution have to
have a conversation about China and how

191
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,310
prolific they are right and China never
really stopped stealing intellectual

192
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:51,489
property but what we saw them do
differently was

193
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:56,020
they started to change from commercial
IP theft after the Obama XI agreement

194
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:59,949
and we started to see them actually
really focus on military and dual use

195
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:05,260
technologies one group in particular a
PT 40 really stood out to us because

196
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:10,120
they've been doing traditional espionage
for a long time but this is something

197
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:15,220
where they're really promoting a very
international agenda through the Belton

198
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:20,950
Road initiative and also to uphold the
maritime and naval capabilities of

199
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:25,630
Chinese government and so we've watched
what a group that we used to call

200
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:30,970
periscope abt 40 would go ahead and
target organizations that anything to do

201
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:36,160
with the Belton Road initiative to
further their agenda and then you know

202
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,180
the big four when you look at Western
targets and what nations are attacking

203
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:44,560
those Western targets what could you
tell us about what brushes activities

204
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:49,149
were like well Russia continues to be
very disconcerning for us you know when

205
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:54,279
we think about them in 2015-2016
sandworm team targeting you the

206
00:15:54,279 --> 00:16:01,089
Ukrainian electrical grid and then they
moved on in 2017 - what a ICS framework

207
00:16:01,089 --> 00:16:05,020
where the they used Triton malware and
the thing that was really disconcerting

208
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:10,540
about this was that it wasn't just about
you know espionage or anything like that

209
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:16,209
they actually targeted the safety
systems of an ICS plant and that means

210
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:20,170
that that was the last step I mean the
safety systems at an ICS facility or the

211
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:25,149
last thing between you know that risks
human life there so that actually

212
00:16:25,149 --> 00:16:29,260
resulted in the shutdown of the entire
plant something that we're not we don't

213
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:34,600
think was actually intentional Wow
so I got a sender we got three minutes

214
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:41,350
and 40 seconds what's next so we brought
you through from 1993 till now as fast

215
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:46,709
as we could talk New Jersey auctioneer
speed what's next from your perspective

216
00:16:46,709 --> 00:16:51,550
unfortunately if things continue the way
that they are with brazen actions

217
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:56,949
increasingly destructive and disruptive
attacks with no guardrails on it I think

218
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:59,560
people are going to get hurt
I think people are gonna get hurt you

219
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:04,609
want to expound on that or well what
we're seeing is that sometimes even

220
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:08,089
the main target of what some of these
destructive attacks are doing don't

221
00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:12,559
actually end there we're seeing
secondary and tertiary effects you know

222
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:17,240
if you look at not Pecha that might have
been targeted at Ukraine because it

223
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:22,099
actually it used a software update
mechanism in ME doc which is a tax

224
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:26,448
preparation service but we all know what
happended up happening tens of billions

225
00:17:26,449 --> 00:17:31,130
of dollars were actually resulted in
damage from that and we're not sure that

226
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:35,720
that was actually the original intent
so as these things continue to get out

227
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:40,460
of control we really need to think about
what steps could be taken to to curb

228
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:44,840
those threats well Sandra I want to
thank you very much I love this honorees

229
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:49,909
about 2018 and in the next 2 minutes and
20 seconds I'll tell you what I think is

230
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:56,750
Thank You Sandra by the way somebody
will be saying well where's United

231
00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:01,309
States and all this we report what we
see so if the United States is on

232
00:18:01,309 --> 00:18:05,590
offense they must be doing it in
countries that don't hire us to respond

233
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:12,110
the and and they're not hacking for
money in the United States so what is

234
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:15,799
next from my perspective one of the
things that I do believe in is we are

235
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:19,340
gonna have to come up with a set of
rules the asymmetry between offense and

236
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:23,689
defense it's always harder to defend
I've always used the 1980s analogy

237
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:27,679
that's how long I've been doing this
it's when you're up against nations and

238
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,740
and and every time we meet a victim
compromised by one of these groups

239
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:35,240
they're not just military it's not the
government it's the private sector being

240
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:39,530
compromised and they're starting to go
why would a nation hack us it's because

241
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:43,399
we don't have established rules and
we're starting to set baselines where we

242
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:47,630
expect certain industries to withstand
cyber military attacks so I think it'll

243
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:52,700
go a long way for all of us to figure
out how do we stop the escalation in

244
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:56,780
cyber and when I look at 2018 by the way
it's my conclusion and I try to read all

245
00:18:56,780 --> 00:19:01,639
of forensic reports I didn't see an
escalation in 18 compared to 17 it's

246
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:06,799
almost like the whole global actors
sphere said hey let's kind of plateau a

247
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:12,800
little bit the thing is all we can
determine about doctrine is by what we

248
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:16,340
observe and I know there are groups
working on doctrine but because of the

249
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:21,889
asymmetry that one good hacker can
create the work for all of us defenders

250
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:25,940
it's just an unfair fight right now and
it'll change the way life the second

251
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:29,059
thing that I think will happen is the
world's already starting to balkanize

252
00:19:29,059 --> 00:19:34,809
the internet based on expectations of
privacy anonymity and identification

253
00:19:34,809 --> 00:19:39,350
period it's just starting to happen you
see with data sovereignty issues you can

254
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:44,750
see that privacy is a cultural decision
by either the regimes that run countries

255
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:49,820
or by the populations depending on
government type and it doesn't appear

256
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:55,250
that one set of rules fits the whole
internet and we should expect that but

257
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:58,520
what I'm witnessing over the last few
years and as I travel the globe I do

258
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:02,418
feel like there's more of a
compartmentalizing the data countries

259
00:20:02,419 --> 00:20:06,049
kind of circling the wagons on their
perimeters and the great thing that

260
00:20:06,049 --> 00:20:10,370
connected us is kind of coming and
closing in a little bit and the last

261
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:14,809
thing I'd say is as we come up with
rules for how countries should behave

262
00:20:14,809 --> 00:20:18,889
during times of peace we'll have nations
that abide by them nations that don't

263
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:22,580
Nations that wish they could but don't
even have the IT infrastructure to prove

264
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:26,990
they are the citizens and the nations I
can't abide by those rules will end up

265
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:31,210
having drastically different experiences
on the internet than the folks that are

266
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:41,160
in a more free world thank you very much
for your time appreciate it

267
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,540
you
