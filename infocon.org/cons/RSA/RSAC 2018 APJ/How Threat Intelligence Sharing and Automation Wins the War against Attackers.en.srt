1
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:17,050
thank you so much appreciate you coming

2
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:19,900
to a session very late in the conference

3
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:23,950
and I've got some really exciting things

4
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:27,180
to speak with you about I've spent the

5
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:30,579
last two-and-a-half years working

6
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:33,340
specifically with security automation

7
00:00:30,579 --> 00:00:37,030
and orchestration and then applying that

8
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:40,210
to the Security Response process as well

9
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:42,940
as to the threat Intel and sharing

10
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:45,850
process and so I'd like to do is go over

11
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:47,800
a little bit about what we've learned as

12
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:50,370
we've gone through this and give you

13
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:53,379
some use cases and some tips as you

14
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:56,410
potentially look at using threat

15
00:00:53,379 --> 00:00:59,280
intelligence sharing and automation to

16
00:00:56,410 --> 00:01:04,498
help bolster your own security program

17
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,498
so the place I'd like to start is

18
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:10,600
there's all kinds of data out there on

19
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:14,020
just kind of where the security

20
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:16,750
landscape is today and I think we all

21
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:18,610
know that with the number of breaches

22
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:21,700
that we've seen in the news over the

23
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:24,280
last several years that all of us as

24
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:27,250
security professionals are struggling

25
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:30,610
with the Security Response process now

26
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:33,640
this is a statistic from the Pony Amon

27
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:35,920
Institute and they've one of the reasons

28
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:40,810
I like what the pony mod Institute does

29
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:43,480
with their with their data is they're

30
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:47,050
actually focused on the cost of a breach

31
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:50,050
and they do a lot of primary research

32
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:52,690
they speak with over 380 organizations

33
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:55,780
around the world and get real data

34
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:57,940
of course anonymized once they publish

35
00:01:55,780 --> 00:02:02,050
the data for it to get the aggregate of

36
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:04,360
the time it caught time it takes to work

37
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:06,820
on breaches how much financial loss

38
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:08,500
there is but one of the reasons I like

39
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:10,899
this this data is that they've been

40
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:13,030
tracking it for a number of years and so

41
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:16,209
this report came out earlier this month

42
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:21,550
and said that there were the the mean

43
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:24,290
time to identify a breach was 197 days

44
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:28,250
so just over six months

45
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:32,569
and now the number for the last several

46
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:37,780
years has been very similar in 2017 the

47
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:41,690
number was 191 in 2016 the number was

48
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:45,890
197 and in the year before that it was

49
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:48,590
201 so that data where we're looking at

50
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:52,540
it over time we're not getting better at

51
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:54,500
this as an industry now one could argue

52
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:57,620
we're getting a little bit better

53
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:59,930
because the complexity has changed

54
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:02,599
during those four years and we've stated

55
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:05,209
this consistent number but even if this

56
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:08,089
number and there's lots of organizations

57
00:03:05,209 --> 00:03:12,109
who put out similar data and even if

58
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:14,500
this number was 1/2 or 1/3 I think we'd

59
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:16,970
all say that it's still 2 it's too long

60
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:19,730
now the second number that goes with

61
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:22,430
this is the number of days it takes to

62
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:24,379
actually solve the problem so how many

63
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:27,590
days does it take to contain the breach

64
00:03:24,379 --> 00:03:30,500
and in their most recent data it came

65
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:33,530
out that it was 69 days the previous

66
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:36,739
year it was 66 the previous year before

67
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:38,930
that it was 71 so it's very consistent

68
00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:42,980
that were struggling with first

69
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:45,049
identifying and then containing and so

70
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:47,810
within ServiceNow we've done some

71
00:03:45,049 --> 00:03:51,440
research as well in terms of trying to

72
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:54,169
look at why and so as we start to look

73
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,540
at why it takes so long we found three

74
00:03:54,169 --> 00:03:59,980
major areas

75
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:03,948
the first was unpatched vulnerabilities

76
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:07,069
now this may feel very obvious to a lot

77
00:04:03,949 --> 00:04:09,109
of you we did a research study in the

78
00:04:07,069 --> 00:04:11,888
first part of this year where we spoke

79
00:04:09,109 --> 00:04:14,510
with just under 3000 individuals in

80
00:04:11,889 --> 00:04:17,989
security roles across nine different

81
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:19,940
countries and what we found there was

82
00:04:17,988 --> 00:04:22,549
actually very consistent around the

83
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:25,400
world but just under half of those

84
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:28,539
organizations had been breached in the

85
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:31,130
previous two years was actually 48% and

86
00:04:28,539 --> 00:04:34,010
the vast majority of those breaches

87
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:36,770
occurred not just because of an

88
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:38,688
unpatched vulnerability but there was an

89
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:41,688
unpatched vulnerability

90
00:04:38,689 --> 00:04:43,339
that the organization knew about they

91
00:04:41,689 --> 00:04:44,779
actually knew they had the vulnerability

92
00:04:43,339 --> 00:04:47,599
and hadn't done anything about that

93
00:04:44,779 --> 00:04:49,339
about it yet now many times when

94
00:04:47,599 --> 00:04:51,469
speaking with senior leaders within an

95
00:04:49,339 --> 00:04:53,989
organization when there's an unpatched

96
00:04:51,469 --> 00:04:55,879
vulnerability it feels like a very

97
00:04:53,989 --> 00:04:58,549
simple process right oh it's on you've

98
00:04:55,879 --> 00:05:00,169
got a vulnerability patch it but we all

99
00:04:58,549 --> 00:05:02,989
know that it's much more complex than

100
00:05:00,169 --> 00:05:04,938
that then you know updating your your

101
00:05:02,989 --> 00:05:07,008
mobile phone or updating your personal

102
00:05:04,939 --> 00:05:10,369
computer when you start to multiply that

103
00:05:07,009 --> 00:05:12,619
by hundreds or thousands or tens of

104
00:05:10,369 --> 00:05:15,139
thousands of servers and when you're

105
00:05:12,619 --> 00:05:18,259
also working you know adjacent to an IT

106
00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:20,629
department who doesn't want downtime for

107
00:05:18,259 --> 00:05:22,669
the patch it becomes a pretty big

108
00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:26,989
struggle but this was the first thing

109
00:05:22,669 --> 00:05:30,139
that we saw as a cause in this data the

110
00:05:26,989 --> 00:05:32,539
second was getting incomplete

111
00:05:30,139 --> 00:05:35,449
information when working on a security

112
00:05:32,539 --> 00:05:38,779
incident now over the last several years

113
00:05:35,449 --> 00:05:41,029
we've all put in more security

114
00:05:38,779 --> 00:05:43,219
technology you know if we would have had

115
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:46,129
this conversation ten years ago we'd be

116
00:05:43,219 --> 00:05:48,050
talking about AV signatures and maybe

117
00:05:46,129 --> 00:05:50,449
moving away and starting to look at IPs

118
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:53,239
and a few other things but over time is

119
00:05:50,449 --> 00:05:56,389
we've put in dozens of security products

120
00:05:53,239 --> 00:05:58,669
where they're whether for protection or

121
00:05:56,389 --> 00:06:00,829
detecting something that a protection

122
00:05:58,669 --> 00:06:03,979
product may have missed all of them

123
00:06:00,829 --> 00:06:06,829
generate an alert and those alerts for

124
00:06:03,979 --> 00:06:10,878
most organizations typically go into a

125
00:06:06,829 --> 00:06:12,589
mailbox and the the security analyst

126
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:15,379
goes and picks those up and starts to

127
00:06:12,589 --> 00:06:17,689
work on them but a lot of times they're

128
00:06:15,379 --> 00:06:19,399
missing a lot of information where you

129
00:06:17,689 --> 00:06:21,619
might understand what the problem is and

130
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:24,079
you know security we kind of live in a

131
00:06:21,619 --> 00:06:26,300
world of IP addresses and so we'd get

132
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:28,369
information about the IP address of the

133
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:31,399
affected system and maybe a lot of

134
00:06:28,369 --> 00:06:35,029
information about potential URLs or

135
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:37,489
malicious payload etc and but what we're

136
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:40,009
missing is a lot of context about what

137
00:06:37,489 --> 00:06:45,258
the actual system that has the problem

138
00:06:40,009 --> 00:06:48,199
is the third area is has to do with

139
00:06:45,259 --> 00:06:50,749
manual process well we've bought a lot

140
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:51,569
of different security security tools for

141
00:06:50,749 --> 00:06:53,729
protection and

142
00:06:51,569 --> 00:06:54,719
detection when it comes to actually

143
00:06:53,729 --> 00:06:56,520
doing the work

144
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:58,169
once security analysts are getting all

145
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:01,139
the information from all these different

146
00:06:58,169 --> 00:07:03,839
tools and putting them into you know and

147
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:06,119
getting this email of the Box what

148
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:07,919
happens when any of us get overwhelmed

149
00:07:06,119 --> 00:07:10,499
with information like not just in

150
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:13,649
security but in any part of our life we

151
00:07:10,499 --> 00:07:16,559
put the information into the best data

152
00:07:13,649 --> 00:07:19,259
repository we all know how to use which

153
00:07:16,559 --> 00:07:21,929
is Microsoft Excel or some sort of

154
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:23,369
spreadsheet or Google sheet we take the

155
00:07:21,929 --> 00:07:25,318
data and we put it in there we organize

156
00:07:23,369 --> 00:07:26,999
it and then as we're working through

157
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:29,430
things and we need to communicate back

158
00:07:26,999 --> 00:07:32,580
to people we might actually take that

159
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:34,529
spreadsheet and then email it off to

160
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,039
different people and ask them to go do

161
00:07:34,529 --> 00:07:37,319
work

162
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:40,289
this is another area of the research

163
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:43,409
that we did we found that in the the

164
00:07:40,289 --> 00:07:47,248
Security Response process organizations

165
00:07:43,409 --> 00:07:48,899
were losing 12 days per incident due to

166
00:07:47,249 --> 00:07:50,490
manual process where people are passing

167
00:07:48,899 --> 00:07:53,069
information back and forth via

168
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:55,529
spreadsheets and email so this is an

169
00:07:53,069 --> 00:07:56,639
area where you start thinking about you

170
00:07:55,529 --> 00:07:58,919
could start to see where this theme

171
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:01,439
comes in where there's a lot of areas

172
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:03,029
here that could be very ripe for using

173
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:05,399
some newer technologies around

174
00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:07,800
automation and this is a great place to

175
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:11,509
get started even before getting into to

176
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:14,219
using thread Intel so as you said

177
00:08:11,509 --> 00:08:16,050
automating Security Response is the

178
00:08:14,219 --> 00:08:19,009
future this is an area been working in

179
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:22,050
it for the last two and a half years and

180
00:08:19,009 --> 00:08:23,729
the industry is actually starting to

181
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:26,789
embrace it although it's still very

182
00:08:23,729 --> 00:08:29,300
early some very leading indicators are

183
00:08:26,789 --> 00:08:32,929
here at the very beginning of this year

184
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:38,240
Forrester comes out came out with a

185
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:41,250
technology predictions for for 2018 and

186
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:45,029
security automation was number three on

187
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:47,459
this list out of ten total and this was

188
00:08:45,029 --> 00:08:50,189
not security technology predictions this

189
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:52,279
was technology predictions overall so

190
00:08:50,189 --> 00:08:54,569
included things like the growth of IOT

191
00:08:52,279 --> 00:08:56,790
lots of things around machine learning

192
00:08:54,569 --> 00:08:59,459
and artificial intelligence but actually

193
00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:01,469
using secure using automation and

194
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:04,479
security was the number three technology

195
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:09,430
to watch over the next three years

196
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:12,990
a second data point is in November of

197
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:16,089
last year Gartner actually defined a

198
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:17,920
security automation market and they

199
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:20,709
called it security orchestration

200
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:23,199
automation and response and there's

201
00:09:20,709 --> 00:09:25,660
several several different types of

202
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:27,910
technologies available that to do this

203
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:30,639
but the key thing that they found was

204
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:34,480
that in the enterprise these

205
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:36,490
technologies are less than 1% penetrated

206
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,260
meaning that less than 1 of every

207
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:40,839
hundred organizations is actually

208
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:43,389
actively looking at and testing these

209
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:46,120
security automation technologies but

210
00:09:43,389 --> 00:09:49,750
what they did say is that they expect

211
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:52,000
this to grow by 15 times in the next 3

212
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:54,699
years meaning that 15 percent of

213
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,199
organizations will be using some sort of

214
00:09:54,699 --> 00:10:00,189
automation as part of their security

215
00:09:56,199 --> 00:10:03,880
process by the end of 2020 now the last

216
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:05,850
one here is from CSO and there's a

217
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:08,649
particular reason why I picked this one

218
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:12,250
they've had a list of I think it was 7

219
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:14,800
predictions and they had they were

220
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:17,290
actually more specific in the security

221
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:20,469
automation prediction they said that

222
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:24,610
automation of threat detection tasks

223
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:26,500
we're going to increase in 2018 now this

224
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:29,980
is really a really important distinction

225
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:32,829
because I think we all when I hear

226
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:34,990
automation I like I think my brain

227
00:10:32,829 --> 00:10:35,410
usually goes to something's going to

228
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:37,120
happen

229
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:38,589
and then some sort of automation

230
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,500
technology is going to fix the problem

231
00:10:38,589 --> 00:10:43,060
and so can you imagine in security if

232
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:45,730
there's some sort of security incident

233
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:47,739
and then some fancy machine learning

234
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:49,000
artificial intelligence automations

235
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:51,040
going to fix all the problems and

236
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,019
security people are going to just see

237
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,769
the outcome and be done we know it's not

238
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:59,139
realistic

239
00:10:53,769 --> 00:11:01,300
but the looking at threat detection this

240
00:10:59,139 --> 00:11:03,339
is an area that can be very interesting

241
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:07,079
for automation because this is an area

242
00:11:03,339 --> 00:11:08,470
where there's a ton of manual repetitive

243
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:10,660
cut-and-paste

244
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:12,699
tasks that teams are doing so I really

245
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:14,769
liked this part of that prediction

246
00:11:12,699 --> 00:11:16,120
because they were very specific about

247
00:11:14,769 --> 00:11:16,610
how organizations are going to be

248
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,600
looking

249
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:22,699
at using auto with automation in the

250
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,829
security in the security area and this

251
00:11:22,699 --> 00:11:27,679
is an area around doing investigation

252
00:11:24,829 --> 00:11:29,420
around research especially looking at

253
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:33,579
threat Intel sources but also sharing

254
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:33,579
that information with other people a

255
00:11:34,929 --> 00:11:38,809
little bit the other thing I put on here

256
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:41,179
the very bottom of this slide is really

257
00:11:38,809 --> 00:11:43,149
being you've you must get the basics

258
00:11:41,179 --> 00:11:46,869
right before you jump into automation

259
00:11:43,149 --> 00:11:49,549
you know as most organizations are using

260
00:11:46,869 --> 00:11:51,259
spreadsheets and email to manage a lot

261
00:11:49,549 --> 00:11:52,639
of the security response process in

262
00:11:51,259 --> 00:11:55,819
terms of working through different teams

263
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:59,420
but the equivalent of moving to

264
00:11:55,819 --> 00:12:02,509
automation would be taking a small baby

265
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:05,839
who just learned how to crawl and then

266
00:12:02,509 --> 00:12:08,329
asking that baby to go run one mile it

267
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,610
the the act of going from spreadsheets

268
00:12:08,329 --> 00:12:12,439
and email to automation is a similar

269
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:13,999
leap and there's some very basic things

270
00:12:12,439 --> 00:12:18,410
that you need to get done ahead of that

271
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:20,949
which I'm going to go over so I'm going

272
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:23,899
to go over kind of to automation

273
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:25,579
frameworks before jumping into some use

274
00:12:23,899 --> 00:12:28,339
cases that will fall within these

275
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:32,179
different frameworks so the first one

276
00:12:28,339 --> 00:12:33,889
will be around using automation for

277
00:12:32,179 --> 00:12:37,220
managing the patching or the

278
00:12:33,889 --> 00:12:39,049
vulnerability response process so the

279
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:43,309
first part of this process would be

280
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:46,100
starting with number one is taking the

281
00:12:43,309 --> 00:12:49,100
information from your vulnerability

282
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:50,360
scanner so whether that could be you

283
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:52,160
know several of the vendors that are

284
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,989
upstairs

285
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,029
but taking and some of you may use more

286
00:12:53,989 --> 00:12:58,730
than one of them but taking that data

287
00:12:56,029 --> 00:13:02,169
and whether you've got it housed by the

288
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:04,489
the vulnerability scanner themselves or

289
00:13:02,169 --> 00:13:08,239
taking that information and putting it

290
00:13:04,489 --> 00:13:10,850
into some sort of database to then go

291
00:13:08,239 --> 00:13:13,309
and process it is the first step so

292
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:16,669
you've got a single repository for all

293
00:13:13,309 --> 00:13:19,730
of the vulnerability scan data from

294
00:13:16,669 --> 00:13:21,649
there once that data comes through you

295
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:24,679
move to box number two or circle number

296
00:13:21,649 --> 00:13:27,279
two which is around automating the

297
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:29,990
prioritization of those vulnerabilities

298
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,660
now most organizations when they're

299
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:32,890
autumn

300
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:36,130
all the different vulnerable items they

301
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:38,800
have they're typically using the CBS s

302
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:40,689
score so how severe is the vulnerability

303
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:43,540
is it a one or is it a five is it an

304
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:46,060
eight and then we'll put into practice

305
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:48,040
some sort of policy on how quickly we're

306
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:50,800
going to respond to it based on that CBS

307
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:54,069
s score but if you're taking the

308
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:56,170
vulnerability scan data and then putting

309
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:58,900
it into a some sort of database where

310
00:13:56,170 --> 00:14:01,800
you can work with it you could use

311
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:04,150
automation to then take that data and

312
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:06,699
correlate it with an asset management

313
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:10,480
database so think about all the data

314
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:11,410
that IT has where IT understands what a

315
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,090
system is

316
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:14,740
who owns it what are the business

317
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:16,990
services that run on that system

318
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:19,750
what are those applications and then

319
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:23,140
what are the dependencies so if your

320
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:25,630
server a has a vulnerability but but

321
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:29,170
server a is connected to server C and

322
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:30,880
server C has PII on it server a is a

323
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:33,699
pretty important thing to go and work on

324
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:36,280
as well and so B but this is an area

325
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:38,460
that's very ripe for automation taking

326
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:41,380
an up-to-date asset management database

327
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:45,390
correlating that with scan data and then

328
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:49,420
from there moving to item number three

329
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:52,240
which is set the rules on how on the the

330
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:55,420
the data between the cbss score the

331
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:57,340
affected asset and the and the the

332
00:14:55,420 --> 00:15:00,550
information from the vulnerability

333
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:03,760
scanner and then automatically create

334
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:05,829
the change request so automatically take

335
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:08,890
in the information from from those tools

336
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:10,780
to then farm out the tasks to the right

337
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:13,600
people that say maybe you've got a group

338
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:15,430
of people who own Windows servers or

339
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,830
maybe this specific location and

340
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:20,859
automatically process all the tasks that

341
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:23,380
to that person so then they're going to

342
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:25,510
get the you get the information that

343
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:27,970
they need to then go and go and trigger

344
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:30,610
the patching in the correct priority so

345
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:33,340
not just with cbss score but also

346
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:36,130
understanding the asset and so up to

347
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:38,980
this point so going to number three we

348
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:40,990
have not had a human involved yet the

349
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:43,900
scan data you always we all scan our

350
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:45,600
regular basis taking the scan data Auto

351
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:47,770
matically correlating with a database

352
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,720
automatically from the the information

353
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:52,150
from the the scan data and the asset

354
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:55,210
management data database to then create

355
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:58,540
a rule set to then send tasks off to a

356
00:15:55,210 --> 00:16:00,520
patching team so to your organization

357
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:02,050
after you set the rule setup automation

358
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:04,120
can get you all the way to the point of

359
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:06,760
I know what I need to what the most

360
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:09,550
important items are to fix and when I'm

361
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:11,200
getting one they need to get fixed so

362
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:13,209
then when you've moved after you've gone

363
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:15,610
to number three and the person's got the

364
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:18,250
the patch request you can then move to

365
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:20,680
item number four which is then

366
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:23,020
coordinating the change planning so

367
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:25,510
depending on the severity of the problem

368
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:27,360
and the affected asset you can then set

369
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:29,260
up when am I going to patch this system

370
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:32,170
you know clearly a lot of the patches

371
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:34,750
require downtime or reboot and so being

372
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:37,150
able to then according to that time this

373
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:39,310
is definitely a task that is at this

374
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:41,439
point probably best equipped for humans

375
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:42,640
so that we can go ahead and that point

376
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,670
be able to put the put the patch in

377
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:48,910
place and then once the the patch has

378
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:52,240
been deployed so we've we finished item

379
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:54,040
number four once the patches deploy

380
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,350
there's another place where automation

381
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:58,689
can really help is let's say the task is

382
00:16:56,350 --> 00:17:00,760
done and the patching team says okay

383
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:02,710
we've pushed the patch out there's

384
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:04,869
another task that you can do to really

385
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:07,870
make sure that the problem is gone by do

386
00:17:04,869 --> 00:17:10,329
by automatically triggering a rescan of

387
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:12,819
the vulnerability scanner to that asset

388
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:15,458
to not just know that the patch has been

389
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:16,990
pushed out but that the vulnerability is

390
00:17:15,459 --> 00:17:18,400
no longer present because the

391
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:20,530
vulnerability scanner we found that in

392
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,260
the first place now is confirm that it's

393
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:25,959
gone so this is really just taking what

394
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:28,359
we do a lot between spreadsheets and

395
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:30,820
email and turning it into an automated

396
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:32,919
process and you knows note and there's

397
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:35,590
their places in here using automation

398
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:37,230
places in here using humans but the idea

399
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:40,030
of having this workflow from end to end

400
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:44,200
is that the basis of getting the basics

401
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:47,770
right before taking on automation now a

402
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:51,130
second use case would be doing this for

403
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:54,580
security incident response this is very

404
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:57,789
very similar to what we do for working

405
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:59,830
on vulnerabilities but is a

406
00:17:57,789 --> 00:18:01,889
a bit more complex where the

407
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:05,109
vulnerability side there's essentially

408
00:18:01,889 --> 00:18:07,389
scan data to integrate with and in most

409
00:18:05,109 --> 00:18:10,960
organizations you've got one scanner

410
00:18:07,389 --> 00:18:12,580
maybe two when it comes to taking

411
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,399
security incidents from lots of

412
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:16,960
different sources the mote the you know

413
00:18:15,399 --> 00:18:20,408
the most common place to go and pull

414
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:22,389
information would be from your sim but

415
00:18:20,409 --> 00:18:24,759
in some cases you may not have all the

416
00:18:22,389 --> 00:18:27,549
data from security alerts going into the

417
00:18:24,759 --> 00:18:30,149
sim and so I may need to pull in and

418
00:18:27,549 --> 00:18:32,889
maybe directly from an endpoint security

419
00:18:30,149 --> 00:18:34,840
product or an and an EDR product or

420
00:18:32,889 --> 00:18:37,449
directly from a firewall or directly

421
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:40,029
from other systems but getting all of

422
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:42,249
the alerts that you're getting from the

423
00:18:40,029 --> 00:18:44,559
various products into one place again

424
00:18:42,249 --> 00:18:47,919
into a some sort of database that you

425
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:49,479
can work with is the first step so again

426
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,249
this is a place where you can pull that

427
00:18:49,479 --> 00:18:53,519
data in all these security products have

428
00:18:51,249 --> 00:18:56,619
API is this is not a this is a

429
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:58,690
relatively simple process today so take

430
00:18:56,619 --> 00:19:00,639
that data and then correlate it again

431
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:02,919
with the asset management database we

432
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:04,709
talked about in the previous slide so

433
00:19:02,919 --> 00:19:07,299
taking the severity of the problem

434
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:10,149
what's the importance of that asset

435
00:19:07,299 --> 00:19:12,009
correlate that data and then from there

436
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:13,478
you've prioritized the security

437
00:19:12,009 --> 00:19:15,580
incidents based on severity of the

438
00:19:13,479 --> 00:19:18,389
problem and the affected asset which

439
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:21,728
allows you to move to step number three

440
00:19:18,389 --> 00:19:24,399
which is once those those alerts or

441
00:19:21,729 --> 00:19:25,929
incidents have been prioritized the next

442
00:19:24,399 --> 00:19:28,570
thing to do is to then go do some

443
00:19:25,929 --> 00:19:30,639
research this is work that's typically

444
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:33,299
I'll call it a cut and paste exercise

445
00:19:30,639 --> 00:19:36,039
right security analyst goes into a

446
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:38,529
security alert cuts the IP address out

447
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:40,389
goes into another tool puts it into a

448
00:19:38,529 --> 00:19:42,519
system click Submit and waits for

449
00:19:40,389 --> 00:19:46,149
results another area that's right for

450
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:48,700
automation so after getting threat

451
00:19:46,149 --> 00:19:50,918
intelligence added to the particular

452
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:52,869
security incident can then move to

453
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:55,960
number four which is determining what to

454
00:19:52,869 --> 00:19:58,269
do so this is the point again where we

455
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:00,249
introduce a human back into the equation

456
00:19:58,269 --> 00:20:03,039
everything we've done at this point can

457
00:20:00,249 --> 00:20:06,549
be automated and this is where the human

458
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:09,609
can decide do I need to go do more or do

459
00:20:06,549 --> 00:20:11,139
I go run the play so I go do my sis

460
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:13,449
again my security run book

461
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:14,770
and this is a DDoS attack and here's

462
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:16,960
what I'm gonna do this is a malware

463
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:19,810
outbreak here's again here's what here's

464
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,880
the plan of action but then freeing up

465
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:24,460
security analysts to then receive

466
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:26,770
information that this is this enriched

467
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:29,170
is going to allow people to be able to

468
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:30,220
operate a lot more quickly so once

469
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:34,000
you've determined what that response

470
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:36,130
action is you can then decide if you go

471
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,200
remediate the problem and this could be

472
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:40,450
a lot of times these are tasks that are

473
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:43,900
not just done by security teams but may

474
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:46,090
be done by people an IT you know it may

475
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:49,360
be wiping machine remove someone's ad

476
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:51,780
credentials you take a machine off of

477
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:54,370
the network add a new firewall rule

478
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:55,870
these could be done by various teams and

479
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:58,330
be able to automatically pass a task

480
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:59,979
over to over to that person inside of

481
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:03,820
the play is the key to making this

482
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:06,010
happen fast and then finally the sixth

483
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:09,070
one here is actually really important

484
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:12,910
from an audit ability standpoint as you

485
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:15,070
use automation to frame up to make a

486
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:17,650
decision on how we're going to work on a

487
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:19,600
particular security problem having an

488
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:22,060
auditable record at the end of every

489
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,860
time stamp everything has happened and

490
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:26,409
then all the tasks that happen with the

491
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:28,120
automation is going to be key to then if

492
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:30,310
you ever need to go use that data in

493
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:33,040
some sort of post-mortem or some sort of

494
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:35,050
review of a security incident you may

495
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:37,210
also refer back to this six months later

496
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:40,409
to understand why a particular firewall

497
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:43,000
rule was added in to the organization

498
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:45,640
well these two frameworks are the basis

499
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:49,030
of what I want to do to go over some

500
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:50,710
particular use cases and I've got three

501
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:52,780
here and then I'm going to go into two

502
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:55,060
more around some threat Intel sharing

503
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:59,730
use cases that layer inside of the

504
00:21:55,060 --> 00:22:02,679
automation so the first one here is

505
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:05,410
doing some high profile vulnerability

506
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:08,410
planning and execution and by high

507
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:10,780
profile vulnerability I think of the

508
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:13,450
ones that get a logo now you know so the

509
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:15,940
ones like heartbleed some of the things

510
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:18,430
we saw last year or earlier with wanna

511
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:20,200
cry I'm gonna use shell shock as my

512
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:23,350
example to maybe date myself a little

513
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:24,850
bit but and you know this is the kind of

514
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:27,550
vulnerability that makes the

515
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:31,540
not tech news but actual like mainstream

516
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:35,470
news where executives are gonna want to

517
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:38,070
understand are we affected and what are

518
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:41,320
we doing about it if we are and

519
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:43,899
automation is a great way to be able to

520
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:46,000
start to answer that question ahead of

521
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:48,430
potentially getting it and so the

522
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,370
scenario here is we've got a high

523
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:52,900
profile vulnerability it's it's a major

524
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:55,300
software vulnerabilities been announced

525
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:57,010
and we want to be able to start working

526
00:22:55,300 --> 00:23:02,139
on it before the execs start asking

527
00:22:57,010 --> 00:23:03,250
questions so the first thing you take it

528
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:05,590
you go back to your vulnerability

529
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:07,780
scanner we know what the affected we

530
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:10,120
know what the vulnerability is and we

531
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:13,660
can go into an asset management database

532
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:16,090
to then understand what are the servers

533
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:18,310
that have that vulnerability on it and

534
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:21,699
then what are the different business

535
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:23,080
services or or important data that's on

536
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:25,000
those those and this is again that

537
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:26,980
correlation of the severity of the

538
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:31,210
problem in this case it's really bad and

539
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:32,950
and secondly is what are the systems

540
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:38,400
that protect that potentially have the

541
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:40,630
issue from their use automation to then

542
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,850
automatically prioritize those

543
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:45,160
vulnerable items so this is where again

544
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:46,990
you could use the the business service

545
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:49,780
impact what are the most important

546
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:51,640
assets in the organization what is the

547
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:53,440
vulnerability risk score we know there's

548
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:56,890
potential exploit in the wild that will

549
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:59,320
happen quickly and basically prioritize

550
00:23:56,890 --> 00:24:02,200
a set of assets that need to be

551
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:04,780
remediated first that prove that present

552
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:06,910
the most risk to the organization and

553
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:09,280
then automatically set up the

554
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:12,010
facilitation of an emergency patch

555
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:14,860
request to the most important systems I

556
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:17,170
think a lot of where organizations got

557
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:20,409
hung up in many of these major

558
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:23,050
vulnerability announcements is it's

559
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:24,850
everywhere it's on every system I've got

560
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:26,889
to go and patch tens of thousands of

561
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:28,959
systems by understanding the most

562
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:31,240
important systems you may be able to get

563
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:34,330
that down to hundreds or maybe dozens or

564
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:35,800
maybe less to be able to really to farm

565
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:38,220
down the work to something that's going

566
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:42,159
to be significantly easier to work

567
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:44,530
and once you've done that work when the

568
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:46,330
executives are bored some of them they

569
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:48,790
want to go and ask the question this is

570
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:50,080
my shellshock example make it when they

571
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:52,500
come and ask the question you can say

572
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:54,970
you know what yes we are affected by

573
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:56,800
whatever the vulnerability is but you

574
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:58,330
know what we've actually already we

575
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:01,389
found all of our critical systems

576
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:02,770
through automation we've patched all

577
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:04,450
those different systems because we're

578
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:05,950
able to automatically get the tasks to

579
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:09,190
the right people to go and work on it

580
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:10,810
and then you know we also we also have

581
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:12,520
some systems that we haven't passed yet

582
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:15,790
but we understood the ones that were

583
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:17,770
less critical and from there we have a

584
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:22,149
plan for the rest this is a generic

585
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:24,129
workflow of sending a an automated tasks

586
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:25,720
to the group during the next maintenance

587
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:27,670
window to then go ahead and get the rest

588
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:30,250
of those those things patched this is a

589
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:33,220
significantly better response to give to

590
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:35,470
Ana senior executive when they're when

591
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:39,820
they are asking you know are we affected

592
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:42,730
by this major of vulnerability or not ok

593
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:44,230
so use case number two and this goes

594
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:47,160
back to a little bit of that CSO

595
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:48,820
prediction about the the security

596
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:52,390
investigation or the incident

597
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:57,100
investigation process so this is what I

598
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:59,350
call a kind of generic flow of what

599
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:01,540
happens with a security analyst once a

600
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:03,639
security instance generated to do a lot

601
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:05,770
of the research so the first thing we do

602
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:08,610
here so a new security incidents been

603
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:12,850
generated we move to the second box an

604
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:15,729
analyst is going to then prioritize that

605
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:18,070
that security incident and will maybe

606
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:21,220
give it a category and assign it to a

607
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:24,280
particular person or persons to then go

608
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:26,590
and work on or a team the next area is

609
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:28,660
that that analysts are then going to go

610
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:34,060
into the security incident and look for

611
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:36,790
IP addresses file hashes and any other

612
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:40,240
indicators to compromise they'll then

613
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:42,670
take that information and then go start

614
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,080
doing reputational lookups and so this

615
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:45,880
is where you get into that cutting and

616
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:48,100
pasting where you've taken information

617
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:50,530
from that security alert swivel-chair to

618
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:51,260
another browser inserted the information

619
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:54,170
in

620
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:56,030
click Submit wait for the results take

621
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:59,270
the next part put that one in wait for

622
00:26:56,030 --> 00:27:01,370
the results this is this is work that

623
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:03,790
takes time in some organizations this

624
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:07,969
mate for junior analyst this could take

625
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:10,310
30 minutes 45 minutes this is a lot of

626
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:13,340
time that that really really hurts the

627
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:15,770
overall Security Response process so and

628
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:19,100
the next area is that we may want to go

629
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:21,830
and check the machine that is under that

630
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:24,290
has the that you where the attack has

631
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:26,600
taken place so the analysts might go and

632
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:29,300
get the running processes from that

633
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:31,669
particular affected asset they may go

634
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:33,470
and understand what are the network

635
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:35,990
connections that that affected asset has

636
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:38,240
the next one they may go look let's go

637
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:39,980
run reputational lookups and all the

638
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,750
hashes of files that have been

639
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:44,840
downloaded to that machine or run hat

640
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:46,850
run every every process that doesn't

641
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:48,110
look normal on the machine against

642
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:51,290
something to understand if it's bad or

643
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:53,719
good and so once they've processed all

644
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:55,280
of those those network lookups again

645
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:58,010
this can take you know another 30

646
00:27:55,280 --> 00:28:00,290
minutes to get done then to move to box

647
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:01,879
number 9 there as analyst confirms or in

648
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:04,550
some case denies that there's an actual

649
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:06,100
threat and then they can go ahead and

650
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:09,200
start working on the remediation process

651
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:10,760
these are the start looking at this for

652
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,960
a junior analyst this could take them

653
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:15,500
they might only be able to get through

654
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:20,360
six to ten of these a day when you start

655
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:22,390
to layer in automation I just changed

656
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:25,250
several these boxes from red to purple

657
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:28,550
now these are what I call data

658
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:30,620
enrichment activities and these are

659
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:34,190
areas that is a great place to get

660
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:37,129
started for with automation and I would

661
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:40,630
call this risk free you're not making

662
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:43,760
any change to any system automatically

663
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:46,580
all you're doing is taking the cutting

664
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:48,920
and pasting that that analyst is going

665
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:50,830
to do into multiple systems and doing

666
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:54,830
that on behalf of the security analyst

667
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:57,110
and so things like doing reputational

668
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:59,750
lookups of IP addresses detonating

669
00:28:57,110 --> 00:29:01,459
malware and sandboxes getting running

670
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:03,620
processes from machines and then going

671
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:04,820
and testing those these are all tasks

672
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:08,689
that can be automated

673
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:10,399
and then when you the the if I go to box

674
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:13,880
number nine analysts can spend their

675
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:16,790
time deciding do I need more or

676
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:18,650
do i or can I just go ahead and start to

677
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:21,950
assign out the the actual remediation

678
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:23,630
process so this is a use case number two

679
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:25,730
and you in using automation and the

680
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:27,590
investigation process and this is a

681
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:29,120
great way of just going and basically

682
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:30,500
get your automatically getting access to

683
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:34,939
all the great thread until that's out

684
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:36,890
there so third one this is really

685
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:38,420
applying something to the most common

686
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:41,960
security issue that a lot of us working

687
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:46,430
on or work on which is a user reported

688
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:48,470
phishing attack so user says I think I

689
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:50,930
got a phishing email we all have our own

690
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:53,690
security awareness programs where we ask

691
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:55,730
people to send if they get a suspicious

692
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:58,060
email to send it to the security team

693
00:29:55,730 --> 00:30:01,700
most people have an email address of

694
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:05,270
security at company comm receive that

695
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:06,680
information in and then someone on the

696
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:08,540
security team or Raviv you know

697
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:10,700
specifically for larger organizations an

698
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:12,409
email security team will then go and

699
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:15,710
research is this a real phishing attack

700
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:18,650
and so there's actually some pretty neat

701
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:20,210
options in Microsoft - you can click a

702
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:22,520
report fish button that will go to an

703
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:24,560
email box or just have them forward an

704
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:27,560
email directly so in this scenario this

705
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:29,629
is my sort of ugly PayPal email here as

706
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:33,070
an example of a phishing attack user

707
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:38,630
sends this off to that email address and

708
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:41,750
what you can do here is automate a bunch

709
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:44,570
of the the investigation so the first

710
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:46,670
thing when someone sends this email in

711
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:49,189
affords the email and the first thing

712
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:51,620
you can do is automatically reply with

713
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:54,080
something - that says thank you for

714
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:56,179
submitting and reinforces the security

715
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:58,340
awareness but then automate the

716
00:30:56,180 --> 00:31:00,200
investigation of the email and the same

717
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:03,230
way we just automated the investigation

718
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:04,850
of a security incident a user reported

719
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:06,500
phishing attack is another place where

720
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:09,320
you can automate the whole front end of

721
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:11,900
this you know so go ahead and do the

722
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:13,909
lookups of the sender look is there any

723
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:16,130
malicious payload in the email is there

724
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:17,720
a URL in the email that potentially has

725
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:19,310
malicious payload

726
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:21,020
these are all steps that can be

727
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:24,889
automated including detonating malware

728
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:27,650
in a sandbox once that comes back you

729
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:29,690
can deliver a verdict so the security

730
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:32,120
team can then when they're opening a

731
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:34,250
user reported phishing email they're

732
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:36,080
actually opening it opening that and

733
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:37,880
actually understanding and with all the

734
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:40,070
manual tasks already done for them so

735
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:43,010
then they can make a decision and once

736
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:46,159
you make a decision you there's more

737
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:48,410
places to do automation the first is if

738
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:49,940
it's not a phishing email you have a

739
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:51,290
template that says thank you that you

740
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:53,180
submit it we appreciate you submitted

741
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:55,639
this we confirm this is not a phishing

742
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:58,340
phishing email and it's safe but if it

743
00:31:55,640 --> 00:32:00,550
is malicious automation can then help

744
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:03,110
with with that remediation process

745
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:05,629
automatically go look inside of the

746
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:06,969
email server to see who else in the

747
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:08,990
organization's received the same email

748
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:11,690
you know that phishing attack probably

749
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:13,790
didn't just go to one person and if

750
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:15,590
somebody's opened it you know delete the

751
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:17,860
email from their their inbox and

752
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:20,959
automatically trigger a malware scan and

753
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:22,300
and then you there's a whole tree of

754
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:25,130
different things you can do from there

755
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:26,629
if it hasn't been opened delete it from

756
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:29,090
the mail server so the user actually

757
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:31,060
doesn't open the email there's other

758
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:33,110
things you can do in parallel

759
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:34,550
automatically update the mail server

760
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:36,379
protection so that's going to block

761
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:38,840
emails in that particular sender or IP

762
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:42,200
address and then update firewall rules

763
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:44,090
to block outbound communication to the

764
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:45,680
malicious site that it was that was

765
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:48,860
trying to attend to these are all things

766
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:52,160
that can be automated and so the outcome

767
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:53,780
of all three of these things is just a

768
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:56,630
drastic reduction and the time to solve

769
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:59,320
the problem so let's dive in to then

770
00:32:56,630 --> 00:33:02,090
layering threat Intel sharing into this

771
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:05,020
so there's some pretty big challenges

772
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:07,520
with threat Intel sharing the first

773
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:10,129
almost every time we get any threat

774
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:10,639
Intel from somebody it's always after

775
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:13,460
the fact

776
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,990
someone's worked on something it might

777
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:16,730
be something that a commercially

778
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:18,710
available feed has given you but it's

779
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:20,300
always something that someone else has

780
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:22,360
already run into and they've probably

781
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:27,200
already solved that problem

782
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:29,870
the second is operationalizing it once

783
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:31,000
you get shared threat Intel then what do

784
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:33,129
you do with it

785
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,540
how do you actually go in what do you

786
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:38,860
actually go and do once you're actually

787
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:41,620
gonna go work on that the third is you

788
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:43,979
can get a ton of different sources and

789
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:45,669
how do you know which one to trust more

790
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:48,850
this is where you're going to get a

791
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:50,470
combination of some of the some of the

792
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:52,419
information sharing communities as well

793
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:53,970
as commercially available feeds which

794
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:58,900
one do you which one do you trust more

795
00:33:53,970 --> 00:34:01,060
and then duplicative information you may

796
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:03,960
see the same information come in from

797
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:06,340
multiple sources how do you rationalize

798
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:07,660
which one to work on and how do you

799
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:10,899
rationalize about that information

800
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:14,710
together the fifth and maybe the most

801
00:34:10,899 --> 00:34:17,230
important one is that most people

802
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:20,530
consume threat intelligence they don't

803
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:23,980
actually share it and a lot of this is

804
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:25,360
the fact that most people I think we all

805
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:27,610
kind of like that right I've certainly

806
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:31,300
read a lot more things on Yelp

807
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:34,570
then I contribute to but there's there's

808
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:36,700
very few people that are contributing to

809
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:40,240
threat Intel because there's maybe not a

810
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:43,120
perceived benefit of doing so and the

811
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:44,979
last one is is it real you know or is

812
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:48,399
this fake information and so this is

813
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:49,510
where many of the the the ice axe you

814
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:50,830
never know where the information is

815
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:52,659
coming from maybe some of the

816
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:54,790
commercially available threat Intel

817
00:34:52,659 --> 00:34:56,290
feeds are gonna be more interesting but

818
00:34:54,790 --> 00:35:00,310
this is a one-way thing what about in

819
00:34:56,290 --> 00:35:03,160
the sharing community so this is a

820
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:07,750
concept I want to talk about around

821
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:11,649
using circles of trust to do thread

822
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:14,290
Intel sharing and so this is this can be

823
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:16,030
simple and there's that you can get

824
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:18,759
really really complex or something like

825
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:22,180
this but it's as simple as the the best

826
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:24,010
place to start so create a you can

827
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:26,740
create a circle of trust and maybe the

828
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:28,720
easiest is easiest example is we all

829
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:30,100
have people that we used to work with

830
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,680
that have moved on to other

831
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:35,529
organizations and when we're working on

832
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:37,299
something working on a security incident

833
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:39,310
there might be times where like oh you

834
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:40,540
know what like bill over here was my guy

835
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:42,580
that I would talk to you about these

836
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:44,800
types of things bill now works at this

837
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:46,299
other company I still might be

838
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:49,540
bill or text bill and ask a quick

839
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:51,790
question and you can start with three

840
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:53,170
like just really think about three

841
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:54,400
people that used to work together that

842
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:57,150
now work at different different

843
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:59,620
companies and set up the ability to

844
00:35:57,150 --> 00:36:02,800
anonymously share information with each

845
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:04,900
other so go to a platform put put

846
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,370
information put information up there the

847
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:13,210
key thing though isn't is actually

848
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:16,720
making it so that it is anonymous this

849
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:19,090
can work really really well when when

850
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:21,490
sharing Beek is part of the Incident

851
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:23,740
Response process not something you do at

852
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:25,180
the end of it so imagine if you're

853
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:26,589
working on something and you've got this

854
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:29,049
really tight relationship with these

855
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:31,780
other two people and you just learned of

856
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:33,520
an of something new that you wanted to

857
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:35,380
go pass on maybe it's an exploit in the

858
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:37,570
wild maybe it's a malicious IP address

859
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:40,030
just simply cutting and pasting it and

860
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:42,760
dumping it up into the into your shared

861
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:44,410
circle of trust as part of the incident

862
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:47,680
response process right as you're working

863
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:49,600
on it we'll make this very very

864
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:51,549
effective for the people receiving it

865
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:53,620
it'll also encourage your other two

866
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:54,910
friends to then go and put stuff put

867
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:57,420
their information up there as they're

868
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:59,500
working on it but anonymous here is key

869
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:01,570
the biggest reason why most

870
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:04,600
organizations don't share information at

871
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:06,850
this part or this stage of the the

872
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:08,200
incident investigation process is you

873
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:10,299
never want to reveal you're the one

874
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:12,609
having the problem I'm under attack I

875
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:14,920
always use an example of if you were the

876
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:16,780
biggest oil company in the world and you

877
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:18,010
were under attack and then the second

878
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:19,900
biggest oil company in the world was

879
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:22,030
under attack wouldn't the third biggest

880
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:23,350
oil company want to know and even if you

881
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:24,880
were in the first and second biggest

882
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:27,640
ones you would want to know because you

883
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:29,710
don't want your industry to go down so

884
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:32,620
making this we can do it anonymously

885
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:34,360
where you know this has came from

886
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:35,650
somebody you trust it came from one of

887
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:38,200
your two friends you used to work with

888
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:39,490
but you don't know which one it makes it

889
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:41,529
so that you haven't revealed that you're

890
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:44,109
under attack but and as you receive this

891
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:46,420
you know that this is information that

892
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:51,370
you need to trust and so if I go back to

893
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:53,740
these challenges timeliness it's now

894
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:55,509
timely because it's actually part of the

895
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:58,390
Incident Response process not something

896
00:37:55,510 --> 00:38:02,829
you've done afterwards the second opera

897
00:37:58,390 --> 00:38:04,359
lysing it once you get it run a play on

898
00:38:02,829 --> 00:38:05,859
it have something as part of the

899
00:38:04,359 --> 00:38:08,049
security run book when you receive that

900
00:38:05,859 --> 00:38:10,210
shared threat intelligence from your

901
00:38:08,049 --> 00:38:11,529
circle of trust this is going to be some

902
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:13,059
of the most important work that you do

903
00:38:11,529 --> 00:38:16,660
because it's from somebody you trust and

904
00:38:13,059 --> 00:38:18,789
you know it's timely the third ranking

905
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:20,950
sources this is probably gonna be the

906
00:38:18,789 --> 00:38:22,779
highest one you trust because this is

907
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:26,578
you know it's from somebody you know and

908
00:38:22,779 --> 00:38:28,809
you know that it's something that's real

909
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:29,980
duplicate of info you know this one's

910
00:38:28,809 --> 00:38:33,160
highest because it came from that

911
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:35,170
trusted group the problem of

912
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:38,500
contributing anonymous makes

913
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:39,609
contribution way easier be and because

914
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:41,470
you're going to this small group of

915
00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:44,680
people may you can extend this I'm using

916
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:46,959
a three person example to for simplicity

917
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:49,359
but you know this could start to go into

918
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:51,730
hundreds of different people as long as

919
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:54,098
you've got somebody administering the

920
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:57,000
anonymity of the whole thing and then

921
00:38:54,099 --> 00:38:59,859
lastly real or fake you know it's real

922
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,420
because you trust the sender because

923
00:38:59,859 --> 00:39:02,890
it's part of your circle of trust as

924
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:05,049
opposed to just something that might be

925
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:08,049
coming from a random information sharing

926
00:39:05,049 --> 00:39:10,809
community and so I'm gonna walk through

927
00:39:08,049 --> 00:39:13,059
two use cases here on using shared

928
00:39:10,809 --> 00:39:16,299
threat Intel to be able to proactively

929
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:20,019
stop an attack so the first scenario

930
00:39:16,299 --> 00:39:22,480
here is around some new indicator

931
00:39:20,019 --> 00:39:24,848
compromised threat Intel information was

932
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:28,180
just posted from your from one of your

933
00:39:24,849 --> 00:39:31,000
trusted sources so what you can do here

934
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:34,450
from an automation perspective is once

935
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:37,210
that information comes in use automation

936
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:41,589
to grab the information from that post

937
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:43,779
and automatically go and search your sim

938
00:39:41,589 --> 00:39:47,259
search other places where you've got

939
00:39:43,779 --> 00:39:49,750
security data to understand do you have

940
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:54,059
any instantiation of that information

941
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:56,740
inside of your inside of your network

942
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:58,000
and so you know these I OCS are probably

943
00:39:56,740 --> 00:40:00,008
gonna be many of the things we see all

944
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:03,640
the time IP addresses file hashes and

945
00:40:00,009 --> 00:40:06,250
URLs so and automatically search that

946
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:09,670
data Lake and or a sim to understand if

947
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:12,009
you've got that there and if not you can

948
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:12,280
log it and then determine what are there

949
00:40:12,009 --> 00:40:13,780
any

950
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:15,580
change issue you need to make to your

951
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:17,020
protection technologies to make sure

952
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:19,450
that you're gonna be able to block this

953
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:23,020
type of information in the future but if

954
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:24,609
you do find it if you do find

955
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:27,190
information from that shared threat

956
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:30,100
Intel inside of your organization you

957
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:32,080
can create and prioritize this work you

958
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:33,850
can assign it to an analyst and you can

959
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:35,799
go ahead and run again inside your

960
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:37,569
security run book run the play of what

961
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:41,190
happens when you've gotten new threat

962
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:45,940
Intel information from a trusted source

963
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:48,100
the outcome here is you've actually

964
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:51,700
turned the threat Intel model upside

965
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:54,190
down we typically use three threat Intel

966
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:56,980
to do research when we were working on a

967
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:58,510
security incident but the outcome here

968
00:40:56,980 --> 00:41:00,640
is we've actually used threat

969
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:03,460
intelligence that's shared from that

970
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:05,890
trusted source into our organization to

971
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:08,530
then proactively stop a particular

972
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:10,779
problem before we actually see it inside

973
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:13,540
of our network unless this is really

974
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:14,950
taking the threat Intel sharing area and

975
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:17,230
making it so that you're actually using

976
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:18,910
that to to solve problems as opposed to

977
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:23,680
using it when you're researching a

978
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:28,180
problem that already exists all right

979
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:30,910
last use case here using shared Intel

980
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:34,480
and shared this shared Intel to

981
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:36,009
prioritize vulnerability patching it

982
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:37,000
kind of goes back full circle kind of

983
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:40,120
where we started with some of the

984
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:42,450
vulnerability work and you know another

985
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:45,250
thing you can share in thread Intel is

986
00:41:42,450 --> 00:41:47,919
information about in this example and

987
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:49,720
exploit in the wild we now know that

988
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,790
there is a vulnerability out there and

989
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:54,189
there's an active exploit being run

990
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:56,590
against it and so if you're able to

991
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:58,870
share that information up into your into

992
00:41:56,590 --> 00:42:01,600
that platform when you receive that

993
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:03,100
information you can then use the you

994
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:04,330
know an exploit and there's a

995
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:06,490
vulnerability where there's an actual

996
00:42:04,330 --> 00:42:08,110
exploit in the wild that's being run and

997
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:10,149
you have that vulnerability inside of

998
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:11,650
your network this may become sort of the

999
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:13,570
highest priority work that your team's

1000
00:42:11,650 --> 00:42:16,300
gonna do when you start looking at

1001
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:18,640
ransomware attacks there's like six or

1002
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:21,700
seven vulnerabilities that almost 90% of

1003
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:23,350
them use if you patch those six or seven

1004
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:25,029
you're gonna you're gonna be able to

1005
00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:26,020
have way less ransomware attacks to go

1006
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:28,540
deal with and way less

1007
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:31,560
to go plug but here you can use the

1008
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:34,660
exploit information in the wild to then

1009
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:36,369
prioritize first find their systems that

1010
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:38,730
have that particular vulnerability and

1011
00:42:36,369 --> 00:42:42,730
then prioritize patching these systems

1012
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:43,869
regardless of the cbss score because you

1013
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:45,100
know there's an exploit in the wild

1014
00:42:43,869 --> 00:42:46,630
that's out there you know a lot of

1015
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:48,549
exploits now are being written to the

1016
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:50,350
middle like those those cbss fives

1017
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:51,670
because they know organizations are

1018
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:54,490
taking a long time to get those things

1019
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:56,560
patched if ever but you can use

1020
00:42:54,490 --> 00:42:58,359
automation and orchestration to then

1021
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:00,340
trigger patching and the rescan that

1022
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:02,890
whole workflow we showed you a little

1023
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:06,520
while ago to go to manage the

1024
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:09,089
vulnerability patching process and so

1025
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:11,440
the outcome here is you've actually

1026
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:15,910
proactively through thread Intel sharing

1027
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:18,160
have proactively removed and and removed

1028
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:19,899
a vulnerability that is a very high

1029
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:22,629
likelihood of being used in an attack

1030
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:25,660
but you would not have known about at

1031
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:27,160
least not yet unless you were part of

1032
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:29,740
this circle of trust to be able to get

1033
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:31,270
information from from your two friends

1034
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:32,618
or whatever those other companies may

1035
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:38,740
end up being that participate in that

1036
00:43:32,619 --> 00:43:41,440
circle so the last part here is one of

1037
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:43,689
the biggest reasons why both automation

1038
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:45,490
and threat Intel sharing are really

1039
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:47,109
important is because all of us are

1040
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:51,910
having a very difficult time hiring

1041
00:43:47,109 --> 00:43:54,279
talent we hear horror stories of you

1042
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:56,560
hire a junior analysts it takes them six

1043
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:58,690
months to go up get up to speed there's

1044
00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:00,009
their productive for six months and they

1045
00:43:58,690 --> 00:44:02,560
move on to the next company as an

1046
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:04,720
experienced security analyst for almost

1047
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:07,930
double their salary we've got to find

1048
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:11,410
ways to make their work more valuable

1049
00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:13,390
and if you're spending your time look

1050
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:15,790
actually solving security problems

1051
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:17,790
versus cutting and pasting and doing

1052
00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:19,720
research to go solve those problems a

1053
00:44:17,790 --> 00:44:21,730
security analyst is going to be a heck

1054
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:24,520
of a lot happier but the other thing you

1055
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:26,920
can do is you're using shared shared

1056
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:30,040
threat intelligence your team of five

1057
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:31,540
all of a sudden you've got a bigger team

1058
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:34,270
out there now because you've got the

1059
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:35,650
people that in my three-person example

1060
00:44:34,270 --> 00:44:37,420
you used to work with they're actually

1061
00:44:35,650 --> 00:44:39,700
working for you now and you're of course

1062
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:41,650
helping them to but this

1063
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:43,839
she fills in the gaps of all the people

1064
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:45,640
that were unable to hire this is a

1065
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:50,500
really important aspect in reasons why

1066
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:53,440
threat Intel sharing is so important all

1067
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:54,609
right last last slide here some things I

1068
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:59,440
hope you're going to take away from this

1069
00:44:54,609 --> 00:45:01,150
is the first is after you go back and

1070
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:03,990
you get home one of the things you

1071
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:06,070
should look at next week is the

1072
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:08,379
vulnerable your current vulnerability

1073
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:10,810
response process this is probably the

1074
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:13,690
easiest place to get started with

1075
00:45:10,810 --> 00:45:16,240
automation and orchestration because

1076
00:45:13,690 --> 00:45:18,700
you've got a single scanner you can or

1077
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:21,549
maybe two and you can work with some of

1078
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:24,430
the different IT sources to figure out

1079
00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:27,640
how you could potentially work on

1080
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:29,589
marrying the data between IT and

1081
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:31,900
vulnerability scans together but just

1082
00:45:29,589 --> 00:45:34,060
even assessing that process and

1083
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:35,440
understanding it as in the current state

1084
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:39,160
is a great thing to look at when you get

1085
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:42,760
back the next area is then look for

1086
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:45,670
processes and places within that process

1087
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:47,200
where you can layer in automation those

1088
00:45:45,670 --> 00:45:48,310
are the front parts I showed you a

1089
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,649
little bit earlier are probably the best

1090
00:45:48,310 --> 00:45:53,319
places to do it correlating data and

1091
00:45:50,650 --> 00:45:56,589
then prioritizing work for patching

1092
00:45:53,319 --> 00:45:58,839
teams and at the same time you start to

1093
00:45:56,589 --> 00:46:01,060
do the exercise they suggest for next

1094
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:03,250
week which is looking at your current

1095
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:05,529
security incident response process and

1096
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:07,480
starting to document some of that many

1097
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:10,900
of us may have security run books that

1098
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:12,910
are documented you digitally some may

1099
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:15,040
have it on paper many times it's tribal

1100
00:46:12,910 --> 00:46:17,230
knowledge and it may sitting inside the

1101
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:20,050
heads of a few very senior people gain

1102
00:46:17,230 --> 00:46:21,819
that information documented a few

1103
00:46:20,050 --> 00:46:24,819
different use cases documented is key to

1104
00:46:21,819 --> 00:46:26,980
getting started and then you know a

1105
00:46:24,819 --> 00:46:29,529
little bit later this year is start to

1106
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:32,670
look for use cases to create processes

1107
00:46:29,530 --> 00:46:36,190
for part of the Incident Response

1108
00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:38,260
process and I purposely wanted to show a

1109
00:46:36,190 --> 00:46:40,750
phishing response use case because that

1110
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:43,480
is one that can have a very big impact

1111
00:46:40,750 --> 00:46:45,339
on the security team in terms of their

1112
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:46,810
time because the number of phishing

1113
00:46:45,339 --> 00:46:49,060
attacks that all of us are definitely

1114
00:46:46,810 --> 00:46:51,700
seeing and then once you've got those

1115
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:53,380
basics set up this is where you can

1116
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:56,109
start to look you know are there

1117
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:57,460
other parties or other people you can go

1118
00:46:56,109 --> 00:46:59,739
start to create these circles of trust

1119
00:46:57,460 --> 00:47:02,019
so you can then start to look for the

1120
00:46:59,739 --> 00:47:04,299
ability to do some threading a sharing

1121
00:47:02,019 --> 00:47:05,828
of threat intelligence information but

1122
00:47:04,299 --> 00:47:08,170
you've really got to get a use the

1123
00:47:05,829 --> 00:47:11,349
example of a baby going from crawling to

1124
00:47:08,170 --> 00:47:13,119
running you've really got to look at

1125
00:47:11,349 --> 00:47:15,579
process get some of those processes

1126
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:17,200
going in to end and then layer threat it

1127
00:47:15,579 --> 00:47:19,170
until sharing on top of it for to have a

1128
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:21,549
chance of being really successful here

1129
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:22,210
so with that we left a few minutes for

1130
00:47:21,549 --> 00:47:24,160
questions

1131
00:47:22,210 --> 00:47:25,239
gentleman got here for a microphone but

1132
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:32,200
if anybody has any questions I'm happy

1133
00:47:25,239 --> 00:47:35,529
to take them you get the example of a

1134
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:36,899
use case 5 in which you said that you

1135
00:47:35,529 --> 00:47:39,430
can automate vulnerability

1136
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:41,259
prioritization and vulnerability close

1137
00:47:39,430 --> 00:47:42,910
closure process using thread Intel and

1138
00:47:41,259 --> 00:47:45,130
you gave you the example of ransomware

1139
00:47:42,910 --> 00:47:47,589
exploiting a particular vulnerability so

1140
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:49,989
in that case the system also need to be

1141
00:47:47,589 --> 00:47:51,308
connected to my CMD P to know my assets

1142
00:47:49,989 --> 00:47:53,650
otherwise you will not be able to

1143
00:47:51,309 --> 00:47:55,960
understand the applicability for example

1144
00:47:53,650 --> 00:47:57,940
you may be having a vulnerability on MS

1145
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:59,829
equal 2008 but if it is not in my

1146
00:47:57,940 --> 00:48:00,309
environment that threat Intel is of no

1147
00:47:59,829 --> 00:48:02,140
use to me

1148
00:48:00,309 --> 00:48:04,089
correct yeah and that's where the the

1149
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:06,729
idea is being corrected to some sort of

1150
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:08,109
asset asset database that understands

1151
00:48:06,729 --> 00:48:10,049
whether it's a configuration management

1152
00:48:08,109 --> 00:48:11,828
database or something else of

1153
00:48:10,049 --> 00:48:13,359
understanding and having that asset

1154
00:48:11,829 --> 00:48:15,160
already discovered is definitely key to

1155
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:17,589
for that for sure yeah so second

1156
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:19,089
follow-up question is that we have a use

1157
00:48:17,589 --> 00:48:21,670
case where in the banking regulator

1158
00:48:19,089 --> 00:48:23,440
wants to banks to share the threat Intel

1159
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:24,729
and then anomalously send this

1160
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:26,920
information to all the other member

1161
00:48:24,729 --> 00:48:29,140
banks so there it fits perfectly well

1162
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:31,359
does it also fits into the MSSP

1163
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:33,069
environment who wants to view threat

1164
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:35,229
Intel from multiple sources but on

1165
00:48:33,069 --> 00:48:37,058
clients individual environment want to

1166
00:48:35,229 --> 00:48:39,700
give this threat Intel information yeah

1167
00:48:37,059 --> 00:48:41,559
and really any sort of circle of trust

1168
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:44,710
can be set up whether it's you know an

1169
00:48:41,559 --> 00:48:46,779
MS SP and you can also have a lot of

1170
00:48:44,710 --> 00:48:48,460
Parent Child company relationships

1171
00:48:46,779 --> 00:48:49,809
that's one of the places where we talk

1172
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:52,779
to a lot of organizations about that

1173
00:48:49,809 --> 00:48:54,880
where you may have a large company that

1174
00:48:52,779 --> 00:48:56,259
owns several subsidiaries and they want

1175
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:57,849
to share threat intelligence that way

1176
00:48:56,259 --> 00:48:58,989
but any one of those different those

1177
00:48:57,849 --> 00:49:02,640
different scenarios can definitely work

1178
00:48:58,989 --> 00:49:02,640
for organizations okay thank you

1179
00:49:04,989 --> 00:49:07,969

1180
