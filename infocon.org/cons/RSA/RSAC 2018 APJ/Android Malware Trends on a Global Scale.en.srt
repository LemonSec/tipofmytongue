1
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:16,520
hello everybody how are you I hope you

2
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:17,869
also enjoying the day over RSI - lot of

3
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:21,020
good dogs here

4
00:00:17,869 --> 00:00:22,490
like we do but before we begin I'd like

5
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:24,169
to introduce myself my name is Jay and

6
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:26,360
Shermer was mentioned I working as a

7
00:00:24,169 --> 00:00:29,919
software as a malware analysis team Lee

8
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:33,800
it's got almost nine years in the

9
00:00:29,919 --> 00:00:36,980
security field and I mostly analyzing

10
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:45,789
the non pieced of mobile stuff etc and

11
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:49,550
it's my colleague Kansai so as well

12
00:00:45,789 --> 00:00:51,980
analyst but I'm also somewhere on the

13
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:54,739
edge of developers so I'm responsible

14
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:58,068
for example for the scanning engine in a

15
00:00:54,739 --> 00:01:00,578
vast number of security and without

16
00:00:58,069 --> 00:01:04,640
further ado let's head into the

17
00:01:00,579 --> 00:01:08,030
presentation so what we would like to

18
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,159
talk about this afternoon is a little

19
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:14,630
bit about what we see in our user base

20
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:18,469
how the trends are evolving in our

21
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:21,619
Android user base what what kind of data

22
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:25,939
we gather and what we can deduce from it

23
00:01:21,619 --> 00:01:27,619
so first of all I would like to tell a

24
00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:30,439
little bit about where we get the data

25
00:01:27,619 --> 00:01:32,750
from and how we count the data then we

26
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:35,750
will look at some threats that we see

27
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:39,229
and the third category is we we monitor

28
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:41,210
and we will do some regional

29
00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:45,920
distribution of the threats and their

30
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:48,020
evolution then we will have some summary

31
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:52,670
of what we can learn from it and what we

32
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:57,920
can tell about it so the data that we

33
00:01:52,670 --> 00:02:01,429
used for this analysis is is from the

34
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:04,770
period of mostly last year we've taken

35
00:02:01,429 --> 00:02:07,990
sort of review of the last year and

36
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:11,350
looked at what are the most significant

37
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:16,960
categories of malware and how they kind

38
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:19,380
of evolved then we took a view of these

39
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:23,710
threats in the different regions that we

40
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:25,840
cut that we monitor sort of we try to

41
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:30,880
compare them based on some similarities

42
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:37,120
that we see in the data and and

43
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:40,299
categories the data come from our users

44
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:44,110
so it's a user base of tens of millions

45
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:47,740
of users or worldwide what we see mostly

46
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:49,270
is that the infection rate is in on

47
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:53,770
average somewhere between four and five

48
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:55,270
percent of the users when we talk about

49
00:02:53,770 --> 00:03:00,820
the data that we are presenting here

50
00:02:55,270 --> 00:03:04,510
today we took for further measurements

51
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:07,420
we took the unique detection and user

52
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:10,269
pairs as the metric that we that we will

53
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:11,738
be monitoring which means that for

54
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:15,910
example if we have a user that

55
00:03:11,739 --> 00:03:21,000
repeatedly has an infection it will be

56
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:25,450
counted only once in the data however

57
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:28,209
yeah so now let's take a look at the

58
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:30,880
threat categories that we monitor some

59
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:41,920
of the most important categories am i

60
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:44,859
doing it okay so these are the nine main

61
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:48,309
categories that we will be concentrating

62
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:50,650
on first of all it's a clickers which is

63
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:54,209
malware that usually on the user's

64
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:59,920
behalf somewhere on the background

65
00:03:54,209 --> 00:04:02,780
clicks links and urns earns the money

66
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:05,209
through through

67
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:07,130
through the ad campaigns but it's

68
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:12,250
usually done on the background so the

69
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:12,250
user doesn't really know about it and

70
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:17,810
usually it's something that you don't

71
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:21,798
want next big category that we want to

72
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:26,710
address is aggressive ads this is a

73
00:04:21,798 --> 00:04:31,599
really popular category that is becoming

74
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:34,760
larger and larger and these are usually

75
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:40,940
identified by randomly popping up ads

76
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:43,840
and may or making the application that

77
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:49,550
you are using almost unusable due to

78
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:52,460
overloading with ads next interesting

79
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:59,120
category is mockers the lockers category

80
00:04:52,460 --> 00:05:02,690
is compared to for example Windows it's

81
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:06,110
it's a smaller category because because

82
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:08,000
on Windows and the guys have definitely

83
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:10,910
more profit from ransomware and lockers

84
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,630
however even on Android we see the trend

85
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:17,080
that it that the malware authors

86
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:20,360
actually want to take a bite off of the

87
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:25,940
the PI as well so so some some of the

88
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:28,220
workers are actually very popular spy

89
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:30,169
apps that's what you would expect that's

90
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:32,990
any apps that are installed on the phone

91
00:05:30,169 --> 00:05:36,010
or on the user's device and try to

92
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:38,450
accelerate data from the phone or try to

93
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:40,520
monitor what the user is doing and where

94
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:42,770
he is doing this is not necessarily

95
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:44,659
malware on its own but it's usually

96
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:48,680
something you don't really want in your

97
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:51,560
phone unless well I mean it can have

98
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:53,300
legitimate reasons why you have by app

99
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:56,540
installed on your phone but mostly it's

100
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:59,030
it's it's not wanted anyway georgina

101
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:01,640
services are a little bit declining

102
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:04,729
because of security measures taken by

103
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:07,580
Android however there are still

104
00:06:04,729 --> 00:06:12,199
some saw specifics and they are related

105
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:14,870
to any SMS sending capabilities and paid

106
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:19,219
the services Reuters is a category that

107
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:21,289
obviously talks about malware that is

108
00:06:19,219 --> 00:06:25,069
trying to root your device usually

109
00:06:21,289 --> 00:06:28,550
without the users consent usually

110
00:06:25,069 --> 00:06:31,129
without the users content we also have

111
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:35,599
reuters that attempt to root the users

112
00:06:31,129 --> 00:06:37,520
device like with him knowing those are

113
00:06:35,599 --> 00:06:41,210
usually potentially unwanted programs as

114
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:45,399
well but if it's what the user wants and

115
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:48,378
then it's okay new emerging threat or

116
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:51,469
one that we will be concentrating on is

117
00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:53,419
bankers although this is a relatively

118
00:06:51,469 --> 00:06:56,899
small category compared to the other

119
00:06:53,419 --> 00:06:59,839
ones it is on the rise and we can see a

120
00:06:56,899 --> 00:07:02,029
lot of a lot of investment into this

121
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:03,770
category by the malware officers and

122
00:07:02,029 --> 00:07:06,069
it's also some of the most sophisticated

123
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:08,568
threats we see out there

124
00:07:06,069 --> 00:07:12,169
fake apps that's obviously something

125
00:07:08,569 --> 00:07:15,110
that that tries to mimic some popular

126
00:07:12,169 --> 00:07:16,219
applications but instead on the

127
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:18,439
background it does something completely

128
00:07:16,219 --> 00:07:21,529
different and downloaders that's

129
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:28,129
probably the biggest category it's not

130
00:07:21,529 --> 00:07:33,649
necessarily as malicious by design as

131
00:07:28,129 --> 00:07:37,300
the other categories however it often

132
00:07:33,649 --> 00:07:42,349
serves as like first stage of of other

133
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:45,669
malicious activities so we will

134
00:07:42,349 --> 00:07:49,550
concentrate mainly on four categories

135
00:07:45,669 --> 00:07:54,080
one of them is lockers one of them is

136
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:58,550
aggressive ads my favorite is bankers

137
00:07:54,080 --> 00:08:01,279
and downloaders the reason is that these

138
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:04,459
threats are either significant in some

139
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:08,300
way or they are just a large category by

140
00:08:04,459 --> 00:08:13,879
themselves so let's take a look at how

141
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:16,390
we view the data that we have we divided

142
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:21,310
that they tie into three different

143
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:23,320
subgroups based on the or we monitor

144
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:24,730
them in different regions and we divided

145
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:27,099
them into three different subgroups

146
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:30,820
based on some similarities that we have

147
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:34,990
seen in the data so the first subgroup

148
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:37,299
that we have here over now is Australia

149
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:41,140
Europe North America and South America

150
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:44,709
and we constructed this sort of heat map

151
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:49,930
let's say over the past one and almost

152
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:51,580
one and a half a year and in the columns

153
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:54,609
you can see the categories themselves

154
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:58,060
and in the rows you will then see the

155
00:08:54,610 --> 00:09:02,770
appropriate months and judging from the

156
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:04,810
data we can see that there are some

157
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:09,970
shifts in the categories there are some

158
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:12,760
visual visible shifts in in this case we

159
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:17,860
can definitely see that lockers are

160
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:21,300
becoming quite popular we see that

161
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:24,130
aggressive ads are on the rise and

162
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:26,410
interestingly enough the bankers

163
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:29,430
although as I said before they are a

164
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:32,949
small category if we take a look at this

165
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:36,370
example of Australia for example in the

166
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:40,270
past year they tripled in size so even

167
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:43,590
though it's just 3% it's actually it's

168
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:48,340
actually becoming more and more

169
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:52,210
impactful then we see for example that

170
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:54,570
Reuters are on the decline a bit which

171
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:59,680
is a similar trend actually everywhere

172
00:09:54,570 --> 00:10:02,380
so looking at Europe we can also see

173
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:08,910
that the lockers are a very significant

174
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:08,910
category for by aggressive ads

175
00:10:09,089 --> 00:10:14,500
and as well I think that it's important

176
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:24,310
to notice here that the bankers have

177
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:28,269
doubled during the last year in North

178
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:30,729
America for example we see that the

179
00:10:28,269 --> 00:10:34,779
lockers are probably one of the biggest

180
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:38,889
categories we can activate why why this

181
00:10:34,779 --> 00:10:41,439
is why this is so however they make

182
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:43,060
almost half of it or half of the

183
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,760
detection that we see in in North

184
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:50,380
America so it is definitely a giant

185
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:58,209
category out there aggressive ads are

186
00:10:50,380 --> 00:11:01,810
also a category and and bankers again we

187
00:10:58,209 --> 00:11:06,069
can see the trend that we saw almost no

188
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:11,459
bankers in North America a year ago but

189
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:13,990
now the category is five times the size

190
00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:17,018
we can see that for example downloaders

191
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:21,190
are on the decline and that's that's a

192
00:11:17,019 --> 00:11:26,910
common denominator for all the regions

193
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:29,320
we talked about in South America

194
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:31,620
interestingly enough the lockers here

195
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:34,449
don't seem to be that much of an issue

196
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:40,060
however aggressive ads are a really

197
00:11:34,449 --> 00:11:44,199
strong category here so aggressive ads

198
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:47,339
are our one of the biggest threats we we

199
00:11:44,199 --> 00:11:51,040
see and are popular these days

200
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:54,720
again bankers have become five times the

201
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,719
size then years ago

202
00:11:56,670 --> 00:12:03,670
and if we were to pick some some of the

203
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:05,880
some of the biggest categories that we

204
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:09,099
that we would like to see the trends in

205
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:11,320
we can pick for example the Reuters that

206
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:14,230
our common denominator in all of these

207
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:17,529
regions and they are declining these are

208
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:20,350
this is probably due to Android being

209
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:22,890
more secure with each version and harder

210
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:28,150
to exploit due to different kinds of

211
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:29,980
mitigations and and protections so so

212
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:32,520
Reuters themselves like like like

213
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:33,850
category are becoming less and less

214
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:38,550
prevalent

215
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:43,420
however they sometimes are used as

216
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:46,449
module as as part of a bigger attack or

217
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:49,569
for ensuring persistence and are still

218
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:54,550
working for or are still working on

219
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:58,720
older devices aggressive ads as

220
00:12:54,550 --> 00:13:00,550
mentioned are are on the rise and in

221
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,420
Europe specifically we can see that the

222
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:06,250
bankers are are becoming a big threat

223
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:09,370
now if you want to take a look at some

224
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:13,330
like what a typical representation of

225
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:15,670
the each category looks like then let's

226
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:20,160
look at some aggressive hats and some

227
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:23,910
walkers I'll start with aggressive ads

228
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:27,910
these as I said are very prevalent

229
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:30,910
oftentimes we can see root capabilities

230
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:35,110
for ensuring the persistence of the of

231
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:38,230
the app the success rate of rooting the

232
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:42,490
device is questionable but we can see

233
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:45,550
those they aggressively show pop-ups and

234
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:50,020
that means not only in the app itself

235
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:51,199
but sometimes some apps integrate for

236
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:56,300
example the

237
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:58,370
system overlay permission or yeah system

238
00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:00,380
overlay window permission which allows

239
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:03,860
them to show ads even outside of the

240
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:08,689
scope of the application for us these

241
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:12,530
are very hard to track because we get

242
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:15,680
user reports that say I have suddenly

243
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:17,449
started receiving ads and I don't know

244
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:20,560
what which app is causing it because

245
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:23,180
suddenly windows start appearing and and

246
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:25,609
the user doesn't know which which app it

247
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:28,189
is linked to it if it's out of context

248
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:30,320
of the application so it sounds like

249
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:35,510
similar like Facebook has the icon that

250
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:37,280
is showing the messenger papa we've also

251
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:42,980
seen some instances of pre-installed

252
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:46,910
malware by the OEMs usually it's it's

253
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:57,710
some smaller brands but these are then

254
00:14:46,910 --> 00:15:00,020
installed in the system popular families

255
00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:03,200
in this case are for example hidden ads

256
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:06,800
that's that's a big big family that is

257
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:09,070
prevalent in last days I hope your

258
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:12,680
gorilla

259
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:15,410
so indicators of compromised are as I

260
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:18,079
said randomly popping up ads all over

261
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:23,630
the place or in the app rendering the

262
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:26,450
app unusable and also usually it is

263
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:29,510
connected to some data leaks because of

264
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:32,780
the way the ad libraries are integrated

265
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:36,500
or or used sometimes these ad libraries

266
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:38,780
don't use secure connection and they

267
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:42,440
also harvest a lot of data about the

268
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:44,000
user about this let's say behaviors and

269
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:47,630
so that they can more appropriately

270
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:52,210
target the ads and transfer of this data

271
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:56,230
is it's not in a secure manner sometimes

272
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:58,700
so if we were to look at how we can find

273
00:15:56,230 --> 00:16:00,460
find out that something is wrong it's

274
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:06,280
usually based on some

275
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:09,640
permissions oftentimes such an app is

276
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:11,860
wants to get the draw over other apps or

277
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:14,990
otherwise known and system alert

278
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:18,890
permission which allows it to to show

279
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:23,560
the ads whenever possible oftentimes we

280
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:27,710
can find that they load code externally

281
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:32,180
because of different modules that the ad

282
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:35,450
networks wants to utilize and because of

283
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:39,530
extensibility or plug-in systems the ad

284
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:45,740
networks use and they oftentimes require

285
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:50,180
permissions that are linked to user like

286
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:54,100
private data such as or identifiable

287
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:57,050
data such as querying device ID or

288
00:16:54,100 --> 00:17:03,620
reading all sorts of personal

289
00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:07,060
information from the device this is for

290
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:10,550
example how how our back-end system

291
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:17,510
which has some machine learning trained

292
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:19,459
model how it evaluates automatically the

293
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:26,390
apps that come into the system it's

294
00:17:19,459 --> 00:17:29,750
probably not so much if we talk about

295
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:33,520
lockers the main reason they are so

296
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:36,380
popular on Android is that they want to

297
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:38,900
get a piece of the trend that's a

298
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:42,500
general boom in ransomware in in last

299
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:45,890
years mainly for PCs but but in Android

300
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:51,650
we see attempts that mimic for example

301
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:54,580
the known wanna try virus we saw family

302
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:57,350
that that was called won a locker that

303
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:59,030
actually displayed almost exactly the

304
00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:01,100
same message as they wanna cry

305
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:06,110
for Windows but it showed it on a mobile

306
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:11,350
device other popular and families in

307
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:11,350
this category are focus or porn Walker

308
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:19,730
we can see or we can just we can clearly

309
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:22,639
distinguish this category because when

310
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:25,760
it does its job you can see various

311
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:32,000
kinds of ransomware notices this can be

312
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:33,740
either that they want to did you or all

313
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,840
of them have in common that they want

314
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:40,520
the user to pay some ransom otherwise

315
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:42,230
some action will happen either he will

316
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:49,760
lose all his files because they were

317
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:52,580
encrypted before and or he is charged

318
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:55,100
with with an offense effect and the

319
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:58,040
ransomware says that it will be reported

320
00:18:55,100 --> 00:19:01,760
to the authorities unless he pays the

321
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:04,490
ransom this category is often also

322
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,470
generated per user as an evasion

323
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:09,020
technique so we see lots of different

324
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:13,910
files that are actually the same time

325
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:15,980
any of the malware the most typical

326
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:18,200
Channel how to distribute these is

327
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:22,610
masking them as some porn player or

328
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:25,040
believe it or not even Flash Player and

329
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:30,229
these are often through fake ads on

330
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:32,570
sites any kind terms of compromised in

331
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:35,920
such case is that the Lots block

332
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:39,800
screening with ransom note appears but

333
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:43,490
this is often already the case when the

334
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:45,350
malware did its job so that's not the

335
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:48,470
stage we want to get into there are

336
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:53,889
other signs that we can look into even

337
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:57,380
before we get this ransomware notice

338
00:19:53,890 --> 00:20:01,730
typically it will be require system

339
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:04,610
device admin privileges device admin

340
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:07,730
privileges which manifests themselves

341
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:08,100
that you see a whole screen request to

342
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:10,110
grant

343
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:11,939
the special permission for this

344
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:14,399
application which is called the device

345
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:17,549
administrator but this is very rarely

346
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:19,260
used in in legitimate applications like

347
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:23,010
there are of course legitimate reasons

348
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:27,059
why to grant application device admin

349
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:30,059
privileges but it's not it's not typical

350
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:32,309
in most apps so it's it's something to

351
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:34,559
be on the lookout for because unless you

352
00:20:32,309 --> 00:20:42,210
grant the device admin privileges the

353
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:44,940
ransomware doesn't have much to do here

354
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:47,210
you can see an example of of ransomware

355
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:50,220
masking as some Google Play services

356
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:53,340
this is the the screen in the middle is

357
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:57,150
is the mentioned device admin permission

358
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:59,668
screen and in the end the last last

359
00:20:57,150 --> 00:21:02,850
screen we can see that this is ranked an

360
00:20:59,669 --> 00:21:05,429
example of the ransom notice and it can

361
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:09,870
change for example to FBI warning or

362
00:21:05,429 --> 00:21:15,179
whatever looking at these it's it's not

363
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:16,770
as easy to simply tell that something is

364
00:21:15,179 --> 00:21:19,140
wrong with the app because they usually

365
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:21,360
mask themselves pretty well but in this

366
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:23,640
case we can see for example an instance

367
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:27,928
of simple occur which was a popular

368
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:31,020
Locker two years ago I think and in this

369
00:21:27,929 --> 00:21:33,210
case it masked as a game but if you took

370
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:35,990
a closer look and and check the package

371
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:39,360
name you can see that it's it's not the

372
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:46,289
grand theft auto vice city game as it's

373
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:50,850
trying to be again we have a little bit

374
00:21:46,289 --> 00:21:54,270
of of how the how the machine learning

375
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:55,889
model behind it works if you could see

376
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:58,740
it you could probably see that there are

377
00:21:55,890 --> 00:22:02,130
distinctive features such as using

378
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:05,570
cheaper Suites and obtaining device

379
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:05,570
admin privileges what

380
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:13,699
and I will give word to them okay it

381
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:16,219
sounds right actually I would like to

382
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:17,780
now I was going to do three more regions

383
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:20,000
we have and should we split these two

384
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:21,260
regions into the two subgroups in fact

385
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,450
when I start working on this

386
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:26,120
presentation we wanted to add one more

387
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:28,010
region which was the China mainland but

388
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:29,540
unfortunately there are some

389
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:31,550
specification where we are not able to

390
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:33,440
collect enough data from China although

391
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:36,250
this market is very specific I think

392
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:40,340
everyone else is like more using the

393
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:42,200
payment to SMSs QR codes etc but because

394
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:45,260
of the specification we are able to do

395
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:47,900
it like a standalone country so we

396
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:49,670
joined this data to the Asia so at first

397
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:52,010
when we look to the African Asia which

398
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:55,100
we decided to take one group we can see

399
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:57,050
in this group there are really big data

400
00:22:55,100 --> 00:23:00,649
and the numbers of the downloaders

401
00:22:57,050 --> 00:23:02,780
actually that's probably because it's

402
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:05,990
relay is it downloader

403
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:09,379
a notice to the device of the victim and

404
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:13,700
used as a stager to download some other

405
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:16,100
malware or the bankers or aggressive etc

406
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:18,950
and also in these countries we can sue

407
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:22,790
as we can see there is again big drop in

408
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:25,850
the numbers of the Reuters and the rise

409
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:28,610
of the adverse effects actually this is

410
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:30,649
mostly because in the African Asia it's

411
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:32,990
been harder to manage it through the

412
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:35,420
bankers etc so the articles need to use

413
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:38,000
some workarounds how to directly

414
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:39,770
monetize their work and in that case the

415
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,270
Agra using the aggressive efforts it's

416
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:45,520
really good way how to earn a lot of

417
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:48,350
money directly she will look to the Asia

418
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:51,110
expertise similar standards on the

419
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:54,679
numbers the aegisub is growing rapidly

420
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:56,959
fast but there is one change that's the

421
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:59,270
number of the Trojan sms's it's usually

422
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,010
drop a lot in many countries and regions

423
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:02,960
but in the Asia

424
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:05,150
it's the holding current like 10

425
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:09,920
percentages or the big number converter

426
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:12,470
all numbers in the country so we decided

427
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:13,640
to look on the course of the aggressive

428
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:15,380
efforts which we do it's growing

429
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:17,720
everywhere around the whole world

430
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:18,780
aggressive that's growing because so

431
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:21,030
nice way for

432
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:23,910
turns out to monetize it earn a lot of

433
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:26,220
money in easy way it's actually really

434
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:28,440
hard for the victims to distinguish they

435
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:30,120
are infected and which exactly

436
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:33,900
application is doing that mess on their

437
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:35,250
device triggers the steady drop in the

438
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:39,510
Reuters numbers as we mentioned already

439
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:41,550
and also you know Africa and Asia there

440
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:43,470
is the huge number of donors if I can

441
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:46,260
Africa is almost like sixty percent of

442
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:47,820
all malware is the downloader and age is

443
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:50,490
slightly below forty percent is still

444
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:52,439
pretty high numbers and because I would

445
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:55,980
like to show you some case study of the

446
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:58,920
downloader so donors are definitely

447
00:24:55,980 --> 00:25:00,840
really really prevalent Marburg

448
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:02,460
she's the biggest category most regions

449
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:05,189
in the long terms and growing globally

450
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:07,800
and it's usually worse as a tall order

451
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:09,360
an additional it's usually download and

452
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:12,510
install additional application in the

453
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:14,879
background which can usually potentially

454
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:17,190
download a more severe threat so as I

455
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,020
said working as a stager you can

456
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:21,540
download the lockers aggressive light

457
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:25,530
stuff and many more that's actually what

458
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:26,940
it's usually do and although also the

459
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:29,790
attackers know they can really easily

460
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:33,090
misuse the paper install model so they

461
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:35,220
just they just get somehow the

462
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:37,980
downloader to the device inside the

463
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:39,810
device and just downloading some

464
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:43,410
additional application install it and

465
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:44,850
all the money for this paper install and

466
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:46,200
actually it's very popular in regions

467
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:49,169
with no official don't know the markets

468
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:51,510
because for example in the China there

469
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:52,920
are Google Play is not working there so

470
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:56,060
the lot of application almost a

471
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:59,010
replication are spread to the

472
00:25:56,060 --> 00:26:02,520
alternative the market and unfortunately

473
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:05,340
others of markets a free law or are not

474
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:08,610
even any security which causes a bit

475
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:11,250
issue even the users the security

476
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:12,389
companies and even like the other banks

477
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:15,690
because there's a lot of fake

478
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:17,880
application etc and also the Tundra's

479
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:19,500
are many times use for example for

480
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:21,690
aggressive at smaller which often

481
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:24,870
contains of the row promoter etc so how

482
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:27,270
can we indicate there is something going

483
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:28,860
on in the device actually it's mostly

484
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:29,379
the random lab correct install apps on

485
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:32,769
the register

486
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:34,509
storage in the device itself but if I

487
00:26:32,769 --> 00:26:35,710
grew up you're a look into our device

488
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:37,809
and check in what application you have

489
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:39,399
inside you do it somebody here like a

490
00:26:37,809 --> 00:26:43,470
fun way you check what's installing your

491
00:26:39,399 --> 00:26:46,299
device No okay me neither

492
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:47,139
so it's really hard this can be for the

493
00:26:46,299 --> 00:26:50,110
victim

494
00:26:47,139 --> 00:26:52,240
it's something's going on and also all

495
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:54,850
this malicious behavior is often hidden

496
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:58,029
on the background so it's unlikely to be

497
00:26:54,850 --> 00:27:00,158
noticed by the victim so everywhere you

498
00:26:58,029 --> 00:27:02,379
look how you can distinguish just

499
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:04,659
Melbourne but actually we look into the

500
00:27:02,379 --> 00:27:06,490
application itself little cold in the

501
00:27:04,659 --> 00:27:08,019
permission etc you can find out that

502
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:10,980
something is wrong with this application

503
00:27:08,019 --> 00:27:14,490
we can notice it as mostly many hyper

504
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:18,309
receivers and also it's using the

505
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:21,159
permissions to execute external code and

506
00:27:18,309 --> 00:27:23,850
also the permission to read and write

507
00:27:21,159 --> 00:27:25,990
systems at the and permission to read oh

508
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:28,840
sorry permission to mount and unmount

509
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:30,100
the system for removal of storage which

510
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:33,939
is really necessary for this type of

511
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:39,490
tomorrow sis need to install and execute

512
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:42,129
additional stuff to monetize as a

513
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:43,929
standalone market region we took the

514
00:27:42,129 --> 00:27:47,230
Russia because of the Sun auto

515
00:27:43,929 --> 00:27:50,019
specification of this market in Russia

516
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:52,169
like every each of the region we can see

517
00:27:50,019 --> 00:27:55,440
the huge growth on the aggressive ends

518
00:27:52,169 --> 00:27:58,269
the cycle everywhere these days but

519
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:00,759
except the other regions we can see in

520
00:27:58,269 --> 00:28:02,769
there's a big number of the bankers in

521
00:28:00,759 --> 00:28:06,549
the Russia actually one of the 5th molar

522
00:28:02,769 --> 00:28:08,230
in the Russia is the banker that's why

523
00:28:06,549 --> 00:28:11,019
we decided to take it like a central

524
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:15,460
region and then shoot some information

525
00:28:11,019 --> 00:28:16,779
about the bankers we talk or from data

526
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:19,000
we have actually thinking about the

527
00:28:16,779 --> 00:28:20,769
bankers and by the numbers in the Russia

528
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,990
I spoke with us there are although

529
00:28:20,769 --> 00:28:25,960
really big bank actually international

530
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:27,940
sperm buster and a lot of people there

531
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:31,779
so there are some good ways how the

532
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:34,059
attackers can monetize it or even like

533
00:28:31,779 --> 00:28:35,409
practice their malware before they were

534
00:28:34,059 --> 00:28:38,799
spreaded to do what I do

535
00:28:35,409 --> 00:28:39,830
Europe North America Gaming bigger

536
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:44,020
impact

537
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:46,100
on the user base so as I said we can see

538
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:48,379
steady growth through aggressive ads

539
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:52,340
also the big numbers of the bankers and

540
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:53,960
all others into Russia well to the

541
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:56,030
banker sexual the bankers sir less

542
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:58,250
sophisticated malware should slow

543
00:28:56,030 --> 00:29:00,320
prevalent right now but - it's on the

544
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:01,820
rise along with the lockers and the

545
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,919
aggressive fads this is the

546
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:07,790
fastest-growing category in our user

547
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:09,470
base and usually drive accounts and

548
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:12,200
phishing attacks to lure users into

549
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:15,170
giving the bank information or a

550
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:16,850
credentials only who is usually asked

551
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:19,070
for additional information the personal

552
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:21,830
information is ask ask for you for the

553
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:23,570
security social number etc to get as

554
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:26,270
much information about the victim as

555
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:27,889
possible to avoid to be detected by the

556
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:31,270
band and be able to wind up the money

557
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:33,230
from the bank account the infected user

558
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:36,260
and of course it's real dangerous

559
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:37,790
because it may impact direct cost impact

560
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:40,040
if you like because you will lose your

561
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:41,990
mind directly and usually it's pretty

562
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:43,909
hard even if you have some insurance or

563
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:46,070
some cover to get some money back

564
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:47,870
because usually what the victim would

565
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:50,240
happen to the victim they ground the

566
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:52,909
permission to the applications of

567
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:55,520
installed a mobile so then it's really

568
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:58,700
hard to get at least the part of the

569
00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:00,889
money lost in this out back and it's

570
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:02,690
usually extremely sophisticated and

571
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:05,840
complex more because daughterís

572
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:07,730
they are putting a lot of resources into

573
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:10,760
the bankers they are really evolving

574
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:12,590
this more they are practicing there of

575
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:15,350
course trying to avoid to be detected by

576
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:18,320
the antivirus etc and between the most

577
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:21,290
copper families belongs like the boom a

578
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:25,610
bank bought eggs abou crumbles also

579
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:27,560
rattle or two so didn't get compromised

580
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:29,479
actually it's really hard for a user or

581
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:32,090
for a victim to notice something's

582
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:34,370
really happening from their device maybe

583
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:36,290
it can be unusual looking screen from

584
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:38,989
the bank application you can be really

585
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:42,950
lucky to get noticed that the banker is

586
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:45,470
trying to overthrow your screen when you

587
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:47,930
try to login into the bank etc if you

588
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:49,430
let me to allow to do the small teaser

589
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:51,380
actually my colleagues they were of

590
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:53,490
tomorrow have pretty good talk about

591
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:56,220
using the apk lop IO

592
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:59,010
in the platform to fight in banking

593
00:30:56,220 --> 00:31:00,480
threat they should pretty good demo how

594
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:04,140
it looks like and how we can distinguish

595
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:06,830
this malware is a banker and how to find

596
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:09,300
out what's going on and how to use our

597
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:11,580
threat Intel platform to detect it Sara

598
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:18,270
so I think it's good idea to go there

599
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:20,250
but I promise to my friend to do it okay

600
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:22,980
so how about you found out Sundays go

601
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:25,620
next so usually again the bankers they

602
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:27,510
need to hyper ate the receivers because

603
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:31,409
what they do usually they try to steal

604
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:34,230
when you are using the o PT ot P no SMSs

605
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:35,790
so they need to be they need to get

606
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:38,309
their information from the SMSs before

607
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:40,770
the user can notice the some estimates

608
00:31:38,309 --> 00:31:44,340
come so they use the hyper two receivers

609
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:46,410
and when the SMS come to the device they

610
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:48,990
will just read the OTP and remove the

611
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:51,270
SMS from the device so nobody can notice

612
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:52,920
that something's going on also they are

613
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:57,059
using the permission to draw over the

614
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:59,330
other applications system our Ezra and

615
00:31:57,059 --> 00:32:05,879
also they need the broadcast receivers

616
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:08,340
to listen for in camicus MSS and usually

617
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:10,110
when we look into the code we can may

618
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:14,639
times notice there are the banking app

619
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:16,830
strings and usually trying to target as

620
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:19,500
many biggest bank in the country as

621
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:22,020
possible so they also contains a lot of

622
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:23,730
information and the login screens of the

623
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:25,980
banks at the Dora that's the way how

624
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:27,840
come we can distinguish the application

625
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:30,230
as the malicious unblocking to prevent

626
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:33,600
our users to get infected by the bankers

627
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:35,780
so what information we can get from

628
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:40,709
realizing the peaks

629
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:43,139
the tracks are divided regionally they

630
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:46,230
are diverse and of course the malware

631
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:48,030
authors they rap to market specifics as

632
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:51,000
we can see in Asia or they are still

633
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:53,670
focusing on the Trojan SMSs in the

634
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:56,820
countries like Africa that are they

635
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:59,370
focusing more on the aggressive etcetera

636
00:32:56,820 --> 00:33:02,550
those guys are spending a lot of money a

637
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:05,250
lot of time resources to get to monetize

638
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:07,110
their work so they really need to focus

639
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:10,169
on some specific markets and they

640
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:12,029
react how this market is evolving and

641
00:33:10,169 --> 00:33:16,200
what's going on the economic changes etc

642
00:33:12,029 --> 00:33:18,450
and allies ik Peaks can help us to

643
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:20,039
follow this three we can you can notice

644
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:21,750
there something is going on in some

645
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:25,080
country some regions which can help us

646
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:27,899
to focus more list runs so when you look

647
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:29,668
on the threat runs the biggest threat on

648
00:33:27,899 --> 00:33:33,840
the rise are assigned as we mentioned

649
00:33:29,669 --> 00:33:36,510
aggressive at bankers and lockers which

650
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:39,600
can help to get real easy money for

651
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:41,850
others and of course the downloaders

652
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:44,428
they have released steady high res

653
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:48,240
globally in some markets hire some

654
00:33:44,429 --> 00:33:51,389
louver but in global long term is

655
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:53,880
released a team Oliver and because of

656
00:33:51,389 --> 00:33:55,500
the android i was evolving and they are

657
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:57,750
trying to make more secure there a

658
00:33:55,500 --> 00:34:03,779
significant drop in the routers in the

659
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:05,970
majority of regions so how we like not

660
00:34:03,779 --> 00:34:08,159
only like the AV industry is but even

661
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:10,980
the ant users developments or even

662
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:12,929
though i'm how we can reduce the risk as

663
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:15,300
the end user you can do some stuff to

664
00:34:12,929 --> 00:34:16,859
keep safe from Ramar were actually you

665
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:18,629
can download the application only from

666
00:34:16,859 --> 00:34:21,089
the trusted source this is goodbye to

667
00:34:18,629 --> 00:34:23,790
you for example google store because

668
00:34:21,089 --> 00:34:26,730
they are a try to keep the application

669
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:29,609
clean etc you spending a lot of money to

670
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:31,050
do it I know it's very hard why because

671
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:35,190
everybody's tried to sneak there but

672
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:37,169
they really do I think they can okay

673
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:38,970
also you can buy the trustable device

674
00:34:37,168 --> 00:34:41,730
from trustable brand because we know

675
00:34:38,969 --> 00:34:45,029
about the OEM prints tomorrow's power or

676
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:47,250
even aggressive very good what to do to

677
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:49,020
prevent some exploits it's always keep

678
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:51,918
security patch up today it's really

679
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:55,379
important not only mobile but everywhere

680
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:58,470
and what is really good it's the read

681
00:34:55,379 --> 00:35:01,319
information about the permission I think

682
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:05,129
as I myself I have big program because

683
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:07,440
when I noticed some application which I

684
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:09,960
want to try to install and there is like

685
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,760
50 different ask for a permission that's

686
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:13,260
terrible I didn't even notice that you

687
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:18,390
were just swiping again to finish it

688
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:19,619
fast and go ahead it's a report romantic

689
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:20,580
because they can sneak up something that

690
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:22,290
you really don't wanna

691
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:25,620
you don't want to install the flashlight

692
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:28,170
which can get a system admin or to write

693
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:31,020
on our external devices for sure so

694
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:32,670
let's also please do not run not need it

695
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:34,759
or suspicious permission to the

696
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:39,510
application to our install to early ones

697
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:40,950
and to make some promo to us please use

698
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:43,380
antivirus actually it can really help

699
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:45,600
you because you can notice a lot of

700
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:48,240
stuff by ourselves but for example some

701
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:51,420
exploits can be really unnoticed to you

702
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:54,569
as a weak team it's good idea I think to

703
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:57,030
use it and what up developers can

704
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:59,670
actually do from the rest a lot of think

705
00:35:57,030 --> 00:36:02,630
they can do to keep their customers no

706
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:04,800
less safe and robot I helped to everyone

707
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:06,660
they should every time and they are

708
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,880
importing some new code or third-party

709
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:10,680
libraries they should try take care what

710
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:13,920
they are importing the code should be

711
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:16,310
adjustable narrated go through the code

712
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:20,220
check it is vulnerable to some exploits

713
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:22,290
etc and of course to protect the users

714
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:24,180
data it's really important to use the

715
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:26,480
encryption for a communication and

716
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:28,890
always anchor it to use their data

717
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:32,670
because we Roman out to be the company

718
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:36,210
with in the news that your custom rate

719
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:37,860
are leaked and as I spoke about the

720
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:39,450
permission extra it's very important ask

721
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:41,730
only for permission your application

722
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:44,310
really needs and then provide clear

723
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:48,570
explanation why do you really need these

724
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:51,509
permissions and accepting one of the our

725
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:53,430
last point for this battle at least it's

726
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:57,020
ready to introduce and enforce the app

727
00:36:53,430 --> 00:37:00,060
as guideline this is really important

728
00:36:57,020 --> 00:37:02,009
think you can do to help even in the

729
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:07,230
future to everyone on the global market

730
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:09,300
and at the end when I say the ones can

731
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:11,820
also really help David

732
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:14,670
for example they introduce and effort

733
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:17,460
the guidelines but all for ads but if

734
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:19,980
they are using some alternative stores

735
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:22,170
or their own stores or markets they

736
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:23,940
should have really good guidelines and

737
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:25,950
full of those guidelines and push the

738
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:29,250
developers to follow these guidelines to

739
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:31,140
keep relay very unsafe and I think

740
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:33,390
really good thing what we can do like

741
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:36,150
everyone not only owns whatever

742
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:38,420
one is to improve the communication with

743
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:41,130
security company and sharing the data

744
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:43,080
the threat unless data can help everyone

745
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:45,870
not only your customers buy in the

746
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:48,120
future cash knows every company I'm not

747
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:51,750
saying to be specific company by but

748
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:54,240
related security companies and of course

749
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:55,800
we know it's happening sometimes the

750
00:37:54,240 --> 00:38:00,029
wires definitely should check for

751
00:37:55,800 --> 00:38:02,070
potential malware in base number so

752
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:03,540
thank you thank you very much for your

753
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:08,030
time and now they really have some time

754
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:08,029
for questions and hopefully transport

755
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:24,800
the number right at the start of the

756
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:30,820
presentation we said four to five

757
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:34,310
percent of devices it's at 45 percent of

758
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:36,230
devices that have Avast Antivirus or is

759
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:39,650
that like a mint you mean the

760
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:40,760
information all right and the infection

761
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:43,850
do infection right

762
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:46,130
yeah actually is the whole user base PF

763
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:48,730
that what we can see into like it's

764
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:52,820
between countries the number of the

765
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:55,070
users they were that have encountered an

766
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:57,860
infection that yeah we pass block yes

767
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:59,600
it's from the Avast user base is a block

768
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:07,790
threat number of the block threats in

769
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:11,990
fact never use the base okay any more

770
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:15,140
questions guys no thank you very much it

771
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:18,370
you with us thank you for your time
