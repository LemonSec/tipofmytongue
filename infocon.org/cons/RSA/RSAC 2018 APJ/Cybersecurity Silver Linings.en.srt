1
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:14,670
look life is either a great adventure or

2
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:17,100
nothing right this moment there is an

3
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:20,520
adventurous some we're about to embark

4
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:24,810
on a transformative journey to script

5
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:26,939
our digital future she could invent a

6
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:29,310
renewable source of energy

7
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:32,519
perhaps a cure for cancer or a brain

8
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:37,109
computer interface maybe she'll redefine

9
00:00:32,519 --> 00:00:40,739
how smart cities get built the headlines

10
00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:44,269
of last year perhaps last week are a

11
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:48,809
reminder that on her journey looks

12
00:00:44,269 --> 00:00:52,079
unprecedented digital risk it casts a

13
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:55,129
dark shadow on whether what we have been

14
00:00:52,079 --> 00:01:00,649
up to for the last several decades

15
00:00:55,129 --> 00:01:04,620
matters at all it absolutely does

16
00:01:00,649 --> 00:01:08,460
cybersecurity is getting better not

17
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:12,300
worse and yes I mean that despite would

18
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:14,130
happen last week a very good afternoon

19
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:17,310
to all of you it's an honor to welcome

20
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:20,220
you to the 6th RSA Conference here and

21
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:22,950
beautiful Singapore there are 6,000 of

22
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:25,740
us here which is a testament to the

23
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:28,890
power the growing power I should say of

24
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:33,530
our community what we do with our time

25
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:37,260
together matters more so now than ever

26
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:44,010
now matters because it drives what's

27
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:46,770
next so let's not talk about the hackers

28
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:49,950
advantage they can do that in their own

29
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:53,820
conference let's talk about our

30
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:56,370
advantages let's not talk about the

31
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:59,490
future of threats let's talk about the

32
00:01:56,370 --> 00:02:01,560
future of security let's talk about how

33
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:05,280
the security community is getting

34
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:07,190
stronger and moving faster now of course

35
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,019
you will not see that in the headlines

36
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:13,019
it's unlikely that the Sydney Morning

37
00:02:10,019 --> 00:02:13,770
Herald will cover a story of how your

38
00:02:13,019 --> 00:02:15,630
brilliant

39
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:18,570
to implementation or multi-factor

40
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:20,519
authentication stopped nation-state

41
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:23,070
threat actors from accessing a critical

42
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:25,890
database sorry

43
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:27,959
but it's not happening now while we

44
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:31,320
cannot celebrate our individual

45
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:36,090
successes what we can celebrate is a

46
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:39,810
collective success as a community in a

47
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:45,300
ero bad news I call these the

48
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:51,270
cybersecurity silver linings now why

49
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:54,920
focus on silver linings because Marcus

50
00:02:51,270 --> 00:03:00,210
Buckingham a leading business expert

51
00:02:54,920 --> 00:03:04,320
said the recipe for lasting success is

52
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:07,070
to double down on your strengths just do

53
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:09,600
more of what's working and do it faster

54
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:15,150
we should consider this approach in

55
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:17,549
cybersecurity in addition we should pay

56
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:20,130
attention not just to the technology of

57
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:22,890
defense we should pay attention to the

58
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:26,579
psychology of defence the spirit of the

59
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:31,140
defender matters as much as the shield

60
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:34,380
that she or he wills for years we have

61
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:37,920
motivated ourselves by the fear of what

62
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:40,590
happens if we fail what if you could

63
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:44,220
inspire ourselves with the glory of what

64
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:47,340
we enable when we are successful over

65
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:50,609
the next few minutes let's review some

66
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:54,060
ideas some silver linings for us to

67
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:57,870
consider they are a blueprint for our

68
00:03:54,060 --> 00:04:02,250
current strengths fuel for our spirit

69
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:08,040
and a catalyst for advances yet to come

70
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:10,830
I call the first one end of the silver

71
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:13,350
bullet fantasy the essence of this one

72
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:17,070
is that teams that win it consistently

73
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:21,029
do not rely on silver bullets let's look

74
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:25,370
at one such team as of 2010 no British

75
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:25,369
cyclist had ever won the Tour de France

76
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:30,460
Dave Brailsford

77
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:33,250
coach of Team Sky proposed that success

78
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:36,580
would boil down to grinding out the

79
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:40,509
basics it get the big things right but

80
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:43,270
do not ignore the little things first

81
00:04:40,509 --> 00:04:46,830
the big things the terrain the context

82
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:51,159
they obsessed about every Bend every

83
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:54,729
incline this in order to slow down over

84
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:58,570
sharp bends and preserve energy for the

85
00:04:54,729 --> 00:05:00,969
steepest most important climbs they also

86
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:04,630
believed in a concept called the

87
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:08,580
aggregation of marginal gains the little

88
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:11,139
things the 1% improvements that add up

89
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:12,039
now they started by optimizing things

90
00:05:11,139 --> 00:05:15,160
you might expect

91
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:18,240
ergonomics of the bike seat nutrition of

92
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:22,060
riders but they did not stop there

93
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:25,410
they looked at mundane areas like the

94
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:27,430
pillows that offered the best sleep

95
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:33,090
that's right ladies and gentlemen

96
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:40,300
pillows they looked for 1% improvements

97
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:42,400
everywhere now coach believed that they

98
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:45,580
could win in about 5 years he was

99
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:48,849
completely wrong they wanted him to 2012

100
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:50,789
repeat in 2013 they captured 70% of the

101
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:55,389
medals and cyclists cyclists

102
00:05:50,789 --> 00:05:57,789
competitions in the 2012 Olympics they

103
00:05:55,389 --> 00:06:01,570
executed the most successful run in

104
00:05:57,789 --> 00:06:06,550
modern cycling history by not relying on

105
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:10,900
silver bullets they focused on being a

106
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:15,630
little bit better every day rather than

107
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:15,630
being totally unbeatable some day

108
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:21,760
similarly in cybersecurity we are no

109
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:25,690
longer lusting after shiny new gizmos

110
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:27,400
and taking a risk orientation and what

111
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:31,539
that means is paying attention to the

112
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:34,900
context the terrain or as Rob Joyce the

113
00:06:31,539 --> 00:06:40,950
former cybersecurity coordinator of the

114
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:40,950
White House says knowing your network

115
00:06:41,269 --> 00:06:49,819
risk is not the enemy too much of it is

116
00:06:45,729 --> 00:06:53,029
but very importantly so is too little of

117
00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:56,989
it so I was delighted to hear the

118
00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:59,539
executive from CSA imply that we should

119
00:06:56,989 --> 00:07:02,049
not let incidence of last week derail

120
00:06:59,539 --> 00:07:05,449
our digital ambitions

121
00:07:02,049 --> 00:07:08,989
between recklessness and complacency

122
00:07:05,449 --> 00:07:12,769
there is a Goldilocks zone of risk not

123
00:07:08,989 --> 00:07:15,529
too much not too little just right we

124
00:07:12,769 --> 00:07:18,049
are helping organisations manage digital

125
00:07:15,529 --> 00:07:23,329
risk by keeping them in this zone

126
00:07:18,049 --> 00:07:26,239
through business driven security cyber

127
00:07:23,329 --> 00:07:28,219
risk is top of mind especially here in

128
00:07:26,239 --> 00:07:31,729
Asia there are some estimates that say

129
00:07:28,219 --> 00:07:35,149
that organization is Asia are sixty to

130
00:07:31,729 --> 00:07:38,110
eighty percent more likely to be targets

131
00:07:35,149 --> 00:07:41,269
of cyber attacks

132
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:44,239
now if necessity is the mother of

133
00:07:41,269 --> 00:07:47,749
invention risk is the mother of

134
00:07:44,239 --> 00:07:50,929
insurance so the very best proof point

135
00:07:47,749 --> 00:07:57,259
of all that cyber risk is top of mind is

136
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:59,839
the rise of cyber insurance the cost of

137
00:07:57,259 --> 00:08:04,879
premiums worldwide is already in the

138
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:07,759
billions more importantly though we are

139
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:11,360
getting better at quantifying cyber risk

140
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:15,229
in terms of dollars and cents using

141
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:17,809
standards like fair and bowtie cyber

142
00:08:15,229 --> 00:08:20,869
risk quantification is an essential tool

143
00:08:17,809 --> 00:08:23,389
for business stakeholders to understand

144
00:08:20,869 --> 00:08:27,999
cyber security in terms of financial

145
00:08:23,389 --> 00:08:27,999
terms a language that they understand

146
00:08:28,149 --> 00:08:35,599
cybersecurity teams today do have an

147
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:38,959
uphill challenge 44% of incidents go

148
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:42,649
unhandled we have gone new terms like

149
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:45,170
cyber fatigue I have no idea what's next

150
00:08:42,649 --> 00:08:49,309
in our cyber vocabulary cyber

151
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:53,420
frustration perhaps I personally like

152
00:08:49,309 --> 00:08:54,680
cyber joy the feeling that you get when

153
00:08:53,420 --> 00:09:01,250
you kick

154
00:08:54,680 --> 00:09:03,770
hackers behind now by prioritizing our

155
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:06,350
incidents based on business context and

156
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:09,710
focusing on the crown jewels the most

157
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:13,010
important systems processes and people

158
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:15,800
we have a recipe for cyber joy our

159
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:18,020
understanding of our business context is

160
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:20,300
the one and only one asymmetric

161
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:24,350
advantage that we the good guys have it

162
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:27,050
helps us preserve energy for the most

163
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:32,500
important steepest climbs the things

164
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:35,180
that matter most now if you think about

165
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:37,550
how we're doing in terms of the big

166
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:39,290
things it's all about managing risks

167
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:41,540
taking a business driven security

168
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:44,890
approach now let's talk about how we're

169
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:47,599
doing on the little things cyber hygiene

170
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:50,420
now while hackers are not great

171
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,140
specimens of humanity they are human

172
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:54,319
after all

173
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:57,589
and contrary to popular belief they too

174
00:09:54,320 --> 00:10:01,100
have limited resources and they go after

175
00:09:57,589 --> 00:10:05,390
the path of least resistance they go

176
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:07,820
after juicy or easy targets so let's not

177
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:09,410
be easy targets let's take care of the

178
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:14,450
basics let's take care of the little

179
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:17,870
things when one Tesla Drive drives over

180
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:18,580
a pothole the entire fleet learns how to

181
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:21,410
avoid it

182
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:24,740
we need fleet learning like that in

183
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:27,589
cybersecurity if a vulnerability has

184
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:29,990
been exploited in the wild let's not

185
00:10:27,589 --> 00:10:34,730
drive over that pothole again let's

186
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:37,339
patch it wanna cry the ransomware attack

187
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:40,940
that lets led to billions of dollars in

188
00:10:37,339 --> 00:10:43,370
damage globally was our wake-up call we

189
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:46,160
failed to patch a vulnerability called

190
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:49,130
eternal blue the exploit kit for which

191
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,990
was available in the wild now since then

192
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:55,730
we have upped our game in terms of

193
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:58,430
patching IT and OTA infrastructure the

194
00:10:55,730 --> 00:11:03,020
adoption of multi-factor authentication

195
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:04,339
is at 60% in the enterprise 40-plus

196
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:08,209
percent even in small and medium

197
00:11:04,339 --> 00:11:11,779
businesses companies worldwide are

198
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:14,569
making unified risk-based identity

199
00:11:11,779 --> 00:11:18,290
access assurance from the ground to the

200
00:11:14,569 --> 00:11:22,729
cloud debt of the password

201
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:28,429
perhaps progress phenomenal progress on

202
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:31,009
little things absolutely we today are

203
00:11:28,429 --> 00:11:34,249
focused on being a little bit safer

204
00:11:31,009 --> 00:11:37,579
every day rather than being totally

205
00:11:34,249 --> 00:11:42,069
unhackable some day we ladies and

206
00:11:37,579 --> 00:11:46,300
gentlemen have escaped the lure of the

207
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:49,939
Silver Bullet fantasy

208
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:52,719
Silver Lining number one transitioning

209
00:11:49,939 --> 00:11:58,309
to silver lining number two that I call

210
00:11:52,720 --> 00:12:01,790
Quicksilver law of cyber defense in the

211
00:11:58,309 --> 00:12:04,429
recently concluded FIFA World Cup the

212
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:06,618
team from Japan did exceedingly

213
00:12:04,429 --> 00:12:11,059
exceedingly well and he folks from Japan

214
00:12:06,619 --> 00:12:13,699
out here come on folks from Japan he's

215
00:12:11,059 --> 00:12:15,649
got to be more look

216
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:19,160
they demonstrated phenomenal

217
00:12:15,649 --> 00:12:22,339
sportsmanship but more importantly their

218
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:25,670
secret sauce was defensive anticipation

219
00:12:22,339 --> 00:12:29,860
the ability to get to the right place at

220
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:29,860
the right time before the opponent

221
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:36,649
Quicksilver law of cyber defense in the

222
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:39,920
cyber security field to the ball moves

223
00:12:36,649 --> 00:12:42,759
pretty darn fast technology has grown

224
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:46,579
exponentially powered by Moore's Law

225
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:50,209
software is eating the world and AI they

226
00:12:46,579 --> 00:12:52,399
say is eating software I have no idea

227
00:12:50,209 --> 00:12:54,969
what is eating what what I do know is

228
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:58,459
that in the digital world we defend

229
00:12:54,970 --> 00:13:01,459
technology is everywhere over the next

230
00:12:58,459 --> 00:13:03,739
decade our trillion lines of code will

231
00:13:01,459 --> 00:13:07,540
be shipped by companies that have never

232
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:11,709
shipped code companies that make trucks

233
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:11,709
pacemakers or sell insurance

234
00:13:13,899 --> 00:13:20,660
now the s-curve of Technology has

235
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:21,939
flattened out over time so it's not just

236
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:24,598
that technology

237
00:13:21,939 --> 00:13:33,238
is everywhere it's getting adopted

238
00:13:24,599 --> 00:13:36,189
faster than ever now if you think about

239
00:13:33,239 --> 00:13:39,489
how this influences cybersecurity

240
00:13:36,189 --> 00:13:43,809
practitioners technology is absolutely

241
00:13:39,489 --> 00:13:47,139
an accelerant for us it helps us but it

242
00:13:43,809 --> 00:13:49,839
is a weapon not just for the defense but

243
00:13:47,139 --> 00:13:51,999
for the offense the bad guys have all

244
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:54,909
the same technology that we the good

245
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:58,799
guys have and the Murphy's Law of

246
00:13:54,909 --> 00:14:05,199
cybersecurity states that new technology

247
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:10,409
equals new vulnerabilities technology is

248
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:15,189
as much a target as it is of weapon

249
00:14:10,409 --> 00:14:18,699
compromised AI or tampered data can be a

250
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:22,929
disaster in a AI and machine learning

251
00:14:18,699 --> 00:14:25,389
powered world now there has always been

252
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:28,959
a gap between when a technology becomes

253
00:14:25,389 --> 00:14:31,749
mainstream versus when we the cyber

254
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:35,409
security professionals learn how to

255
00:14:31,749 --> 00:14:38,499
leverage it and how to protect it let's

256
00:14:35,409 --> 00:14:42,399
call this the cybersecurity afterthought

257
00:14:38,499 --> 00:14:45,099
gap so we had RSA conducted a study

258
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,869
going over multiple decades to see how

259
00:14:45,099 --> 00:14:52,989
we were doing in terms of closing this

260
00:14:46,869 --> 00:14:56,169
gap as an example biometrics emerged as

261
00:14:52,989 --> 00:14:58,839
a mainstream technology back in 2001 but

262
00:14:56,169 --> 00:15:03,399
it did not figure in our vernacular here

263
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:04,149
at RSA conference until 2009 are we

264
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:07,209
making progress

265
00:15:04,149 --> 00:15:10,239
yes progress is very real if you look at

266
00:15:07,209 --> 00:15:14,679
other technologies like cloud computing

267
00:15:10,239 --> 00:15:21,159
that gap was three years I or T a mere

268
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:25,449
12 months machine learning even less now

269
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:29,529
I was talking to the CISO of a financial

270
00:15:25,449 --> 00:15:33,789
services organization it was clear to me

271
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:35,070
he was sleep deprived it was also clear

272
00:15:33,789 --> 00:15:38,760
to me

273
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:40,320
that he was ultra excited about the use

274
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:43,890
of machine learning to build an

275
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:45,990
intelligent sock and recruit machines to

276
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:49,350
fight alongside the humans in the sock

277
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:54,510
and at the centerpiece of this is the

278
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:57,450
evolved sim that pulls data and provides

279
00:15:54,510 --> 00:16:01,530
pervasive visibility from all facets of

280
00:15:57,450 --> 00:16:06,780
the attack surface users endpoints

281
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:09,540
network data center above that user and

282
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:12,390
entity behavioral analytics provides

283
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:15,510
continuous insight to help the human

284
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:19,500
analyst anticipate and move with speed

285
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:22,020
and efficacy and finally automated

286
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:25,080
orchestration can close the loop and

287
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:26,960
implement actions to plug the holes and

288
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:33,120
remediate their attacks

289
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:36,210
visibility incites action and hopefully

290
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:39,960
a lot more sleep for my friend the

291
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:42,690
scissor we are finally also paying

292
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:45,330
attention to the user experience by

293
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:48,390
using state-of-the-art visualization

294
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:51,150
technology we have security offerings

295
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:54,300
now which are beautiful security

296
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:57,420
security that is not just intuitive but

297
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:59,430
almost enjoyable to use we have the

298
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:02,699
advent of the era where we have slack

299
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:05,399
like you eyes argumented with chat BOTS

300
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:09,870
that are helping the human analyst be

301
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:13,079
more effective now if you think about

302
00:17:09,869 --> 00:17:16,109
standards in the fraud world the

303
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:19,560
adoption of 3ds 2.0 the very premise of

304
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:22,770
it it is to eliminate user friction even

305
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:26,099
as we combat fraud so this innovation in

306
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:28,560
user experience will help cyber security

307
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:32,010
practitioners anticipate move faster

308
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:34,820
when speed is of essence so as new

309
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:37,080
technology becomes mainstream we

310
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:40,379
professionals and cyber security are

311
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:44,460
moving faster than ever to leverage it

312
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:47,760
and protect it in a world powered by

313
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:48,780
Moore's Law and a world complicated by

314
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,390
more

315
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:54,420
is law of cybersecurity we are

316
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:57,000
anticipating better and getting to the

317
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:59,400
ball before the opponent deaths we are

318
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:04,080
getting better at the Quicksilver law of

319
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:05,160
cyber defense all right on to the third

320
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:10,740
silver lining

321
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:13,470
magic of sterling teamwork Malcolm

322
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:15,840
Gladwell defined a weakling sport as one

323
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:20,510
where you cannot win unless everyone

324
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:24,510
contributes rowing is the ultimate

325
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:29,070
weakling sport if anyone on the team is

326
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:32,310
off sync even by a split second it ruins

327
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:36,090
the timing of the entire team so let's

328
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:38,190
take a rowing example for this silver

329
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:41,250
lining

330
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:43,680
let's go to the iconic skyline of Hong

331
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:46,610
Kong where in the recent Dragon race

332
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:50,160
competition the team for Singapore

333
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:56,310
actually did phenomenally well any

334
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:58,230
Singaporeans out here no so let's let's

335
00:18:56,310 --> 00:19:00,780
diagnose what happened there what was

336
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:04,320
the secret sauce of the team as we spoke

337
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:08,340
to the captain of the women's rowing

338
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:11,189
team she expressed that the secret of

339
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:14,699
their success was of course teamwork

340
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:18,180
hard work but what was also noticeable

341
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:21,150
was that in addition to that it was

342
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:25,290
trust and communication between members

343
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:28,230
of team inside the boat she also notes

344
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:31,590
that one of the elements of success was

345
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:34,980
contribution from stakeholders outside

346
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:37,560
the boat programs University programs

347
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:42,480
that provided the depth of talent and

348
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:45,720
diversity into the team net-net to drive

349
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:49,640
that significant performance required a

350
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:54,920
great teamwork inside the boat and

351
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:59,010
outside now we to win in cyber security

352
00:19:54,920 --> 00:20:03,150
must gonner collaborations between folks

353
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:06,840
in the boat risk and cybersecurity teams

354
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:09,840
but we also need help from folks outside

355
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:13,860
the boat think about business

356
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:18,290
stakeholders policymakers regulators IT

357
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:22,530

359
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:29,250
happened today the phyto alliance

360
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:32,580
fantastic examples of teaming within the

361
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:35,550
boat the governments and policy makers

362
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:36,590
and regulators are absolutely stepping

363
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:39,629
up as well

364
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:41,879

phenomenal progress in terms of policy

371
00:20:56,670 --> 00:21:02,700
making in this very region now in

372
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:06,059
addition APJ governments are also paying

373
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:06,750
attention and instituting data privacy

374
00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:10,230
laws

375
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:12,780
Singapore's Personal Data Protection Act

376
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:16,500
Hong Kong's personal data privacy

377
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:18,750
ordinance Japan's privacy law great

378
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:21,120
progress in terms of caring for the

379
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:24,600
notion of data privacy to manage that

380
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:27,659
aspect of digital risk in addition

381
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:29,550
ministry is here much like the example

382
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:31,980
that we saw here in Singapore has the

383
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:35,669
cyber security agency in Thailand you

384
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:37,890
have a de in in Malaysia and Indonesia

385
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:39,750
you have cyber security agencies so

386
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:41,880
again they're establishing focused

387
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:44,130
organizations to help with their

388
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:46,500
security risk posture and managing

389
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:48,780
digital risk at the national level from

390
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:51,360
a policy perspective business

391
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:54,240
stakeholders as well in in this region

392
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:56,219
are absolutely more engaged the National

393
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:59,250
Association of corporate directors says

394
00:21:56,220 --> 00:22:01,980
cyber security is a topic at board level

395
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:05,550
at least two times a year even in this

396
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:08,040
region universities worldwide are doing

397
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:10,260
great work in terms of inculcating and

398
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:13,020
building and feeding talent into the

399
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:15,750
good fight we are say through our

400
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:16,750
academic alliance program are honored to

401
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:19,240
be working

402
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:22,810
with Temasek Polytechnic right here in

403
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:27,810
Singapore to allow students to have the

404
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:31,870
opportunity to work in a real world sock

405
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:34,389
now in addition to all of this no matter

406
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:37,570
what we do in the domain of security we

407
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:40,810
need help from IT to build resilience

408
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:43,300
and help reduce the attack surface and

409
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:46,290
we get to see this at close quarters

410
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:49,990
because we are part of Dell technologies

411
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:54,010
we are absolutely seeing greater

412
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:56,680
mindshare of cyber security at the CIOs

413
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:59,430
desk we are seeing adoption of

414
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:01,930
technologies like micro segmentation and

415
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:04,720
instrumenting security right in the

416
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:07,090
virtualization layer we're also seeing

417
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:10,750
great innovation in what is now called

418
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:13,330
dev sac ops which basically takes

419
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:15,460
security and burns it into the very

420
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:18,850
heart of the software development

421
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:21,310
process we are designing security in as

422
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:26,199
opposed to bolting it on as an

423
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:30,520
afterthought now to build a strong

424
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:33,520
security posture you must have different

425
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:36,730
ideas different perspectives diversity

426
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:40,150
is key if you're unable to attract

427
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:43,870
diversity in your workforce gender race

428
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:45,940
national origin religion orientation you

429
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:47,709
cannot be successful in the field of

430
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:50,080
cyber security you need to look at the

431
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:52,600
problem from many diverse perspectives

432
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:55,480
in order to move at the velocity that is

433
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:58,449
needed to execute on the cyber security

434
00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:00,190
challenge and we at RSA are honoured and

435
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:03,040
committed to this very important cause

436
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:06,700
our diverse diversity is specifically in

437
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:07,450
the cybersecurity talent game look what

438
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:09,220
am I saying

439
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:14,380
I'm saying we are getting better at

440
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:16,810
teaming and everyone is chipping in so

441
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:19,080
let's recap we talked through three

442
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:24,280
silver linings for us to consider and

443
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:30,760
double down on and build upon first risk

444
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:33,530
orientation not silver bullets second

445
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:38,559
quicksilver like pace to adopt

446
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:42,230
technology and anticipate better third

447
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:49,809
Sterling team buck inside and outside

448
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:53,780
the boot look I am NOT in denial that

449
00:24:49,809 --> 00:24:57,010
while there are silver linings there do

450
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:59,809
exist clouds pretty dark ones at that

451
00:24:57,010 --> 00:25:02,299
just look at the q2 earnings for many

452
00:24:59,809 --> 00:25:02,899
companies like mark Mondelez Reckitt

453
00:25:02,299 --> 00:25:06,889
Benckiser

454
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:08,900
they cite sovereigns incidents as as the

455
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:11,179
main factor for impacting their

456
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:13,700
financial results and this will lead to

457
00:25:11,179 --> 00:25:16,970
very personal accountability there are

458
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:19,400
no sacred cows cyber incidents put

459
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:21,770
everyone's career at stake today from

460
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:27,940
the chairperson of the board to the CEO

461
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:31,960
on down here in APJ the economic losses

462
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:37,130
due to cyber attacks were tantamount to

463
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:41,690
1.75 trillion with the T dollars just in

464
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:45,650
2017 and that that's equivalent to 7% of

465
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:49,130
the region's GDP think about that for a

466
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:51,410
moment and in this region we suspect

467
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:56,360
that there is under reporting of cyber

468
00:25:51,410 --> 00:26:00,169
incidents that's pretty dark the

469
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:04,219
personal data of 1.5 million Singh

470
00:26:00,169 --> 00:26:09,280
health patients stolen right here that's

471
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:12,559
a pretty dark shade right there an

472
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:15,649
incident with an autonomous vehicle in

473
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:20,960
Arizona United States can shake up or

474
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:23,120
trust in technologies like AI a similar

475
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,429
accident where the cause is a cyber

476
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:30,260
isn't incident is not a far-fetched

477
00:26:25,429 --> 00:26:33,260
notion at all look data and technology

478
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:36,049
are the fuels for our digital

479
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:40,090
transformation our trust in them is

480
00:26:36,049 --> 00:26:42,860
tenuous there is a very very fine line

481
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:47,178
between TAC love

482
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:51,500
and tackle ash it takes a lifetime to

483
00:26:47,179 --> 00:26:54,400
build trust but only a moment to lose it

484
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:57,950
so as much as we worry about avoiding

485
00:26:54,400 --> 00:27:01,660
breaches in our respective organizations

486
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:05,270
the largest collective risk we face is

487
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:09,890
our failure to avoid the breach of trust

488
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:13,429
in technology itself that's what's at

489
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:15,980
stake now we started our conversation by

490
00:27:13,429 --> 00:27:18,320
talking about headlines and it's simply

491
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:21,950
the nature of our work that our biggest

492
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:25,040
wins will never be front-page news when

493
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:27,770
we execute on the silver linings we

494
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:32,210
don't make headlines in fact we stop the

495
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:34,370
bad ones but our work is not nor has it

496
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:36,320
ever been about getting our own

497
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:38,809
headlines it's about protecting people

498
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:41,750
and technology in an increasingly

499
00:27:38,809 --> 00:27:44,149
digital world that's what it's about

500
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:47,000
it's about enabling the digital

501
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:49,850
adventurers to go forth and make their

502
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,429
own headlines and we've certainly had

503
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:55,699
some very inspiring headlines in this

504
00:27:52,429 --> 00:27:58,090
last year our world now has machine

505
00:27:55,700 --> 00:28:02,570
vision apps for the visually impaired

506
00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:06,379
virtual reality that enables surgeons to

507
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:08,809
conduct remote surgery artificial

508
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:10,940
intelligence that can tell whether the

509
00:28:08,809 --> 00:28:13,570
caller on the other line is having a

510
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:17,330
heart attack as they make the 911 call

511
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:20,960
we have startups that are using the

512
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:26,750
internet to provide access to clean

513
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:27,980
water micro loans to people who don't

514
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:30,350
have access to it

515
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:33,410
we have a power plant coming online this

516
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:36,100
year that will burn fossil fuels but

517
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:39,500
will not produce greenhouse gases and

518
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:43,250
looking to the next generation we have

519
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:46,280
twice as many girls and three times as

520
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:48,350
many minority students in the AP

521
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:52,970
computer science classes today than we

522
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:55,730
did in 2016 now whether these

523

organizations to

525
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:04,309
they're digital destination it's kind of

526
00:29:00,679 --> 00:29:07,879
up to us it is our privilege and our

527
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:10,820
burden to ensure that they stay in this

528
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:13,809
Goldilocks zone of risk as they go forth

529
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:17,389

535
00:29:31,029 --> 00:29:40,450
technologies people and companies to

536
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:44,179
