my name is trevor hughes and i'm the

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:16,540
president and CEO of the IA p p the

4
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:19,050
international association of privacy

5
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:21,669
professionals we are the world's largest

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:23,620
privacy organization we represent all of

7
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:26,410
the people in the world who work in data

8
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:30,520
protection and privacy and I'm delighted

9
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:33,880
to be here at RSA this year joined by an

10
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:36,250
esteemed panel to talk about four little

11
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:39,310
letters four little letters that have

12
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:43,360
been causing us so much trouble so much

13
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:46,960
work and of course those are g.d.p are

14
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:49,690
the general data protection regulation

15
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:53,050
the regulation passed just some years

16
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:55,180
ago but went into effect on May 25th of

17
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:58,239
this year just over two months ago and

18
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:59,969
it has created an enormous amount of

19
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:02,468
work for organizations around the world

20
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:05,468
what we thought we would do for you

21
00:01:02,469 --> 00:01:07,929
today is create a panel of experts

22
00:01:05,468 --> 00:01:10,780
representing views from around the world

23
00:01:07,929 --> 00:01:13,209
on the effect of GDP our what it means

24
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:16,090
to organizations today and what we might

25
00:01:13,209 --> 00:01:18,249
expect in the future let me give you

26
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:20,200
just a little bit of background on how

27
00:01:18,249 --> 00:01:22,719
we got to where we are now and then

28
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:25,749
we'll dive into things with our

29
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:27,699
panelists so first of all the GD P R is

30
00:01:25,749 --> 00:01:31,749
a replacement it is a regulation that

31
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:33,849
replaces a directive in Europe in 1995

32
00:01:31,749 --> 00:01:36,279
the European Union passed the Data

33
00:01:33,849 --> 00:01:38,079
Protection Directive which was the law

34
00:01:36,279 --> 00:01:42,039
of Europe with regards to data

35
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:45,490
protection for over 20 years however

36
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:48,249
given that that law was passed in 1995

37
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:51,158
and as a result did not reflect the

38
00:01:48,249 --> 00:01:53,048
internet or smartphones the rise of

39
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:55,270
social media many of the technologies

40
00:01:53,049 --> 00:01:58,119
that we take for granted today there was

41
00:01:55,270 --> 00:02:00,459
a recognition that a new standard a new

42
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:02,739
set of policies needed to be created and

43
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:05,979
so the GD P R the general data

44
00:02:02,739 --> 00:02:08,670
protection regulation it was drafted

45
00:02:05,979 --> 00:02:12,040
early about seven eight years ago and

46
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:14,380
passed just four or five years ago with

47
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:16,480
an expectation of May 25th being that

48
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:21,519
compliance deadlines so now we are in

49
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:23,829
the gdpr era and it is a monumental

50
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,180
moment for data protection one of the

51
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:27,130
things that we are seeing around the

52
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:29,560
world is tremendous investment and

53
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:31,329
growth in privacy and data protection I

54
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:35,440
can give you a sense of that from the

55
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:37,590
IEP P itself we have 42,000 members

56
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:42,400
around the world in over 100 countries

57
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:44,590
but just 24 months ago we had 20,000

58
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,310
members around the world so the size of

59
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:51,520
the IEP P if that is any indicator of

60
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:54,430
how GD P R has affected our world

61
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:59,710
I think our growth is a great indicator

62
00:02:54,430 --> 00:03:02,020
of that ok welcome to you all

63
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:04,270
I am going to play a little game as we

64
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:06,010
go through the panel today and the

65
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:09,130
little game is I'm going to read a quote

66
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:13,359
and you get to guess who it is

67
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:15,640
so our first quote is there are no grace

68
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:20,260
periods because the grace period was

69
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:23,760
already two years ago who said that I'm

70
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:29,350
gonna guess that was Helen Dixon wrong

71
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:32,530
any other guesses another good guess but

72
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:34,690
also wrong it's Andrea Yellin act under

73
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:38,080
a yellow neck is the Austrian Data

74
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:40,390
Protection Commissioner and aundrea was

75
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,030
talking of course about the GDP our she

76
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:46,929
is notably now the chair of the European

77
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:49,390
Data Protection Board and let's use that

78
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:52,240
quote as a way to talk about how

79
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:54,220
prepared we are so who would like to

80
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:56,740
start where are we in terms of our

81
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:58,870
preparations for GDP our and in many

82
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:02,110
ways are we too late if we're still

83
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:04,240
preparing for GDP are so Trevor I'll

84
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:06,640
start with that question one of the

85
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:08,290
things that we've seen in helping

86
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,079
companies around the world in their

87
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:14,560
preparation for GDP are is that a lot of

88
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:17,620
work has been put in but only 20% of

89
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:20,079
companies that we surveyed recently have

90
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:23,590
actually claimed to be GDP our

91
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:26,260
compliance many more are actually in the

92
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:27,369
process of implementation but have a

93
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:30,880
number of other

94
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:33,430
they're still trying to complete in fact

95
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:36,940
there are I think if I recall correctly

96
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:40,030
about 30% or so that have not even begun

97
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:42,340
to prepare and so there are many many

98
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:44,859
organizations that still have a lot of

99
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:46,330
work to do but we do know that many

100
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:49,660
organizations have put a tremendous

101
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:52,210
amount of effort in to place already to

102
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:54,520
begin to understand what's happening

103
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:56,919
with their data in a way that they had

104
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:59,109
not necessarily ever done before they're

105
00:04:56,919 --> 00:05:02,109
doing inventories they're beginning to

106
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:03,780
do much more stringent assessments and

107
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:06,100
things of that nature

108
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:09,429
there is new year with a global

109
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:13,180
multinational describe how the global

110
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:15,280
focus on gdpr has affected a on is it a

111
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:17,650
is it a big project how many people

112
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,599
around the world how senior was the

113
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:22,840
engagement for four gdpr

114
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:25,330
so as a global organization I think the

115
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:27,638
focus on GDP are just really put a

116
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:28,810
spotlight on how important data was to

117
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:30,669
the company

118
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:32,680
we've always marketed ourselves as a

119
00:05:30,669 --> 00:05:35,440
data-driven entity just being in risk

120
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:37,270
and reinsurance and so in terms of

121
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,490
involvement we had involvement all the

122
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:42,669
way up from the CEO level on the board

123
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:45,190
level and that really increased the

124
00:05:42,669 --> 00:05:47,680
amount of I guess expenditure that we

125
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:49,870
had in order to be in compliance so that

126
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,810
that was a lucky thing that we had but

127
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:54,460
in terms of focus towards not just

128
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:56,680
Europe I think understanding that there

129
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:59,440
were data flows not just originating

130
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:01,780
from Europe but also coming from other

131
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,960
parts of the wall into Europe and those

132
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:07,780
are important areas has been really good

133
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,520
from a privacy professional perspective

134
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:11,770
because you do get to understand your

135
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:14,409
business better but also to understand

136
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:16,479
where your data is located where how

137
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:18,610
your data is being used and what kind of

138
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,320
people are we actually interacting with

139
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:22,120
when we are collecting this kind of data

140
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,949
so through Italy let me stay with you

141
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,990
just for one second because I think it's

142
00:06:23,949 --> 00:06:29,320
important to note that the GD P R is a

143
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:31,360
European regulation but the effect of GD

144
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:33,419
P R is very much global and that's

145
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,280
because GD P R has what we call

146
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:37,659
extraterritorial application so if you

147
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:40,570
are an organization around the world

148
00:06:37,659 --> 00:06:41,030
that that interacts with a data subject

149
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:44,090
with a

150
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:46,640
person in Europe you are theoretically

151
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:49,609
subject to gdpr is that right absolutely

152
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:52,280
and I think the gdpr makes a reference

153
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:55,400
that if you are transacting with an EU

154
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:57,409
resident that just makes you you have to

155
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,690
comply with the obligations of a GDP R

156
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:02,630
and I think there is a bit of a lack of

157
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:04,820
understanding with when there's a GDP r

158
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:07,100
apply outside of the EU I think a lot of

159
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:09,290
companies out here say that's a European

160
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:10,790
legislation you know we have other laws

161
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:13,520
here we don't need to comply with that

162
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:16,100
but ultimately you know when you have a

163
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:18,409
4% global turnover being the sanction

164
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:20,930
that's really when organizations really

165
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:22,400
need to kind of realize hey we need to

166
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:24,170
look at this European piece of

167
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,210
legislation that we've never really kind

168
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:28,100
of paid attention to much before so

169
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:30,680
we'll talk about enforcement in a second

170
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:33,080
but four percent of global turnover is

171
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:36,500
fines that creates I think some

172
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:38,780
attention from senior execs Alex tell us

173
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:41,030
a little bit from the perspective of

174
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:42,979
Accenture what do you see the readiness

175
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:44,719
as around the world

176
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:47,180
Accenture clearly is a very global

177
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,220
organization are there differences

178
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:52,790
between multinational corporations and

179
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:54,620
small and medium-sized businesses is are

180
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:57,050
there regions of the world that are more

181
00:07:54,620 --> 00:08:00,740
focused on GDP are right now what is the

182
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:03,620
perspective that you see yeah so very

183
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:07,910
clearly and from an European perspective

184
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:09,650
specifically I think there is a great

185
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:12,860
advancement currently with many

186
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:15,469
companies on readiness so I see

187
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:18,260
especially in Europe everybody is

188
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:19,670
prepared on GDP are in a kind of way and

189
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:22,490
so it doesn't means that there are a

190
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:25,550
hundred percent done with it especially

191
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:28,670
for the semi companies so the medium and

192
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:31,790
small-sized companies but if I'm going

193
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:35,210
to the doctor even my Carnival Club all

194
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:37,550
all of those kind of associations small

195
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:39,010
companies if these bakeries if needed

196
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:41,299
they are kind of coming up with

197
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:45,319
notifications and consent and whatever

198
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:47,569
so it's truly like that are they ready

199
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:49,730
in other aspects of GDP our readiness

200
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:52,280
I'm not sure about this but you

201
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:54,209
definitely see a much greater sense of

202
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:58,499
understanding and awareness

203
00:08:54,209 --> 00:09:02,998
it means to handle personal data for us

204
00:08:58,499 --> 00:09:06,990
at Accenture obviously gdpr was a big

205
00:09:02,999 --> 00:09:08,939
advantage also to push it as enhance for

206
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:12,269
our data privacy and also for our

207
00:09:08,939 --> 00:09:14,490
information security system into the

208
00:09:12,269 --> 00:09:19,740
company and push it through because we

209
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:21,269
are in more than 40 45 countries so we

210
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:23,399
really need to make sure that we have a

211
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:28,619
global baseline so we leverage GDP

212
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:30,240
alphas that are we ready yes we are we

213
00:09:28,619 --> 00:09:33,389
have implemented what we had to

214
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,019
implement is this perfect I don't think

215
00:09:33,389 --> 00:09:36,929
so

216
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:40,439
I think we are now in what we call a

217
00:09:36,929 --> 00:09:42,149
phase to make further improvements to

218
00:09:40,439 --> 00:09:45,209
what you have implemented in the

219
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:48,329
processes and also learn actually how it

220
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:50,638
really works because in the beginning it

221
00:09:48,329 --> 00:09:54,329
was all on paper and it was all in

222
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:56,490
theory but now we are learning in the

223
00:09:54,329 --> 00:09:59,910
daily doing what we can do better and

224
00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:01,410
how to improve excellent so I I find it

225
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:03,240
really compelling that for a large

226
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:06,179
organization like Accenture you're using

227
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:09,059
gdpr as a global baseline yes that that

228
00:10:06,179 --> 00:10:12,119
is sort of the expectation and then I

229
00:10:09,059 --> 00:10:15,990
presume you do variation by jurisdiction

230
00:10:12,119 --> 00:10:18,360
if there is law that changes beyond gdpr

231
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:20,579
yeah I think we are seeing an

232
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,129
interesting effect with gdpr and that is

233
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:24,660
that not only does it have a

234
00:10:22,129 --> 00:10:26,459
extraterritorial application so you may

235
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:29,040
not be a European organization but you

236
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:31,410
may be subject to gdpr but also many

237
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:34,439
organizations like Accenture are using

238
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:37,019
gdpr as their baseline for managing data

239
00:10:34,439 --> 00:10:38,549
protection managing privacy around the

240
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:42,029
world and one of the things that's

241
00:10:38,549 --> 00:10:44,549
driving that is the need under gdpr for

242
00:10:42,029 --> 00:10:46,829
you to having agreements in place with

243
00:10:44,549 --> 00:10:50,670
all of the companies with which you

244
00:10:46,829 --> 00:10:53,729
transact data data processor agreements

245
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:55,829
DPAs they're becoming a well-known thing

246
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:59,009
hilary maybe you could talk a little bit

247
00:10:55,829 --> 00:11:01,589
about this so some organizations which

248
00:10:59,009 --> 00:11:03,720
may not ever have a customer in europe

249
00:11:01,589 --> 00:11:05,339
may actually receive one of these data

250
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,220
processor agreements because of a

251
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:08,870
customer or a partner

252
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:11,660
a vendor that they work with is that

253
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:14,089
right that's absolutely right so one of

254
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:17,000
the things that's required under gdpr is

255
00:11:14,089 --> 00:11:18,980
if you are a controller of data

256
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,870
controllers the one who makes the

257
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:23,300
company that makes the decisions about

258
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:26,180
the data your obligation when you're

259
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:27,979
engaging any third party regardless of

260
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:31,250
where they are in the supply chain is to

261
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:32,720
make sure that they and those connected

262
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:34,430
with them in that supply chain are

263
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,889
entering into these new agreements that

264
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:39,319
Trevor is mentioning so a data processor

265
00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:42,050
agreement or a data processing addendum

266
00:11:39,319 --> 00:11:45,099
known by this new acronym DPA is

267
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:48,139
something that everyone who's engaging

268
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:50,300
third-party suppliers vendors is going

269
00:11:48,139 --> 00:11:52,430
to need to make sure is put in place and

270
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:53,660
it's very different from the kinds of

271
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:56,209
agreements that we've seen before

272
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:59,089
they're very specific obligations with

273
00:11:56,209 --> 00:12:01,910
respect to things like notifications of

274
00:11:59,089 --> 00:12:03,980
security breaches managing individual

275
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:06,019
rights cooperating with a data

276
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:08,389
controller making sure that adequate

277
00:12:06,019 --> 00:12:11,029
protections are being put in place and

278
00:12:08,389 --> 00:12:13,660
then binding anybody else that's

279
00:12:11,029 --> 00:12:16,610
actually working together with you

280
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:18,110
subprocessors hosting providers others

281
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:20,120
that help to provide the service

282
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:21,019
together has to enter into an agreement

283
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:23,089
as well

284
00:12:21,019 --> 00:12:25,459
what we're seeing as a result is that

285
00:12:23,089 --> 00:12:28,399
this is taking up a tremendous amount of

286
00:12:25,459 --> 00:12:31,459
time for organizations to negotiate and

287
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:33,680
it does need to be coupled with some

288
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:36,439
really good due diligence about whether

289
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:39,170
the organizations that you're engaging

290
00:12:36,439 --> 00:12:41,410
the vendors you're engaging are in fact

291
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:44,180
those that can meet these requirements

292
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:47,569
because of the as we were talking about

293
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:49,519
already three snoo is saying the 4% fine

294
00:12:47,569 --> 00:12:51,139
that one can have if you're not meeting

295
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,879
these requirements effectively we're

296
00:12:51,139 --> 00:12:55,879
gonna get to the four percent fines I

297
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:58,819
promise so it is interesting though that

298
00:12:55,879 --> 00:13:00,910
whether you are directly subject to gdpr

299
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:03,110
because you're based in Europe or

300
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:05,480
through extraterritorial application

301
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:06,769
you're subject to gdpr because you're

302
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,720
based outside of Europe that you have

303
00:13:06,769 --> 00:13:12,529
European customers there is a long

304
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:14,209
shadow to gdpr which is that many global

305
00:13:12,529 --> 00:13:16,610
organizations are using it as their

306
00:13:14,209 --> 00:13:18,349
baseline and many other organizations

307
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:20,899
are sending out these data processor

308
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:24,259
agreements which essentially bacon

309
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:26,660
GDP our protections through contract to

310
00:13:24,259 --> 00:13:28,519
your organization I think the big

311
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:31,129
message that we're trying to convey with

312
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:33,680
the panel here is that whether you think

313
00:13:31,129 --> 00:13:36,589
you are subject to GDP are or not you

314
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:38,569
are likely to struggle with some of the

315
00:13:36,589 --> 00:13:40,189
effects of GDP our and you probably

316
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:43,339
should be ready all right

317
00:13:40,189 --> 00:13:45,740
another quote ready here we go

318
00:13:43,339 --> 00:13:48,829
you need to ensure that compliance is

319
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:53,860
not focused on the legal department but

320
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:53,859
throughout the company who said that I

321
00:13:54,730 --> 00:14:00,980
know these are all gonna be tough

322
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:02,779
isabell South Dakota and Isabelle is the

323
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:05,059
commissioner of the canal the French

324
00:14:02,779 --> 00:14:06,800
data protection regulator and I think

325
00:14:05,059 --> 00:14:10,790
she's saying something very important

326
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:15,439
she's saying that gdpr is not a policy

327
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:17,629
driven regulation gdpr is actually a new

328
00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:20,118
way of doing business that you have to

329
00:14:17,629 --> 00:14:21,619
drive it across the company so

330
00:14:20,119 --> 00:14:25,209
thoroughly why don't you help us out

331
00:14:21,619 --> 00:14:28,160
tell us what has been the most vexing

332
00:14:25,209 --> 00:14:31,969
implementation challenge for under GDP

333
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:33,889
our foray on sure I think I kind of

334
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:35,689
initially spoke a little bit about it

335
00:14:33,889 --> 00:14:39,079
which is understanding where your data

336
00:14:35,689 --> 00:14:41,599
is and really how much data do you

337
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:44,059
collect where is it being stored how is

338
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,829
it being used in an organization I think

339
00:14:44,059 --> 00:14:48,499
one of the things that we immediately

340
00:14:45,829 --> 00:14:50,449
see is that while you collect data at

341
00:14:48,499 --> 00:14:52,819
this point what happens behind the

342
00:14:50,449 --> 00:14:54,800
scenes is something that a lot of legal

343
00:14:52,819 --> 00:14:57,199
professionals have never really taken

344
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,929
into account before I think this is when

345
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:02,628
you see the relationship between InfoSec

346
00:14:59,929 --> 00:15:04,999
professionals you know coming true with

347
00:15:02,629 --> 00:15:07,370
the legal department but also with board

348
00:15:04,999 --> 00:15:09,259
level management because initially it

349
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:11,839
was well we don't really care where our

350
00:15:09,259 --> 00:15:14,959
data is as long as we have it and we do

351
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:17,149
whatever we want to maximize profits but

352
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:19,368
now I think with the GDP our it says you

353
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:22,040
have to know where your data is and that

354
00:15:19,369 --> 00:15:24,290
relates to the fact that one if anything

355
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:27,259
goes wrong ie a data breach that will be

356
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:30,259
a problem but two if an individual makes

357
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:33,110
a request either to delete their data or

358
00:15:30,259 --> 00:15:34,560
access the data 200 to have data

359
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:36,689
portability I eat

360
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:39,779
for it from one organization to another

361
00:15:36,689 --> 00:15:42,360
all of that comes down to knowing where

362
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:45,540
your data is and that for me is the

363
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:47,759
hardest part of compliance with the gdpr

364
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:50,040
but also the most important thing to get

365
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:51,779
right as well okay so that's a great one

366
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:54,748
one of the requirements or one of the

367
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:56,069
expectations of gdpr is that you know

368
00:15:54,749 --> 00:15:58,470
what data you have and you know how

369
00:15:56,069 --> 00:16:00,930
you're using it so data inventories data

370
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:04,290
flow Maps data audits those are

371
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:05,758
absolutely critical under gdpr and not

372
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:08,219
for one second should we think that

373
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:10,559
that's a small job because in most

374
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:12,990
complex organizations there are many

375
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:15,930
places in which data is coming in many

376
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:18,089
ways in which it's being used Alex what

377
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:20,550
was the most vexing most challenging

378
00:16:18,089 --> 00:16:24,029
implementation problem that you had at

379
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:26,189
Accenture actually the most challenging

380
00:16:24,029 --> 00:16:29,430
thing we have seen as definitely is that

381
00:16:26,189 --> 00:16:31,980
it's a new law at the time we were

382
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:34,519
looking into the law which we started as

383
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:37,559
a project very early so two years ago

384
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:39,990
there was nothing out there to give us

385
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:43,319
any guidance on it so we really had to

386
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:47,040
interpret the law in the way it would

387
00:16:43,319 --> 00:16:49,620
work for us actually that was initially

388
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:53,430
a huge challenge guidance came out

389
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:57,509
dropping in later right very late

390
00:16:53,430 --> 00:17:00,209
some of the point and so we leveraged

391
00:16:57,509 --> 00:17:02,430
that on the other side it also gives a

392
00:17:00,209 --> 00:17:03,569
bit of a reflection on what is required

393
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:06,030
under gdpr

394
00:17:03,569 --> 00:17:09,720
as part of the accountability you have

395
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:11,789
you are also required to interpret the

396
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:15,600
laws and rules how it would make sense

397
00:17:11,789 --> 00:17:17,908
for you as a company and at one point we

398
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:20,369
really then we're taking the step

399
00:17:17,909 --> 00:17:23,130
forward and saying like okay we need to

400
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:26,250
decide how we are interpreting it and

401
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:27,899
that's the way we are doing it we so

402
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:30,929
this is this is a really interesting

403
00:17:27,898 --> 00:17:34,469
point gdpr is a new regulation they just

404
00:17:30,929 --> 00:17:36,929
went to into effect on May 25th it was

405
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:40,350
passed introduced just two years ago and

406
00:17:36,929 --> 00:17:42,780
the regulators in Europe and the courts

407
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:44,219
have not had a chance to interpret it

408
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:46,860
and I think it's fair to say that

409
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:48,480
there's many provisions within gdpr

410
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:50,309
that are less than

411
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,790
clear there are many questions that

412
00:17:50,309 --> 00:17:56,190
remain unanswered how do you manage that

413
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:59,129
risk inside Accenture how do you make

414
00:17:56,190 --> 00:18:01,679
those decisions what what is that what

415
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:05,040
are the tools that you use to try to

416
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:08,309
answer some of those questions yeah we

417
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:10,710
actually implemented and enhanced a

418
00:18:08,309 --> 00:18:13,850
couple of tools for managing our data

419
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:17,190
privacy compliance and one of the major

420
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:18,928
actually not really changes but

421
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:20,850
improvements we did is that we

422
00:18:18,929 --> 00:18:24,750
implemented a lot of data privacy

423
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:27,480
controls we actually had a lot of

424
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:30,960
security controls beforehand but now we

425
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:33,660
leveraged the systems for the security

426
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:36,240
controls to enhance them with new

427
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:38,640
privacy controls which actually required

428
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:41,429
us to work closely obviously with our

429
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,770
security people and to understand where

430
00:18:41,429 --> 00:18:47,250
we have potentially overlaps but also

431
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:50,010
actually to implement those new tools on

432
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:53,250
the other side we implemented data

433
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:56,820
privacy impact assessment tools another

434
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:58,290
new tool and given the requirement of

435
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:01,590
the regulations that you need to

436
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:03,418
document what you are assessing we

437
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:06,689
really wanted to have it in a very

438
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:09,480
specific place and we wanted to use a

439
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:12,809
very specific tool for it and this

440
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:14,910
actually took a bit of Y to define what

441
00:19:12,809 --> 00:19:17,160
are the requirements of the tools and

442
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:20,160
which would be the right provider of the

443
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:23,460
tool could we do it ourself or not and

444
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:25,410
then we moved on the third to will be

445
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:28,470
implemented and one of the biggest tool

446
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:31,650
and actually also reflecting a bit that

447
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:34,860
gdpr can be also an enhancer was our

448
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:37,110
supplier tool so we have certain

449
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:41,520
supplier tools and applications for our

450
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:46,080
procurement team the global computer

451
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:49,770
procurement and but with now or supplier

452
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:51,990
requirements we do have for applying due

453
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:54,179
diligence on the suppliers really

454
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:57,000
understand and know which supplier is

455
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:57,270
touching which data if you want to say

456
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,140
so

457
00:19:57,270 --> 00:20:02,400
so that actually required us also also

458
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:05,070
taking into a

459
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:08,280
the size of the suppliers we have the

460
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:11,220
number that we implemented a new

461
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:12,690
supplier tool and also leverage said for

462
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:15,690
our supplier due diligence

463
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:17,010
excellent so so three really powerful

464
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:20,250
tools first you board from your

465
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:22,590
Information Security colleagues and use

466
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:25,110
their risk controls which is powerful

467
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:28,110
you implemented data protection impact

468
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:30,389
assessments a risk management tool where

469
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:32,310
you are assessing the data protection

470
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:34,350
consequences in new products new

471
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:36,870
features new ideas inside your

472
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:39,120
organization and third consistent with

473
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:41,219
what we were discussing with data

474
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:45,300
processor agreements you implemented a

475
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:48,540
supplier tool many are talking about GDP

476
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:50,760
are ushering in a new era of digital

477
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:53,159
supply chain management and it sounds

478
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:55,860
like that's very close to that Hillary

479
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:58,440
tell me about technological tools and

480
00:20:55,860 --> 00:21:01,590
how important they are in a GDP our

481
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:04,230
response organizations clearly are

482
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:06,360
investing in these tools we certainly

483
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:08,460
see many more vendors emerging in the

484
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:10,080
marketplace your company trust arc is

485
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:12,900
one of the leading players in the space

486
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:15,570
tell us about that part of the solution

487
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:17,520
yeah so one of the things that we're

488
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:18,810
seeing and it I'm going to go back to

489
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,210
the data that we talked about right at

490
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:24,149
the beginning of our session today is

491
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:27,030
that people are not fully ready to

492
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:29,550
comply and even those who have claimed

493
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:31,950
that they are compliant needs to manage

494
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:34,379
their ongoing obligations with respect

495
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:36,330
to GDP our and as my colleagues have

496
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:38,490
shared already it's important to

497
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:40,620
understand what's happening to your data

498
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:42,720
where it's flowing and how that changes

499
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:45,510
over time so what we're seeing in terms

500
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:48,350
of technology is a need and a growing

501
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:50,940
need for many organizations to

502
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:52,800
understand what's happening with their

503
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:55,770
data so they're employing more data

504
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:57,960
discovery tools for privacy purposes and

505
00:21:55,770 --> 00:22:00,090
really partnering with their information

506
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:01,410
security colleagues to make sure that

507
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:03,709
they're understanding what's happening

508
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:06,090
with the data more effectively

509
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:09,330
downstream from that we're seeing that

510
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:11,909
they are beginning to use data inventory

511
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:13,510
or data mapping tools and so by way of

512
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:14,560
contrast to

513
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:17,230
some of the tools that have been used

514
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:19,570
before to do an asset inventory the data

515
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:21,820
inventory tools for privacy purposes are

516
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:24,879
ones that are looking more into how

517
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:26,230
exactly are you using the data as my

518
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,660
colleagues have shared already it's

519
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:31,420
important in order to comply with gdpr

520
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:33,190
that you know what is the data being

521
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:35,500
used for it's a concept called

522
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:38,320
processing purposes and so we have these

523
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:40,450
data inventory tools that are helping to

524
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,850
understand what are the processing

525
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:45,990
purposes and help to better understand

526
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:49,870
as the data are flowing throughout the

527
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:51,520
actual data flow from a organization

528
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:54,030
from an individual from whom they're

529
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:56,440
collected to an organization to a

530
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:59,500
processor to another supplier to a

531
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:01,750
hosting provider to recipients exactly

532
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:03,880
what is happening with that data as it's

533
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:06,370
traveling around the world from there

534
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:09,130
we're also seeing that organizations as

535
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:11,409
Alex was saying are needing to assess

536
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:13,360
and they're needing to assess various

537
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:15,730
different things very similar to what

538
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,590
happens with data assessments from a

539
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:20,230
security perspective so assessing

540
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:22,300
suppliers but not just for security

541
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:25,870
controls but also for privacy related

542
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:27,280
controls as Alex was sharing lastly I'll

543
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:30,600
say in terms of the things we're seeing

544
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:34,570
the greatest uptake in our tools around

545
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:37,689
understanding risk and I say I share

546
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:39,820
that at the outset because security risk

547
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:43,090
I think there's been a lot of work done

548
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:44,919
to understand and define what security

549
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:46,810
risk management or information risk

550
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:49,150
management looks like to address

551
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:51,639
information security obligations within

552
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:53,590
organizations what we see under GDP are

553
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,940
that's particularly troubling given that

554
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:57,820
there's not a ton of guidance out there

555
00:23:54,940 --> 00:24:01,260
yet is that there's an obligation for

556
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:04,360
organizations to understand and protect

557
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:07,690
something called the risks to the rights

558
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:10,330
and freedoms of individuals that's not

559
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:13,420
an objective thing that is a very

560
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:16,270
subjective determination and so what the

561
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:19,720
tools are beginning to do is to help

562
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:22,480
organizations define objectively what

563
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:25,120
does that risk actually look like what

564
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,530
kind of data may be sensitive that may

565
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:29,260
be causing some harm

566
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:32,470
two individuals what kind of processing

567
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:34,720
involves monitoring or surveillance for

568
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:36,910
an example as something that's perceived

569
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,560
by the regulator's to be higher risk and

570
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:40,030
I could list a number of other things

571
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:42,070
but those are the main tools that we're

572
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:44,850
beginning to see as part of the research

573
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:49,300
that we've done together with the ia pp

574
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:52,780
fantastic so we've kind of covered the

575
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:56,409
operational response to GD P R and as we

576
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:59,590
go through the list the inventory of new

577
00:24:56,410 --> 00:25:01,360
tools new ideas new processes that have

578
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:03,610
emerged inside organizations to comply

579
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:07,090
with GD P R I'm struck by one thing

580
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:08,740
we've talked about data inventory we've

581
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:11,020
talked about data flow mapping we've

582
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:13,570
talked about strong vendor and supplier

583
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:17,170
and partner controls we've talked about

584
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:19,810
data data protection impact assessments

585
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:23,110
we didn't mention data subject access

586
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:25,659
requests which is another major tool or

587
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:28,000
another requirement under GD P R what

588
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:30,190
I'm struck by is how much these look

589
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,160
like presents to the information

590
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:36,070
security field you know these are good

591
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:38,680
data management tools and I think any

592
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:40,960
information security Pro should be

593
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:42,760
delighted to see investment and

594
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:45,400
resources coming in to these types of

595
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:47,830
tools in many ways all the people in

596
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:49,690
this audience should go back and buy a

597
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:52,419
drink or give a present to their chief

598
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:53,860
privacy officer or their data protection

599
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:55,840
officer back in their home office

600
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:59,709
because I think there really is some

601
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:03,220
synergy here all right let's move on and

602
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:04,930
talk about the global perspective and

603
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:07,990
originally I'm hoping that you can give

604
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:10,210
us a sense what has the response been in

605
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:13,380
the Asian marketplace you're responsible

606
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:15,850
for asia-pacific for a on what type of

607
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:19,240
engagement what type of receptiveness

608
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:23,320
have you seen market to market across

609
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:25,480
the asia-pacific region and and where do

610
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:27,909
you see that going sure so I think

611
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:29,440
there's a couple of like there are very

612
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:31,600
different countries and how they look at

613
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:34,480
privacy and data protection within the

614
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:36,760
region I guess the big one would be

615
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,900
Japan that very recently that you use it

616
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:41,990
will look at giving them an adequacy

617
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:44,180
status so an adequacy status means that

618
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:46,160
particular country has the same amount

619
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:48,260
of protection or the same level of

620
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:51,440
protection for individual data as it

621
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:55,040
would be in the EU but recent statistics

622
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:57,440
so ey conducted a survey that only a

623
00:26:55,040 --> 00:27:00,320
quarter of Japanese companies surveyed

624
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:03,710
said they had made progress 20 percent

625
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:05,419
plan to do so I don't think planning to

626
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:07,180
do something would fly with a regulator

627
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:10,340
very much

628
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:13,100
26% updated their privacy statements

629
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:14,270
online again while that's a publicly

630
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,830
facing thing and you think you're

631
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:17,570
covering that risks are so much more to

632
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:20,179
be done but what I find really

633
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:23,810
interesting in this survey is that only

634
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:27,110
7% of organizations are prepared for the

635
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:30,649
72-hour breach notification requirement

636
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:32,449
and that is honestly a big key piece

637
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:34,520
when you talk about risk and exposure

638
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:37,220
when it comes to a data breach you need

639
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:39,080
to inform a regulator within 72 hours

640
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:41,780
and if you're not prepared for that

641
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:44,120
you're looking at very large numbers of

642
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:47,210
fines but which I understand ever will

643
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:49,459
go to later and in other markets in Asia

644
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:51,560
I think when you look at the companies

645
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:54,830
that are operating on global level the

646
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:56,690
level of awareness is there and in fact

647
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:58,790
it's almost taken precedent over the

648
00:27:56,690 --> 00:28:01,340
local laws and regulations that exist

649
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:03,260
for data privacy such as the PDPA I've

650
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:07,040
seen that happen in some organizations

651
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:09,350
where with contracts they say EU law the

652
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:11,420
GDP are but not necessarily the law that

653
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:14,719
of the lands that's an interesting

654
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:17,120
development and in some countries as

655
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,860
well you see the fact that GDP are is

656
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:21,229
there it's bringing attention to local

657
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:24,050
legislation that there is an existence

658
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:26,240
almost side by side of local privacy

659
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:28,280
legislation and data protection laws and

660
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,410
the GDP are there's a lot of positivity

661
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:33,980
there but still a lack of I think

662
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:36,230
knowledge and also attention to the

663
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:39,320
details that are involved in the GDP are

664
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:40,910
because it's a large document I think we

665
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:43,100
might have all read it but not a lot of

666
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:44,450
people would go to that level and I

667
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:46,040
think that's really where the

668
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:48,920
regulator's need to come interesting

669
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:52,340
evidence it sounds like there's a lot of

670
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:53,960
work still to be done and Alex I

671
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:56,059
I'm going to ask you a rhetorical

672
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:58,220
question so it sounds like along with

673
00:28:56,059 --> 00:28:59,779
French wine and German automobiles the

674
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:03,950
gdpr might be one of the greatest

675
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:06,799
exports ever from Europe is that fair

676
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:08,510
alright let's turn now to enforcement so

677
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:11,360
I'm going to read a couple of quotes for

678
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:14,629
you here the first is the aim of our

679
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:16,729
office is to prevent harm but we will

680
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:21,830
back that up with tough action where

681
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:24,230
necessary any guesses I see well done

682
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:27,439
our first correct answer well done well

683
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:30,289
done Alex that is Liz Denham the

684
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:33,409
Information Commissioner from the UK now

685
00:29:30,289 --> 00:29:35,658
notably Liz Denham just brought an

686
00:29:33,409 --> 00:29:38,659
enforcement action and issued a fine

687
00:29:35,659 --> 00:29:42,730
proposed a fine against Facebook for the

688
00:29:38,659 --> 00:29:46,039
Cambridge analytic issue and that was

689
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:49,010
500,000 pounds but that was a fine

690
00:29:46,039 --> 00:29:51,950
brought under the prior regime which was

691
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:55,240
the Data Protection Directive and that

692
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:59,659
was the maximum fine under GDP our

693
00:29:55,240 --> 00:30:02,120
maximum fines go up to 4% of global

694
00:29:59,659 --> 00:30:05,809
turnover which is to say 4% of global

695
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:09,439
revenue for an organisation had the fine

696
00:30:05,809 --> 00:30:12,350
been the maximum fine under GDP are in

697
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:14,289
this Facebook example it theoretically

698
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:18,740
could have been many billions of dollars

699
00:30:14,289 --> 00:30:21,919
which is really quite striking let me

700
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:26,419
offer another quote there will be fines

701
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:29,960
and they will be significant any guesses

702
00:30:26,419 --> 00:30:32,809
that was Helen Dixon the Irish Data

703
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:36,409
Protection Commissioner and notably

704
00:30:32,809 --> 00:30:38,750
Helen Dixon oversees Ireland the

705
00:30:36,409 --> 00:30:40,789
jurisdiction where many of the major

706
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:42,289
tech players have their European

707
00:30:40,789 --> 00:30:45,610
headquarters so she will be the

708
00:30:42,289 --> 00:30:49,700
regulator of record so let's talk about

709
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:51,649
fines is GDP are really all about the

710
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:54,500
fines is that the thing that we should

711
00:30:51,649 --> 00:30:56,539
be responding to the most that this is a

712
00:30:54,500 --> 00:31:00,260
risk management response that we're

713
00:30:56,539 --> 00:31:02,929
trying to avoid fines and so the the big

714
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:05,030
stick of 4% of global turnover

715
00:31:02,929 --> 00:31:06,110
that's what CEOs and boards of directors

716
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:08,420
are mostly

717
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:11,240
going to pay attention to and that's why

718
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:15,860
we should comply with GDP our Alex is

719
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:18,740
that the right answer I don't think so

720
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:22,040
however the 4% definitely helps in

721
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:26,480
getting the attention and awareness of

722
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:29,659
your CEO and to honestly also open the

723
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:33,049
kind of pockets for bigger budgets and

724
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:35,210
for more resources at least it

725
00:31:33,049 --> 00:31:39,679
definitely had awareness within our

726
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:42,590
company and on the other side I have to

727
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:45,830
say just looking at the fines it will

728
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:51,168
not ever help you because GD P R is much

729
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:55,309
more about how you are able as a company

730
00:31:51,169 --> 00:31:58,100
to handle personal data in an in a

731
00:31:55,309 --> 00:32:02,660
responsible way and I think especially

732
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:06,799
in the area we are working in and this

733
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:09,650
is digital it is hugely important for us

734
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:12,860
to do it in a very responsible way and

735
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:15,740
also be trusted by our clients but as

736
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:18,530
well by our employees that we handles

737
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:20,780
the data in the way we not only should

738
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:23,809
do but it's also the right thing to do

739
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:26,720
and therefore GD P are obviously for the

740
00:32:23,809 --> 00:32:28,520
privacy team was a big advantage because

741
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:32,450
now we had the money and the resources

742
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:34,760
to more invest actually we didn't get

743
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:38,200
all of what we would have asked for but

744
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:40,879
at least it happed a bit but yeah the

745
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:44,120
intention really needs to go much beyond

746
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:47,270
the 4% as as a stick here

747
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:49,309
so the 4% fines will capture one's

748
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:52,700
attention they will open the door to a

749
00:32:49,309 --> 00:32:55,879
conversation and perhaps allow some

750
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:57,679
resources to be loosened up and created

751
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:59,780
within the organisation but they're not

752
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:02,630
the end of the story Hilary you spend a

753
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:04,639
lot of time in Europe what do you think

754
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:06,980
we should be expecting from the

755
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:09,110
regulator's with regards to enforcement

756
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:11,179
so Helen Dickson said well there will be

757
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:13,879
fines and they will be significant

758
00:33:11,179 --> 00:33:16,580
Liz Denham said the aim of her office is

759
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:19,100
to prevent harm but they'll back that up

760
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:19,669
with tough action so the regulators are

761
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:21,560
putting

762
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:23,750
or word some language that suggests that

763
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:25,730
they're going to use fines so I think we

764
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:27,800
should expect enforcement what do you

765
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:29,120
think that's gonna look like well I

766
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:31,580
think first it's going to look like

767
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:33,350
regulator's responding to the complaints

768
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:36,110
that they are already receiving from

769
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:38,689
data subjects or individuals about whom

770
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:40,490
the data are processed we know from what

771
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:42,350
they've shared that they are getting

772
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:44,540
many more complaints than they have

773
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:46,520
received historically in fact many of

774
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:47,690
them have fast in the thousands of

775
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:49,850
complaints that they're dealing with

776
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:52,130
right now um what do I think it will

777
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:54,919
look like as a result I think that it

778
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:58,010
will force organizations to be able to

779
00:33:54,920 --> 00:34:00,800
show how they have put in place measures

780
00:33:58,010 --> 00:34:02,510
to comply with these various different

781
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:04,580
operational requirements that we've been

782
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:06,710
discussing on the panel today how you

783
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:08,960
can show that you actually have

784
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:10,940
maintained a record of what your data

785
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:13,580
processing look like how you've done

786
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:15,380
your assessments how you've managed you

787
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:17,360
know incident management processes

788
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:19,400
within your organization to actually

789
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:21,740
show that you're prepared to respond

790
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:23,330
timely and to report to them if you've

791
00:34:21,739 --> 00:34:25,428
had a breach they'll be looking to see

792
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:27,139
whether or not you've managed any

793
00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:29,360
breaches that have happened in

794
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:31,190
accordance with their expectations one

795
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:33,919
of which is as we were talking about

796
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:36,168
risk earlier to actually evaluate what

797
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:37,909
your risk is associated with that breach

798
00:34:36,168 --> 00:34:40,429
consistent with the expectations under

799
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:42,830
gdpr so I think early on they're going

800
00:34:40,429 --> 00:34:45,500
to be looking for demonstration of

801
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:47,750
preparedness that you haven't as three

802
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:49,909
sneh said ignored completely or done

803
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:52,719
nothing yet but that you've put these

804
00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:54,649
requirements into place within your

805
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:57,139
organization that you're prepared to

806
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:59,330
respond I think ultimately though they

807
00:34:57,139 --> 00:35:01,009
will be looking to see how well you've

808
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:02,540
managed the risk associated with that

809
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:05,180
data and if you've not taken that

810
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:07,910
seriously that you will not have any

811
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:09,740
mitigating measures when it comes to

812
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:12,770
these defines that they have the ability

813
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:14,660
now to to put in place I think that's

814
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:16,730
really well said and and let me just

815
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:17,930
capture that point for this audience one

816
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:19,640
of the things that we have heard

817
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:21,710
consistently from regulators with

818
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:23,870
regards to these fines is that good

819
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:26,210
faith will go a long way and that means

820
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:28,880
if you show the good faith in assessing

821
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:31,250
the risk in interpreting the GDP are to

822
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,780
the best of your abilities and you do

823
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:34,760
the hard work

824
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:37,010
that that will be a significant

825
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:39,320
mitigating factor in any enforcement

826
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:42,050
action that a regulator may bring or any

827
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:43,820
complaint that may come towards you but

828
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:46,790
doing that hard work I think is pretty

829
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:51,460
critical there is need tell me about

830
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:54,230
that hard work at a on tell me about how

831
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:58,490
how you have implemented resources

832
00:35:54,230 --> 00:36:00,710
across a on and and where you see the

833
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:03,319
greatest work in the in the weeks and

834
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:06,080
months ahead sure one thing to mention

835
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:08,480
is with an a on the GD P our compliance

836
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:11,299
program is actually sponsored not by the

837
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:14,300
privacy team but by the global security

838
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:16,520
services so that so this event all the

839
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:18,110
way up to there are seaso and there are

840
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:20,630
the sponsors of the program

841
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:23,510
understanding that a huge part of GDP

842
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:25,910
are compliance rests within security and

843
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:28,070
our information security professionals

844
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:30,920
because they ultimately understand how

845
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:33,020
the business works and if you know what

846
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:35,270
we can advise on the legal perspectives

847
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:37,520
but from an operational practical

848
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:39,440
perspective it is the security

849
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:41,600
professionals to understand how to

850
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:43,910
actually operationalize that so the

851
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:46,520
cooperation between the privacy team and

852
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:48,440
the global security services at a on has

853
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:50,990
been honestly one of the most helpful

854
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:53,570
ways that this program has moved forward

855
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:56,060
and so in terms of the next few months

856
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:58,430
we're looking at also we've also called

857
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:59,920
it phase two there's a lot of the stuff

858
00:36:58,430 --> 00:37:03,200
in phase one was just around

859
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:05,860
notifications consents contracts now is

860
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:09,169
actually how do we deal with a major

861
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:11,540
attack or a major incident that happens

862
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:13,880
within your our organization with data

863
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:16,490
flowing from various different countries

864
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:19,520
and continents how do we then address a

865
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:21,950
particular incident within 72 hours and

866
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:24,110
the hard work is not just with the core

867
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:26,000
team that's working on it so we we are

868
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:29,000
planning on having sort able top

869
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,620
exercises we've you know we've had sort

870
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,930
of fake phishing attacks that were

871
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:35,359
engineered by our guys you know and

872
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:37,160
seeing really it's not about whether

873
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:39,490
people fall for it but where the

874
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:42,020
percentages of people falling for that

875
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:44,720
did they actually report the fact that

876
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:46,030
they were fish to the correct entity

877
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,589
within a on for eggs

878
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:49,780
while these are the hard work we need to

879
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:52,690
do because if the numbers are not great

880
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:53,830
we need to get it to great every

881
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:56,740
employee needs to know their

882
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:59,020
responsibility to respond to an incident

883
00:37:56,740 --> 00:38:01,209
really quickly because this 72 hours

884
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:03,940
passed by very very quickly and in

885
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:06,910
contracts itself if we are a vendor it's

886
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:10,170
not only 72 hours the data user will say

887
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:13,240
come back to me in 24 hours upon

888
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:14,890
discovery and as a vendor of a lot of

889
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:16,930
major organizations this is something

890
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:18,700
that is a responsibility for every

891
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:21,640
single employee and that's really the

892
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:24,160
hard work yeah Wow all right we're

893
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:27,040
heading towards the end of our time and

894
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:29,230
I want to talk about the future and

895
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:32,020
future risk and future complexity

896
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:34,240
because the data protection world does

897
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:36,850
not live in stasis it actually moves

898
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:39,759
quite quickly there's a number of things

899
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:43,390
emerging on the horizon that could add

900
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:46,570
even more complexity to what we already

901
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:48,250
experienced in our world so Alex why

902
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:51,160
don't we start with you I'd like to go

903
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:54,190
down the panel and just tell me what you

904
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:57,430
are thinking about now and preparing for

905
00:38:54,190 --> 00:39:00,610
or worried about that might be coming up

906
00:38:57,430 --> 00:39:05,109
in the next year or two years yeah I

907
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:09,310
think GDP is a good good baseline as we

908
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:11,260
put it but as we are a digital company

909
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:14,920
we are looking very much in new

910
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:18,880
technologies it's um it's providing

911
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:20,920
actually also some no answers I should

912
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:23,260
say to some of the challenges the new

913
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:26,560
technologies are bringing with them so

914
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:30,760
like IOT how how we are dealing with

915
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:34,270
that are we thinking about machine

916
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:36,400
learning blockchain these are answers we

917
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:38,950
are looking into obviously we now need

918
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:42,040
to look into it from a gdpr perspective

919
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:45,100
but we also want to find answers to it

920
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:47,080
from from our perspective how we are

921
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:52,180
interpreting it and how we are giving it

922
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:54,940
and yeah maybe not only one one legal

923
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:58,660
framework answer here but really an

924
00:39:54,940 --> 00:40:01,300
ethical answer to how we manage personal

925
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:02,920
data with those new technologies so one

926
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:05,710
of your concerns would be sort of like

927
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:07,780
the 1995 directive could not contemplate

928
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:08,920
smartphones and the internet and social

929
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:11,620
media gdpr

930
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:14,050
may not be fully formed to contemplate

931
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:16,390
IOT and facial recognition and AI and

932
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:19,330
other things great there is new I think

933
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:21,730
working in an insurance company really

934
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:24,910
is to my benefit because so if you can

935
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:26,470
ensure risk they'll find it yeah yeah so

936
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:27,790
that's been pretty cool and so I think

937
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:30,970
one of the things you were talking about

938
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:32,680
new technologies and whether the privacy

939
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:35,040
laws really do help with that because

940
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:38,259
under GDP are one of the concerns is

941
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:41,440
monitoring behavior of individuals at

942
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:43,150
what point does this law start and stop

943
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,460
when it comes to innovation I think

944
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:46,870
that's really been a big I think that's

945
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:49,300
a big future challenge for any

946
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:51,790
organization you want to use data to

947
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:54,160
innovate can the privacy laws keep up

948
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:55,870
can we ensure that these privacy rules

949
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:58,810
are evergreen as well that these are the

950
00:40:55,870 --> 00:41:01,390
principles that we can rely on to ensure

951
00:40:58,810 --> 00:41:03,310
that innovation is there but also

952
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:05,259
individual rights because people tend to

953
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:07,240
forget about the people behind the

954
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:09,640
scenes so when a reasons I like privacy

955
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:14,109
laws it is focus on preserving

956
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:15,879
individual rights fantastic Hillary the

957
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:17,860
thing I'm most worried about actually is

958
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:21,070
when we haven't spend time talking about

959
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:23,620
and that is the restriction under GDP

960
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:25,750
are on cross-border data flow and the

961
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:27,520
limited mechanisms that exist right now

962
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:30,010
to actually make that happen

963
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:32,740
many of which actually are under threat

964
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:35,020
as potentially not being vehicles that

965
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:37,000
can be used in the future so currently

966
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:39,910
there are means by which people move

967
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,620
data lawfully using contracts the

968
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:43,990
standard contracts that have been

969
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:47,170
approved by the European Commission are

970
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:48,939
actually currently being challenged as

971
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:51,250
to their validity and so there may not

972
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:54,340
be a standard anymore in the absence of

973
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:56,560
a standard one individual company needs

974
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:58,900
to go to a regulator and get approval

975
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:00,759
for each form of agreement that they

976
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:03,790
need imagine how much that will slow

977
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:06,660
data flows so I worry about whether

978
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:09,850
there will be vehicles such as gdpr

979
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:13,180
certification or codes of con

980
00:42:09,850 --> 00:42:15,460
or other forms of framework mechanisms

981
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:17,560
that will allow data to flow around the

982
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:19,960
globe the way it needs to in order to

983
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:22,080
drive the digital economy I think that's

984
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:26,620
a great one and I'll add to that mix

985
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:28,870
brexit so Hillary's absolutely right to

986
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:31,779
raise the issue of data transfers under

987
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:33,460
GDP are you cannot transfer data outside

988
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:35,440
of the European Union unless you have a

989
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:37,720
mechanism for transferring data outside

990
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:39,070
of the European Union those data

991
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:42,490
transfers are going to get much more

992
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:46,330
complex after brexit okay we are in the

993
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:48,430
speed round of our panel we have an

994
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:50,529
audience of incredibly engaged

995
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:53,799
information security professionals here

996
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:56,050
with us from your perspective as a data

997
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:58,480
protection expert what is the most

998
00:42:56,050 --> 00:43:00,490
important thing that these information

999
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:05,890
security professionals should take back

1000
00:43:00,490 --> 00:43:09,220
to their office Alex yes actually data

1001
00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:11,980
privacy is going hand-in-hand with

1002
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:14,200
information security we actually did

1003
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:17,080
something very similar what happened at

1004
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:21,549
Erin we partnered with our information

1005
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:25,509
security team and built our enhanced

1006
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:27,640
data privacy program in or within the

1007
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:29,980
framework of information security

1008
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:31,810
we now have implemented a team of

1009
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:35,440
fifteen data privacy and information

1010
00:43:31,810 --> 00:43:38,350
security leads that's actually how they

1011
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:40,990
are called and you see from the title or

1012
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:43,180
name that they are not only doing data

1013
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:46,089
privacy but also information security

1014
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:49,540
because we are big believing that you

1015
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:54,100
can't actually detangle that without a

1016
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:58,120
good course so there is this idea that

1017
00:43:54,100 --> 00:44:00,430
whenever you have data personal data you

1018
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:02,970
need to have security around sirs and

1019
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:06,370
security is the dependency on how

1020
00:44:02,970 --> 00:44:10,230
privacy programs run so coming together

1021
00:44:06,370 --> 00:44:13,450
or getting together both angles and

1022
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:16,900
actually hugely helpful and therefore I

1023
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:19,120
think all security people should have

1024
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:22,480
regular conversation with the privacy

1025
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:23,230
people as a company Therese knee I would

1026
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:25,780
just add on

1027
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:29,109
that to say it's about speaking a common

1028
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:31,119
language I think in the past you know

1029
00:44:29,109 --> 00:44:32,560
the legal department and security and

1030
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:35,859
technology didn't speak a common

1031
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:37,750
language and the GDP art allows for that

1032
00:44:35,859 --> 00:44:40,390
kind of conversation to happen a

1033
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:42,340
security professional should know some

1034
00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:44,589
of the intricacies of gdpr and how it

1035
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:46,990
affects their job and so with does a

1036
00:44:44,590 --> 00:44:48,390
legal department I think couple days ago

1037
00:44:46,990 --> 00:44:50,740
I spoke about the legal department

1038
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:52,569
understanding terms in cyber security

1039
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:54,759
and cyber attacks the different types of

1040
00:44:52,570 --> 00:44:56,140
cyber attacks that exist and so coming

1041
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:58,330
together and speaking the same language

1042
00:44:56,140 --> 00:45:01,060
it's hopefully the take away from the

1043
00:44:58,330 --> 00:45:03,069
GDP are excellent Hillary and I will

1044
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:05,410
just echo what they're saying through

1045
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:08,920
the words integrated data governance and

1046
00:45:05,410 --> 00:45:10,868
risk management's excellent I will add

1047
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:13,060
my point that I think this group should

1048
00:45:10,869 --> 00:45:14,410
take away and that is that the privacy

1049
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:16,869
professionals the data protection

1050
00:45:14,410 --> 00:45:19,629
professionals in your organization are

1051
00:45:16,869 --> 00:45:22,420
your colleagues in arms they are your

1052
00:45:19,630 --> 00:45:25,359
partners in managing this incredibly

1053
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:26,650
complex digital economy I'll tell you

1054
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:29,859
one of the things that gives me great

1055
00:45:26,650 --> 00:45:32,530
hope for our future in data protection

1056
00:45:29,859 --> 00:45:35,319
in the digital economy is the strength

1057
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:37,150
and wisdom of leaders like this so I

1058
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:41,740
hope you'll join me in thanking our

1059
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:43,890
panelists for a great conversation thank

1060
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:43,890
you
