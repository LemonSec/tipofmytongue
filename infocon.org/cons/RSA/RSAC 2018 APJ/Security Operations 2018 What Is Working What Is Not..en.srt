1
00:00:11,059 --> 00:00:18,169
thank you guys for coming my role

2
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:20,480
previously previous jobs of the last 15

3
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:23,720
years was to go into security operations

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:27,349
centers evaluate their maturity evaluate

5
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:28,640
their effectiveness see what they're

6
00:00:27,349 --> 00:00:30,290
doing right what they're doing wrong and

7
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,939
what I've done is taken that history

8
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:34,969
into my current role at Palo Alto

9
00:00:31,939 --> 00:00:37,399
Networks to kind of evaluate here's what

10
00:00:34,969 --> 00:00:39,230
we need to be doing so that's what we're

11
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:41,329
doing it at Palo Alto is trying to

12
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:42,709
figure out what we should be doing next

13
00:00:41,329 --> 00:00:45,079
and what I'm going to show with you

14
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:48,339
share with you today is my experience of

15
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:51,019
large companies small companies

16
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:52,339
companies that are new to sock companies

17
00:00:51,019 --> 00:00:54,199
they've been doing it for 15 years

18
00:00:52,339 --> 00:00:58,159
things that are working in things that

19
00:00:54,199 --> 00:01:00,498
definitely aren't and not here to poopoo

20
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:01,399
on anybody's sock telling them that

21
00:01:00,499 --> 00:01:02,839
they're doing it wrong

22
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:04,190
but what I want to do is tell you about

23
00:01:02,839 --> 00:01:06,530
things that people are doing right so

24
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:10,158
that we can all kind of elevate our

25
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:14,600
effectiveness together so let me find my

26
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:15,290
clicker so like I said I've been in a

27
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,270
bunch of socks

28
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:20,810
the first sock I ever walked into my

29
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:21,740
life it was it had a man trap so don't

30
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:23,000
know if you know what those are but she

31
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,949
walk into the door and you step on the

32
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,119
scale and you shut the door behind you

33
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:27,170
and then it weighs you and make sure

34
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:28,820
that she weighed the right amount and

35
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,960
then you're allowed in or not and I

36
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:32,990
thought that was the coolest thing ever

37
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:35,119
I thought this place is made of magic i

38
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:36,890
sat down and they had you know all the

39
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:39,649
big screens on the side and I thought

40
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:40,820
this place is amazing and then you start

41
00:01:39,649 --> 00:01:42,170
to get into and you're like okay this is

42
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:45,529
actually harder than it looks they don't

43
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:47,240
have it all figured out since then I've

44
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:49,640
been in socks where you know there's the

45
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,170
fancy snap glass and I'm here to tell

46
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,840
you that if they have that snap glass

47
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:55,130
where it's if you can't see through and

48
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,500
then they turn on a switch and you can

49
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:59,179
see through it from the EBC those

50
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,979
actually don't tell you that they're a

51
00:01:59,179 --> 00:02:04,909
better or worse sock they just are

52
00:02:00,979 --> 00:02:07,039
expensive some other things I've been in

53
00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:09,350
socks where it's just an open cube area

54
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:11,720
I've had I've seen socks where it's the

55
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:12,650
network operation center people sitting

56
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:16,040
right next to the Security Operations

57
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:18,110
Center people do not do that please we

58
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:21,140
always want to separate the Watchers

59
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:22,190
from the doers and even though we're

60
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,569
moving towards where we want these

61
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:24,870
people to integrate and we want their

62
00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:26,940
processes to work together we

63
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:29,310
want them to be hand-in-hand we do not

64
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:32,220
want them sitting next to each other and

65
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:34,650
influencing directly what each other are

66
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:36,239
doing so just to just the hint there

67
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:40,620
keep your knock in your sock separate

68
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:42,180
but talking a lot I've also seen where

69
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:44,370
you know there was a closed-in room

70
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,989
where people walked into the room and

71
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:48,030
sat down for 15 minutes in the morning

72
00:02:45,989 --> 00:02:50,489
and checked their console and walked out

73
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:52,110
and that was their sock so there's a

74
00:02:50,489 --> 00:02:54,239
bunch of different types of socks I'm

75
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:57,450
sure every different kind is represented

76
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,379
here from very large to very small but

77
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:01,319
that's kind of what we're working with

78
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:05,040
these days and we all need to be getting

79
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:06,708
better at it so how did we get here

80
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,440
I mean socks kind of came around

81
00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:11,760
officially in about the 70s and at that

82
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,200
point I was really governments

83
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,069
governments were the only people that

84
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:20,819
needed a sock because who would attack

85
00:03:16,069 --> 00:03:23,369
just a citizen so that's where you know

86
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:25,858
in the 70s by the way I got this off of

87
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:28,889
an HP paper but in the 70s it was kind

88
00:03:25,859 --> 00:03:31,500
of governments and it was about kind of

89
00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:32,910
like those nuisance attacks but then we

90
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:36,959
moved into kind of the second generation

91
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:39,239
of sock and it became really those

92
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,829
nuisances so nuisances for businesses I

93
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:42,180
started becoming a bigger problem but

94
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:45,150
still the only people that had socks

95
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:50,269
were those super fortune 100 type

96
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:52,980
companies if if even then then stage 3

97
00:03:50,269 --> 00:03:55,169
that's when we started you know living

98
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:57,530
ecommerce everybody was on the Internet

99
00:03:55,169 --> 00:03:59,430
and so you know cyber crime started

100
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:01,799
people start to figure out they can make

101
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:04,769
money from it and so what happens is the

102
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:05,940
sock has to evolve to be able to account

103
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:07,650
for that so that's when we're seeing

104
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:09,660
stage 3 is where we're seeing a ton of

105
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:12,989
financial groups really elevating their

106
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:17,130
security operation centers and then for

107
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:21,030
for is 2007 to 2012 and that's when

108
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:23,400
we're starting to see cyber warfare you

109
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:25,500
know Stuxnet existed before them but

110
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,479
that's when it was actually found so

111
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,150
that evolves how your how your sock is

112
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:31,289
actually working you no longer just

113
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:33,960
intrusion detection you're actually

114
00:04:31,289 --> 00:04:35,400
doing intrusion prevention hopefully but

115
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,530
you know that the tools are increasingly

116
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,549
a number of tools that you have keep

117
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:40,979
going up

118
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:44,130
so that's stage four or the fourth

119
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:47,130
generation of socks then this little

120
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:48,570
thing happened the target breach so

121
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:50,760
there's everything before target and

122
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:52,740
there's everything after target and the

123
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:56,120
reason is is because target was the

124
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:58,200
first time an executive got fired so

125
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,850
completely change the game of the sake

126
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:02,190
now you say well I worked in a sock it

127
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:04,500
really didn't change that much it did

128
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:06,840
because it was the executive started to

129
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:08,100
see they're responsible for these

130
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,659
breaches they're getting more involved

131
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,430
so you might have seen more money come

132
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:13,410
into a sock you might have just seen

133
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:14,880
more pressure and more oversight come

134
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:17,220
into a sock but that's the difference

135
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:20,610
between four and five and I think today

136
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:22,890
we're still in this Stage five I think

137
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:25,770
some organizations are starting to get

138
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:27,630
to a next generation but right now Stage

139
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:31,049
five so you know we're trying to use

140
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:32,340
analytics we're using hunt we we're kind

141
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:33,300
of using hunt I'll talk about that in a

142
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:35,789
minute

143
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:37,350
you know we're started to really get

144
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:41,130
into the automation really build it into

145
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:42,810
our organizations kind of some people

146
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:45,180
doing better than others but we'll we'll

147
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:49,110
get into that so that's the layout of

148
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:50,370
how we got to where we are so I'm gonna

149
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:52,470
go through a couple things that I found

150
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:54,690
number one well number one was the snap

151
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:57,600
glass thing and I told you about but

152
00:05:54,690 --> 00:06:00,540
this one number one naming makes no

153
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,740
difference so everybody's trying to come

154
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:03,860
up with different name security

155
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:06,150
operation centers of course the normal

156
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:08,310
cyber defence centre is kind of a close

157
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:11,159
second people are coming up with

158
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:13,830
Security Intelligence and operation

159
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,240
centers if you put the vet defence

160
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:17,490
center in there does it make it sound

161
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,140
more interesting if you put intelligence

162
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:22,650
in there does it make it make you sound

163
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:24,900
more smart you can call it whatever you

164
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:26,159
want fusion center I like fusion center

165
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:29,039
because it's kind of the holistic the

166
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:31,770
business is coming together and it makes

167
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:37,290
no effect no effect on the effectiveness

168
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:38,729
of your sock so does anybody not called

169
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:41,190
a sock here do you call it one of these

170
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:46,170
other names hands nobody's gonna admit

171
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:49,410
it okay fine I do get asked about sock

172
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:51,520
2.0 what if I call it sock I have a sock

173
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:55,300
2.0 okay

174
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:57,299
Sauk 2.0 is misused everywhere we use it

175
00:06:55,300 --> 00:07:01,150
in marketing we use it everywhere

176
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:02,800
originally Sauk 2.0 was defined by

177
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:05,799
Forrester and it's basically a

178
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:08,560
virtualized Sauk so the idea is that you

179
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:10,479
can automate the first line analyst so

180
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:14,190
the only thing left for a sock to do is

181
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:16,690
that advanced analytics that advanced

182
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:19,889
investigation of the incidents and the

183
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:22,780
theory is that those are specialized

184
00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:24,720
feature specialized tool sets that a

185
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:27,039
person has and they can do that remotely

186
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:30,340
so you don't actually have a physical

187
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:31,810
sock you have experts based around the

188
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:34,719
world that are pulled in to do what they

189
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:36,820
need to do that's Sauk 2.0 I've never

190
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:40,090
seen anybody do it so while it's great

191
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:47,080
Theory nobody is doing sock 2.0 so don't

192
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:49,568
buy into that so that's the naming call

193
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:51,909
it a sock that's fine number two the

194
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:54,520
mission matters so when the biggest

195
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:57,039
things I see for socks that fail is that

196
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:58,090
they're trying to take on too much or

197
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:01,900
they don't even know what they're

198
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:05,580
supposed to be doing so when I define a

199
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:08,229
sock I say your analysts do three things

200
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:08,560
identify investigate and mitigate

201
00:08:08,229 --> 00:08:11,258
threats

202
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,729
that's all they should be doing and you

203
00:08:11,259 --> 00:08:15,460
say no no we have to do all these other

204
00:08:12,729 --> 00:08:16,870
things on the right your organization

205
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:20,020
has to do all of these other things on

206
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:21,520
the right your analysts do not and the

207
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:23,830
problem is if they start doing all of

208
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,080
these things in the no column their

209
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:27,219
mission is going to be diluted so that

210
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,289
means they're not gonna be effective at

211
00:08:27,219 --> 00:08:31,719
it so you need to be able to define

212
00:08:29,289 --> 00:08:33,338
here's what the sock does here's what

213
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:35,110
they don't do all of these other things

214
00:08:33,339 --> 00:08:39,310
are necessary so somebody has to do them

215
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:42,190
but not your analyst so one thing that

216
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:43,510
I've actually seen work for a sock is

217
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:44,950
they came up with their mission they had

218
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:47,500
their limited scope and they actually

219
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:48,850
came up with a service catalog here's

220
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,620
the things that we are going to provide

221
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:52,240
to you and kind of just give a little

222
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:56,220
bit more of a definition of here's what

223
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,220
we do and here's what we don't do

224
00:08:57,089 --> 00:09:04,110
another example of a terrible mission

225
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:06,240
statement I worked with a sock that

226
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:07,680
they got requests from the business to

227
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,170
say I need this port open on the

228
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:13,109
firewall and the sock would turn around

229
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:15,029
and create a ticket for the engineers to

230
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:16,709
do I said that's what you do

231
00:09:15,029 --> 00:09:19,529
yes that's what that's what our security

232
00:09:16,709 --> 00:09:21,390
operations center does no no so

233
00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:22,860
hopefully nobody in this room is in that

234
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:26,880
position but it was not a small company

235
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:30,180
it was a very established company so to

236
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:35,220
find your mission well limit the scope

237
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:38,849
of what you're doing problem number

238
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:40,950
three or solution number three we all

239
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:43,950
have a people problem we hear about this

240
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:47,490
every day we've lived it for a decade

241
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:50,430
two decades I put a question mark on it

242
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:52,440
and I'll talk about why one we know we

243
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:54,510
don't have enough people we know that

244
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:56,100
we're trying to train them in University

245
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:58,439
we're trying to make sure that we have

246
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,579
the next generation to help us staff our

247
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:02,040
security operation centers is not

248
00:09:59,579 --> 00:10:04,170
working I worked with a very large

249
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:06,589
energy company in the United States and

250
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:10,019
they tried to create their own internal

251
00:10:06,589 --> 00:10:11,790
security university within their program

252
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:14,490
within their company they were an energy

253
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:16,319
company and they built a security

254
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:17,940
training program they did it for two

255
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,709
years they spent a lot of money they

256
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:23,760
trained a lot of people that went to

257
00:10:19,709 --> 00:10:25,410
work for somebody else so it doesn't it

258
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,209
doesn't always work but but that's

259
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:29,189
that's the the problem right we get we

260
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:30,510
get in people we train them up and now

261
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:32,339
they've got the elevated skill set

262
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:34,560
they're like oh I'm gonna go find more

263
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:37,170
money work in a different place the

264
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:39,410
problem gets worse if you live in a

265
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:42,899
place where there's even less resources

266
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:46,079
so if you are in Australia there's only

267
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:47,970
so many people that do security in

268
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,380
Australia you're gonna have to ship them

269
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:51,750
in I mean it's not hard to convince

270
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:54,570
people like myself I love Australia to

271
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:56,579
move down there but you you have it not

272
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:59,760
only a limited resource pool but a

273
00:10:56,579 --> 00:11:03,329
limited area that you can draw people

274
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:05,850
from so that makes it worse but I'd like

275
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:07,349
to argue that it's not just a people

276
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:11,370
problem like we created this problem

277
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:13,829
ourselves we created this problem

278
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:15,240
because well the attackers created the

279
00:11:13,829 --> 00:11:17,219
problem because now they're now they're

280
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:19,230
automated so

281
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:21,810
they can launch attacks they just spin

282
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:23,279
up botnets they can rent um all of a

283
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:25,258
sudden we have too many events coming in

284
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,980
and what do we do we say we have to hire

285
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:28,050
more people

286
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:29,730
that's our go-to so we're creating that

287
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:35,310
people problem and that's not the right

288
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:38,629
solution the other thing is low fidelity

289
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:40,888
data is overwhelming our socks and so I

290
00:11:38,629 --> 00:11:42,449
don't even know how long ago now when

291
00:11:40,889 --> 00:11:44,639
did seem to come out over a decade ago

292
00:11:42,449 --> 00:11:45,779
everybody said I want to sim because

293
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:47,339
what's gonna happen is I'm gonna take

294
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:49,350
all my security data I'm gonna put it in

295
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:50,610
one place single pane of glass it's all

296
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:52,949
gonna get correlated together it's gonna

297
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:57,360
be simple I've solved all my problems I

298
00:11:52,949 --> 00:11:59,550
now have a sim most people pull all that

299
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,959
data in to their sim and don't do

300
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:03,149
anything with it so now all I've done is

301
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:05,339
congregated all of this data they don't

302
00:12:03,149 --> 00:12:08,519
know what to do with so then that also

303
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:11,279
leads to more of the people problem so

304
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:13,589
that's what we need to solve say how the

305
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:15,529
heck do we do that well we'll get there

306
00:12:13,589 --> 00:12:20,220
too

307
00:12:15,529 --> 00:12:23,730
one other note - on Sims number of feeds

308
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:25,019
does not equal use cases so a lot of

309
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:26,670
times people will buy their sim and they

310
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:29,129
say oh I've got you know ten feeds

311
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:30,599
coming into it that doesn't mean

312
00:12:29,129 --> 00:12:33,389
anything if you don't have the right use

313
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:36,600
cases built on it then you're not really

314
00:12:33,389 --> 00:12:38,399
doing anything additional so number of

315
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,800
feeds does not equal actual

316
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:44,750
effectiveness in your sock keep that in

317
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:49,670
mind does anybody know what this is

318
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:55,050
nobody okay this is a Turing machine so

319
00:12:49,670 --> 00:13:00,240
during World War two the Germans were

320
00:12:55,050 --> 00:13:01,709
using an Enigma machine to to encrypt

321
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,629
all their messages we couldn't the

322
00:13:01,709 --> 00:13:05,369
Americans the Brits couldn't figure out

323
00:13:03,629 --> 00:13:07,019
how to decrypt them fast enough and the

324
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:10,019
problem reason was is because they kept

325
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:12,269
changing their cipher at a range that we

326
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:14,819
had rooms full of people and couldn't

327
00:13:12,269 --> 00:13:18,180
figure out how to decipher them quick

328
00:13:14,819 --> 00:13:20,878
enough so Alan Turing's like oh we need

329
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:22,829
a machine to fight a machine and this is

330
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:24,449
exactly what we need today we need

331
00:13:22,829 --> 00:13:25,769
machines to fight machines not people to

332
00:13:24,449 --> 00:13:28,949
fight machines because it's not working

333
00:13:25,769 --> 00:13:30,990
we can't we can't train enough people to

334
00:13:28,949 --> 00:13:32,819
handle it we don't have rooms big enough

335
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:35,550
for the amount of people that we need to

336
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:41,100
fight this thing so we need machines to

337
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:45,479
fight machines so this is a this is a

338
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:48,900
depiction of current this is my view on

339
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:50,670
how analysts spend their time so

340
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:52,410
Anderson Osaka spent almost all their

341
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:53,819
time identifying stuff most of the time

342
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:55,709
it's false positives most of the time

343
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:58,610
it's noise most of the time they don't

344
00:13:55,710 --> 00:14:01,500
do anything with it besides ignore it

345
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:03,090
again feeds do not equal use cases so

346
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,320
they might have 20 feeds coming in but

347
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:08,580
if they're not doing anything with it

348
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:12,000
it's junk they're overwhelmed you know

349
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:13,350
it's low fidelity data they might only

350
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,380
see half of the picture because they're

351
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:17,760
not using SSL decryption it's just it's

352
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:20,700
just junk and they're wasting their time

353
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:22,560
on it so what do they do they be tune

354
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:24,690
the sensors say well we're getting too

355
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,219
much data in so I'm just going to detune

356
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:28,950
my sensors so I don't get as much data

357
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:30,870
in okay that's one way to do it that

358
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:35,340
happens all the time the other thing is

359
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:36,690
they can just ignore alerts so the first

360
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:39,060
sock that I walked into that I told you

361
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:40,620
where I got into the mantrap I sat down

362
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:43,979
next to an analyst and we looked at a

363
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:45,630
screen full of alerts and I said oh my

364
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,740
gosh that's you know there's there's 20

365
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:47,880
of them there there's only one of you

366
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:53,880
what are you gonna do about it

367
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:55,560
he does I select all delete you can't do

368
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:57,060
that well you just did he's like oh

369
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:59,550
those are probably all false positives

370
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:02,790
anyway and that's how he solved his

371
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:05,390
problem okay that's not what we can do

372
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:07,469
kid that's not what we do

373
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:09,150
the other thing is if they do find

374
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:10,380
problems then they're gonna create a

375
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:11,579
ticket for somebody else to solve

376
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:13,410
they're never gonna have a closed-loop

377
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:15,420
process they're gonna see the same

378
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:18,510
problem again so it's kind of the how

379
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:21,060
fast can we can we close out issues

380
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:24,360
without actually solving the problem

381
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:26,040
maybe we need to upgrade an application

382
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,480
maybe we need to upgrade a firewall

383
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,990
whatever we need to do let's do it

384
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:34,350
instead of just try to get people to do

385
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:36,660
closed tickets as fast as they can and

386
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:39,450
all of this just causes our people to

387
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:42,120
burnout which again leads to increase

388
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:44,190
our people problem so it's a

389
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:48,120
self-fulfilling process and prophecy

390
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:49,620
now do they really ignore events now

391
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:52,589
besides my personal experience of the

392
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:56,430
select all and delete this was research

393
00:15:52,589 --> 00:15:58,079
done last year by ESG I don't know if

394
00:15:56,430 --> 00:16:00,149
you guys can read it in the back does

395
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:02,310
your organization ever have to ignore

396
00:16:00,149 --> 00:16:03,839
some security events alerts that you

397
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:07,560
believe should be investigated further

398
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:10,709
but can't because you can't keep up with

399
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:14,489
the overall volume more than 50 percent

400
00:16:10,709 --> 00:16:17,599
said yes I think the other 43% are lying

401
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:19,889
to themselves but over 50 percent

402
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,360
acknowledged that yeah we ignore things

403
00:16:19,889 --> 00:16:23,910
because we just don't have time to deal

404
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:26,370
with it as a business that's not what

405
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:30,180
you want to hear as practitioners that

406
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:33,709
we get this this is our life we need to

407
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:35,758
change it so one thing I've seen work

408
00:16:33,709 --> 00:16:39,089
people are moving towards prevention

409
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:40,980
based architectures so instead of just

410
00:16:39,089 --> 00:16:42,629
detect and respond detect and respond

411
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:44,850
detect and respond we've heard it for

412
00:16:42,629 --> 00:16:47,819
you know every some vendor ever I used

413
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:49,470
to work for one we need to move back to

414
00:16:47,819 --> 00:16:51,300
actual protection before it comes in I

415
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:53,670
believe that if we changed the inputs

416
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:55,979
and the outputs of a sock we can change

417
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:57,540
what actually happens in a sock and so

418
00:16:55,980 --> 00:17:00,149
the prevention based architecture is

419
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:01,740
something that I've seen consistently

420
00:17:00,149 --> 00:17:04,919
working for organizations so what does

421
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:06,569
that mean the first thing is consistent

422
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:10,380
protection so whether you're working

423
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:12,299
Network Cloud endpoints you need to make

424
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:13,919
sure that you have consistent

425
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:15,418
protections against all of them that

426
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,220
they're all updated at the same time

427
00:17:15,419 --> 00:17:19,470
because if you lock the front door but

428
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:21,510
you leave the back door open you're not

429
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:25,020
helping yourself so figuring out how to

430
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:26,640
get that consistent protection we used

431
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:28,079
to think well that means you know I got

432
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,429
two by two firewalls I got two by two

433
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,870
that I got a you know if my first

434
00:17:29,429 --> 00:17:33,600
firewall doesn't catch it my second

435
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:34,530
firewall will know you just need to make

436
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,418
sure that things are implemented

437
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:39,270
properly and make sure that you have the

438
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:42,960
consistent protections across your

439
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:45,860
environment so it's number one number

440
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:48,059
two is centralized management so

441
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:49,500
centralized management great I only have

442
00:17:48,059 --> 00:17:52,710
to learn one tool that seems like it'll

443
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:55,169
make everything faster correct it will

444
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:56,640
also make things manageable so if you

445
00:17:55,169 --> 00:17:57,710
have an update that you need to do you

446
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,929
can do it across your entire

447
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:01,360
environment instead of onesie twosie you

448
00:17:59,929 --> 00:18:03,440
have to have the centralized management

449
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,570
and to make sure that everything is

450
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,549
update at the same time because you

451
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:10,668
don't want your Japan office to be

452
00:18:07,549 --> 00:18:13,250
behind in your Sydney office to be you

453
00:18:10,669 --> 00:18:14,360
know three levels up from Japan or else

454
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:16,610
they're gonna get into your network

455
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,959
you're gonna be in trouble anyway so

456
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:21,500
centralized management helps you with

457
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:23,990
that the third piece of prevention based

458
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:27,049
architecture is automated threat

459
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:29,330
prevention so I've been in numerous

460
00:18:27,049 --> 00:18:32,480
socks and I say how do you guys handle

461
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:34,250
threat intelligence and they say well we

462
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,990
just subscribe to all these different

463
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:38,419
feeds it's overwhelming there's too much

464
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:40,520
so well okay what do you do when you get

465
00:18:38,419 --> 00:18:43,070
this threat intelligence how do you

466
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:46,730
consume it they say well we get it an

467
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:48,610
email we read it and then within a week

468
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:51,529
or two we press out we push out some

469
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:54,918
updates we have our IOC as we update

470
00:18:51,529 --> 00:18:56,960
those a week or two email people problem

471
00:18:54,919 --> 00:18:58,880
you get where I'm going with that not

472
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:03,470
scalable and then takes a week or two to

473
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:05,630
update so there's automated threat

474
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:07,460
prevention available in lots of

475
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:10,250
different places you just have to let it

476
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:12,350
run so what this means is that a threat

477
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:13,940
comes in an IOC comes in and it

478
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:15,649
automatically updates your controls

479
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:18,620
whether it be your endpoints whether it

480
00:19:15,649 --> 00:19:22,610
be your firewalls whether it be you know

481
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:24,020
your your cloud access you can get to

482
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:24,979
read permission to five minutes now I'm

483
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:27,110
not saying you're gonna get that for

484
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:30,440
every threat but if you can get it down

485
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:32,479
to five minutes from two weeks that's

486
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:35,419
going to make you better protect it so

487
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:37,700
that's the third piece and then the

488
00:19:35,419 --> 00:19:41,600
fourth piece is moving all of our

489
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:43,700
prevention closer to the business so

490
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:46,240
closer to users applications data

491
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:48,620
services we want to make sure that we

492
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,760
are protecting those things not just the

493
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:51,889
network because who cares about the

494
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,720
network if we can't protect the users of

495
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:56,000
the apps and the data and the services

496
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:58,460
so that's kind of along the lines of

497
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,130
zero trust another topic that's going

498
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:04,690
around so all that together is in

499
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:04,690
prevention based architectures

500
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:15,050
this is where we want to be I've the

501
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:17,180
companies that I've seen do this so far

502
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:19,310
are not small they have a lot of money

503
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:21,350
they've put a lot of time into this but

504
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:22,669
I think that's how it always works is

505
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:23,689
that the bigger guys with the with the

506
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:25,580
budgets are going to be able to get

507
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:27,500
there first and then it can trickle down

508
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:31,159
to some of the more medium sized

509
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:33,350
organizations but what it's going to do

510
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:35,750
is you're gonna have that automation for

511
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:37,939
consistency so that again your Japan

512
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:41,390
office in your Sydney officer at the

513
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:43,640
same levels you're gonna have better

514
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:44,720
outcomes the reason you're gonna have

515
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,190
better outcomes is because you're not

516
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:49,850
spending all of your time tracing down

517
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:51,280
false positives and nuisance data you're

518
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:55,760
actually gonna have time to investigate

519
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:57,920
it's gonna go faster and the key is that

520
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:00,140
you want machines to do what machines

521
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:02,030
are good at you want people to do what

522
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:03,770
people are gonna so machines are good at

523
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:06,820
events machines are good at pattern

524
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:10,220
matching people are good at situations

525
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:11,689
people are good at finding patterns that

526
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:12,770
those machines can that's what we want

527
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:15,740
them to work on and that's where

528
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:18,800
investigate works ultimately they'll

529
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:22,040
have more job satisfaction so we're

530
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:23,270
taking away that the overwhelming

531
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:25,909
feeling of too much data

532
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:27,560
crappy data we're giving them more job

533
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:28,760
satisfaction so hopefully with all of

534
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:32,720
these things we're helping that people

535
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:35,420
problem I did want to note on the

536
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,950
mitigate section there's a bunch of

537
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:42,620
tools out there that will do automated

538
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:46,760
remediation edr XDR i know of one

539
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:48,889
company that has stood and done it that

540
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:50,629
has turned it on and this isn't probably

541
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:53,630
in the past two months that i've kind of

542
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:56,480
asked who's doing it and I mean fully so

543
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:58,880
that an action incident comes in and

544
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,260
they fully stand back and let it go turn

545
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,830
off the Machine pull it off the network

546
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:05,330
do whatever everyone else is scared for

547
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:07,220
good reason I mean you don't want to go

548
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:09,889
and turn off the CEOs laptop because

549
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:11,480
it's infected you really want to but you

550
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:13,310
know it could cause business impact so a

551
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:15,440
bunch of people use those tools to alert

552
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:18,560
them say this one should be taken off

553
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,770
the network here's the next action but

554
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,860
there

555
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:23,660
not many that are willing to do that yet

556
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:27,919
I think that's going to change hopefully

557
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:30,130
very very quickly so where else does

558
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:35,240
this get us this red part right here

559
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:40,420
this is hunting this is where we all

560
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:42,380
want to be so who here does hunting

561
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:45,640
nobody's raising their hands today for

562
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:45,640
me I got a couple hands okay

563
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:50,840
many many companies say that they do

564
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:54,050
hunting or they want to do hunting again

565
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:56,540
very few do or do it effectively so what

566
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:57,770
is hunting hunting is smart people

567
00:22:56,540 --> 00:23:00,139
looking for things that couldn't be

568
00:22:57,770 --> 00:23:02,840
found else by anything else so this is

569
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:04,070
smart people doing smart things not what

570
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:07,360
machines do machines do what they do

571
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:11,300
this is smart people doing smart things

572
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:13,669
the people that are good at it they take

573
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:15,200
time to do it and it's not just okay

574
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:17,750
it's Friday afternoon here's two hours

575
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:20,000
go figure something out it is here's two

576
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:23,960
weeks your mission is to be a hunter for

577
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:26,090
two weeks it's going to be documented

578
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:28,070
we're gonna have a process for it

579
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:30,470
we're gonna meet every morning and do it

580
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:32,600
like a sprint stand-up meeting to figure

581
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:35,240
out what they've done but it's gonna be

582
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:38,389
goal oriented process driven it's gonna

583
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:40,280
be driven by a piece of intelligence so

584
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:42,710
a lot of times it's so I've heard of

585
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:45,530
this new threat and I want to know if

586
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:50,540
I'm affected by it sometimes it's a

587
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:51,590
review of blocked events you go back

588
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:53,780
through your firewall to figure out what

589
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:56,230
you blocked figure out why figure out if

590
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:56,230
you're under attack

591
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:03,500
so always driven by a piece of

592
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:04,760
intelligence and then it ends with what

593
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:07,040
we've learned if you haven't learned

594
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:08,120
anything then your process is junk and

595
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:11,389
you need to go back and figure out a

596
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:12,620
different process for hunting this is

597
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:13,820
the way we want to be and these are the

598
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:16,639
companies that are successful with

599
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:19,189
hunting those that are unsuccessful are

600
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:23,540
those that say here's two hours on a

601
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:26,480
Friday go find something they buy they

602
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:28,610
invest in a data scientist who doesn't

603
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,710
know anything about security so it's a

604
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:34,020
good way to spend a lot of money I've

605
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:36,370
seen it done I've done it

606
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:38,918
but that's that's how it's not gonna

607
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:40,750
work you need those security people you

608
00:24:38,919 --> 00:24:42,070
need to give them enough education that

609
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:43,150
they can go play in the data and find

610
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:44,980
what they want but they need to know

611
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:49,179
what they're looking for so that's how

612
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:53,970
you make hunt work so given that is

613
00:24:49,179 --> 00:24:53,970
anybody doing hunt okay

614
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:05,209
my next big heart attack my issue

615
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:08,779
all right in your security operation

616
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:10,309
center who uses less than ten tools and

617
00:25:08,779 --> 00:25:11,720
you have to raise your hand from one of

618
00:25:10,309 --> 00:25:16,010
these so you're not getting out of it

619
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:22,010
who uses less than ten tools two three

620
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:27,080
okay who uses ten 250 tools should be

621
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:32,539
most most who uses over fifty it happens

622
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:33,889
it happens from what I've seen this is

623
00:25:32,539 --> 00:25:35,600
nothing official I've never sent out a

624
00:25:33,889 --> 00:25:39,139
survey but what I've seen is the average

625
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:42,559
is about forty forty tools I've talked

626
00:25:39,139 --> 00:25:45,379
to CISOs that say see so the main big

627
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:47,658
banks and such that say all I'm doing is

628
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:50,929
vendor management it's all I do all day

629
00:25:47,659 --> 00:25:52,370
I got the lunch it's night no it's doing

630
00:25:50,929 --> 00:25:53,779
vendor management's taking calls it's

631
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:55,729
learning about new tools it's getting

632
00:25:53,779 --> 00:25:57,049
the pitches they're not actually doing

633
00:25:55,730 --> 00:26:01,970
security they're just doing vendor

634
00:25:57,049 --> 00:26:03,440
management that needs to change what can

635
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:04,760
we do about it well everybody's got this

636
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,289
problem it's kind of like the people

637
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:11,179
problem we also have the too many tools

638
00:26:06,289 --> 00:26:14,080
problem I think everybody has the new

639
00:26:11,179 --> 00:26:16,250
shiny I want to buy one of those problem

640
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:19,418
I'm not sure how to get over the shiny

641
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:21,710
thing problem besides to say don't do it

642
00:26:19,419 --> 00:26:23,299
but a bigger thing is very limited

643
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:26,330
feature use so what happens is we buy

644
00:26:23,299 --> 00:26:29,750
all these technologies and then we don't

645
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:32,360
implement them fully we have a legacy

646
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:35,090
firewall and then we buy this brand-new

647
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:36,229
fancy firewall and we say okay I'm gonna

648
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:37,850
I'm gonna use all those features I'm

649
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:39,710
gonna buy all the subscriptions I'm

650
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:41,779
gonna do all the things and you take

651
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:43,039
your old firewall and you plop all your

652
00:26:41,779 --> 00:26:45,169
rules into your new firewall and then

653
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:48,919
you don't do anything else and all

654
00:26:45,169 --> 00:26:50,659
you've done is upgraded your metal here

655
00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:52,460
you have the same security that you did

656
00:26:50,659 --> 00:26:56,419
the past five to seven years except for

657
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:57,740
in a new shiny box so this happens over

658
00:26:56,419 --> 00:26:59,389
and over and over again this is one of

659
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:01,880
the big pitfalls I've seen especially

660
00:26:59,389 --> 00:27:04,100
with subscriptions I've seen people

661
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:06,590
spend forty thousand dollars on a

662
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:10,219
monthly subscription and never turn it

663
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:11,789
on if the people running the business

664
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:14,159
knew this they would have a heart attack

665
00:27:11,789 --> 00:27:16,139
but as practitioners we understand well

666
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:18,419
we're busy we don't have time to learn

667
00:27:16,139 --> 00:27:20,580
this new thing or turn it on well you

668
00:27:18,419 --> 00:27:25,259
need to make time because this can make

669
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:27,389
you more more protected one of the seats

670
00:27:25,259 --> 00:27:30,899
those I work with out of the Middle East

671
00:27:27,389 --> 00:27:33,090
he has a rule if they want to add a new

672
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:35,758
tool into his sock they have to take out

673
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:38,970
too it's a pretty good rule it's working

674
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:40,619
for him so hard it so far it makes the

675
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:42,539
employees of the sock have to work think

676
00:27:40,619 --> 00:27:44,309
a lot harder about what they want so it

677
00:27:42,539 --> 00:27:46,349
takes the luster off of the shiny object

678
00:27:44,309 --> 00:27:51,389
problem but it really works for him to

679
00:27:46,349 --> 00:27:53,059
reduce the amount of tools so here's

680
00:27:51,389 --> 00:27:55,228
another problem

681
00:27:53,059 --> 00:27:56,340
extensive vendor management yeah you're

682
00:27:55,229 --> 00:27:59,279
spending too much time talking to

683
00:27:56,340 --> 00:28:01,439
vendors you have duplicate functionality

684
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:05,220
because you haven't actually turned on

685
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:06,869
all your features but the other thing

686
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:08,509
every time you buy a new tool what is

687
00:28:06,869 --> 00:28:11,099
the what does the person want you to do

688
00:28:08,509 --> 00:28:13,799
you just have to install this one agent

689
00:28:11,099 --> 00:28:16,139
you just have to put this one more box

690
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:17,700
in your data center it's just one more

691
00:28:16,139 --> 00:28:20,428
thing you have to add so what happens is

692
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:23,340
you have end-user degradation so your

693
00:28:20,429 --> 00:28:25,700
user experience is slower it might be

694
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:28,918
eating you know the batteries of your

695
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:30,210
handhelds it's actually affecting your

696
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:33,359
users for every single one of these

697
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:35,159
tools that you you buy so what I predict

698
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:37,949
is gonna happen is there's gonna be a

699
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:42,539
consolidation of platforms I do not mean

700
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:44,099
a rollup I do not believe that when big

701
00:28:42,539 --> 00:28:47,190
companies buy all the little startups

702
00:28:44,099 --> 00:28:48,928
that that's a winning strategy because I

703
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:50,249
think we've all seen when really good

704
00:28:48,929 --> 00:28:51,659
companies get bought up by bigger

705
00:28:50,249 --> 00:28:54,269
companies and maybe it doesn't work out

706
00:28:51,659 --> 00:28:56,609
quite right and that feature of that

707
00:28:54,269 --> 00:28:59,580
technology that innovation kind of dies

708
00:28:56,609 --> 00:29:02,099
on the vine so when I say consolidation

709
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:03,059
on the platform I do not mean a big

710
00:29:02,099 --> 00:29:05,939
company buys up all these little

711
00:29:03,059 --> 00:29:07,379
companies what I mean is that there's

712
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:09,720
going to be some big players that come

713
00:29:07,379 --> 00:29:12,478
out with platforms and all of the

714
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:14,909
startup companies that we see all of the

715
00:29:12,479 --> 00:29:16,259
fantastic innovation that we see those

716
00:29:14,909 --> 00:29:18,720
are going to become features of the

717
00:29:16,259 --> 00:29:20,099
platform it doesn't mean they have to be

718
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,840
bought by the big company it just means

719
00:29:20,099 --> 00:29:24,450
they become a feature and so it changes

720
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,649
the way that we're consuming technology

721
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:28,800
it's changing the

722
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:31,020
that were were only having to install

723
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:33,300
one agent because all of our features

724
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:35,010
use the same data anyway so let's have

725
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:36,690
one agent it pulls in all the data and

726
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:39,120
then we have all these features that can

727
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:41,190
act on it so I think that that's the way

728
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,810
that it's going to move we've already

729
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:46,410
started to see some of the the players

730
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:48,419
do this and it's going to help us with

731
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:53,940
our our other problems of vendor

732
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:59,280
management etc so we want less tools we

733
00:29:53,940 --> 00:30:02,150
want more features that's the goal but

734
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:04,350
but but what if I just build my own I

735
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:06,060
hear this especially the ones with money

736
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:08,780
I'm just I'm just gonna build my own

737
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:11,879
platform I'm gonna do this myself no

738
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:14,639
this doesn't work there was a large

739
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:16,350
customer down not when I say customer I

740
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:19,410
don't mean my customer I mean somebody

741
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:22,439
that I've spoken with down in Australia

742
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:25,710
who spent two years and about 20 million

743
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:27,690
dollars and it didn't work and they said

744
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:30,360
oh nevermind it was a fantastic idea

745
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:33,270
they had all the rights knowledge to do

746
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:35,629
it they just couldn't do it so high cost

747
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:39,570
low results don't try to do it yourself

748
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:42,930
there's one exception I've seen another

749
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:44,610
different energy company who is building

750
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:46,530
their own but what they've done is they

751
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:49,020
they are one that has bought every

752
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:50,430
product on the market and then when they

753
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:51,570
build their own they're building all the

754
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:54,210
integrations of all those different

755
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:55,800
products my guess is that most of you in

756
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:58,800
this room don't have the budgets or the

757
00:30:55,800 --> 00:31:04,129
time to do that so when you say I'm just

758
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:04,129
going to build my own don't doesn't work

759
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:19,590
okay side note of cloud switching topics

760
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:20,669
to cloud this isn't a fully shock

761
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:22,678
message but everybody has questions

762
00:31:20,669 --> 00:31:25,620
about clouds so here's some things that

763
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:29,970
I'm seeing in cloud everybody's very

764
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:31,908
very cautious the first year is usually

765
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:33,750
really really slow

766
00:31:31,909 --> 00:31:35,880
these are the three big players

767
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:37,200
Microsoft Amazon and Google there's a

768
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:40,529
couple others but these are the three

769
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:43,440
that are really coming out a lot the big

770
00:31:40,529 --> 00:31:46,440
guys that I know are on their second

771
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,730
third fourth iterations the first time

772
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,899
they always say I'm just gonna lift and

773
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:50,159
shift I'm just gonna take all of my

774
00:31:48,899 --> 00:31:52,070
current applications I'm gonna throw my

775
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:55,020
cloud and then I'm gonna fix them later

776
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:56,760
it doesn't work and so if you're

777
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:58,500
planning your cloud journey and you say

778
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:00,020
I'm just gonna I'm just gonna pick them

779
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:02,190
up and put them in the new in the cloud

780
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:03,918
so unfortunately it doesn't work that

781
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:06,200
way

782
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:09,059
you're gonna have to take the time to

783
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:12,000
change the way applications work for the

784
00:32:09,059 --> 00:32:14,010
cloud here's the other thing is that if

785
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,500
something was insecure and junky before

786
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:18,059
cloud it's gonna be unsecured and junky

787
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:20,190
in cloud so you have to do that

788
00:32:18,059 --> 00:32:22,049
changeover you have to add in that

789
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:24,419
security before it's actually gonna work

790
00:32:22,049 --> 00:32:26,039
so that's what I've seen there there's

791
00:32:24,419 --> 00:32:27,720
also a lot of regulation challenges that

792
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:28,679
people are trying to figure out the

793
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:30,419
bigger ones are gonna have to figure

794
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:32,130
that out before the smaller guys cuz you

795
00:32:30,419 --> 00:32:36,470
don't have time we don't have the money

796
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:36,470
to figure that out so it's ever-evolving

797
00:32:36,679 --> 00:32:44,279
as far as protections the big the big

798
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,419
players Microsoft Amazon Google have

799
00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:47,580
made it pretty clear about what they

800
00:32:45,419 --> 00:32:49,169
protect and what they don't read the

801
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:52,580
fine print of your your contracts but

802
00:32:49,169 --> 00:32:55,559
basically they protect their

803
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:57,090
infrastructure you protect all of your

804
00:32:55,559 --> 00:32:58,830
data in it you protect all of the

805
00:32:57,090 --> 00:33:01,289
traffic flows to and from it they

806
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:03,299
protect their data center you protect

807
00:33:01,289 --> 00:33:06,990
everything else so data coming to and

808
00:33:03,299 --> 00:33:09,179
from the cloud the data in the SAS

809
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:13,649
applications that you're using all the

810
00:33:09,179 --> 00:33:16,470
user controls that's on you so when they

811
00:33:13,649 --> 00:33:18,178
say oh I'm gonna buy the secure cloud no

812
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:19,559
you're gonna buy a cloud that is secure

813
00:33:18,179 --> 00:33:20,130
on its own and once you put your stuff

814
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:21,539
into it

815
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:24,960
that's your problem

816
00:33:21,539 --> 00:33:25,919
would just keep that in mind the other

817
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:30,869
thing is that prevention based

818
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:33,359
architecture the zero trust model if you

819
00:33:30,869 --> 00:33:35,039
get that right in your network when you

820
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:37,439
move it over to cloud it's still gonna

821
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:38,789
work so a lot of times people say well I

822
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,950
don't want to do I don't want to do this

823
00:33:38,789 --> 00:33:42,809
zero trust model until I move to the

824
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:44,999
cloud because I don't wanna have to redo

825
00:33:42,809 --> 00:33:46,259
it you don't have to so do it now and

826
00:33:44,999 --> 00:33:56,099
then you can move it to the cloud as

827
00:33:46,259 --> 00:33:57,590
your business moves so number six there

828
00:33:56,099 --> 00:34:00,149
was pre target there's after target

829
00:33:57,590 --> 00:34:04,499
there's pre the business really caring

830
00:34:00,149 --> 00:34:05,609
and now the business really cares so

831
00:34:04,499 --> 00:34:08,250
working with the business is something

832
00:34:05,609 --> 00:34:11,699
I've seen change a lot over the last

833
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:15,089
five years or so one of the big things

834
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:17,189
this sock NOC integration but not

835
00:34:15,089 --> 00:34:22,078
physically do not put them in the same

836
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:24,210
room but it's it's more of the sock fine

837
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:26,879
something bad you have to work with the

838
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:28,440
network to go fix it block it prevent it

839
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:28,918
so that they don't see it again in the

840
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:31,829
sock

841
00:34:28,918 --> 00:34:34,549
this works for bigger companies smaller

842
00:34:31,829 --> 00:34:36,869
companies the sock is still an island

843
00:34:34,549 --> 00:34:38,719
unfortunately and I don't mean small

844
00:34:36,869 --> 00:34:40,559
companies I mean medium-sized companies

845
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:42,569
unfortunately the sock is still an

846
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:47,040
island so that's something that we have

847
00:34:42,569 --> 00:34:50,579
to continually break down I have seen an

848
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:53,549
increase of socks CISOs reporting

849
00:34:50,579 --> 00:34:55,970
directly to a CEO so that's interesting

850
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:59,250
you know 15 years ago it was the

851
00:34:55,969 --> 00:35:01,740
security always reported to IT which is

852
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:04,049
a conflict of interest it's bad because

853
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:05,520
then the security people say well we

854
00:35:04,049 --> 00:35:07,200
need to fix this and the IT person says

855
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:09,780
no no that'll take my network down and

856
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:12,740
so you have an issue so it's changed

857
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:16,109
over the years to the seaso reports to

858
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:20,729
risk and compliance or they report to

859
00:35:16,109 --> 00:35:21,839
audit or they report to the CEO anyway

860
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:23,190
so that's how things have changed but

861
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:25,680
I've actually seen them report to the

862
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:32,279
CEO now so that'll be interesting how

863
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:35,069
that plays out business unit alignment

864
00:35:32,279 --> 00:35:38,070
something that I've seen people do

865
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:41,370
is instead of buying an analyst you buy

866
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:45,300
you buy instead of hiring a new analyst

867
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:49,220
you hire a business liaison so this

868
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:51,990
person's gonna figure out what sort of

869
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:53,430
controls do we need on the business why

870
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:54,959
do we keep saying no and the business

871
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:58,109
keeps saying I hate you

872
00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:00,950
let me do what I want and so they've

873
00:35:58,110 --> 00:36:03,450
actually found a lot of benefit from

874
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:07,279
hiring that business liaison instead of

875
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:09,870
just another analyst other things there

876
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:12,690
Automation developers and operations and

877
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:14,190
engineers so not just the process not

878
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:18,300
just figuring out the processes and

879
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:21,840
engineering within the sock but finding

880
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:23,340
it between especially with cloud working

881
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:25,410
with those developers what do they need

882
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:27,330
what sort of templates do they need to

883
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:30,509
be able to spin up their virtual

884
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:32,190
environments quickly and securely so

885
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:37,530
investing in those as opposed to just

886
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:39,030
the pure analysts you know I forgot to

887
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:43,260
mention before to is with the people

888
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:47,010
problem a lot of times people say well

889
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:49,170
I'm just going to use an MSS they have

890
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:50,670
the same people problem we do so if

891
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:52,680
you're thinking about using an MSS just

892
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:53,940
keep that in mind a managed security

893
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:56,700
provider they may have the same people

894
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:58,680
problems that you do anyway so the

895
00:36:56,700 --> 00:37:01,379
automations and operations engineers

896
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:03,299
kind of help if you are working with an

897
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:09,900
MSS figuring out those processes between

898
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:12,090
them and you and like I said small

899
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:14,370
businesses are still on an island I have

900
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:16,230
seen organizations where they run

901
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:19,589
reports and they say here's all the

902
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:22,170
applications that you're running go deal

903
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:23,700
with it they're never going to deal with

904
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:25,080
it you just gave me or the traffic cop

905
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:27,960
you just gave them a report and they're

906
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:29,520
never gonna do anything so that that

907
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:32,010
operations engineer can figure out those

908
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:33,750
processes to make sure that you lock

909
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:35,160
down those applications or you strictly

910
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:39,110
allow those applications so you're not

911
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:43,359
wasting your time on that anymore

912
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:46,510
so one more big topic metrics

913
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:47,530
I hate metrics and I love metrics all at

914
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:49,800
once

915
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:53,350
the right metrics drive change and

916
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:56,230
unfortunately our metrics suck they are

917
00:37:53,350 --> 00:38:00,130
terrible they have been forever and so

918
00:37:56,230 --> 00:38:01,900
I'm trying to push what I've learned

919
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:03,430
into what's what are terrible metrics

920
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:05,200
and what are good metrics and the

921
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:07,990
biggest thing is you have to ask

922
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:11,620
yourself can I do anything with the data

923
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:13,180
that I'm providing it's the so what you

924
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:17,049
give you given number hey today we're a

925
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:17,770
42 so what is that better or like what

926
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:21,070
are you gonna do with that information

927
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:24,370
so you always want to have metrics that

928
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:28,470
mean something so here are terrible

929
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:30,520
metrics and number one everybody has

930
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:34,089
because the business likes to see it

931
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:36,009
because security grew out of IT and IT

932
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:37,720
cares about how fast can you get the

933
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:40,900
network back up how fast can you do

934
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:43,839
things and so we've inherited mean time

935
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:46,050
to resolution mean time to response it's

936
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:47,800
terrible it drives the wrong behavior

937
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:49,090
because what you're doing is you're

938
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:51,370
telling your analyst how fast can you

939
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:53,590
get this how fast can you close it how

940
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:55,270
fast can you select all and delete how

941
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:57,220
fast can you close this ticket which is

942
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:59,320
not what we want them to do that does

943
00:38:57,220 --> 00:39:02,700
not make the business more secure so

944
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:05,230
meantime the resolution is terrible

945
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:10,629
number of incident is handled is kind of

946
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:14,230
one of those so what I did I did 16 so

947
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:16,420
what if there were 200 then that's

948
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:18,220
terrible if there were 16 then that's

949
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:22,020
fantastic so number of incidents by

950
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:24,609
itself doesn't matter number of alerts

951
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:27,520
maybe you turned on any sensor and so

952
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:29,590
now you've doubled your alerts that by

953
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:32,170
itself just as a media thing and number

954
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:34,660
of feeds like I said I got 50 feeds

955
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:37,120
coming into my sock who cares if you're

956
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:40,720
not doing anything with it then it

957
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:45,720
doesn't matter and a note on red yellow

958
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:48,939
green I hate red yellow green here's why

959
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:51,759
if you show your board hey today we're

960
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:54,850
green you should never tell them you're

961
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:57,029
green you are never you should never be

962
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:58,979
comfortable that you're not

963
00:39:57,029 --> 00:40:01,199
get attacked tomorrow this is a false

964
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:03,118
sense of security if you say oh we're

965
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:05,099
only at a yellow oh good I can go home

966
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:06,479
and sleep tonight no you have no idea

967
00:40:05,099 --> 00:40:09,539
what's gonna happen tomorrow so red

968
00:40:06,479 --> 00:40:10,890
yellow green is misleading and I don't

969
00:40:09,539 --> 00:40:15,989
think that we should use those for

970
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:20,699
overall security of our companies so

971
00:40:15,989 --> 00:40:23,159
what does work this is my rant I love

972
00:40:20,699 --> 00:40:24,630
this there's two types of metrics I

973
00:40:23,159 --> 00:40:27,779
think all metrics should fit into these

974
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:30,319
there's configuration confidence whit's

975
00:40:27,779 --> 00:40:32,880
which is what is my confidence that my

976
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:35,939
technology my controls are up and

977
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:38,609
running that are configured to best

978
00:40:35,939 --> 00:40:41,519
practice and are operating as I intend

979
00:40:38,609 --> 00:40:42,989
them to operate so that's one set of

980
00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:45,718
configuration I'm confident in my

981
00:40:42,989 --> 00:40:48,869
configuration of controls the other is

982
00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:50,849
I'm confident in my operations of those

983
00:40:48,869 --> 00:40:52,559
controls do I have the people in place

984
00:40:50,849 --> 00:40:54,299
so I have the processes in place can I

985
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:56,999
actually use the technology that I have

986
00:40:54,299 --> 00:40:58,949
up and running because ultimately the

987
00:40:56,999 --> 00:41:00,509
business doesn't care about number of

988
00:40:58,949 --> 00:41:02,219
feeds or number of alerts they want to

989
00:41:00,509 --> 00:41:06,929
care they care about what's the threat

990
00:41:02,219 --> 00:41:08,909
am i affected how big is it and when's

991
00:41:06,929 --> 00:41:11,130
it gonna be fixed that's what they care

992
00:41:08,909 --> 00:41:13,859
they don't care about number of alerts

993
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:18,059
that came in today so what are some

994
00:41:13,859 --> 00:41:20,808
examples configuration confidence are my

995
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:23,099
controls running so this is really hard

996
00:41:20,809 --> 00:41:24,419
so you you go out and you install a

997
00:41:23,099 --> 00:41:28,829
bunch of firewalls you install a bunch

998
00:41:24,419 --> 00:41:30,509
of endpoint protection and then somebody

999
00:41:28,829 --> 00:41:32,609
needs to make a machiya change in this

1000
00:41:30,509 --> 00:41:34,739
corner of your network and so they turn

1001
00:41:32,609 --> 00:41:37,169
off the firewall or they turn off some

1002
00:41:34,739 --> 00:41:39,779
rules on the firewall and then they

1003
00:41:37,169 --> 00:41:43,229
forget to turn it back on and it's

1004
00:41:39,779 --> 00:41:46,409
really hard to actually know that that

1005
00:41:43,229 --> 00:41:47,999
happened it's hard to track that so our

1006
00:41:46,409 --> 00:41:50,159
controls are running that's something

1007
00:41:47,999 --> 00:41:52,078
that we have to lock down just because

1008
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:54,959
we installed it doesn't mean it's

1009
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:56,369
running figure out what's been changed

1010
00:41:54,959 --> 00:41:59,519
especially in cloud

1011
00:41:56,369 --> 00:42:00,900
so there's configuration drift and so we

1012
00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:03,508
could need to figure out we started out

1013
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:05,279
at this point and 48 hours later it got

1014
00:42:03,509 --> 00:42:08,159
someplace else we need to know about

1015
00:42:05,279 --> 00:42:11,040
those are we configured the best

1016
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:14,890
practices if not why that's fine

1017
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:16,930
feature use so if we're only using 5% of

1018
00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:18,810
our features which by the way I didn't

1019
00:42:16,930 --> 00:42:21,368
audit on a customer and they were using

1020
00:42:18,810 --> 00:42:25,599
5% of the technology that they had

1021
00:42:21,369 --> 00:42:27,340
bought we need to know that you know you

1022
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:29,080
bought this technology go and use it and

1023
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:31,390
be able to measure it and ask your

1024
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:33,520
vendors to make to tell you okay I

1025
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:36,549
bought your endpoint solution am i using

1026
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:37,720
it right how much of it am I using ask

1027
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:40,869
them to figure that out for you

1028
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:44,649
and then percent of traffic visible

1029
00:42:40,869 --> 00:42:49,210
so if 70 80 percent of our network is

1030
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:51,820
encrypted how much of it can we see are

1031
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:54,400
we using SSL decryption can we not

1032
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:56,140
because of certain regulations we need

1033
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:58,210
to know these things to be able to run

1034
00:42:56,140 --> 00:43:01,650
the business and have a sense of am i

1035
00:42:58,210 --> 00:43:03,700
confident that I can handle an attack

1036
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:07,150
which is where the operational

1037
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:09,040
confidence comes in this is I'm going to

1038
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:10,210
be attacked I'm going to I don't know if

1039
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:13,050
it's tomorrow I don't know if it's next

1040
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:15,820
week it's probably continuous

1041
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:18,970
operational confidence is can you handle

1042
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:21,339
it when it happens so a couple of

1043
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:23,950
metrics around that events per analyst

1044
00:43:21,339 --> 00:43:29,049
hour this is like the or the holy grail

1045
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:31,779
of all of the sock metrics because this

1046
00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:34,300
means if events per analyst hours to

1047
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:36,190
high your analysts are overwhelmed

1048
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:38,950
they're gonna miss things they're gonna

1049
00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:40,060
delete things if it's too low then you

1050
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:42,759
can give them extra work to do it

1051
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:45,690
whenever it's never too low but events

1052
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:47,500
pray and all this tower is probably if

1053
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:50,109
1313 is kind of what you're driving

1054
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:52,030
towards and that's an extremely hard

1055
00:43:50,109 --> 00:43:53,470
number to get to but that's that's where

1056
00:43:52,030 --> 00:43:56,400
you can be confident that that analyst

1057
00:43:53,470 --> 00:43:58,839
can handle something that comes in

1058
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,130
duplicate incidents if you see the same

1059
00:43:58,839 --> 00:44:01,390
incident coming in over and over and

1060
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:05,080
over again that means there's a problem

1061
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:07,390
in your controls there you're not your

1062
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:10,230
closed loop process is broken because

1063
00:44:07,390 --> 00:44:13,240
it's not actually closing the loop

1064
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:14,950
alerts for doing threats your control

1065
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:16,810
should always be preventing known

1066
00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:19,660
threats you should never see those

1067
00:44:16,810 --> 00:44:22,450
coming into a sock and then deviation

1068
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:24,578
from soft procedures if you have these

1069
00:44:22,450 --> 00:44:27,710
procedures in place and people keep

1070
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:28,849
moving step five over here there's two

1071
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:31,730
there's two problems that this could

1072
00:44:28,849 --> 00:44:33,589
indicate one is education people just

1073
00:44:31,730 --> 00:44:35,029
aren't using the processes correctly two

1074
00:44:33,589 --> 00:44:38,029
of your processes are terrible they need

1075
00:44:35,029 --> 00:44:40,549
to be rewritten so those are things that

1076
00:44:38,029 --> 00:44:41,869
are actually going to help you be

1077
00:44:40,549 --> 00:44:47,440
confident that you can protect the

1078
00:44:41,869 --> 00:44:50,900
business so there's a quick recap

1079
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:54,460
so what's working if people do it right

1080
00:44:50,900 --> 00:45:00,170
well-defined mission in scope identify

1081
00:44:54,460 --> 00:45:03,319
investigate mitigate period we want to

1082
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:05,000
do noise reduction in the sock how do we

1083
00:45:03,319 --> 00:45:07,038
do that well prevention based

1084
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,019
architectures we've we've seen work

1085
00:45:07,039 --> 00:45:12,319
prevent it before it even gets to the

1086
00:45:09,019 --> 00:45:16,038
sock automate the mitigation if you have

1087
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:21,019
the confidence to do so if you can do

1088
00:45:16,039 --> 00:45:22,220
all that then attempt hunting don't say

1089
00:45:21,019 --> 00:45:24,319
you're gonna do hunting just because it

1090
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:26,930
sounds cool and you need an extra

1091
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:28,609
challenge on a Friday afternoon if

1092
00:45:26,930 --> 00:45:33,799
you're gonna do hunting formalize it do

1093
00:45:28,609 --> 00:45:37,279
it right full utilization of existing

1094
00:45:33,799 --> 00:45:39,019
tools so make sure that what you paid

1095
00:45:37,279 --> 00:45:40,279
for your subscription is their target

1096
00:45:39,019 --> 00:45:43,399
turned on you're actually blocking

1097
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:45,730
you're not just alerting make sure that

1098
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:47,839
you're using your tools that you bought

1099
00:45:45,730 --> 00:45:50,690
try to get it more business focus

1100
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:52,490
sometimes this is hard if you work in a

1101
00:45:50,690 --> 00:45:55,250
small organization sometimes you are on

1102
00:45:52,490 --> 00:45:57,109
that Island so you get you got to try to

1103
00:45:55,250 --> 00:46:00,079
work on that but the tighter you are at

1104
00:45:57,109 --> 00:46:02,150
the business the more you can not just

1105
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:04,880
say no and actually work with them on

1106
00:46:02,150 --> 00:46:06,859
solutions one of the people I know

1107
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:08,930
that's on their fourth iteration of

1108
00:46:06,859 --> 00:46:10,430
cloud what they've done is they've

1109
00:46:08,930 --> 00:46:13,250
worked to the business to say here's our

1110
00:46:10,430 --> 00:46:15,049
preferred cloud vendor here's all the

1111
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:17,480
services you can get from this

1112
00:46:15,049 --> 00:46:18,680
particular cloud vendor and I know that

1113
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:19,880
developers are going to want some

1114
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:23,180
feature over here and they can do that

1115
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:24,470
too but it's going to be hard okay at

1116
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:26,180
least they work to the business to come

1117
00:46:24,470 --> 00:46:31,939
up with a solution so they don't have to

1118
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:33,470
fully support - clouds - cloud vendors

1119
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:36,819
they have one that they support and one

1120
00:46:33,470 --> 00:46:36,819
that they have is extras

1121
00:46:38,390 --> 00:46:43,910
so next week define the mission of your

1122
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:47,940
sock

1123
00:46:43,910 --> 00:46:49,680
make sure it's defined in short and

1124
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:52,650
scope and make sure that the business

1125
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:53,819
actually buys into it because if you

1126
00:46:52,650 --> 00:46:55,079
just say this is what we do but they

1127
00:46:53,819 --> 00:46:58,130
expect you to do this that's not going

1128
00:46:55,079 --> 00:47:01,920
to matter so make sure they buy into it

1129
00:46:58,130 --> 00:47:03,270
second is question all your metrics see

1130
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,230
if you can actually change people away

1131
00:47:03,270 --> 00:47:06,480
from MTTR

1132
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:08,309
it's gonna be hard but you can do it

1133
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:10,530
make sure that your metrics are actually

1134
00:47:08,309 --> 00:47:12,599
telling you if you can with stain an

1135
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:13,890
attack or not because that's really what

1136
00:47:12,599 --> 00:47:15,569
we're here to do just figure out can you

1137
00:47:13,890 --> 00:47:17,879
find it can you limit it we're not going

1138
00:47:15,569 --> 00:47:19,680
to prevent an attack but you need to be

1139
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:21,359
able to prevent it spreading in your

1140
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:24,240
network and actually exfiltrating data

1141
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:27,569
that you need so preventing successful

1142
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:29,879
cyber attacks is our goal

1143
00:47:27,569 --> 00:47:33,569
evaluate your tool set use your features

1144
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:35,609
in the next six months try to go towards

1145
00:47:33,569 --> 00:47:37,799
that zero trust model that prevention

1146
00:47:35,609 --> 00:47:42,538
based architecture if you can do that

1147
00:47:37,799 --> 00:47:45,990
then move towards hunting and if they

1148
00:47:42,539 --> 00:47:47,700
let you hire hire business liaison move

1149
00:47:45,990 --> 00:47:49,618
those controls closer to what actually

1150
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:53,359
matters to the business because it's

1151
00:47:49,619 --> 00:47:55,289
usually not what we think it is so

1152
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:57,710
hopefully this has given you some

1153
00:47:55,289 --> 00:48:00,119
nuggets of information you can take back

1154
00:47:57,710 --> 00:48:01,260
we only have a couple minutes left but

1155
00:48:00,119 --> 00:48:03,480
I'll be around if you guys have

1156
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:05,690
questions and I thank you guys for your

1157
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:05,690
time

1158
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:38,450
you mean as far as the third-party

1159
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:41,480
provider of hunting I haven't seen a

1160
00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:43,430
whole lot of it I've heard about it but

1161
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:44,690
I haven't actually seen it myself so I

1162
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:46,069
can't tell you if it's a good idea or

1163
00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:48,170
bad um

1164
00:48:46,070 --> 00:48:49,490
in theory I think it would be good

1165
00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:54,020
because then you don't have to hire the

1166
00:48:49,490 --> 00:48:56,509
the skills but yeah but I haven't

1167
00:48:54,020 --> 00:49:00,670
actually seen it myself so I can't

1168
00:48:56,510 --> 00:49:00,670
answer yeah

1169
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:21,670
right yep yeah

1170
00:49:26,870 --> 00:49:34,430
yes yeah so I think if mostly so what

1171
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:36,620
what I've seen in machine learning and

1172
00:49:34,430 --> 00:49:38,419
AI is so my theory is you don't have to

1173
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:40,069
be perfect you have to be better than

1174
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:42,500
the analyst you just have to be better

1175
00:49:40,070 --> 00:49:44,330
than the human so it's so that's why I'm

1176
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:47,000
saying yes it can be successful because

1177
00:49:44,330 --> 00:49:49,700
you don't have to be perfect what I have

1178
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:51,170
seen is some of the machine learning AI

1179
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:52,819
that's trying to replace that first line

1180
00:49:51,170 --> 00:49:54,440
analyst some are actually very good and

1181
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:57,650
you can actually run them in parallel

1182
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:59,390
with you can actually run through 30

1183
00:49:57,650 --> 00:50:00,920
days of your old data and compare what

1184
00:49:59,390 --> 00:50:02,990
the Machine found against your analyst

1185
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:05,720
and and figure out if your analysts are

1186
00:50:02,990 --> 00:50:08,229
better or if the machine is better and

1187
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:08,230
so you can go with that

1188
00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:38,600
yes yes yes

1189
00:50:35,530 --> 00:50:40,550
it's possible and I've seen yeah we can

1190
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:42,970
talk later about some tools that I've

1191
00:50:40,550 --> 00:50:45,890
seen that are effective yeah

1192
00:50:42,970 --> 00:50:47,240
and I've only seen so here's why I don't

1193
00:50:45,890 --> 00:50:50,569
want to say hey this is the best tool

1194
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:52,368
ever because I've only seen a small

1195
00:50:50,570 --> 00:50:53,570
amount of socks in the world and I've

1196
00:50:52,369 --> 00:50:57,010
seen certain things work for certain

1197
00:50:53,570 --> 00:51:00,010
socks so we can talk about that later

1198
00:50:57,010 --> 00:51:00,010
yes

1199
00:51:18,050 --> 00:51:31,940
be data breach with the vendors that's

1200
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:35,690
all in your contracts I mean there's no

1201
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:37,970
automated way to handle all of that it's

1202
00:51:35,690 --> 00:51:40,580
all in your processes if I'm getting

1203
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:42,020
your question right so the way to handle

1204
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:45,110
the breach is to make sure that you have

1205
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:47,740
the right processes with your vendors is

1206
00:51:45,110 --> 00:51:47,740
that what you're asking

1207
00:51:55,770 --> 00:52:08,670
do we have any what a technical way not

1208
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:13,650
that I've seen so yes because you're

1209
00:52:08,670 --> 00:52:15,150
monitoring you can monitor you know what

1210
00:52:13,650 --> 00:52:16,680
data is flowing back and forth what data

1211
00:52:15,150 --> 00:52:18,839
is flowing to that vendor maybe you'll

1212
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:21,240
work with an MS SP but then you're

1213
00:52:18,839 --> 00:52:25,560
basically doubling the amount of work so

1214
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:27,598
you're not trusting them so I think the

1215
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:29,790
only way to do it technically is to

1216
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:31,800
double you know you're monitoring them

1217
00:52:29,790 --> 00:52:37,140
they're monitoring you and that's kind

1218
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:40,640
of a waste maybe we can talk later and

1219
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:44,490
see if I can get a better answer for you

1220
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:46,759
anyway else all right thank you guys for

1221
00:52:44,490 --> 00:52:46,759
your time
