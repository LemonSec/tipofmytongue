1
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:15,379
so I want to start off by apologizing my

2
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:18,900
first slide is not about the dangers of

3
00:00:15,379 --> 00:00:22,050
cybersecurity or what's happening or how

4
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:25,528
many attacks we had we're all cyber

5
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:28,160
professionals we know the importance of

6
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:30,420
cybersecurity that's why we're here I

7
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:34,640
want to start off by talking about

8
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:37,649
digital and what that means to cyber and

9
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:40,710
let's talk about the evolution of

10
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:44,429
cybersecurity and how and where we are

11
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:46,260
now so when we started in our cyber

12
00:00:44,429 --> 00:00:50,309
professions we were looked at as

13
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:52,019
inhibitors as an example you as a cyber

14
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:56,218
professional would show up to somebody's

15
00:00:52,019 --> 00:01:00,208
desk and they'd be like oh my god you're

16
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:02,159
gonna slow down the process really you

17
00:01:00,209 --> 00:01:05,640
mean I have to check my code before I

18
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:06,480
put it in live into production that's

19
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,170
ridiculous

20
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:13,220
I've been writing code for years anybody

21
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:18,300
familiar with that yeah

22
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:19,830
then we slowly evolved so people started

23
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:23,190
understanding that there's something

24
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:27,600
called information right and that

25
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:29,640
information has value so when they

26
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,470
thought about that then people started

27
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,710
using it and that people could use that

28
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:37,380
for nefarious reasons

29
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:42,000
so then regulation came in so we became

30
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:45,479
a necessary evil so you needed to become

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,740
compliant the auditor would show up once

32
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:53,010
a year let me tick the box do you do

33
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:54,630
this yes yes yes not that we just tick

34
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:58,710
the box some of us actually go through

35
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:59,460
the exercise but they say hey thank you

36
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:03,000
very much

37
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:08,098
you are now eyes or 27th one compliant

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,829
list whatever it is right and they come

39
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:14,268
visit you next year

40
00:02:09,829 --> 00:02:18,239
but now we are looked at as an enabler

41
00:02:14,269 --> 00:02:22,140
so I'm gonna ask a question how many of

42
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:24,840
you currently use your phone your

43
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:30,779
smartphone to pay can I see a show of

44
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:33,870
hands actually so would you do that if

45
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:37,110
you didn't think it was secure we're all

46
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:37,950
professionals here we wouldn't so what

47
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:42,470
have we done

48
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:42,470
you have just two-factor authentication

49
00:02:43,099 --> 00:02:51,359
see the change that's the change that

50
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:57,120
I'm talking about so now let's look at

51
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:59,069
some of the trends so we as DXE we've

52
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,470
talked to many clients we do our

53
00:02:59,069 --> 00:03:03,869
research and these are some of the top

54
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:06,420
trends that we've seen you know some of

55
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:08,190
them are here some of them may change

56
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:11,569
some of them be more relevant less

57
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:16,079
relevant but they're going to evolve now

58
00:03:11,569 --> 00:03:17,700
why are these important before we get

59
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:21,750
into why these are important let's talk

60
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:24,988
about business so we need to understand

61
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:28,079
the drivers of business so in business

62
00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:31,079
there are two drivers at a very high

63
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:36,450
level you're either looking to increase

64
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:39,239
revenue or decrease cost now let's look

65
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:43,349
at government in government what are you

66
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:46,349
measuring you're measuring GDP right or

67
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:50,089
we call it engagement health of a nation

68
00:03:46,349 --> 00:03:53,429
citizens those are the two measurements

69
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:57,599
so when we look at those now as cyber

70
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:59,849
professionals we look at these trends we

71
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:02,790
need to look at them through the eyes of

72
00:03:59,849 --> 00:04:08,310
those two variables whether it be

73
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:10,709
government or business so I'm going to

74
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:13,590
deep dive into some of these to further

75
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:14,819
explain what I mean by that not all of

76
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:20,579
them I'm gonna address maybe four or

77
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:26,490
five the first one is near and dear to

78
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:29,340
all our hearts basic hygiene so

79
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:32,880
it seems very simple at the top layer

80
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:34,679
but when it comes to implementing it it

81
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,199
is very difficult probably one of the

82
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:39,270
most difficult things to do and when you

83
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,759
go ass business hey can I please have

84
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:45,330
some money to do this that's example

85
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:48,449
patching can I buy a tool the response I

86
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:50,219
don't want to say as always no but not

87
00:04:48,449 --> 00:04:54,840
very well received because it's looked

88
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:56,729
at as a synced cost now how do we change

89
00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:00,138
that conversation internally

90
00:04:56,729 --> 00:05:05,630
Tinh able us to get what we need

91
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:08,490
I'm gonna take passwords as a use case

92
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:12,169
now in the opening keynote somebody said

93
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:16,759
the password is dead I agree with that

94
00:05:12,169 --> 00:05:20,068
we are competing with a smartphone yet

95
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:23,220
every three months you get a nice

96
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:26,400
reminder saying hey by the way can you

97
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:28,590
please update this password okay that's

98
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:32,190
great and if you're using more than one

99
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:35,789
system you have to do it in multiple

100
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:39,060
systems and maybe some users and I'm not

101
00:05:35,789 --> 00:05:43,590
saying we do it may decide to write that

102
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:48,060
down somewhere and if you're a super

103
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:51,359
user god help us all I don't need to

104
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:54,229
tell you about the rest so how do we

105
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,639
approach this conversation differently

106
00:05:54,229 --> 00:06:02,310
the way we approach it differently is we

107
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:06,960
say I am looking to enhance the user

108
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:10,530
experience and improve efficiency of our

109
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:15,289
employees by enabling them to log in

110
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:19,049
once into multiple systems efficiency

111
00:06:15,289 --> 00:06:22,130
drives revenue decreases cost right this

112
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:24,960
is a business conversation then you say

113
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:26,909
hey you know that there's all this cost

114
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:30,900
people are calling this how many people

115
00:06:26,909 --> 00:06:32,699
call the helpdesk asking for me to reset

116
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:36,570
the password here's how many people I

117
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:40,080
sent in love habla so if I get this

118
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:44,849
investment it will also help with that

119
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:47,099
cost then we move to the second piece

120
00:06:44,849 --> 00:06:50,639
now we start talking about cyber which

121
00:06:47,099 --> 00:06:53,310
says by the way anybody can take

122
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:56,069
anyone's password and I don't know if

123
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:58,050
they're the right people doing that but

124
00:06:56,069 --> 00:07:01,560
if I use something that's a little bit

125
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:04,289
more safe like facial recognition or

126
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:06,900
thumbprint whatever you want to use or

127
00:07:04,289 --> 00:07:09,030
two-factor authentication then I know

128
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:11,878
who's logging in what data they're

129
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:15,840
accessing and then we can prevent all

130
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:19,530
the issues from happening mr. business

131
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:23,369
owner it is not a question of if it is a

132
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:26,489
question of when so you're either gonna

133
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:29,940
incur this cost now or double the cost

134
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:32,250
should something happen because you are

135
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:35,490
going to have to pay for the remediation

136
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:39,469
and then give me what I need to enable

137
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:43,229
the business and enhance user experience

138
00:07:39,469 --> 00:07:46,409
so let's say now we have dealt with

139
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:49,830
basic hygiene what do we need to look at

140
00:07:46,409 --> 00:07:52,909
next we need to look at monitoring

141
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:56,940
making sure that the environment is safe

142
00:07:52,909 --> 00:07:59,250
so sock now we all know that sock has

143
00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:02,969
evolved from just monitoring to now

144
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:04,800
being able to respond and remediate but

145
00:08:02,969 --> 00:08:07,949
we've all had the discussion which says

146
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:10,560
hey am I going to insource am I going to

147
00:08:07,949 --> 00:08:14,009
give it to somebody I've given you all

148
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:16,139
this money it's sunk right I don't see

149
00:08:14,009 --> 00:08:17,940
the ROI and you go to him and say hey

150
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:21,060
boss now there's this thing called AI

151
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:22,919
and you know we're doing some analytics

152
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:28,050
around this I need more money to be

153
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:29,878
relevant and he tells you sorry but you

154
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:32,849
know I have a hundred use cases and I've

155
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:38,010
stopped a DDoS attack that means nothing

156
00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:43,079
to business here's how there are two use

157
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:45,089
cases that can show what this does I'm

158
00:08:43,078 --> 00:08:49,770
going to use an airport as one example

159
00:08:45,089 --> 00:08:51,410
so land in an airport come use your

160
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:54,180
password

161
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:57,270
but a thumbprint facial-recognition you

162
00:08:54,180 --> 00:09:00,000
walk and it takes you five minutes what

163
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:02,310
a great experience now what's happened

164
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,470
in the background there right this all

165
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:06,930
is fed into a machine right we can call

166
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:10,710
it a sock we can call it whatever you

167
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:12,870
want to call it and they check because

168
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:14,970
there's different inputs coming in and

169
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:18,840
they say oh this person check this

170
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:20,400
person questionable please you may need

171
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:22,920
to have a conversation somebody shows up

172
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:24,870
has a conversation with you now me as

173
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:26,760
somebody who's landed I feel comfortable

174
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:28,440
because I know this is happening in the

175
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:31,110
background and I still have a very

176
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:32,970
pleasant experience now you take that

177
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:35,310
and you compare it to an airport that

178
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:39,030
you land in and it takes you an hour and

179
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:41,459
a half to get through customs what

180
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:44,640
happens then I will guarantee you that

181
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:49,110
you will only visit that place if you

182
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:50,550
have to but where would you go you would

183
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:52,830
go to the place that takes you ten

184
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:56,599
minutes to get through customs what does

185
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:59,310
that mean for that place the airport

186
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:03,360
you're spending money there so you're

187
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:06,390
helping national carriers better maybe

188
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:09,030
tourism so you increase GDP so you see

189
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:12,390
this is an actual use case in which

190
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:14,069
you've helped increase revenue now I'm

191
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:17,189
going to take another use case with an

192
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:19,590
ATM so some banks now are thinking about

193
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:23,100
putting facial recognition in their ATM

194
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:25,110
machines so how do we do how do we take

195
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:28,680
out bank money right now from banks we

196
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:30,900
put in your card put in your code take

197
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:34,739
out money now what's the problem there

198
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:38,579
the problem there is if somebody copies

199
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:42,120
your card and gets your code guess what

200
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:45,390
good luck getting your money back you

201
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:48,120
call them you go back and forth you have

202
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:51,180
to prove there's paperwork all this cost

203
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:55,770
all this cost is going into the system

204
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:59,609
now imagine a situation where you go

205
00:10:55,770 --> 00:11:02,860
into a machine put in your card put in

206
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:05,260
your code sees your face excellent

207
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:09,820
here you go here's your money what does

208
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:12,760
that do that removes part of that cost

209
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:16,960
from the system now what's the second

210
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:20,110
piece of that safety so let's say for an

211
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:21,870
example there's somebody behind you that

212
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:26,080
is forcing you to pull that money out

213
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:29,890
now because of AI okay and using

214
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:33,520
analytics the machine is smart enough to

215
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:35,110
say this person is not authorized so I'm

216
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:36,430
not going to give you money it sees your

217
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:38,230
face it recognizes you but it also

218
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:39,910
recognizes the person standing behind

219
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:42,580
you and says I'm not gonna give you

220
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:45,360
money so what does that create that

221
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:48,630
creates a safer environment around you

222
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:51,580
so how does that help the bank

223
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:53,890
you then go you're a happy person you're

224
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:56,250
a happy customer you go to all the

225
00:11:53,890 --> 00:12:00,460
people and say hey this is secure

226
00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:04,990
increase revenue as we're talking about

227
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:07,480
money we need to talk about crypto but

228
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:09,130
before we get into crypto and we need to

229
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:13,320
talk about the basics of it so let me

230
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:13,320
just address box chain really quick just

231
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:20,710
high-level blockchain is an auditable

232
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:23,860
ledger why is that important for us in

233
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:28,180
cyber it's important for us in cyber

234
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:30,310
because of use cases so in a very high

235
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:32,859
level what we need to worry about is is

236
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:35,589
the code secure and can somebody drop

237
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:38,020
something in the middle of the chain now

238
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:43,080
let's get into the meat and potatoes

239
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:45,760
which is the use case crypto currency I

240
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:49,390
am NOT going to debate if crypto

241
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:52,750
currency exists or doesn't exist but

242
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:55,540
what I say is that currency is known as

243
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:58,450
something of value that you're willing

244
00:12:55,540 --> 00:13:01,810
to accept in exchange for goods and

245
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:05,830
services and since people have accepted

246
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:10,030
crypto as a medium of exchange that

247
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:13,960
means it exists so why is that important

248
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:15,430
for us as cyber professionals

249
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:18,550
it's important to us a cyber

250
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:24,969
professionals because this impacts the

251
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:28,060
basic foundation of banking banking is

252
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:31,270
based on underwriting what is

253
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:35,920
underwriting it means that me as an

254
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:38,140
individual when I go to a bank and I put

255
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:42,310
my money in there if somebody steals my

256
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:47,199
identity and I can prove that they're

257
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:50,380
supposed to pay me back but what happens

258
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:53,790
in crypto if somebody steals your

259
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:57,939
identity in crypto nobody pays you back

260
00:13:53,790 --> 00:14:02,620
so where's the value the value is your

261
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:04,450
identity so now a cyber professionals we

262
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:07,899
need to change the way we're looking at

263
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:10,480
it not only do we need to protect the

264
00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:15,190
company but we also need to protect the

265
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:17,080
individuals so when you get asked as a

266
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:19,870
cyber professional because you will be

267
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:22,870
asked as a cyber professional should we

268
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:25,420
as an organization accept cryptocurrency

269
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:28,089
as a currency or not let's go back to

270
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:31,089
the fundamentals so increase revenue

271
00:14:28,089 --> 00:14:34,660
decrease cost your answer should be yes

272
00:14:31,089 --> 00:14:36,940
or no if your answer is yes you should

273
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:41,860
say yes because I'm trying to enable you

274
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:44,110
to increase your revenue so this is

275
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:48,430
another revenue stream so what we need

276
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:52,209
to ensure is that our clients are secure

277
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:55,449
so we need funding for that if you say

278
00:14:52,209 --> 00:14:58,420
no you need to say because the risk is

279
00:14:55,450 --> 00:15:01,180
too high we might have to underwrite and

280
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:04,300
so therefore risk versus reward cost

281
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:08,579
might be high so the answer to that is

282
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:12,339
known now as we're talking about

283
00:15:08,579 --> 00:15:14,949
protecting people I want to talk about

284
00:15:12,339 --> 00:15:19,540
cyber warfare I think it's very

285
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:24,830
important recently there's been a change

286
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:28,260
in warfare previously

287
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:32,760
you need to attack multiple locations to

288
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:35,910
impact multiple things but now you can

289
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:40,050
attack one thing and impact multiple

290
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:42,810
locations and multiple people so think

291
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:49,740
about that for a second what does that

292
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:52,439
do that now means that if I am in an

293
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:54,210
industry that basically is looking to do

294
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:58,050
harm this is where I'm going to put my

295
00:15:54,210 --> 00:16:01,380
investment that's where I can get the

296
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:02,939
maximum damage so if we look at a

297
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:04,800
business what are you worried about

298
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:07,350
you're worried about people stealing

299
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,810
your IP right or you're worried about

300
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:11,700
you know your competitors ruining your

301
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:15,030
reputation so a loss in revenue but

302
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:17,000
that's not what I want to focus on what

303
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:20,550
I want to focus on our citizens and

304
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:24,120
protecting them so I want to talk about

305
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:30,240
Maslow's hierarchy of needs in the

306
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:36,600
second rule it's security and cyber

307
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:38,190
security is now part of security and why

308
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:41,400
is it important for people to feel

309
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:43,020
secure it's important for people to feel

310
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:45,720
secure because they need to get to the

311
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:48,360
third level which is basically feel

312
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:53,240
empowered and feel that they a sense of

313
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:55,560
belonging to an environment so now I

314
00:16:53,240 --> 00:17:00,510
want to bring this to a live use case

315
00:16:55,560 --> 00:17:03,599
and just touch on it very lightly what

316
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:07,470
happened last week in Singapore was some

317
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:11,670
people decided to take information in

318
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:14,400
the healthcare so what does that do we

319
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:18,180
as citizens now say I'm not I'm not

320
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:22,170
gonna give you my data but look at the

321
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:25,050
cost of that some of that data I've used

322
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:29,550
correctly can start predicting for

323
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:32,460
citizens okay if there are diseases or

324
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:34,440
if you know most of the if we're seeing

325
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:36,600
an epidemic in a certain play

326
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:39,049
or let's say we say hey there's a high

327
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:41,610
cholesterol as citizens so as an

328
00:17:39,049 --> 00:17:44,190
organization as a as a government we can

329
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:46,860
start addressing these things very early

330
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:52,129
on and preventing them but if we don't

331
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:58,519
give the data then we don't enable that

332
00:17:52,129 --> 00:17:58,519
so I would ask you to continue trusting

333
00:17:59,509 --> 00:18:05,009

334
00:18:01,889 --> 00:18:08,939

337
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:20,370
understand the business drivers and to

338
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:23,159
enable them if you are a cyber

339
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:27,000
professional in that in the government

340
00:18:23,159 --> 00:18:30,840
sector our goal is to ensure that our

341
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:35,100

343
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:41,929
