1
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:17,990
good morning thanks for coming along for

2
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:20,930
the session bright and early on on the

3
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:23,839
second day here so my name is Mike

4
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:24,650
Santos VP Technology Strategy for

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,140
CrowdStrike

6
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:28,939
I am based in this part of the world

7
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:31,040
I've spent most of my time in this part

8
00:00:28,939 --> 00:00:33,560
of the world so try to bring in a few

9
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:35,750
examples as we talk about what's going

10
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:38,930
on throughout Asia Pacific but I'll give

11
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:42,050
you a global view of a number of things

12
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:45,140
that are happening typically I like to

13
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:48,379
kind of do a little bit of setting the

14
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:50,810
scene talking about the issues framing

15
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:53,300
the problem as such and then starting to

16
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:55,490
dive into a few specific examples and

17
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:57,890
hopefully leave you with a few

18
00:00:55,490 --> 00:01:00,020
suggestions as to how to better secure

19
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:02,900
your organization so I'll use real-world

20
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:05,449
examples as we go through this and take

21
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:09,470
you through my presentation which is

22
00:01:05,449 --> 00:01:16,689
talking about let me see if I can get

23
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:16,689
this slide to work maybe not

24
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:24,510
can we just get a slightly different

25
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:27,680
clique up there we go no all right let's

26
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:30,660
go back good start with the PowerPoint

27
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:33,240
so the session will be blurred lines

28
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:34,979
between cybercrime and statecraft and

29
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,440
really what I want to talk about is the

30
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:41,729
environment where threat actors today

31
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:43,830
are totally intertwined when we think

32
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:45,780
about the types of issues that people

33
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:47,940
face when I speak to a lot of

34
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:50,880
organizations many people do say to me

35
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:52,920
you know I'm a small organization or I'm

36
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,390
an aviation company why would a state

37
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,860
act or one a time with me

38
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:57,720
and one of the things that I do want to

39
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:00,180
talk a little bit about is debunk a

40
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:03,240
little bit of that and talk about how

41
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:05,820
this ecosystem is just so interconnected

42
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:09,000
and give a number of examples as we go

43
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:11,340
through this as promised a little bit of

44
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,470
a asia-pacific view I love to use

45
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:15,390
examples from across the industry for

46
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:18,420
many different analysts and researchers

47
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:20,730
and a couple of months ago here in

48
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:22,670
asia-pacific it was great to see some

49
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:26,130
research that came from Frost & Sullivan

50
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:28,920
that try to scope the size of the

51
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:31,680
problem and ultimately the risk that we

52
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,700
face by cyberattacks in the asia-pacific

53
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,040
region

54
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,510
this is a massive number according to

55
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,410
the research that Frost & Sullivan

56
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:43,620
carried out they believe that cyber

57
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:47,820
incidents could account for 4 7% of GDP

58
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:51,360
across the region about 1.75 trillion

59
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:52,950
dollars now we can debate the number we

60
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,450
can argue whether it should be smaller

61
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:57,298
we can hug you whether it should be

62
00:02:54,450 --> 00:03:00,109
large or in fact if it's correct the

63
00:02:57,299 --> 00:03:02,579
point that I would stress on is it is a

64
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:05,370
significantly huge number that continues

65
00:03:02,579 --> 00:03:08,910
to grow and probably will continue to

66
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:11,010
grow for the foreseeable future the

67
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:15,989
question that I'd ask everybody to think

68
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:18,630
about is collectively as a community are

69
00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:20,670
we prepared your organization's do you

70
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:22,920
feel you're prepared with the types of

71
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:24,569
issues that are happening are you aware

72
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:27,149
of the issue

73
00:03:24,569 --> 00:03:29,069
and an opportunity like this it's good

74
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:32,250
to start to use a few and talk about a

75
00:03:29,069 --> 00:03:34,980
few of the examples to try to understand

76
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:38,120
what the adversaries are doing so you

77
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:40,409
can prepare to defend against them I

78
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,599
thought it would be needs to start to

79
00:03:40,409 --> 00:03:44,608
talk a little bit about nation-state

80
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:47,819
attackers II crime actors hacktivists

81
00:03:44,609 --> 00:03:50,340
etc and start to understand the

82
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:52,828
tradecraft and and ultimately what

83
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:54,540
they're doing but before I do that one

84
00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:58,349
of the things that I do want to sort of

85
00:03:54,540 --> 00:04:00,599
touch on very quickly is we need to stop

86
00:03:58,349 --> 00:04:04,589
thinking about security the way we

87
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:06,659
always have one example is thinking that

88
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:09,500
attackers always use malware I'm gonna

89
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:13,019
talk a lot about that another example is

90
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:14,879
thinking that I'm an organization in New

91
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:17,430
Zealand or I'm an organization in

92
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:20,250
Malaysia you know why would I State Act

93
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:23,099
that want to target me and I'm gonna use

94
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:25,139
examples to highlight that you may

95
00:04:23,099 --> 00:04:28,800
actually find yourself in a scenario

96
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:30,780
where you are attacked or you are the

97
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,020
victim of a technique that was once

98
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:35,820
designed by a state-based actor how many

99
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:38,609
people have heard of the concept of the

100
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:39,630
trickle-down effect so a couple of

101
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:41,610
people are nodding and putting their

102
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:43,469
hands up it's quite interesting to think

103
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:45,750
about the trickle-down effect in

104
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:48,000
relation to security and threats that

105
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:49,560
were talking about this morning the

106
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,949
trickle-down effect is where technology

107
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:55,740
that was once developed and designed by

108
00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:58,590
the government as an example very very

109
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:01,320
quickly finds its way into large

110
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:03,270
enterprise and over time starts to come

111
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:06,570
down to small business find its way into

112
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:08,280
consumers what's one example of the

113
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:10,770
trickle-down effect in terms of

114
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:15,150
technology that we rely on every day

115
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:17,820
GPS think not long ago GPS was not a

116
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:21,539
luxury that we had in our cars we

117
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:23,340
couldn't use grab to pick a book a car

118
00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:26,460
to come to our front door and then take

119
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:28,500
us to our destination as an example we

120
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:31,120
kind of expect it today you buy a phone

121
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:33,880
etc GPS is

122
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,889
there for us what's an example of the

123
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:38,199
trickle-down effect as it relates to

124
00:05:35,889 --> 00:05:41,199
cybersecurity what's an example of an

125
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:43,389
attack over the last 12 to 18 months

126
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:47,040
where the trickle-down effect has

127
00:05:43,389 --> 00:05:47,040
impacted all of us in some way

128
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:55,030
absolutely wherever they came from a

129
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:58,090
hundred percent want to cry there we go

130
00:05:55,030 --> 00:06:00,580
what a cry is a classic example think

131
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:04,060
back you know how time flies want to cry

132
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:07,030
May of last year May of last year we had

133
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:10,500
this massive global event wanna cry was

134
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:12,549
a direct result from data leakage that

135
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:15,100
resulted in the eternal blue

136
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:17,080
vulnerability becoming public want to

137
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:21,940
try leveraged a number of techniques

138
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:25,659
that came from government effectively it

139
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:29,289
was operationalized by an actor that was

140
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:32,199
state-based unfortunately it's an event

141
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:34,990
that impacted everybody across the world

142
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:36,820
shortly after what was the the next

143
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:39,520
version we had not picture if you

144
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:43,419
remember in June just slightly over a

145
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:48,180
year ago where an attack attributed

146
00:06:43,419 --> 00:06:50,169
today to to Russia targeted people

147
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:52,660
specific users of the medaka

148
00:06:50,169 --> 00:06:55,150
applications but an example of an attack

149
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:56,380
that just spread aggressively impacted

150
00:06:55,150 --> 00:07:00,580
people around the world there's an

151
00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:02,409
example of the trickle-down effect the

152
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:06,880
point that I'm making here is think of

153
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:09,729
this example as attackers starting to

154
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:12,250
leverage some of the intelligence that

155
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:14,020
was leaked some of the vulnerability

156
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:15,789
information there have been very

157
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:19,630
opportunistic to leverage those

158
00:07:15,789 --> 00:07:21,659
techniques to carry out attacks now what

159
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:24,909
happens when you have a situation

160
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:27,490
whereby the whole world is starting to

161
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:30,610
get impacted by a number of attacks

162
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:32,110
wanna cry was hugely successful from the

163
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:34,889
perspective of the attacker

164
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:38,020
not picture some what are even more

165
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:38,380
successful people start to sit up and

166
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:41,560
listen

167
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:43,430
attackers start to think about how they

168
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,940
can operationalize those technique

169
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:50,720
to use it for their malicious purposes

170
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:53,060
so actors are huge innovators bad actors

171
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:56,300
are huge innovators but they are also

172
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:59,630
replicators they use a lot of techniques

173
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:02,510
that have been used over the years what

174
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:05,600
seemingly works will be repurposed in

175
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:08,599
many different ways so we've seen in the

176
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:13,670
last 12 months so even in the last three

177
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:16,280
to six months we've seen a huge focus

178
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:18,050
and continued focus on attacks a very

179
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:21,130
high-profile attack

180
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:23,630
I'm sure yesterday we heard many

181
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:25,730
conversations around sea health I would

182
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:27,680
imagine for the next few weeks we'll be

183
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:30,020
hearing a lot more about seeing health

184
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:33,020
I'm not going to speculate on that we'll

185
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:34,760
let that investigation continue but

186
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:36,500
we've seen examples where attackers

187
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,809
continue to focus on intelligence

188
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:41,000
gathering campaigns we've seen a

189
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:44,569
continued examples where people are

190
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,840
focused on raising currency raising

191
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:51,230
funds effectively there's been examples

192
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:53,480
out of it out of South America Banco de

193
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:55,790
Chile was targeted with a swift based

194
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:58,160
attack similar techniques to what we've

195
00:08:55,790 --> 00:09:00,050
seen in previous Swift based attacks

196
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:03,290
which have been attributed to North

197
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:06,560
Korea as an example and we continue to

198
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:10,069
see more and more evidence of attackers

199
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:12,920
focusing on the supply chain focusing on

200
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:16,340
somewhat of a weaker link and perceived

201
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:21,949
weaker link to carry out their their

202
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:25,340
attacks let me touch on quickly a huge

203
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:28,610
focus over the last 12 to 18 months

204
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:31,220
which is state-sponsored ransomware

205
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:34,160
where a number of nation-states have

206
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:39,500
been behind the use of some very very

207
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:41,569
well crafted well developed campaigns

208
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,820
that ultimately focus on the use or

209
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:46,070
leverage the use of Iran

210
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:48,680
somewhere this is an interesting area to

211
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:51,890
look at because ransomware actually is a

212
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:55,250
category somewhat has declined over the

213
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:58,730
last one to two years we haven't seen

214
00:09:55,250 --> 00:10:01,670
massive attack campaigns repeated attack

215
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:06,800
campaigns but what we've seen is very

216
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:09,949
very targeted focus campaigns that have

217
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,510
had significant damage so this is

218
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:14,660
something that we need to kind of think

219
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:17,090
about an area that I believe we need to

220
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:18,770
talk about because a lot of these attack

221
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:21,620
campaigns have been extremely

222
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:24,380
destructive in nature so even though we

223
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:26,660
may not see the frequency we all need to

224
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:29,000
be thinking about what is the evolution

225
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:31,370
of one okay what's the next version of a

226
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,660
not picture because what I would argue

227
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:37,460
is we may not be as prepared to deal

228
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:39,709
with those scenarios we may not have

229
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:42,020
taken the learnings from those examples

230
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:43,010
and applied them in a way that makes us

231
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:46,150
secure and I'm going to give you a

232
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:48,860
couple of examples as to why I say that

233
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:50,900
specifically attackers continue to reuse

234
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:53,120
these techniques and they're continuing

235
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:56,750
to be successful what does that mean

236
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,220
we're not patchy we're not necessarily

237
00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:02,840
aware of all of the machines that we

238
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:05,240
have across the network and we are still

239
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:06,560
not leveraging technology to defend

240
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:09,370
against these techniques or the

241
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:11,569
technology that we use maybe isn't

242
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:14,240
deployed correctly or doing a good

243
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:18,530
enough job so a couple of interesting

244
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:22,070
examples to touch on there's been a huge

245
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:25,310
number of state-sponsored ransomware

246
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:30,530
attacks over the last twelve or so

247
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:31,819
months you can see here a couple of ones

248
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:34,370
that I've highlighted that I've already

249
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:36,770
talked about so far wanna try and not

250
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:39,860
picture another one which was

251
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:42,770
interesting the back end of last year

252
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:45,380
was bad Robert creatively named bad

253
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:49,310
Robert you can imagine all the pictures

254
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:51,829
that were used in presentations post

255
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:55,699
the release of bad rabbit a psychopathic

256
00:11:51,829 --> 00:11:58,969
rabbit and causing chaos but linked to

257
00:11:55,699 --> 00:12:01,639
to Russia some of these attacks have

258
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:03,769
been quite destructive interestingly

259
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:06,499
some of these attacks were not

260
00:12:03,769 --> 00:12:09,850
destructive in nature you could recover

261
00:12:06,499 --> 00:12:12,980
so it's a very interesting complex

262
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:15,110
environment to research but obviously we

263
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:18,769
don't have time to be in too much this

264
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:21,610
morning now what happens when you've got

265
00:12:18,769 --> 00:12:25,189
a number of these state-based attacks

266
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:27,529
that are extremely successful who else

267
00:12:25,189 --> 00:12:31,248
wakes up and starts to think about this

268
00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:33,470
a crime actors suddenly think I'm gonna

269
00:12:31,249 --> 00:12:35,809
do the same thing because I know it can

270
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:38,449
work what's the motivation behind an e

271
00:12:35,809 --> 00:12:41,360
crime actor using the same technique if

272
00:12:38,449 --> 00:12:44,899
I'm going to develop ransomware why

273
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:48,019
focus on using a pretty commoditized

274
00:12:44,899 --> 00:12:51,439
technique and ask the the targeted

275
00:12:48,019 --> 00:12:53,959
victim for $200 when I can use a complex

276
00:12:51,439 --> 00:12:59,269
attack that I know works and ask an

277
00:12:53,959 --> 00:13:01,699
organization for $50,000 makes sense to

278
00:12:59,269 --> 00:13:03,319
try to monetize somebody else's good

279
00:13:01,699 --> 00:13:06,559
work which is effectively what we

280
00:13:03,319 --> 00:13:09,319
continue to see think about the first

281
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:12,290
six months of this year and what I would

282
00:13:09,319 --> 00:13:16,040
say is the maturing of enterprise

283
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:18,920
ransomware we've seen across the

284
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:20,899
industry a huge number of examples in

285
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:23,809
the last two years certainly in the last

286
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:26,750
two years where attackers are focusing

287
00:13:23,809 --> 00:13:29,240
on in many cases of the u.s. what I

288
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:32,899
would say what I would call the public

289
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:35,179
safety network across the u.s. fire

290
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:37,459
brigade and ambulance etc etc and

291
00:13:35,179 --> 00:13:39,679
attackers are trying to leverage a lot

292
00:13:37,459 --> 00:13:41,479
of these techniques to carry out their

293
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:44,389
attacks and hold their victims to a

294
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:47,209
higher ransom the example one particular

295
00:13:44,389 --> 00:13:49,160
group we call it across the industry Sam

296
00:13:47,209 --> 00:13:53,779
Sam or the technique that they use is

297
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:56,839
I am ransomware city of Atlanta city of

298
00:13:53,779 --> 00:14:00,949
Baltimore both become have been targeted

299
00:13:56,839 --> 00:14:02,959
and the damage has been huge some of the

300
00:14:00,949 --> 00:14:06,139
press reports talked about so far

301
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:07,989
incident response cleanup exceeding two

302
00:14:06,139 --> 00:14:11,149
and a half to three million US dollars

303
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:13,430
trying to recover from that attack where

304
00:14:11,149 --> 00:14:16,730
the attackers were asking for in excess

305
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:20,410
of fifty thousand US dollars the

306
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:23,089
techniques largely are based on similar

307
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:27,620
exploits similar vulnerabilities that we

308
00:14:23,089 --> 00:14:31,040
saw in early part of 2017 and even today

309
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:33,259
it at the back end of July we continue

310
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,449
to see attackers trying to use these

311
00:14:33,259 --> 00:14:39,110
techniques and let's just call it out

312
00:14:35,449 --> 00:14:40,758
those techniques are working again think

313
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:43,209
through what this means from an

314
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:46,790
operational security perspective Lee

315
00:14:43,209 --> 00:14:49,189
we're not keeping up and and dealing and

316
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:53,029
mitigating some of those issues and some

317
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:56,709
of those threats who else thinks about

318
00:14:53,029 --> 00:14:59,569
this other a crime actors that focus on

319
00:14:56,709 --> 00:15:01,130
crypto type attacks are starting to

320
00:14:59,569 --> 00:15:03,439
think a lot about some of these

321
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:06,459
techniques as well one particular

322
00:15:03,439 --> 00:15:09,230
example is a lot of the attacks on

323
00:15:06,459 --> 00:15:13,670
Manero as a crypto currency Manero

324
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:16,579
Manero hasn't had the same you know

325
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:19,370
lofty heights as say for example Bitcoin

326
00:15:16,579 --> 00:15:22,939
but it is one of the top traded crypto

327
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:25,819
currencies somewhat more stable but

328
00:15:22,939 --> 00:15:29,149
what's interesting about Manero is that

329
00:15:25,819 --> 00:15:32,889
there is a huge number of attackers that

330
00:15:29,149 --> 00:15:35,360
are focusing on leveraging eternal blue

331
00:15:32,889 --> 00:15:37,220
vulnerabilities they're leveraging on

332
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,559
spreading their attacks using PowerShell

333
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:43,699
and WMI they're trying to mined for

334
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:46,100
crypto currencies and and raise funds a

335
00:15:43,699 --> 00:15:49,339
couple of examples that I've looked at

336
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:52,149
in the Asia Pacific region they're

337
00:15:49,339 --> 00:15:55,759
hugely successful attack campaigns and

338
00:15:52,149 --> 00:15:57,230
most security software simply doesn't

339
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,120
detect it a few reasons

340
00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:00,720
the attackers continue to change the

341
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:04,410
techniques they continue to

342
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:06,300
continually evolved the tool that they

343
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:09,020
use and you can see there that

344
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:11,790
screenshot that I put the box around

345
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:15,530
according to some research of some

346
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:18,000
attacks that I looked at only 13 of 68

347
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:19,860
engines that were on virus virus total

348
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,110
at the time had the ability to detect

349
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:24,930
these techniques several days after they

350
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:27,480
were released again a classic reason as

351
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:30,089
to why attacks continue to happen for

352
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:34,950
whatever reason attackers are outpacing

353
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:36,720
some of the prevention technologies now

354
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:41,580
I touched on this earlier the the other

355
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:44,670
I guess ideal that I want to challenge

356
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:48,960
as an industry we talk so much about

357
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:52,020
malware looking at a lot of the talks at

358
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:53,970
RSA this week looking at a lot of

359
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:56,730
discussions that have happened at events

360
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:59,640
so far this year we talked about zero

361
00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:02,810
days we talked about apts and largely

362
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:06,000
our focus always comes down to malware

363
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:09,208
attackers don't think that way attackers

364
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,130
think about their ultimate goal what

365
00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:14,189
they're trying to achieve if they're

366
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:16,920
focused on carrying out espionage to get

367
00:17:14,189 --> 00:17:19,320
to get information from a Defense

368
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:21,360
Department that's their goal they will

369
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:23,609
use whatever tool is available to them

370
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:26,729
to be successful in achieving their

371
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:29,010
desired outcome any crime actor again is

372
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:30,990
trying to raise money they don't start

373
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:34,950
off thinking about creating malware

374
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:38,130
that's just one example we need to think

375
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:40,020
as defenders about all of the tools and

376
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:42,600
techniques the tradecraft that these

377
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:45,570
adversaries will use otherwise we'll

378
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:48,120
find ourselves exposed and I'm going to

379
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:50,520
go through a few examples that are

380
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:53,000
currently being used and I'm going to

381
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:55,070
tend to focus on example

382
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,580
where the attackers are not using

383
00:17:55,070 --> 00:18:02,210
exploits why because I want you to think

384
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:03,980
about the fact that maybe our security

385
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:06,260
architectures that we're all deploying

386
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:08,120
are focused on looking for malware and

387
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:10,340
attackers aren't actually thinking that

388
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:12,409
way which could lead to a compromised

389
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:14,899
inside your organization so I'll use

390
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:17,150
some real world techniques as I go

391
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:20,870
through this and leave you with some

392
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:25,820
examples as to how to defend against

393
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:27,919
some of these techniques so I'm gonna

394
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:30,590
use some techniques from some of the

395
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:35,200
adversaries that you see here we track

396
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:38,389
over 100 adversaries that are focused on

397
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:41,660
a crime activity hacktivists

398
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:43,990
state based actors we try to give them a

399
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:47,180
name so you can remember who they are

400
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:50,060
you see there for example fancy bear out

401
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:53,060
of Russia state based actor spiders

402
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:55,429
being a crime actors the goal is to

403
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:57,860
ensure that you can remember who they

404
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:58,940
are at least where they come from as you

405
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:01,639
start to think about how you

406
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:04,400
operationalize your your threat

407
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:08,780
intelligence and cybersecurity programs

408
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:11,120
the one that I will start off with which

409
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:13,520
is a great place to start is Prudential

410
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:16,280
theft this is something that attackers

411
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:18,800
have been doing for 20 plus years

412
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:22,340
attackers have been trying to steal

413
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:24,680
credentials because having credentials

414
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:27,860
means that they can authenticate

415
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:31,160
themselves to a network and act as a

416
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:34,340
legitimate trusted user how many people

417
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:37,040
are hunting for legitimate users in the

418
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:39,530
network who maybe are executing

419
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:42,530
legitimate commands what users would do

420
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:44,330
day-to-day probably not many and that's

421
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:45,770
the ultimate goal of attackers how have

422
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:48,290
they done it many different techniques

423
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:49,790
over the last couple of decades over the

424
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:51,950
last few years we've seen one of the

425
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:52,639
most common ones which is the use of of

426
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:55,460
mini cats

427
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,240
many different versions of mini cats

428
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:58,670
many

429
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,650
many different ways of of downloading

430
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:03,650
mini cats with the ultimate goal of

431
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:07,640
getting a username and password to allow

432
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:11,150
them to act as a as a trusted insider

433
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:14,450
but there's a huge number of ways that

434
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:17,440
an attacker could capture credentials

435
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:20,120
and there's just constant credential

436
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:23,870
stealing campaigns that are that are

437
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:25,419
always happening always occurring so one

438
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:28,159
example that I want to talk through

439
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:30,770
somewhat of an oldie but a goodie with a

440
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:33,950
few slight twists and updates into the

441
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:36,650
way that they work here's an example

442
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:40,340
where there is no exploit used at all

443
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:42,650
the attackers are effectively leveraging

444
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:45,139
the way the operating system works the

445
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:48,350
way Windows works in this particular

446
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:51,830
example they're leveraging SMB to

447
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:52,520
effectively capture ntlm hashes to store

448
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:54,919
them offline

449
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:57,410
to use a lot of processing power to

450
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,970
crack them and then they have access to

451
00:20:57,410 --> 00:21:01,520
credentials so they can then obviously

452
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:04,190
log in and do other things how does this

453
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:06,710
particular attack work pretty

454
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:09,860
straightforward the attacker will in

455
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:11,809
most cases compromised a website you can

456
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:14,629
do this by sending a targeted email

457
00:21:11,809 --> 00:21:16,340
what's the difference if I want to

458
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:19,670
target particular a particular vertical

459
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:21,980
as an example if I want to target

460
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:24,800
logistics or aviation in this part of

461
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:27,260
the world I'll create a website or I'll

462
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:30,050
compromise a website that a lot of

463
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:33,320
people go to so I've got a huge audience

464
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:34,610
to capture a lot of ntlm hashes or if I

465
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:37,550
want to be very targeted to an

466
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:40,219
organization or an individual I may use

467
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:41,690
an email campaign to do this but

468
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:45,650
effectively what you're trying to do is

469
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:49,160
get a visitor an internet user to

470
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:53,900
connect to an infected website from that

471
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:55,760
point what you're doing is using SMB

472
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:57,920
you're using your you're storing a

473
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:00,650
legitimate image on that particular

474
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:03,260
website it's hosted on the site and

475
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:06,590
you're using file colon slash slash or

476
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:10,279
SMB colon slash slash which the

477
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:12,110
the machine will return the ntlm hash

478
00:22:10,279 --> 00:22:15,620
that's the way the operating system

479
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:18,139
works and then you have that information

480
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:20,209
that you then need to to to crack

481
00:22:18,139 --> 00:22:22,129
overtime there's a couple of variations

482
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:23,509
to this the example that I've talked

483
00:22:22,129 --> 00:22:24,649
about is something that's been around

484
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:27,049
for quite a while

485
00:22:24,649 --> 00:22:29,779
again the attackers innovate a couple of

486
00:22:27,049 --> 00:22:32,658
different ways that they innovate they

487
00:22:29,779 --> 00:22:35,240
use JavaScript obfuscate the traffic or

488
00:22:32,659 --> 00:22:37,340
a time obfuscate their technique or they

489
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:38,899
use tiny image tiny image is a classic

490
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:41,449
one because you've got a two by two by

491
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:43,279
pixel that you put on the page you're

492
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:45,980
not going to see that amongst everything

493
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:49,249
on a webpage and the use of visiting the

494
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:52,249
website the ntlm hash comes back or

495
00:22:49,249 --> 00:22:55,730
hidden jquery's as an example to carry

496
00:22:52,249 --> 00:22:58,820
out that attack so how do we see this

497
00:22:55,730 --> 00:23:02,899
used we've seen a number of adversaries

498
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:06,759
over certainly active from April of last

499
00:23:02,899 --> 00:23:10,610
year that have built campaigns to

500
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:12,889
capture and harvest credentials from

501
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:15,408
many different sectors many different

502
00:23:12,889 --> 00:23:17,059
verticals one particular actor out of

503
00:23:15,409 --> 00:23:18,950
Russia that we've been tracking we've

504
00:23:17,059 --> 00:23:21,408
called the Duke they're based on the way

505
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:25,999
that they operate and they've targeted a

506
00:23:21,409 --> 00:23:27,830
number of sectors capturing ntlm hashes

507
00:23:25,999 --> 00:23:31,460
and then effectively trying to crack

508
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:34,610
those to carry out additional attacks no

509
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:36,440
exploit is used if the security

510
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:38,119
countermeasures we use are looking for

511
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:42,019
an exploit they would fail in this

512
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:43,999
particular example again attackers

513
00:23:42,019 --> 00:23:45,740
innovate they get smarter they start to

514
00:23:43,999 --> 00:23:47,779
think about what other tools are

515
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:50,749
available inside the enterprise that

516
00:23:47,779 --> 00:23:52,879
they can exploit to be a little bit more

517
00:23:50,749 --> 00:23:55,279
creative in the way that they use an

518
00:23:52,879 --> 00:23:58,908
age-old technique in this particular

519
00:23:55,279 --> 00:24:00,440
example like to use word now words got

520
00:23:58,909 --> 00:24:02,809
some interesting functionality maybe

521
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:04,639
some people aren't aware of but the way

522
00:24:02,809 --> 00:24:07,970
of word works is you've got a you've got

523
00:24:04,639 --> 00:24:10,158
a document template when you open word

524
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:12,679
word opens and loads a document template

525
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:16,639
one of the features of word is the

526
00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:18,560
ability to store the document document

527
00:24:16,639 --> 00:24:21,860
template on a network

528
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:24,320
including on the internet so you open up

529
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:25,909
word word will download if it's a

530
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:30,050
network share regardless of where that

531
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:33,110
network is word will download the normal

532
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:36,230
template and within normal dot dot what

533
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:39,260
you can do is actually put the details

534
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:41,030
so I went too fast there under where

535
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:43,520
you'll see normal dot highlighted

536
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:47,149
further down you'll see the IP address

537
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:50,150
of the host and just by opening a word

538
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:52,970
document the word will go off to the

539
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:56,630
website will actually share the ntlm

540
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:59,330
hash with the attacker again no exploit

541
00:24:56,630 --> 00:25:03,500
is just using the tools and the features

542
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:06,110
that they have with malicious intent so

543
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:08,570
what happens as mentioned a couple times

544
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:10,879
offline hash cracking obviously there's

545
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:13,240
a lot of processing power that we will

546
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,920
have access to today as do attackers

547
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:18,230
they use pass the hash tools as an

548
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:20,690
example and where we see this most

549
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:24,290
actively exploited is with public facing

550
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:26,930
services using webmail and remote

551
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:29,540
conferencing software example and this

552
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:31,610
is something that is it is currently

553
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:35,420
active and it's a very very successful

554
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:38,240
technique let's like to talk about

555
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:41,980
countermeasures the biggest thing that

556
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:44,810
we need to just all keep pushing forward

557
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:47,570
even if it's complex in certain

558
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:50,710
scenarios is to leverage multi-factor

559
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:53,240
authentication and other authentication

560
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:56,450
methods beyond username and passwords

561
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:58,820
that would go a long way to solving in

562
00:25:56,450 --> 00:26:02,330
this particular example monitor SMB

563
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:05,540
connectivity certainly remotely even

564
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:09,080
restricted where possible to remote

565
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:10,610
sources if you if you need to again when

566
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:12,500
you're talking about credential theft

567
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:15,169
and people that are trying to crack

568
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:17,150
credentials complex passwords long

569
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:20,510
passwords good password hygiene

570
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:22,420
obviously critically important and even

571
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:24,490
do things like monitor remote you

572
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:27,190
authentication and have thread

573
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:31,660
intelligence to stay on top of what the

574
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:34,150
latest SMB see two sites are which is

575
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:37,450
critically important again no mal I want

576
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:39,700
to keep stressing that point because a

577
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:41,530
countermeasure technology that's looking

578
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:48,490
for those types of attacks simply aren't

579
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:51,190
going to help you so I'm big fan of this

580
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:54,070
one I do like this next example because

581
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:56,050
you know how does how do we respond to

582
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:57,669
attacks as an industry and users of

583
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:59,980
technology how have you responded to

584
00:26:57,670 --> 00:27:02,290
attacks over the last sort of four to

585
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:04,600
seven years people have really been

586
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:06,010
trying to battle their way through

587
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:08,620
whitelisting technology

588
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:10,629
I say battle their way if you haven't

589
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:12,879
implemented whitelisting technology and

590
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:15,100
you're going down that path it's a hard

591
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:18,700
project whitelisting technology is very

592
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:22,959
very difficult to operation lives inside

593
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:26,080
an enterprise environment that said

594
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,490
attackers know that people around the

595
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:30,129
world they're deploying whitelisting

596
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:33,010
technology why you want to restrict the

597
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:36,700
execution of non-approved applications

598
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:38,500
conceptually good idea if if an

599
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:41,200
application is not approved they won't

600
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:44,170
run so malware won't have the resource

601
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:46,270
to be able to execute again attactive is

602
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:48,610
it innovative they'll look for ways to

603
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:50,440
bypass the whitelisting technology to

604
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:52,959
compromise the whitelisting technology

605
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:55,960
or use other tools to allow them to

606
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:58,810
still execute but leveraging the tools

607
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:01,080
that have already been whitelisted one

608
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:03,639
particular example is a tool called

609
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:07,050
installing YouTube which which i think

610
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:11,970
is an interesting example to talk about

611
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:15,940
install install YouTube is a signed

612
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:18,070
Microsoft command-line utility the way

613
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:20,860
it's used or the read what you use it

614
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:22,689
for is to install and under store

615
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:25,419
application so it's part of the.net

616
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:26,780
framework if you're using dotnet inside

617
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:30,890
your environment install

618
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:34,580
- we'll be inside your organization now

619
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:38,300
there's a researcher goes by the handle

620
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:40,970
some tea who effectively looked at

621
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:46,010
install you install you tool created

622
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:47,840
some c-sharp code and leverage the tool

623
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:50,480
and a couple of techniques to

624
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:53,389
effectively bypass AppLocker

625
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:55,820
as an example and the way that they also

626
00:28:53,390 --> 00:29:00,170
did this which is where I think this is

627
00:28:55,820 --> 00:29:02,409
a very very amazing research is they

628
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:04,640
were able he was able to bypass

629
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:07,400
AppLocker and the restriction of

630
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:10,880
PowerShell in a way that still allowed

631
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:14,870
him to execute power shell so let's go

632
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:17,870
through effectively how this works so a

633
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:19,699
part of the research that was done there

634
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:22,070
was the c-sharp application that was

635
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:25,100
created which is called instill you tool

636
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:29,149
powershell CS you see there on the top

637
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:31,669
left hand side under point one and dll

638
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:35,570
that was that was used effectively which

639
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:37,520
allows you to compile a special

640
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:39,679
powershell executable call it what you

641
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:44,420
want this particular example call it CS

642
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:48,470
c XE and then the way that you use this

643
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:51,890
is you effectively execute CSC got ax c

644
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:54,290
with the dll and the compiled

645
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:57,680
information effectively allows you to

646
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:59,780
execute power shell and get a power

647
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:03,950
shell prompt and you can see there the

648
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:06,290
second line the install util which is a

649
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:09,080
whitelist that an approved whitelisted

650
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:11,810
application will execute it will then

651
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:14,300
load powershell and then you can pass

652
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:17,120
some parameters for example one that you

653
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:19,730
see there log file log to console equals

654
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:20,459
false so that you can use PowerShell and

655
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:25,040
do it

656
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:29,610
any lobbies very interesting technique

657
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:33,090
is the the one that I like to look at so

658
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:35,850
Casey who published this research this

659
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:39,720
research was published 4th of June 2015

660
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:41,429
a state based actor now this is the

661
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:43,470
reverse of the previous example that I

662
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:45,660
talked about earlier earlier I talked

663
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:47,520
about state state basis actors

664
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:49,440
developing techniques that have been

665
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:51,330
reused by other actors in this

666
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:54,210
particular example a researcher has

667
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:56,939
published their findings and then in

668
00:30:54,210 --> 00:31:00,000
October of 2017 and at the start of this

669
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:02,610
year we saw China based our Chinese

670
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,190
based adversary that was using this

671
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:11,639
particular technique to carry out

672
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:13,980
attacks on some certain targets no

673
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:18,600
exploit leveraging the tools that are

674
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:22,380
part of the operating system now there's

675
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:23,939
a couple of things to talk about if if

676
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:26,010
you don't know anything about install

677
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:29,010
your util it's probably because you've

678
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:31,260
never used it and in many cases I would

679
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:33,810
probably also suggest that a lot of your

680
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:34,710
system admins have never used install

681
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:37,889
YouTube

682
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:40,920
so maybe consider blocking the execution

683
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:46,020
of this particular file given the the

684
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:48,450
way that it can be used additionally you

685
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:50,700
should be hunting for the use of the

686
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:52,410
tool and maybe some of the command-line

687
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:54,750
arguments that are being used for

688
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:57,630
example somebody that's trying to use

689
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:59,520
install you tool without logging is

690
00:31:57,630 --> 00:32:01,230
pretty unusual

691
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:04,080
why would somebody not want to log

692
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:06,170
anything inside the organization so

693
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:10,139
think through some of those examples

694
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:12,540
because you can sort of start to funnel

695
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:16,190
off or bubble up some of some weird

696
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:16,190
things that may be happening in your net

697
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:21,470
now like let's touch on one more which i

698
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:25,280
think is again very interesting and

699
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:28,100
probably drive the point home again

700
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:30,950
what else do attackers do so once

701
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:32,990
they've captured credentials once maybe

702
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:34,520
they've executed some code inside an

703
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:37,640
organization they want to start to do

704
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:38,060
reconnaissance reconnaissance is not

705
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:40,640
easy

706
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:42,470
attackers don't just suddenly get onto

707
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,930
the network and you know they're off

708
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:46,730
doing their thing they are spending time

709
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:49,070
trying to work out what's going on

710
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:51,500
inside the environment and they use a

711
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:54,080
number of different tools I'm going to

712
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:57,550
use the example of three tools again

713
00:32:54,080 --> 00:33:00,010
that come with the operating system

714
00:32:57,550 --> 00:33:03,290
certainly until expand

715
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:05,960
csvde many of you will have used these

716
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:09,070
tools seen those tools before certainly

717
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:13,160
know about them all built-in windows

718
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:15,710
command line programs certainly tool is

719
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:18,740
a Windows command line program that's

720
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:22,520
part of certificate services

721
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:25,430
it's one of or two of its functions is

722
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:27,879
to download image file or remote files I

723
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:33,230
should say and then to also decode

724
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:33,650
base64 encoded files attackers love you

725
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:35,840
too

726
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:38,720
because of its function and its ability

727
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:40,370
to download files attackers you cert you

728
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,080
tool because it's a great malware

729
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:45,139
downloading tool and it's a Windows

730
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:48,409
signed to the second one is expand

731
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:52,730
expand you effectively use to decompress

732
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:54,950
CAD files think of the two together one

733
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:56,750
tool to download files one tool to

734
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:59,570
expand them and then the final one is

735
00:33:56,750 --> 00:34:03,170
csvde this one's slightly different this

736
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:06,560
is something that you find on Windows

737
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:09,639
servers again it's a signed tool it's

738
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:13,520
installed as part of Active Directory

739
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:15,629
tools you don't tend to see this on

740
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:17,550
client operating systems

741
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:19,790
and this can be used to do a lot of

742
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:22,170
enumeration of Active Directory

743
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:27,210
environments let's put them all together

744
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:32,040
and use some interesting examples so

745
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:35,900
csvde if you use csvde on a Active

746
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:39,630
Directory machine and you use the - F

747
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:41,760
parameter and output the results this is

748
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:46,230
some of the information that you would

749
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:49,530
get off an Active Directory an ad device

750
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:53,190
you can't actually fit all the fields

751
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:55,200
that you can return on the one screen

752
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:57,480
I'd be using multiple power points and I

753
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:59,549
had to reduce the size of the deck so

754
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:02,130
you can get an amazing amount of

755
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:05,310
information about the environment simply

756
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:08,070
by using a built in tool csvde and you

757
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:10,470
can see there some of the some of the

758
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:14,760
examples that you can you can track

759
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:18,029
their DNS information creation

760
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:19,890
information name object classes that are

761
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:22,830
their certificate information user

762
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:24,930
certificate information it's it's huge

763
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:26,340
what you can do with it let's put them

764
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:28,830
all together from an attackers

765
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:30,480
perspective we've seen examples August

766
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:33,180
November last year we've seen examples

767
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:35,030
of February this year where attackers

768
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:38,430
are using all of the tools together

769
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:40,890
what's interesting is in the example

770
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:44,370
seen in August and November of last year

771
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:47,370
cert util was used to download and

772
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:49,230
decode a base64 encoded file why you

773
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:51,569
would want to do that if it's encoded

774
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:53,220
you're bypassing again a lot of security

775
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:57,330
controls which you may not be able to

776
00:35:53,220 --> 00:36:00,029
see what is in a particular file then

777
00:35:57,330 --> 00:36:01,680
you expand the file and then you start

778
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:08,460
using it in this particular example

779
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:10,890
csvde February 2018 slight variation

780
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:14,040
again where the attacker is actually

781
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:17,430
using a split command to chunk the file

782
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:21,720
down and bring it in in stages before

783
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:24,180
executing it why again bypassing Network

784
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:26,189
curity devices bring it in in chunks

785
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:29,009
reconstruct that execute and carry out

786
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:31,609
the attack attackers continue to

787
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:34,580
innovate and find ways of using

788
00:36:31,609 --> 00:36:37,200
sometimes old techniques sometimes

789
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:40,369
legitimate tools but in ways that they

790
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:43,020
weren't obviously intended to be used

791
00:36:40,369 --> 00:36:46,530
some ways of dealing with this I'll

792
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:50,750
start bottom-up you don't in most cases

793
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:55,020
found find you shouldn't find csvde on a

794
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:59,300
client version of Windows so don't allow

795
00:36:55,020 --> 00:37:03,359
it to run on a client version of Windows

796
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:07,830
the other thing to do is again think of

797
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:09,390
the way you would use csvde or think of

798
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:12,299
the way that you use cert you two

799
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:14,490
certainly cert you to some of the the

800
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:15,150
execution are consider blocking it

801
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:19,040
entirely

802
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:21,810
except for trusted users to run up

803
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:24,029
monitor the usage and the parameters

804
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:25,980
that people are using because there's

805
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:28,349
ways that typically you would user and

806
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:31,740
there's ways that should be flagged as

807
00:37:28,349 --> 00:37:36,900
potential malicious activity inside the

808
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:40,109
network so three particular examples to

809
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:45,480
touch on so a couple more slides and

810
00:37:40,109 --> 00:37:47,940
then I'll pause for for questions like

811
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:50,089
we get all together and bring it back to

812
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:52,589
how we deal with a lot of these issues

813
00:37:50,089 --> 00:37:55,170
one of the biggest challenges that I

814
00:37:52,589 --> 00:37:58,859
certainly see as I travel around the

815
00:37:55,170 --> 00:38:01,230
world is knowing these techniques is the

816
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:02,970
first challenge and the second one is

817
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:03,930
being able to find them inside the

818
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:06,779
organizer

819
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:10,288
I used one statistic to kind of prove

820
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:15,049
out this point we we ran a survey that's

821
00:38:10,289 --> 00:38:17,910
just come in of 1300 security

822
00:38:15,049 --> 00:38:19,740
practitioners one of the things that we

823
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:21,839
were trying to work out is how long it

824
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:24,770
takes to detect respond and remediate an

825
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:27,960
attack and the average around the world

826
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:29,520
was about 63 hours which actually I was

827
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:30,839
pretty surprised with because that was a

828
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:33,089
lot better than what I thought it was

829
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:35,940
going to be I would argue it's probably

830
00:38:33,089 --> 00:38:40,259
a lot longer you know depending on the

831
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:42,180
attack I think but a few people are not

832
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:45,180
even sort of looking at this I'll show

833
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:49,288
you how I think about 63 hours for me if

834
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:50,819
we break down 63 hours it's about 7.8

835
00:38:49,289 --> 00:38:53,789
working days if you think of an

836
00:38:50,819 --> 00:38:56,069
eight-hour working day think of the

837
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:58,920
examples of the attacks that I just

838
00:38:56,069 --> 00:39:02,220
showed you and what an attacker could do

839
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:06,000
to an organization over effectively

840
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:08,609
eight working days this assumes that you

841
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,339
have the staff that know what to look

842
00:39:08,609 --> 00:39:13,890
for and these techniques constantly

843
00:39:11,339 --> 00:39:16,589
change daily weekly monthly and then

844
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:18,598
have the tools to know or the tools to

845
00:39:16,589 --> 00:39:22,859
be able to use to go and find these

846
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:25,470
particular techniques the second

847
00:39:22,859 --> 00:39:28,500
statistic that I'll sort of finally

848
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:32,578
touch what I would call the breakout

849
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:34,440
time now this is something that we've

850
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:36,359
been thinking about as an industry for a

851
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:40,920
long time it's been quite difficult to

852
00:39:36,359 --> 00:39:43,078
to wrap our arms around a number but the

853
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:46,770
the research that we've done into the

854
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:49,529
breakout time throughout 2017 shows that

855
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:51,779
an attacker targets a host and the time

856
00:39:49,529 --> 00:39:54,809
it takes them to compromise their hosts

857
00:39:51,779 --> 00:39:56,940
to then start moving laterally so they

858
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:57,600
can start to bury themselves deeper in

859
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:59,730
the network

860
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:02,190
use stolen credentials to act as the

861
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:05,970
legitimate user has now come down to an

862
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:08,280
hour and 58 so we've got some

863
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:10,799
interesting time challenges and time

864
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:15,480
pressures and skill challenges that we

865
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:19,200
need to think of I'll give you one piece

866
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:21,150
of final advice to think about that it's

867
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:24,240
going to be somewhat challenging when

868
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:25,650
you think about how to defend and build

869
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:28,319
an architecture to protect your

870
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:31,230
organization this is what the

871
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:34,320
best-of-the-best focus on we like to

872
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:36,480
call it survival of the fastest the best

873
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:39,390
of the best are starting to focus their

874
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:42,390
security architectures around what you

875
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:45,150
can easily remember as the 11060 rule

876
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:48,450
what's one ten sixty one minute time to

877
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:51,210
detect an issue ten minutes time to

878
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:54,810
investigate to try to understand what

879
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:56,610
that incident looks like what it's done

880
00:40:54,810 --> 00:41:00,420
what it could do what's the scope of the

881
00:40:56,610 --> 00:41:05,730
problem and then 60 minutes to totally

882
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:07,560
remediate or contain the issue as I said

883
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:09,480
just to be very very careful this is

884
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:12,270
what the best of the best are either

885
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:15,360
doing or aspiring to what I would

886
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:19,410
challenge you to think about is how

887
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:21,600
close or far you are away from the 11060

888
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:24,420
rule and when you're thinking about

889
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:26,880
designing security architectures what

890
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:29,580
can you do to help you move towards the

891
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:31,440
goal of 110 60 you know when you're

892
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:33,600
walking around at the the conference

893
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:36,330
looking at a lot of technology think

894
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:39,569
about what can help you get to that

895
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:41,009
point to be able to detect an incident

896
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:43,790
as quickly as possible

897
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:47,340
importantly an incident an issue a

898
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:50,430
threat that doesn't necessarily use

899
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:52,140
malware how could you understand what

900
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:52,589
it's doing inside your environment how

901
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:54,810
could you

902
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:57,030
the size of the problem and work out

903
00:41:54,810 --> 00:41:59,990
what you need to do and then what tools

904
00:41:57,030 --> 00:42:03,960
do you have in place to remediate

905
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:05,910
so summary from me I just start to pull

906
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:07,140
all of those things together you're

907
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:10,259
going to need to start to think about

908
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:12,330
automation you're gonna need to start to

909
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:15,690
think about how you can prevent attacks

910
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:19,890
without being reactive thinking about

911
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:23,280
legacy types of updating signatures etc

912
00:42:19,890 --> 00:42:26,640
because time becomes critically complex

913
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:30,420
to deal with if you are using reactive

914
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:32,490
technology focus on behaviors focus on

915
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:35,220
what I would call indicators of attack

916
00:42:32,490 --> 00:42:38,970
not indicators of compromise which are

917
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:41,450
inherently reactive look beyond malware

918
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:44,399
as per the examples that I talked about

919
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:45,689
look for combinations of things that are

920
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:48,180
happening in the network where

921
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:49,850
individually they could be okay but the

922
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:52,980
combination of a number of tools

923
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:55,400
executables as I showed you command line

924
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:57,690
parameters could indicate a possible

925
00:42:55,400 --> 00:43:01,110
issue that's going on inside your

926
00:42:57,690 --> 00:43:02,790
organization it's interesting over the

927
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:04,710
last few years the industry has been

928
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:06,690
talking a lot about detection over the

929
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:08,310
last 12 to 18 months the industry's

930
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:10,530
really started to talk more and more

931
00:43:08,310 --> 00:43:13,170
about threat hunting my advice is very

932
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:14,970
simple do threat hunting whether you do

933
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:17,670
it whether you work with a vendor or

934
00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:20,459
security systems integrator a partner

935
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:22,080
find the resource to be able to do

936
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:24,750
threat hunting in your network to look

937
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:27,660
for these types of attacks the final one

938
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:29,280
that I would point out is I've shown

939
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:31,259
your example of a number of attacks

940
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:35,340
where the attackers are focused on

941
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:38,970
causing some form of destruction wiping

942
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:40,320
logs wiping machines there's a lot of

943
00:43:38,970 --> 00:43:41,790
discussion that's going on in the

944
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:44,700
industry today about detection

945
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:46,770
technology and when you capture system

946
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:50,129
events telemetry information where do

947
00:43:46,770 --> 00:43:52,170
you where do you install it my argument

948
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:54,240
would be certainly not where the

949
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:55,890
attacker is currently operating inside

950
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:58,229
your environment if the attacker is

951
00:43:55,890 --> 00:44:00,210
targeting a server if an attacker is

952
00:43:58,230 --> 00:44:02,880
targeting part of the network if they're

953
00:44:00,210 --> 00:44:04,239
using wiping technologies don't find

954
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,309
yourself in a situation

955
00:44:04,239 --> 00:44:08,639
where they've destroyed wiped removed

956
00:44:06,309 --> 00:44:10,689
the logs that are going to help you

957
00:44:08,639 --> 00:44:13,719
investigate the issue inside your

958
00:44:10,689 --> 00:44:17,589
organization which is why I say take

959
00:44:13,719 --> 00:44:19,509
that information off-site in a way that

960
00:44:17,589 --> 00:44:22,389
allows you to continue to investigate

961
00:44:19,509 --> 00:44:24,969
the issue have the necessary response

962
00:44:22,389 --> 00:44:27,579
controls that allows you to connect to

963
00:44:24,969 --> 00:44:30,489
every machine regardless of where it is

964
00:44:27,579 --> 00:44:34,569
at any point in time on network off

965
00:44:30,489 --> 00:44:37,899
network so I'm down to my last five

966
00:44:34,569 --> 00:44:40,239
minutes let me pause feel free to reach

967
00:44:37,899 --> 00:44:42,489
out send me an email hit me up on

968
00:44:40,239 --> 00:44:44,469
Twitter if you've got any questions but

969
00:44:42,489 --> 00:44:46,959
let me pause I appreciate everybody's

970
00:44:44,469 --> 00:44:49,169
time and open up if any questions are in

971
00:44:46,959 --> 00:44:49,169
the audience

972
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:04,860
yeah I love the question so I just

973
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:06,899
repeat it make sure everyone he is I've

974
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:08,490
used a couple of examples of threats

975
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:11,220
there's so many more that we can talk

976
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:15,750
about how to prioritize the reason why I

977
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:18,450
say I love the the the question is for

978
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:21,300
me every threat that's out there even

979
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:23,580
now where there is a person behind that

980
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:25,260
attack now I didn't magically create

981
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:27,090
itself and end up in your network there

982
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:29,850
is a person behind the attack they have

983
00:45:27,090 --> 00:45:32,430
a motivation they also have techniques

984
00:45:29,850 --> 00:45:34,350
that they're going to try to use people

985
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:35,669
are going to focus on certain verticals

986
00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:37,589
they're gonna focus on certain

987
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:39,350
industries they're gonna replicate

988
00:45:37,590 --> 00:45:42,480
attacks that have been used before

989
00:45:39,350 --> 00:45:45,120
that's what I refer to as threat

990
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:47,730
intelligence threat intelligence is not

991
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:51,240
a list of bad IPs and URLs etc that's

992
00:45:47,730 --> 00:45:53,190
one part of find a way to access threat

993
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:55,049
intelligence that includes that

994
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:57,690
information so you can understand the

995
00:45:55,050 --> 00:46:00,360
tactics the techniques and use

996
00:45:57,690 --> 00:46:01,800
technology that allows it allows you to

997
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:03,780
operationalize it in a way that's

998
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:05,160
relevant to you you know if you're if

999
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:06,630
you're an airline if you work for an

1000
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:09,379
airline as an example use threat

1001
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:12,630
intelligence that has a strong research

1002
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:15,000
section on the aviation industry and

1003
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:17,550
what's happened to your peers in the

1004
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,960
industry and what you look for because

1005
00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:21,570
the way I would use threat intelligence

1006
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:24,240
two ways hunt for the adversary and your

1007
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:25,710
network and obviously remove and if

1008
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:27,839
they're there hopefully they're not

1009
00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:29,250
there emulate those techniques to make

1010
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:30,090
sure that if they do come to your

1011
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:31,470
network you

1012
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:35,610
how to defend against that remove a

1013
00:46:31,470 --> 00:46:37,859
block at etc so having access to that

1014
00:46:35,610 --> 00:46:40,620
sort of threat intelligence that allows

1015
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:41,880
you to understand what's the the active

1016
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:44,069
campaigns what are the relevant

1017
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:46,830
campaigns to you you know what you

1018
00:46:44,070 --> 00:46:49,440
should be thinking about and trying to

1019
00:46:46,830 --> 00:46:53,840
get as much of that into your seem into

1020
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:53,840
your endpoint tools network tool etc

1021
00:46:59,530 --> 00:47:05,620
we're out of questions or I appreciate

1022
00:47:03,910 --> 00:47:07,390
everybody's time thanks for coming along

1023
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:09,430
to the session enjoy the rest of the

1024
00:47:07,390 --> 00:47:12,529
conference and hopefully you got

1025
00:47:09,430 --> 00:47:15,948
something out of the session thank you
