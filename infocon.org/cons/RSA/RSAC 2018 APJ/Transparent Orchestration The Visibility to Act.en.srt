1
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:14,309
good afternoon ladies and gentlemen

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:16,950
thrilled to be here to talk about the

3
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:20,759
new era of transparent orchestration

4
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:24,210
which is upon us and it's going to give

5
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:27,060
all of us here in cybersecurity the

6
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:29,789
visibility to act which is something

7
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:31,948
that we are lacking today and very

8
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:35,069
important the earlier conversation about

9
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:39,149
GDP our and and the fines and all of

10
00:00:35,069 --> 00:00:41,999
that that are expected however before we

11
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:44,579
go let's start the story starts with my

12
00:00:41,999 --> 00:00:48,269
daughter so I have a seven-year-old

13
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:51,179
daughter and she is into my little pony

14
00:00:48,269 --> 00:00:53,699
I don't know I don't get it

15
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:54,989
but you know apparently seven-year-old

16
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:57,799
girls are into my little pony

17
00:00:54,989 --> 00:01:02,129
so she waits for me to come home and

18
00:00:57,799 --> 00:01:05,250
wants me to play it for her so I cannot

19
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:07,050
record it the steps that I go through to

20
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:09,330
get to that point where I can actually

21
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:14,640
play it for her so I made a little video

22
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:19,770
about that so you know you I have to

23
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:23,900
first go get the remote of course turn

24
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:27,929
the TV on it's a smart TV so it has a

25
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:30,870
home button which has the apps so I need

26
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:34,230
to go find the right app to play so I

27
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:35,940
got the Netflix once you go in there you

28
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:38,910
have the search for the show on this

29
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:41,160
amazingly user-friendly keyboard that we

30
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:45,119
all love to use I don't know why they

31
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:47,970
can't change it but I started looking

32
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:50,840
for my and then my babysitter's the

33
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:53,940
vampire shows up which is scary but I

34
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:57,210
wanted my little pony so find the show

35
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:59,520
she's very particular about the episode

36
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:02,729
the season the specific episode that she

37
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:08,008
wants to watch so finally get to that

38
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:13,230
point play it and then I'm hoping that

39
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:14,339
she is happy but she is not okay so as

40
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:17,399
you saw

41
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:19,860
there's it's modern technology at a

42
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,050
smart TV you have all these things but

43
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:24,810
it was multiple different steps that

44
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:26,670
were required to get to that point so

45
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:30,390
that she could actually watch it so she

46
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:32,429
thinks this guy's too slow I need to

47
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:35,790
orchestrate him out of the equations so

48
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:38,730
I can get to what I need to fast so this

49
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:41,549
is what she has done figured out how to

50
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:43,410
get to what she wants without needing me

51
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:44,970
in the equation of course she needs me

52
00:02:43,410 --> 00:03:06,390
to buy the stuff but after that she's

53
00:02:44,970 --> 00:03:08,760
figured it out so there you go the tv

54
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:14,700
turns on pulls up the right episode and

55
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:15,739
it starts playing right so how cool is

56
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:19,500
that

57
00:03:15,739 --> 00:03:21,480
you have multiple vendors hardware from

58
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:25,110
different vendors there speakers from

59
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:28,798
Google the TVs from LG the software app

60
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:32,970
is from Netflix the content is you know

61
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:36,150
from Hollywood or whoever but she's able

62
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:39,900
to get to what she wants with just a

63
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:42,120
single voice command saying play this

64
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:44,310
and she gets that she gets that you know

65
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,920
gets to the point that she needs to in

66
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:49,829
just one single wise command that's how

67
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:52,018
in the consumer world what's happening

68
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:54,930
in the consumer world how integrated

69
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:57,090
systems how vendors are working together

70
00:03:54,930 --> 00:04:00,870
to really come up with ways that make

71
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:05,190
our life at home easy now let's turn to

72
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:09,150
our world what a mess we have to deal

73
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:11,579
with we got all kinds of vendors all

74
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:14,280
kinds of hardware all kinds of software

75
00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:17,760
you got the cloud even there you have

76
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:19,440
like three clouds and seven soon so you

77
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:23,099
even there you don't have a uniform way

78
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:26,700
of doing anything you have systems that

79
00:04:23,099 --> 00:04:27,750
have been put together over a period of

80
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:31,320
time

81
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:34,170
which means that they have different

82
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:36,360
architecture so you know the

83
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:39,240
architecture of the AIX machine and the

84
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:41,670
the Oracle database and and all of that

85
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:45,120
is very different than the architecture

86
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:46,650
of the cloud today but we kind of tried

87
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,180
to put all of that together to make

88
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:50,760
those systems work

89
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:52,920
it just keeps it's incremental it gets

90
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:55,680
added on you come up with a new app you

91
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:57,210
add it to your existing set of apps and

92
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,920
try to make it work so which means that

93
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:02,479
with the different architecture these

94
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:04,110
systems don't really talk to each other

95
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:08,490
sounds familiar

96
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:12,300
in our world it's the IT team and the

97
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:14,130
security team arch-nemesis don't want to

98
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,210
talk to each other I don't want anything

99
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:18,060
to do with each other

100
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:21,630
IT goes out you know they develop their

101
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:24,690
app they don't care about security they

102
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:28,409
package it throw it over the fence and

103
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:30,780
now it's Security's problem if there is

104
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:34,380
a breach because of a vulnerability in

105
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:35,669
the code its Security's fault how is

106
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:39,060
that our fault we didn't even write the

107
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:42,180
code but hey you know so then of course

108
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:46,890
security team they are their own silo so

109
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:48,780
they take all these different IT systems

110
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:51,300
that are thrown at them and then they

111
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:53,909
buy their own IT systems on top of that

112
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:55,860
to secure these IT systems they don't

113
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:57,479
want hard to the IT guys because they

114
00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:00,930
always give code with vulnerabilities

115
00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:02,880
and oh but you know if we talk to them

116
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:04,320
and give them our tools and if the code

117
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,200
actually has no vulnerabilities and

118
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:10,950
maybe we don't have a job right so

119
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:12,900
whatever the reason that's how that's

120
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:15,419
how security guys are thinking about

121
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:18,120
that so what we have today in our IT

122
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:20,849
systems is a whole bunch of different

123
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:23,880
systems that get thrown out in the

124
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:26,820
infrastructure and then security goes

125
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:29,520
and buys their tools and puts them

126
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:31,710
around that infrastructure so that you

127
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,270
know you cannot breach them a whole

128
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:35,039
bunch of different firewalls and all

129
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:37,590
kinds of systems so hopefully you can

130
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:40,930
stop someone from coming in and create

131
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:46,330
this bolted on security it's after the

132
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:48,639
fact bolted on security right anybody

133
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:50,740
who has not experienced this in their

134
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:54,220
organization may be at the wrong

135
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:58,470
conference right now this is the reality

136
00:06:54,220 --> 00:07:02,530
that we deal with all the time and so

137
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:04,660
what is the cost of all of this I don't

138
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:06,929
even venture to try to put any number on

139
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:10,180
it because we deal with this every day

140
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:11,889
security goes about and buys all kinds

141
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:14,349
of different solution then they have to

142
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:18,009
buy the hardware to deploy those

143
00:07:14,349 --> 00:07:20,050
solutions then they have to go and buy

144
00:07:18,009 --> 00:07:24,220
the software on those solutions they

145
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:25,750
have to hire developers to try to make

146
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:28,960
those solutions to work with each other

147
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:30,610
they have to hire experts for each of

148
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,590
those systems so they can manage those

149
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:34,780
and you know in security even if you

150
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:37,479
have the money those the people don't

151
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:39,669
exist you can't get the people who can

152
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:47,740
actually help you do this so the cost of

153
00:07:39,669 --> 00:07:49,690
this is tremendous right now so we do

154
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:52,270
have an opportunity this is what I want

155
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:55,419
to talk about that the good news is that

156
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:57,340
we have a once-in-a-lifetime unique

157
00:07:55,419 --> 00:08:01,630
opportunity today that has not existed

158
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:03,849
in the long 40 50 60 years of ID

159
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:06,159
development that we have done whereas I

160
00:08:03,849 --> 00:08:08,889
gave that example earlier everything has

161
00:08:06,159 --> 00:08:12,250
been incremental II added so we have the

162
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:16,780
opportunity to reboot the way we think

163
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:19,720
about security and IT today and the way

164
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:23,258
we can do that is enter the hero which

165
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:25,659
is digital transformation so a lot of

166
00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:29,110
organizations today are going through

167
00:08:25,659 --> 00:08:32,338
this digital transformation exercise to

168
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:36,729
take all of their existing systems and

169
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:40,589
move them to modern technology into the

170
00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:44,290
cloud containers all kinds of different

171
00:08:40,589 --> 00:08:45,700
modern environment but that's not really

172
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:47,620
it's not so much that they are taking an

173
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:50,230
existing system and just pushing it to

174
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:52,990
the cloud it is the fact that right now

175
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:53,910
a lot of organizations are going back to

176
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:56,070
the drawing board

177
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:59,339
and completely redesigning their

178
00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:02,100
application architecture so that they

179
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:04,200
can natively move these applications

180
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:07,080
into the cloud and this is why this is a

181
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:09,390
unique opportunity because so far we

182
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:13,230
have always done IT incremental e and

183
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:14,790
what is happening today that and this

184
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:16,740
was the panel earlier there's a lot of

185
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:20,180
talk about gdpr this reappeared that

186
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:23,040
it's bad it's scary and all of that but

187
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:26,099
organizations are realizing that the

188
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:28,949
cost of securing their existing

189
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:32,640
infrastructure by bolting on all of that

190
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:35,400
security after the fact is so high that

191
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:38,520
it is actually cheaper to go back and

192
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:40,439
redesign those applications and put them

193
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:42,720
into the new infrastructure where all of

194
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,790
them can be instrumented the right way

195
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:49,460
and that's really what the opportunity

196
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:51,930
we have today is to actually build in

197
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:53,520
this infrastructure the security into

198
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:55,770
the infrastructure and not have it

199
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:58,680
bolted on as has been done for such a

200
00:09:55,770 --> 00:10:01,439
long time so we have the opportunity as

201
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:03,329
IT is going about designing and

202
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,570
redesigning and re architecting those

203
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:09,120
applications to try to get security at

204
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:12,060
the table so the devops dev psych ops

205
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:14,790
it's not just a phrase that looks good

206
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:17,520
on our resume to get a better job right

207
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:18,780
it's actually real this is a this is the

208
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:21,900
big change that is happening right now

209
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:24,480
that development operations security

210
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:27,630
people are actually working together to

211
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:30,380
ensure that the react attracted apps are

212
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:32,939
being done in a way that they are

213
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:36,840
elastic they are easy to deploy they are

214
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:39,540
self scaling and the big part of that is

215
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:41,580
that security is built-in we can

216
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:44,180
eliminate a lot of the security issues

217
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:46,500
in the development cycle up front before

218
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:50,790
even that application goes to production

219
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:54,590
and after that we need to have ensure

220
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:57,660
that we instrument those applications

221
00:10:54,590 --> 00:11:00,390
upfront so that all the information we

222
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:02,760
require to manage and monitor those apps

223
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:05,130
when they are in production is actually

224
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:06,920
already built in to create this

225
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:08,989
integrated

226
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:13,248
application framework an integrated

227
00:11:08,989 --> 00:11:17,420
platform where we can make that security

228
00:11:13,249 --> 00:11:20,660
something that is not a hindrance to the

229
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:22,128
end users who are using this so you have

230
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:24,230
your endpoint you have your security

231
00:11:22,129 --> 00:11:27,319
just take an example of you know when I

232
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:29,480
talk about bolted on security might seem

233
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:31,128
a little abstract but take your servers

234
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,589
today you have servers out in production

235
00:11:31,129 --> 00:11:36,439
and you have like 8 9 10 different

236
00:11:33,589 --> 00:11:38,269
agents on them and each of the agents is

237
00:11:36,439 --> 00:11:39,709
looking at what the exact same stuff

238
00:11:38,269 --> 00:11:41,209
there is looking at the same network

239
00:11:39,709 --> 00:11:43,549
connection they're looking at the same

240
00:11:41,209 --> 00:11:46,238
file change looking at the same process

241
00:11:43,549 --> 00:11:49,639
change they're looking at the same

242
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:51,559
memory utilization just interpreting

243
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:54,259
things differently because they were not

244
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:56,389
built-in so if we need if this is a

245
00:11:54,259 --> 00:11:57,769
requirement that for us to have security

246
00:11:56,389 --> 00:12:00,109
and monitor the behavior of the

247
00:11:57,769 --> 00:12:01,970
application we need to have it

248
00:12:00,109 --> 00:12:03,439
instrumented then this is the time to

249
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:05,359
make sure that we collect all of that

250
00:12:03,439 --> 00:12:07,189
data once whatever we need and then we

251
00:12:05,359 --> 00:12:10,100
can analyze it in different ways after

252
00:12:07,189 --> 00:12:12,498
the fact and not try to get 10 15 20

253
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:14,689
different you know Unicorn agents out

254
00:12:12,499 --> 00:12:16,519
there to you know claim that they will

255
00:12:14,689 --> 00:12:19,849
get the security which we don't get

256
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:21,589
today so this is not just abstract so

257
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:24,619
the good news is that with the cloud

258
00:12:21,589 --> 00:12:26,449
providers like Amazon will Azure this

259
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:29,600
phenomena is already happening right now

260
00:12:26,449 --> 00:12:31,910
so I put together a little video that

261
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:35,089
kind of shows today how for example in

262
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:39,259
the Azure security center this is where

263
00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:41,269
all of the IT infrastructure is visible

264
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:42,589
in one place which is the big change we

265
00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:44,389
have not had the visibility in the

266
00:12:42,589 --> 00:12:46,459
infrastructure in the past but it will

267
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:48,819
pop up the recommendations for example

268
00:12:46,459 --> 00:12:50,719
that you need on its own to say these

269
00:12:48,819 --> 00:12:52,219
virtual machines are missing

270
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,230
vulnerability assessment click and

271
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:56,389
install vulnerability assessment on them

272
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:58,819
that's it 1 click the end user does not

273
00:12:56,389 --> 00:13:01,879
know how it is done it is already

274
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:05,539
instrumented in the backend not only

275
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:07,910
that once has been done they come back

276
00:13:05,539 --> 00:13:09,410
in a few hours within that same console

277
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:11,600
where they used to manage the IT

278
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:13,910
infrastructure they see all of the

279
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:17,059
findings they see all of the issues that

280
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:19,039
their application has without having to

281
00:13:17,059 --> 00:13:21,069
go to ten different consoles from

282
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:24,319
different providers

283
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:26,329
not only can they see what is wrong the

284
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,490
cool part about that is within that same

285
00:13:26,329 --> 00:13:31,519
address security center console they can

286
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:34,040
write their remediation rules without

287
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,810
having to buy another four products to

288
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:37,969
try to make all of that work is simple

289
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:41,300
if there is a vulnerability on a machine

290
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:45,170
that has an external facing IP and is

291
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:47,180
exploitable then create a security rule

292
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:49,099
which will block that particular port

293
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:53,209
for that particular virtual machine and

294
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:54,769
then send a message to slack all of that

295
00:13:53,209 --> 00:13:59,239
within the same console without ever

296
00:13:54,769 --> 00:14:02,060
having to leave that think of how this

297
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:03,709
kind of transparent orchestration can

298
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:06,949
really make our life significantly

299
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:10,160
easier if we take the effort upfront to

300
00:14:06,949 --> 00:14:13,930
really instrument and leverage what is

301
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:16,250
going on in this new phenomena of IT

302
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:19,729
digital transformation and building

303
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:21,620
things in where all of this is something

304
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:24,470
that the end-user never has to worry

305
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:26,839
about how do I get the security I don't

306
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:29,110
need to be a PhD in trying to install a

307
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:32,389
particular application for security I

308
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:34,880
need security on my infrastructure I

309
00:14:32,389 --> 00:14:37,339
just check a box and it's there there's

310
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:39,769
three distinct types of orchestration

311
00:14:37,339 --> 00:14:41,120
that we saw in that particular video the

312
00:14:39,769 --> 00:14:44,779
first one is orchestration and

313
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:46,519
deployment is that you need security you

314
00:14:44,779 --> 00:14:49,339
just say yes I need security I don't

315
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:51,319
need to have to be a PhD in in

316
00:14:49,339 --> 00:14:54,680
installing each individual security

317
00:14:51,319 --> 00:14:58,849
application it's already done second is

318
00:14:54,680 --> 00:15:00,979
the is the monitoring aspect of it the

319
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:03,350
orchestration of monitoring you don't

320
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:06,279
have to go and hire a whole bunch of

321
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:09,319
programmers using lots of API calls

322
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:10,970
putting together a third system where

323
00:15:09,319 --> 00:15:13,250
you can collect all of this logs and

324
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:14,300
have its own different console whatever

325
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:16,069
you need from a monitoring perspective

326
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:18,889
is available right there

327
00:15:16,069 --> 00:15:20,569
that's another orchestration and all of

328
00:15:18,889 --> 00:15:23,470
this is leading towards the third

329
00:15:20,569 --> 00:15:26,479
orchestration which is that response

330
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:28,699
which is the visibility to act which is

331
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:31,220
if I have all of that visibility in that

332
00:15:28,699 --> 00:15:33,770
same console if I'm able to quickly just

333
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:36,220
turn it on see what's coming up

334
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:43,150
now I can act in a much better way

335
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:46,370
that's the response so these new systems

336
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:49,850
cloud containers have all of these

337
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:51,830
advantages where if you instrument and

338
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:53,360
but you have to not just go and take the

339
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:54,290
old way of doing things and implement in

340
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,660
the cloud you have to really think

341
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:58,819
through and instrument them upfront and

342
00:15:56,660 --> 00:16:01,689
you're going to get a lot of those

343
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:04,520
benefits it's actually going to make you

344
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:07,250
save all you a lot of money it's

345
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:09,380
actually going to make you act really

346
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:11,120
secure because for the first time you go

347
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:12,860
into that console you see every single

348
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,540
virtual machine you have what's the

349
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:17,300
status of each of those virtual machine

350
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:19,520
and probably make your hero with the

351
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:21,709
board because you're the one who kind of

352
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:24,220
brought that in so that's an additional

353
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:26,570
benefit and this is just the start

354
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:32,510
there's so many advantages to moving

355
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:34,430
towards these solutions beyond just the

356
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:38,840
simple things of like okay I'm gonna get

357
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:41,510
better security going back to that first

358
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:43,340
video that I showed between the multiple

359
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:45,980
steps versus you know my seven-year-old

360
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:48,920
drawing inspiration from my

361
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:52,250
seven-year-old what she was able to do

362
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:54,709
we can have to show how if you

363
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:57,040
instrument things up front and leverage

364
00:16:54,710 --> 00:17:00,560
these systems what kind of capabilities

365
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:03,349
security can get we put together concept

366
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:05,629
application that highlights what

367
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:11,540
capabilities we can get in the very near

368
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:13,630
future okay google talk to Qualis cloud

369
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:15,909
support

370
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:19,150
all right getting the test version of

371
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:22,750
koalas cloud support hello how can

372
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:24,419
koalas help you how many cloud accounts

373
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:27,760
do I have

374
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:30,809
you have 15 accounts in Oz five accounts

375
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:35,549
in Azure in one account in Google Cloud

376
00:17:30,809 --> 00:17:39,190
how many resources do I have in AWS

377
00:17:35,549 --> 00:17:43,090
there are a total of 16,000 823

378
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:45,250
resources in your AWS accounts what is

379
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:49,418
the current security assessment for the

380
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:52,799
marketing production account there are

381
00:17:49,419 --> 00:17:58,360
five control failures in 3rm

382
00:17:52,799 --> 00:18:00,668
what are the three new failures there

383
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:03,070
are 12 as 3 buckets which have public

384
00:18:00,669 --> 00:18:05,620
access enabled one security group allows

385
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:08,080
unrestricted ingress access to port 22

386
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:12,070
five instances with public IP have

387
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:16,230
exploitable vulnerabilities post the

388
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:19,270
control failures to ESPO Cieslak channel

389
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:28,500
control failures posted to SLC slack

390
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:35,289
channel thank you and they're so polite

391
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:38,020
compared to our security guys so this is

392
00:18:35,289 --> 00:18:43,320
real right I mean these technologies

393
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:45,700
today exist and break with the new

394
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:47,080
software the service security the

395
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:49,270
service building things in

396
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:51,610
instrumentation we can really get to

397
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:53,440
this point very quickly and that's the

398
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:56,199
direction that we are going so this

399
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:58,960
transparent orchestration is really you

400
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:02,429
know we started off by looking at the

401
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:06,059
current way we are doing incrementally

402
00:19:02,429 --> 00:19:09,490
developed IT systems trying to slap on

403
00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:11,620
bolt on security solutions after the

404
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:14,110
fact that don't really work don't really

405
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:17,049
give us the visibility but if we take

406
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:19,030
that additional step think through ride

407
00:19:17,049 --> 00:19:21,908
on the current bus where boards are

408
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:24,280
actually giving IT teams a lot of money

409
00:19:21,909 --> 00:19:25,600
to rewrite their applications and make

410
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,418
sure that you can actually I know it's

411
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,738
hard but

412
00:19:26,419 --> 00:19:31,580
sure you can make friendship with the IT

413
00:19:27,739 --> 00:19:33,980
guys then we can get a better much

414
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:35,509
better security eliminate those hundreds

415
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:37,909
of agents get back to having

416
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:40,489
instrumentation built-in right from the

417
00:19:37,909 --> 00:19:42,499
beginning and essentially provide and

418
00:19:40,489 --> 00:19:45,440
give us that visibility that we are

419
00:19:42,499 --> 00:19:51,030
lacking and this is now I believe the

420
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:51,740
time for us to act thank you very much
