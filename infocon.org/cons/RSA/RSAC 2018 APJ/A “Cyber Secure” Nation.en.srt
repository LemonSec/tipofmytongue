1
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:12,269
good afternoon everyone I can't believe

2
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:14,579
I have to check my watch then first of

3
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:16,170
all thank you for attending Niro say

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,270
conference thank you to the RSA people

5
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:21,300
for having me here thank you for

6
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:23,698
attending my session so what I want to

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:26,820
talk to you about today is the concept

8
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:29,119
of a cyber secure nation and I know that

9
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:32,729
sounds like grand almost megalomaniacal

10
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:36,809
kind of ambition but having been in this

11
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:38,339
industry for 25 years I've spent a lot

12
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:40,559
of time treating their symptoms of

13
00:00:38,339 --> 00:00:43,350
cybercrime but never really getting to

14
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,608
the root cause and what you'll hear me

15
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:47,010
talk about and I'll try not to offend

16
00:00:44,609 --> 00:00:49,260
anyone because I know our security

17
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:51,539
people can find a fence in unusual

18
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,579
situations you'll hear me talking about

19
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:55,379
herd immunity I'll try to call it

20
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:57,799
community immunity because no one likes

21
00:00:55,379 --> 00:01:00,718
being referred to as some sort of bovine

22
00:00:57,799 --> 00:01:03,420
but you know one of the key tenets of

23
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,870
what we believe needs to be done in

24
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:09,330
order to fundamentally address

25
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:12,030
fundamentally lift the level of cyber

26
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:14,759
security preparedness in a country is

27
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:19,050
move toward that state of community

28
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:21,690
immunity so I need to start with some

29
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:23,250
statistics I'll breeze through them

30
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:25,980
because you're all cyber security

31
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:28,650
professionals and you don't like Fudd

32
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:31,080
but it's not far it's context before I

33
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,790
do that may I have a show of hands who

34
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:37,170
here is from the telecommunications

35
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:39,060
industry all right a decent amount

36
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:42,300
because I'm kind of talking to you with

37
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,770
this who here is in a large organization

38
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,539
within their of the country that they

39
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,940
live in you know a serious large

40
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,300
national enterprise ok I'm talking to

41
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:53,370
you

42
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:55,770
government government government sound

43
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:57,440
hired I'm talking to you as well and

44
00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:00,330
everyone else I'm talking to you because

45
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:02,370
this will take a team effort I don't

46
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:06,330
think you can create fundamental change

47
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:09,119
in any area without a United population

48
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:11,790
without a united force so just quickly

49
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,610
43 percent of cyber crimes target the

50
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:15,470
small business they're enough

51
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:16,880
sounds about right almost reminds me of

52
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:18,290
that statistic and you might have to

53
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:21,440
think about this if you haven't heard it

54
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:22,609
that 40% of all sick days are taken on a

55
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:27,530
Monday or a Friday

56
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:29,300
doesn't that sound terrible no anyway

57
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:30,410
it's a joke because there's five days

58
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:34,250
each is 20%

59
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:37,970
so it's average anyway moving on okay no

60
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:39,620
more jokes for you 22 percent of small

61
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:42,260
businesses breached by rents and we're

62
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:44,990
attacks in 2017 could not continue to

63
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:47,120
operate now in most countries the

64
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:48,980
lifeblood of the economy is the small

65
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,440
business it's by far the largest sector

66
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:54,769
it's all by far also by far the most

67
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:56,150
fragile sector so 22 percent of small

68
00:02:54,770 --> 00:03:00,410
businesses that we hit could not

69
00:02:56,150 --> 00:03:02,270
continue to operate 87% of small

70
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:04,190
businesses believe antivirus software

71
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:05,350
alone can protect their business from

72
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:08,150
cyberattacks

73
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:10,430
congratulations antivirus sellers you've

74
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:13,130
done a marvelous job to the rest of you

75
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:15,890
not so much because and I include myself

76
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:17,930
in that because we have allowed small

77
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:19,820
business customers to believe that if

78
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:21,860
they're running antivirus everything's

79
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:25,070
cool and obviously that's not quite the

80
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:27,110
case 60 percent and no arguments from

81
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:29,840
the antivirus vendors place 60 percent

82
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:32,090
of small firms that experienced a cyber

83
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,680
breach went out of business within the

84
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:35,720
following six months so there's an

85
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,120
immediate knock-on or an immediate

86
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:40,280
effect of small businesses going out of

87
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,080
business immediately and some managed to

88
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,150
drag on for some time and then go out of

89
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,730
business so it's a massive problem for

90
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:50,989
small business again the lifeblood of an

91
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:54,619
economy small business so what do we

92
00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:56,810
need to do to change the game in my

93
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:59,090
opinion we need to move away from

94
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:00,709
treating customer by customer by

95
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:02,810
customer it's not cost-effective

96
00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:04,220
it doesn't change outcomes across the

97
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:05,600
board and certainly when it comes to

98
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:08,030
small business it's barely

99
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,709
cost-effective to be able to consult to

100
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:12,230
them and help them on an individual

101
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:14,650
basis so I've got a cute little graphic

102
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:18,349
here to demonstrate community immunity

103
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:20,579
so you'll see the inscrutable graphic

104
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:22,470
that looks like a watch

105
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:25,710
whatever that show was with Leonardo

106
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:28,560
DiCaprio where time was malleable which

107
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:29,969
is the bad thing now the bad thing sends

108
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,610
out the world's cutest little green

109
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:35,460
virus which infects a computer there's a

110
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:37,890
normal Network that computer becomes

111
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:41,190
infected infects everybody else next

112
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:43,830
thing you know we have Melissa virus we

113
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:45,960
have whatever we have a virus a worm

114
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:48,390
that sweeps the world causing massive

115
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:50,039
untold damage that is incredibly hard to

116
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:51,870
eradicate and by the way most of those

117
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:55,830
are still flying around the internet in

118
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:59,130
one form or another that's bad now what

119
00:04:55,830 --> 00:05:01,979
if through inoculating a percentage of

120
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:04,260
the of the industry and and just to

121
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:06,800
quickly touch on inoculation obviously

122
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:10,469
it's a medical term when you think about

123
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:13,140
inoculating against disease there are a

124
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:15,480
number of different measures in terms of

125
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:18,510
the percentage of a population that you

126
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:21,150
have to protect in order to attain herd

127
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:24,630
or community immunity depending on the

128
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:26,789
virility of the disease basically those

129
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:30,200
range from sixty percent to nineteen

130
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:32,880
ninety-five percent my utterly

131
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:36,030
unscientific estimate for our industry

132
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:38,460
is if we can get 70% coverage we're well

133
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:42,510
on the way to herd immunity or community

134
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:44,580
immunity so imagine now an organ a

135
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:46,530
network where we have our sneaky

136
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:51,930
compromised device that sends out its

137
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:54,750
cute little green thing its bug infects

138
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:57,660
an unprotected device the unprotected

139
00:05:54,750 --> 00:06:00,540
device says well time to infect everyone

140
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:02,460
else oh no they're all protected now

141
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:04,200
that's kind of normal but if you look in

142
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:07,409
the bottom left of that you have another

143
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:09,960
unprotected Advice device that isn't hid

144
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:12,600
that is the essence of community

145
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:14,250
immunity not everyone has to be

146
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,950
vaccinated and even if you're

147
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:19,680
unvaccinated you are effectively covered

148
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:21,150
because the bulk of the population is so

149
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,590
we don't have to get this perfectly

150
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:24,510
right which is great because humans

151
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:26,429
aren't good at perfection we just have

152
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:29,370
to get this most right and we can

153
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:31,620
protect most of our customers most of

154
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:33,960
our small business customers and if we

155
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:35,940
can do that then we'll reduce the impact

156
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:38,280
we'll reduce the spread will reduce the

157
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:40,740
effort to clean up will reduce the the

158
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:42,239
loss of productivity will stop small

159
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:44,280
businesses from going out of business

160
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,320
and then we can start to think about how

161
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:48,388
can we bring this community immunity

162
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:50,969
upward into the mid-market

163
00:06:48,389 --> 00:06:57,210
and beyond and also downward into the

164
00:06:50,970 --> 00:07:00,750
consumer space so we devised a strategy

165
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:03,599
now this is a Telstra Australia strategy

166
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:06,330
so sorry I know it's just Australia but

167
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:08,460
what I want you to take from this is you

168
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:12,060
could do this in any country this isn't

169
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:14,448
just for Australia this is our view on

170
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:18,180
what we need to do to be able to protect

171
00:07:14,449 --> 00:07:20,130
our entire community from government

172
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:21,930
through large enterprise through the

173
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:27,030
mid-market through small business and

174
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:28,889
through to consumer so we felt that we

175
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:31,948
needed to create solutions that would

176
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:36,030
really raise the game in each area so we

177
00:07:31,949 --> 00:07:38,190
started with open MSS so who here and I

178
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:40,469
asked this question in another forum and

179
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:42,180
got an answer that didn't really prove

180
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:45,210
my point so this will be interesting

181
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:47,400
who here has outsourced security

182
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:50,989
management to a third party could you

183
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:54,210
raise your hand if you're not too shy

184
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:58,669
okay nobody outsources who here has

185
00:07:54,210 --> 00:08:03,780
outsourced security management hello one

186
00:07:58,669 --> 00:08:07,289
wow what a sample group - in my sample

187
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:09,570
group of two that I can see please raise

188
00:08:07,289 --> 00:08:13,110
your hand again if you're really happy

189
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:17,430
with the service neither of you

190
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:19,289
congratulations you made my point my

191
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:21,990
point is in the managed security

192
00:08:19,289 --> 00:08:24,659
services industry the economics are so

193
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:27,150
fundamentally broken that in my cynical

194
00:08:24,659 --> 00:08:29,820
opinion you have two types of providers

195
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:31,948
which create two types of customers you

196
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:34,140
have the provider that is profitable and

197
00:08:31,949 --> 00:08:36,659
their customers probably despise them

198
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:39,569
and you have the provider that is

199
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:44,550
bleeding cash and their customers may

200
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:47,190
like them does anyone disagree I'm

201
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:48,959
taking that for now the problem is the

202
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:50,880
economics of the managed security

203
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:53,520
services industry are fundamentally

204
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,950
broken I don't want to name a vendor but

205
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:59,250
if you were to start an MSSP and I've

206
00:08:55,950 --> 00:09:01,500
started a couple what you find is very

207
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:03,300
quickly about 50% of the revenue that

208
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:06,330
you receive from your customers go

209
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:07,740
straight to your sim provider SIEM

210
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:10,230
security information event management

211
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:12,420
provider now that's not where the real

212
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:14,580
value is sure that collects data that

213
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:17,459
deduplicate that correlates that alerts

214
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:19,050
on known owns but these days that's just

215
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:20,520
the ticket to the game for a managed

216
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:22,949
security service that's not where the

217
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:25,079
real value is to your customer but that

218
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:26,910
took fifty percent of your revenue so

219
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,590
with the other 50 percent you have to

220
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:30,240
work out how do i do vulnerability

221
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:32,520
management how do i do threat management

222
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,530
how do i build a sock how do i star fit

223
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:36,420
how do i innovate how do i do customer

224
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:37,740
service management and it turns out

225
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:39,959
there isn't enough money to do all of

226
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:42,330
that so you either take a cynical view

227
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:45,900
and cut down on everything offshore your

228
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:47,940
socks do follow-the-sun support which

229
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:50,699
you sell as a benefit to your customers

230
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:53,130
but the reality is that means every

231
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:56,040
analyst in every location has to know

232
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:58,470
about every customer that's not good it

233
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:00,300
also means your analysts are continents

234
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:03,030
away from your customers and that's not

235
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:06,209
good so there are some fundamentally

236
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:08,730
broken things in this market so we set

237
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:10,500
out to change it we worked with open

238
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:15,780
source anyone from Cisco in the room

239
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:19,710
hello Cisco wow I'm so glad I'm not the

240
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:22,589
warm-up act for a comedy routine if

241
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:24,780
you're from Cisco my tip of the hat to

242
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:27,810
you because you guys created a thing

243
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:30,089
called Cisco open sock then you realized

244
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:34,410
if it's an open sock you can't sell it

245
00:10:30,089 --> 00:10:35,550
as a product so you dumped it so that's

246
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:41,250
what you get for not putting your hand

247
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:43,109
up and then a far more open source

248
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:45,120
friendly group called Hortonworks picked

249
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:46,380
it up and added it to their stack so

250
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,020
Hortonworks are one of the two big

251
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:51,570
providers in my view of the Hadoop

252
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:53,790
platform so Hortonworks now see that

253
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:55,490
they have Metron which is a sim sitting

254
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:57,559
on top of Hortonworks do

255
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:59,749
which is you know HDFS and all the good

256
00:10:57,559 --> 00:11:05,300
things there and so it's an open-source

257
00:10:59,749 --> 00:11:07,009
sim so we hired about 70 people because

258
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:09,649
it's not easy to work with the open

259
00:11:07,009 --> 00:11:11,389
source we acquired a company in New

260
00:11:09,649 --> 00:11:13,459
Zealand called kognito which does

261
00:11:11,389 --> 00:11:15,230
advanced security analytics and we've

262
00:11:13,459 --> 00:11:18,008
been bringing all of that capability

263
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:20,929
together into an open source based

264
00:11:18,009 --> 00:11:24,589
managed security service so that we can

265
00:11:20,929 --> 00:11:27,619
remove that 50% tax now I think that tax

266
00:11:24,589 --> 00:11:30,829
in our case will end up being about 25%

267
00:11:27,619 --> 00:11:32,920
as as we approach scale that 25% will be

268
00:11:30,829 --> 00:11:35,569
a lot of developers some support

269
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:37,699
subscriptions and also some commercial

270
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:40,248
elements because we use organization

271
00:11:37,699 --> 00:11:43,910
like Qualis anyone from Qualis in the in

272
00:11:40,249 --> 00:11:47,379
the room know shy okay

273
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:51,589
Qualis took for scanning for instance I

274
00:11:47,379 --> 00:11:54,559
think I heard yes so that is what we're

275
00:11:51,589 --> 00:11:56,629
doing to democratize managed security

276
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:59,118
services why do we need to democratize

277
00:11:56,629 --> 00:12:01,850
it and by the way we're not pricing it

278
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:04,069
as if it's just another managed security

279
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:06,559
service we're pricing it far more

280
00:12:04,069 --> 00:12:07,790
aggressively and and I tell you this not

281
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,769
because I'm trying to sell your steak

282
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:11,509
knives right now but to emphasize the

283
00:12:09,769 --> 00:12:13,220
fact that if you want to change this

284
00:12:11,509 --> 00:12:15,499
market you have to change the economics

285
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:18,889
so we're pricing the entire 24 by 7

286
00:12:15,499 --> 00:12:21,860
service as if it's about the same cost

287
00:12:18,889 --> 00:12:23,240
as that software which creates a

288
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:25,339
completely different outcome for your

289
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:27,350
customers and it also means we can take

290
00:12:25,339 --> 00:12:29,480
that service far further down the market

291
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:32,299
into the mid market which has been

292
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:34,730
previously unable to access the

293
00:12:32,299 --> 00:12:37,819
ridiculously high pricing for a managed

294
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:39,949
security service also we've built our

295
00:12:37,819 --> 00:12:41,748
socks so built to in Australia so far

296
00:12:39,949 --> 00:12:44,389
one in Melbourne one in Sydney because

297
00:12:41,749 --> 00:12:47,089
we want to foster a better security

298
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:49,309
professional community in Australia and

299
00:12:47,089 --> 00:12:52,339
we also want our analysts close to our

300
00:12:49,309 --> 00:12:54,410
customers so as we expand globally will

301
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:57,410
be building socks or finding sock

302
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:59,689
partners to run our technology in each

303
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:01,579
country as we expand because we believe

304
00:12:59,689 --> 00:13:04,339
your analysts should be in the same

305
00:13:01,579 --> 00:13:06,888
country as you the customer because this

306
00:13:04,339 --> 00:13:08,689
isn't a service you provide from no

307
00:13:06,889 --> 00:13:11,989
this is a service that you provide with

308
00:13:08,689 --> 00:13:14,449
intimacy locally to your customers so

309
00:13:11,989 --> 00:13:16,249
that's open emesis the other reason we

310
00:13:14,449 --> 00:13:20,089
needed to build that platform first is

311
00:13:16,249 --> 00:13:22,399
that gave us a big data engine which

312
00:13:20,089 --> 00:13:25,669
allows us to ingest vast quantities of

313
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:28,309
data run sim rules so known knowns

314
00:13:25,669 --> 00:13:31,299
across that data set and there's then

315
00:13:28,309 --> 00:13:35,358
also run advanced security analytics so

316
00:13:31,299 --> 00:13:37,639
behavioral based algorithms looking for

317
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:39,859
let's just call it aberrant behavior

318
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:41,379
across a number of different areas so

319
00:13:39,859 --> 00:13:43,819
things like data ingress egress

320
00:13:41,379 --> 00:13:45,379
relationships logins those kind of

321
00:13:43,819 --> 00:13:49,009
things you can't really pick that stuff

322
00:13:45,379 --> 00:13:51,589
up with rules so that brings us to

323
00:13:49,009 --> 00:13:53,749
secure internet do I have some steak

324
00:13:51,589 --> 00:13:55,790
knives for you here secure internet the

325
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:58,249
idea is provide enterprise-grade

326
00:13:55,790 --> 00:14:01,309
security and when I say that I mean

327
00:13:58,249 --> 00:14:04,249
think of a highly advanced next-gen

328
00:14:01,309 --> 00:14:06,829
application aware firewall all-singing

329
00:14:04,249 --> 00:14:09,470
all-dancing provided in our points of

330
00:14:06,829 --> 00:14:11,748
presence so not even you don't cross the

331
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:13,850
internet to get to this in front of our

332
00:14:11,749 --> 00:14:16,369
fixed lines and in front of our mobile

333
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:18,290
lines and then linking those two with a

334
00:14:16,369 --> 00:14:20,839
single policy so that a small business

335
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:23,360
customer for the grand price no wait

336
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:23,660
there's more the grand price of $20 a

337
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,419
month

338
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:29,919
ozzie which is what about $18 a month

339
00:14:26,419 --> 00:14:32,799
Singh I think at the moment can have

340
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:35,389
access to enterprise grade technology

341
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:38,299
protecting their network network in and

342
00:14:35,389 --> 00:14:40,850
out including their smart devices and as

343
00:14:38,299 --> 00:14:42,769
well we give them to next-gen endpoints

344
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:44,869
so they can protect their Mac's or pcs

345
00:14:42,769 --> 00:14:47,149
because the last thing we want to do is

346
00:14:44,869 --> 00:14:49,939
crack open their SSL sessions because

347
00:14:47,149 --> 00:14:52,309
all of a sudden I am Big Brother I don't

348
00:14:49,939 --> 00:14:55,459
want to do that the reason it is so

349
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:58,249
keenly priced is when it massive take up

350
00:14:55,459 --> 00:15:00,049
we need to inoculate 70% of the

351
00:14:58,249 --> 00:15:02,239
community we're not going to do that

352
00:15:00,049 --> 00:15:05,179
with premium pricing we're going to do

353
00:15:02,239 --> 00:15:06,709
that with premium value and scale so

354
00:15:05,179 --> 00:15:09,709
that's what we've built we're launching

355
00:15:06,709 --> 00:15:11,809
that in February next year once it's

356
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:13,518
launched by the way we'll move it down

357
00:15:11,809 --> 00:15:15,350
to consumer with more family friendly

358
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:18,289
features and we'll move it up into

359
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:20,010
business mobile which is a real gap and

360
00:15:18,289 --> 00:15:22,410
in terms of applying

361
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:26,250
more about applying policy when it comes

362
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:29,459
to business mobile then we looked at

363
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:32,130
denial of service who here thinks denial

364
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:38,080
of service protection is cheap but you

365
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:40,839
hand up eka my anyone

366
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:43,149
it's not cheap it's for enterprises it's

367
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:46,060
for government it's the rolls-royce it's

368
00:15:43,149 --> 00:15:48,190
expensive it shouldn't be a country

369
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:50,319
should build its own or at least a telco

370
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:52,510
in a country should build its own global

371
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:55,269
denial-of-service protection capability

372
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:56,740
it should provide that to its customers

373
00:15:55,269 --> 00:15:58,269
from government through enterprise

374
00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:00,370
through small business and in a way

375
00:15:58,269 --> 00:16:01,990
through the consumer and it should make

376
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:04,839
it entirely affordable entirely

377
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:07,240
accessible and pretty much an automatic

378
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:09,940
service otherwise we're relying on large

379
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:12,220
North American vendors who if it hits

380
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:13,120
the fan globally will not be

381
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:15,760
prioritizing

382
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,380
your country or my country they weren't

383
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:20,980
prioritized any country other than North

384
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:22,450
America so therefore every country if it

385
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,760
wants to protect its own national

386
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:27,579
infrastructure and IT is critical

387
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:30,010
infrastructure it needs to create its

388
00:16:27,579 --> 00:16:33,189
own capability to protect its network on

389
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:35,050
behalf of its customers and finally

390
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:37,089
network hygiene and that doesn't mean

391
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:39,579
just dusting and stuff like that the

392
00:16:37,089 --> 00:16:41,620
best example of this is and really this

393
00:16:39,579 --> 00:16:43,420
is to operate the network better on

394
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:47,589
behalf of our customers to give them

395
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:51,339
better security outcomes we see botnets

396
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:53,380
building in our network and right now we

397
00:16:51,339 --> 00:16:55,060
sit and watch them building and we have

398
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:57,070
a responsibility to monitor the network

399
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:58,930
for performance and security reasons

400
00:16:57,070 --> 00:17:01,079
what we don't have is a clear

401
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:03,550
legislative mandate to interfere with it

402
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:05,500
so we see these command and control

403
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:09,040
networks building and we say to each

404
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:11,349
other that one's gonna hurt and then it

405
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:13,329
happens and it hurts and we sit back

406
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:14,730
sadly and try to help our customers

407
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:16,569
recover from it

408
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:18,939
legislation will be different in every

409
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:21,579
country in our country it's not clear

410
00:17:18,939 --> 00:17:23,350
enough to allow us to interfere with

411
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:25,599
that and stop the botnet while that's

412
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:28,480
building so we're working closely with

413
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:30,309
government on a number of measures that

414
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,380
will help us better protect the network

415
00:17:30,309 --> 00:17:35,290
itself on behalf of all customers of the

416
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:38,350
network so that is the cyber secure

417
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:40,899
Australia strategy and as I said it will

418
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:42,639
be largely rolled out by the first of

419
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:47,980
not the first of sorry

420
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:51,030
February 2019 and I believe will give us

421
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:53,010
the will basically raise the baseline of

422
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:56,070
security across the entire country and

423
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:57,990
let's remember almost every person at

424
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:59,490
home almost every consumer works for

425
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:01,890
somebody so we're going to protect them

426
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:04,020
and their employer small businesses

427
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:05,760
provide services to other businesses

428
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:07,920
including medium and large better

429
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:10,080
protection you know this is about the

430
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,880
chain being as strong as its weakest

431
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,070
link and we want to make all of the

432
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:16,830
links strong so that's the that's the

433
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:18,810
concept and again this isn't something

434
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:21,510
you can only do in Australia this is

435
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:23,639
something your telco people what I would

436
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:25,190
love for you to think about how could I

437
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:28,320
do something like this in my country

438
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:30,930
because you can't fix the internet and I

439
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:33,810
know fix is a big term from one country

440
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:36,000
what it's going to take is more and more

441
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:37,379
countries saying we've had enough we've

442
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,150
had enough of the Wild West

443
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:40,890
we actually would like to provide a

444
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:42,720
better outcome for our country for our

445
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:45,060
economy and we're going to do something

446
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,070
like this so I implore you do something

447
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:49,350
like this government I implore you to

448
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:51,750
support something like this big business

449
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:55,500
I implore you to get involved in and

450
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:57,810
support something like this as we know

451
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:59,400
technology is some of the answer but not

452
00:18:57,810 --> 00:19:02,870
all of the answer so we're very focused

453
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:05,190
on driving awareness as a part of this

454
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:08,219
33% of businesses with fewer than 100

455
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:11,190
employees don't take proactive measures

456
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:14,700
against cyber security breaches so that

457
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:17,760
kind of go me that's not great I have a

458
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:19,710
number of tips let's call them slightly

459
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,930
tongue-in-cheek but slightly also

460
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:24,510
genuine more genuine than

461
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:26,720
tongue-in-cheek for those of you who are

462
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:29,070
kind of like yeah great where do I start

463
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:31,200
don't talk about your own security it's

464
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:33,689
like Fight Club if you talk about your

465
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,670
own security on public forums and and

466
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:37,320
when I say that don't be afraid to be a

467
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:39,510
reference because we really need

468
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:41,159
references everyone need referent needs

469
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:43,800
references and security references are

470
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:47,220
hard to come by but don't talk about the

471
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:49,590
specifics of your security controls and

472
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:51,360
and where this most often happens is a

473
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:53,310
well-intentioned engineer goes on to a

474
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,320
public discussion forum for a given

475
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:57,480
piece of technology and says we're

476
00:19:55,320 --> 00:20:00,540
running bla bla bla beige and blah blah

477
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:02,190
blah here's my configuration file it's

478
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:03,409
not working can anyone help me

479
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:05,630
all that is just

480
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:07,970
grist for the mill for the hackers as

481
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:09,800
their profiling to understand what your

482
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:11,420
network defenses are and therefore how

483
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:14,960
to get around them so it's Fight Club

484
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:17,060
don't talk about it back up you'd be

485
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,560
surprised how many people don't and to

486
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:20,330
the next point you'd be surprised how

487
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:22,820
many people when they finally will try

488
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:25,129
to restore work out that it was never

489
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:27,290
really backing up in the first place so

490
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:29,690
back up test your backups and if you

491
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:32,360
didn't remember it back up again single

492
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:34,780
most important thing you can do really

493
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:37,189
and also keep at least one backup

494
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:40,639
offline because the little cottage

495
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:42,590
industry writing malware writing mansome

496
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,630
rent somewhere getting more and more

497
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:46,129
sophisticated because they're business

498
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:49,310
people you know they want to offer a

499
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:52,130
good product and so they're now looking

500
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:54,980
for online services bless you online

501
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:56,630
services backup services you know

502
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:58,880
network-attached services so keep

503
00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:00,700
something that they can't wipe if they

504
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:04,670
happen to get control of your machine

505
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:07,070
pet pet pet chatty patch patch patch

506
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:09,410
my personal view you run a far greater

507
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:11,600
risk not patching because you're worried

508
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:16,720
about interfering with operational

509
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:18,889
capability then then patching because

510
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,560
yeah I don't know if I need to explain

511
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:24,920
that one but my personal view patch

512
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:26,450
first ask questions later prepare it

513
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:29,390
means will answer questions later

514
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:31,790
prepare an incident response plan

515
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:35,390
who here has participated in a fire

516
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:36,920
evacuation drill everyone if you're not

517
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:40,310
putting up your hand you're looking at

518
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:42,560
your iPhone or something everyone the

519
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:45,320
reason is the stakes are higher loss of

520
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:47,600
life the point is if you don't do that

521
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:49,129
for cybersecurity you'll run around you

522
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,449
won't know who's got the wardens hat you

523
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:52,520
won't know who to talk to who to

524
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:54,500
escalate to what a reasonable response

525
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:56,450
is do we care about forensics do we care

526
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:58,310
about operational recovery do we not

527
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:59,540
care about anything you'll mess it up

528
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:01,610
it'll take longer

529
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:03,980
it'll be horrific everyone will be

530
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:06,740
blamed don't do it practice your plan

531
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:09,310
deploy the fundamental security controls

532
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:11,600
in Australia there's the ASD top eight

533
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:13,190
there are equivalents all around the

534
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,330
world these are just fundamental

535
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:17,580
controls that Mustangs

536
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:20,100
and then deploy further controls based

537
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:22,230
on your risk posture depending on what

538
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:25,169
what industry you're in any tobacco

539
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:27,900
producers some people don't like you so

540
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:29,790
you have to be careful about that not to

541
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:31,020
pick on tobacco producers but you know

542
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:32,970
where I'm going with this there are

543
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:34,920
high-risk industries financial services

544
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:36,570
for different reasons high risk industry

545
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,550
so apply the controls that are right for

546
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:41,700
you

547
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:44,460
and finally with 17 seconds to go so I

548
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:46,290
need to I need to whiz through this it's

549
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:48,420
really important to foster a strong

550
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:51,060
local cybersecurity professional

551
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:53,220
community we do a lot in our country to

552
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:55,620
do that I implore you to do a lot and

553
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:57,120
work with government to do a lot some

554
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:59,669
people will tell you there is no

555
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:02,100
cybersecurity skills shortage in the

556
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:04,140
world I think they are deluded I think

557
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:06,300
there is absolutely a cybersecurity

558
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:08,670
skills shortage and it's up to people

559
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:10,950
like us to put the mechanisms in place

560
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:13,980
to create a better more vibrant more

561
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:18,990
capable local cybersecurity professional

562
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:21,720
industry and that's me done if you would

563
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:23,850
like a copy of the report that I that

564
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:28,890
some of these statistics came from you

565
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:31,320
can go to that that URL and fill out

566
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:33,810
some minor details and you'll get a copy

567
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:36,450
of the report if you'd like to get in

568
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:38,250
touch with me my email address is not on

569
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:40,260
there that wasn't deliberate but

570
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:42,000
particularly any anyone in the

571
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:44,220
telecommunications industry if you'd

572
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,780
like to get together and share what are

573
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:48,990
we doing how we're doing it what could

574
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:51,540
you do this is a community if a global

575
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:53,760
community efforts I'd be delighted to

576
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:55,639
talk to anyone and everyone about what

577
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:57,240
we're doing and about your specific

578
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:59,310
circumstances and whether there's

579
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:01,800
something we can do together or whether

580
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:04,320
you can learn from the successes and

581
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:07,080
awesome mistakes that we've been making

582
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,639
along the way on this journey so thank

583
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:10,710
you all very much for your time I've

584
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:13,370
really appreciated it and I hope that

585
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:15,430
was thought-provoking for you

586
