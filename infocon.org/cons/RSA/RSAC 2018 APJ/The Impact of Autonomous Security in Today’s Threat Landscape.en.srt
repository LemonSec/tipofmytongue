1
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:11,350
good afternoon everyone thank you all

2
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:14,440
for taking the time to be here I'm very

3
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:17,770
excited to be here to talk about how

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:21,189
autonomous security can help in today's

5
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:23,289
threat landscape as many of you are used

6
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:26,140
to seeing a lot of information coming

7
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:27,460
out about security threats and there's a

8
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:29,410
lot of ways to kind of solve that

9
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:30,850
problem and what we want to do in this

10
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:32,560
session is to give you an idea of what

11
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:34,870
other opportunity you have using

12
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:39,040
autonomous capabilities to solve that

13
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:40,839
threat landscape so just give some

14
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,640
examples in terms of what you might be

15
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:46,600
seeing in the news for the last many

16
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:50,170
years one example being in Japan in 2016

17
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:52,600
where a lot of the data from travel

18
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:54,750
agencies using phishing attacks were

19
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:57,600
compromised around eight million records

20
00:00:54,750 --> 00:01:01,120
information like passport travel data

21
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,710
credit cards and that that was just done

22
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,268
through fishing which can easily be

23
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:07,659
prevented by a lot of the things we'll

24
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:10,170
talk about later today second around

25
00:01:07,659 --> 00:01:14,139
this idea of having distributed

26
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:17,590
denial-of-service websites like Netflix

27
00:01:14,139 --> 00:01:18,969
for example sites like Yahoo where

28
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:20,679
compromised with a lot of these attacks

29
00:01:18,969 --> 00:01:23,020
when nobody could access those websites

30
00:01:20,679 --> 00:01:26,979
and there was no easy way to stop that

31
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:28,990
and prevent that attack in that time

32
00:01:26,979 --> 00:01:30,729
frame and also people who were trying to

33
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:33,729
access other web sites were also having

34
00:01:30,729 --> 00:01:35,469
difficulty getting into it because of

35
00:01:33,729 --> 00:01:39,219
the millions and millions of push coming

36
00:01:35,469 --> 00:01:42,428
through this DDoS kind of attack third

37
00:01:39,219 --> 00:01:46,029
was around a bank in Bangladesh where

38
00:01:42,429 --> 00:01:49,929
eighty million dollars worth of currency

39
00:01:46,029 --> 00:01:52,289
was stolen using again a malicious ways

40
00:01:49,929 --> 00:01:56,079
of getting into the system using

41
00:01:52,289 --> 00:01:57,880
compromised accounts from abusers this

42
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:59,288
could have been even worse if there was

43
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,298
no ability they didn't have an ability

44
00:01:59,289 --> 00:02:03,579
to kind of prevent that and this is

45
00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:05,709
again the idea that how do you use user

46
00:02:03,579 --> 00:02:07,689
behavior understand what kind of

47
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:09,550
information you want to collect and how

48
00:02:07,689 --> 00:02:12,850
do you prevent that becomes an important

49
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:14,750
part so what's going on today in the

50
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:17,150
industry as many of you know

51
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:19,310
executives and CEOs have been asked to

52
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:21,260
really innovate and improve the systems

53
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:23,840
they have today and really make them

54
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:26,989
efficient be able to reduce the cost and

55
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:29,540
be able to have services which are very

56
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:31,670
effective and efficient without again

57
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:33,890
having to invest a lot but the biggest

58
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:35,959
one nowadays happening and we stalk into

59
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:39,140
more and more executives we're managing

60
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:42,350
risk and having systems which operate 24

61
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:44,660
by 7 and are very secured has been the

62
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:47,060
one of the most important imperative

63
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:50,240
today and how do you really make sure

64
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:52,250
that the risks are managed and you are

65
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:55,160
not getting into any kind of compliance

66
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:58,970
issues also you're not also getting any

67
00:02:55,160 --> 00:03:01,850
kind of fines by government agencies for

68
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:03,980
sharing data or privacy information have

69
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:06,079
been compromised so managing risk is

70
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:07,959
becoming a very very critical things as

71
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,130
companies transform into digital

72
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:13,700
companies with the amount of information

73
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:15,500
being collected and stored managing risk

74
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:19,640
associated with that is becoming a very

75
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:22,190
critical imperative right but it is

76
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:23,660
becoming very difficult to do as well if

77
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:25,970
you look at the growing footprint for

78
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:28,190
example right you have a lot of now

79
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:29,510
devices like mobile devices who are

80
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:32,209
accessing the same kind of network

81
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:34,548
you're also seeing a lot of IOT sensor

82
00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:36,769
information and data being also called

83
00:03:34,549 --> 00:03:39,200
you used to be collecting and getting it

84
00:03:36,769 --> 00:03:41,690
all integrated together a number of apps

85
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,820
and users accesses not just the

86
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:45,650
on-premise F but also cloud apps so

87
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:47,810
suddenly you have exposure to a lot of

88
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:50,060
your company data corporate data been

89
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:52,100
exposed to multiple environments some

90
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:53,870
control by use as your enterprise in

91
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:55,600
your own data center some controlled by

92
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:58,760
other vendors who are running your

93
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:01,250
applications in the cloud and the amount

94
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,899
of data being created is out quite a lot

95
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:05,810
the proliferation of data is becoming

96
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:07,670
very difficult to manage the regulation

97
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:09,470
associated with that with the things you

98
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:11,750
heard today about GDP our and other

99
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:13,519
country based regulation in terms of

100
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:15,620
what can get access how do you prevent

101
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,750
it who's allowed to see it how do you

102
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:19,940
share it so putting rules and policies

103
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:21,649
around that is becoming very complicated

104
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:24,650
for most of the enterprises to manage

105
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:26,780
and keep up with and the attackers the

106
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:28,250
hackers and the folks who are kind of

107
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:30,650
trying to get into systems are getting

108
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:32,890
very sophisticated they're using using a

109
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:35,989
lot of machine learning AI algorithms

110
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:38,240
they are also very well-funded with

111
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:40,070
cyber currency cryptocurrencies very

112
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,050
easy to hire people in the dark web and

113
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:44,659
be able to do and compromise the data

114
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:46,250
and share it is easy to make money on

115
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,660
this information as well where you can

116
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:50,240
go and sell that illegitimate

117
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:52,940
information to other parties who might

118
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,730
be interested in also a lot of this

119
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:58,640
hackers are trying to compromise the

120
00:04:55,730 --> 00:05:00,140
systems really bring it down as well as

121
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:03,409
steal the assets associated with those

122
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:05,570
companies as well and the persistence in

123
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:07,460
the attack in the approach and sharing

124
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:09,230
of information across the hack across

125
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:11,989
the hacker community is pretty prevalent

126
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:13,910
as well so the sophisticated attackers

127
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:15,830
are making it even more difficult for a

128
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:17,540
lot of companies to keep and protect

129
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:18,830
their information and organization

130
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:21,230
organizations are becoming very

131
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:22,969
vulnerable right they are the threat

132
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:24,260
landscape is growing it's very hard to

133
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:26,540
know where you will get the threats from

134
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:28,669
what information who's trying to get

135
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:31,280
access to it and are you allowed to it

136
00:05:28,669 --> 00:05:33,729
or not and how do you really keep track

137
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:36,590
of that is a very difficult proposition

138
00:05:33,729 --> 00:05:38,659
the technologies as I said earlier are

139
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:40,310
moving very fast and is evolving how

140
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:42,919
does an organization keep up with that

141
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:44,479
and make sure that there is no downtime

142
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:46,820
because you do want your system to be

143
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,890
running 24 by 7 you want to be able to

144
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:50,930
patch and update that environment on a

145
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:53,479
regular basis without bringing it down

146
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:55,040
but that does create a lot of difficulty

147
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:57,710
in terms of how do you apply latest

148
00:05:55,040 --> 00:06:00,590
patches in zero downtime kind of a

149
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:02,690
mindset without really compromising the

150
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:04,250
systems so and it affects the brand

151
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:05,960
reputation if the systems are down or

152
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:08,690
compromised if you look at for example

153
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:10,789
Equifax which is a large credit card

154
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:13,219
bureau in the u.s. when the data was

155
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:15,140
compromised there the stock fell close

156
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:16,760
to 15% on the first day when the

157
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:19,159
information came out into the market and

158
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:21,289
they still have not recovered so it does

159
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:23,419
have a big reputation issue for the

160
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:27,200
company when this information goes out

161
00:06:23,419 --> 00:06:28,640
into the marketplace so we have been

162
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,409
doing a lot of work with a lot of

163
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:32,200
companies to kind of figure out what are

164
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:36,410
the key critical issues they are facing

165
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:39,080
we recently did a survey with KPMG as we

166
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:40,920
interviewed 450 global practitioner of

167
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:43,560
security and I

168
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:46,110
shops out of the 100 of them in

169
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:48,210
asia-pacific and some of the information

170
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:49,740
which we got back was very very

171
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:51,239
interesting in terms of the number one

172
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:53,460
challenge for many of these companies

173
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,590
today it's around managing security

174
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:57,330
events in the cloud how do you really

175
00:06:55,590 --> 00:07:00,030
keep track of it how do you collect that

176
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:02,430
information how do you manage it and how

177
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:04,950
do you really guarantee that there's no

178
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:07,020
data leakage eighty-five percent of the

179
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:08,849
users cited more than half of the cloud

180
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:10,349
data is sensitive so a lot of times

181
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:11,490
people think that the data which you

182
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:13,620
have which is sensitive is only

183
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:15,930
on-premise but more and more with the

184
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:17,880
proliferation of SAS based applications

185
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:20,520
as well as systems in the cloud that

186
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:23,700
data is available to users outside the

187
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:26,060
sensitive data right a lot of times also

188
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:28,170
the employees are violating the

189
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:31,080
regulations and the policies inside a

190
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:32,970
company all right so 89% of concerned

191
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,800
employees violate cloud policies so you

192
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:36,270
can set up all these policies but how do

193
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,190
you make sure that they are deterring to

194
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:40,560
those policies is a big challenge as

195
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:41,910
well and no doubt things like GDP our

196
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,190
impact pretty much every company out

197
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:47,460
there so take a look at this report at

198
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:51,060
Oracle comm slash CTR you get an idea of

199
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:52,799
what kind of things your colleagues as

200
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:55,860
well as a companies like yours are

201
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:58,910
facing today with cyber security as well

202
00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:00,660
as associated security trends and

203
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:02,280
associated with that I think the

204
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:04,170
information we get out of these things

205
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,969
is important to really make sure you

206
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:09,030
putting the policies as well as the

207
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:11,670
remediation systems to really keep a

208
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:13,710
keep track of that so if we talked about

209
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:15,870
cloud being sensitive the data being

210
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:18,120
sensitive out there but cloud also helps

211
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:20,300
in many ways as well one the cloud

212
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:24,120
vendors like Oracle has a lot of

213
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:26,550
investment as well as know-how to really

214
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:28,710
prevent a lot of the security issues you

215
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:30,420
might be facing there's a lot more

216
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:32,909
ability to kind of collect information

217
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:35,070
from other threats share things between

218
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:36,600
different customer data which we

219
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:38,460
understand in terms of what kind of

220
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,530
things might be going in and apply that

221
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:42,660
policies and regulations into those

222
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:44,850
environments as well so the cloud

223
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:47,579
vendors have expertise and ability to

224
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:49,650
manage the security elements we do focus

225
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:51,210
a lot in the cloud and our innovation

226
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:52,890
and reducing the costs and they're

227
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:54,870
reducing the risk I talked about earlier

228
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:56,699
and this also allows you to

229
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:58,410
be able to focus in terms of building

230
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:00,750
your business applications and systems

231
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:02,520
without having to worry about some of

232
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:06,779
the current security and management

233
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:08,939
challenges but if you look at some of

234
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:10,710
these security challenges and what kind

235
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:14,160
of approaches you require one is around

236
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:16,560
threat exposure right so 85% of the

237
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:20,069
security breaches are happening with

238
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:22,079
known patches and fixes available so

239
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:24,600
basically it means that many enterprises

240
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,220
even knowing that their ability to fix

241
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,800
those issues or holes in the system

242
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:31,140
they're not able to get to them you're

243
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,329
applying them manually you don't have

244
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:34,800
ability to do regression testing systems

245
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:36,810
might come down so you don't mind might

246
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,459
not apply so even if you apply to all

247
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:39,869
these fixes you will definitely protect

248
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:42,300
your environment but it's very difficult

249
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:44,610
to do given that amount of volume of

250
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:46,469
fixes available there and knowing when

251
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:48,810
to do it and how quickly to apply that

252
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:51,600
and not missing some of the key critical

253
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:53,579
points and systems and environments in

254
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,990
your infrastructure so this is exactly

255
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:57,510
what happened with Equifax where they

256
00:09:54,990 --> 00:10:00,839
had a fix for their server which was not

257
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:02,520
applied into the environment and the

258
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:05,370
hackers were able to use and compromised

259
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:07,260
the system so the threat exposure making

260
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:09,900
sure that you really apply all the fixes

261
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:11,490
required secondly think the second thing

262
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,410
is around the limited expertise

263
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:17,490
available in the marketplace today this

264
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:19,740
amount of need for folks with experience

265
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:21,959
in cyber security and experience in

266
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:24,209
general insecurity is pretty high that

267
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:26,670
not enough people out there who can be

268
00:10:24,209 --> 00:10:28,529
hired and keep up with this demand which

269
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:29,849
we seeing so that the expecting

270
00:10:28,529 --> 00:10:31,950
expectations aren't three and a half

271
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:34,410
million jobs around cybersecurity by

272
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:36,779
2021 and this not enough people out

273
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:38,370
there who can do this work today so this

274
00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:40,589
is again the idea that you need to go to

275
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:41,940
vendors or companies who are really

276
00:10:40,589 --> 00:10:43,589
specializing in this thing

277
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:46,800
instead of trying to do it and learn it

278
00:10:43,589 --> 00:10:48,750
on the fly amount of alerts you are

279
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,579
generating the alert overload for

280
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:52,830
anybody who's running systems today I'm

281
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:56,250
sure you can see that amount of events

282
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:59,550
you're getting it's around 17,000 alerts

283
00:10:56,250 --> 00:11:01,170
per week per enterprise and only you're

284
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:03,510
getting to 19 percent of them are

285
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:05,160
reliable and only able to investigate

286
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:07,920
four percent of it so you don't have

287
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:09,750
enough staff expertise and ability to

288
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,270
keep up with

289
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:14,310
Alerts to be able to do something about

290
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:15,990
it so no use knowing there's a problem

291
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:18,060
without having to solve a baby without

292
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:20,250
being able to solve it so this becomes a

293
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:21,449
big issue and requires that very

294
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:23,730
different approach in terms of how we

295
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:25,920
solve it and the tools which we have

296
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:28,830
today in many enterprises are very

297
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:31,439
inadequate the in our in our research we

298
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:34,170
found 86% of the traditional tools are

299
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,510
not sufficient to manage security across

300
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:39,209
the cloud right so you are really

301
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:41,130
lacking capabilities and automation to

302
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:43,620
be able to manage this process and be

303
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:47,220
able to really have a system which is

304
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:50,100
not vulnerable to this attacks right so

305
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:52,950
at Oracle and we have Larry Ellison with

306
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:55,980
the CTO and co-founder he talks about

307
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:57,750
how this is becoming a war versus just

308
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:00,240
kind of trying to have humans trying to

309
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:02,220
fight the machines it's really machines

310
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,740
against machines and automation being

311
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:07,020
the primary way to really keep up with

312
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:09,420
the issues you are seeing today with the

313
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:11,579
the attacks in this in the environments

314
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:14,099
right so you really need to now start

315
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:16,650
thinking about how do you use artificial

316
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:18,870
intelligence and automation built on top

317
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:21,060
of that to really protect your users

318
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:23,520
your applications data and

319
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:25,439
infrastructure with with the amount of

320
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:27,780
systems out there an amount of users

321
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,610
amount of data bin and managed there's

322
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:31,949
no other way than having automation

323
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:34,140
built into your environment into your

324
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:36,240
applications into your systems to really

325
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:38,340
prevent any kind of issues you are

326
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,760
seeing otherwise trying to do this

327
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:43,050
manually is just a recipe for disaster

328
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:45,090
you the thing you want to do is be able

329
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:47,339
to bring down your meantime to detection

330
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:49,440
as well as mean time to resolution and

331
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:51,530
that really needs to be your goal when

332
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,030
you're thinking about applying and

333
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:57,630
making sure your systems are not

334
00:12:54,030 --> 00:13:00,780
vulnerable anymore so how does automatic

335
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:02,580
autonomous security work the way to kind

336
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:05,160
of think about this is that you are able

337
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:08,120
to now collect all the different kind of

338
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:11,579
data coming in from applications devices

339
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:14,010
from user systems and be able to

340
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:15,750
classify all this data and normalize and

341
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:17,760
be able to interpret this thing in real

342
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:19,590
time as a single source of truth you

343
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,089
really need to be able to now take that

344
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:23,949
information and parse it

345
00:13:22,089 --> 00:13:26,350
really hone down to the area which it

346
00:13:23,949 --> 00:13:28,240
matters and be able to react to it you

347
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:30,399
can do on top of that ad hoc reporting

348
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,829
so you get an idea what's going on and

349
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,930
have an understanding of the system

350
00:13:32,829 --> 00:13:37,388
issues you might be facing as well as

351
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:39,519
detect anomalies in the systems as well

352
00:13:37,389 --> 00:13:43,240
and once you detect anomalies you can

353
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:46,059
now do real-time remediation by pushing

354
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:47,649
alerts to into the users automating the

355
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:49,689
actions against the alerts based on the

356
00:13:47,649 --> 00:13:52,240
rules you might have set up making sure

357
00:13:49,689 --> 00:13:53,559
that you're degrading the privilege for

358
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,680
a user if you know is the phishing

359
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:57,969
attack and somebody's personally

360
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,109
impersonating some other users who are

361
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:01,569
not supposed to be kind of getting

362
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:03,189
access to that environment as well so

363
00:14:01,569 --> 00:14:08,319
you can easily do a lot of those rules

364
00:14:03,189 --> 00:14:10,209
based an AI based implementation once

365
00:14:08,319 --> 00:14:12,309
you have this data and able to process

366
00:14:10,209 --> 00:14:15,339
this real time so the whole autonomous

367
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:17,589
security uses AI ml as a way to kind of

368
00:14:15,339 --> 00:14:19,689
parse and run algorithms on top of the

369
00:14:17,589 --> 00:14:22,209
information you collect but also now

370
00:14:19,689 --> 00:14:24,519
builds a lot of real framework on it

371
00:14:22,209 --> 00:14:24,910
based on the learnings and experience

372
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:26,610
you've had

373
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:29,319
running the systems as well and

374
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:31,749
understanding what to do when and how

375
00:14:29,319 --> 00:14:33,399
quickly you can really remediate right

376
00:14:31,749 --> 00:14:37,899
so that you can now have a very very

377
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:40,559
quick detection of issue as well as very

378
00:14:37,899 --> 00:14:42,999
quick resolution and proactively

379
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:44,920
bringing down and making sure that the

380
00:14:42,999 --> 00:14:46,420
the systems are locked in and nobody is

381
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,110
getting access to it if it's been

382
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:49,540
compromised

383
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:53,019
so autonomous security is really kind of

384
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:55,809
giving you the speed agility as well as

385
00:14:53,019 --> 00:14:59,350
the the risk mitigation when you are

386
00:14:55,809 --> 00:15:01,240
dealing with volumes of data as well as

387
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:03,660
systems and users who are coming in

388
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:06,220
multiple ways into your environment

389
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:08,499
trying to do this manually without

390
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:10,269
automation will not work and this is

391
00:15:08,499 --> 00:15:11,829
really something which you have to start

392
00:15:10,269 --> 00:15:13,449
thinking about when you're trying to

393
00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:15,339
make sure that you are not facing the

394
00:15:13,449 --> 00:15:18,099
similar kind of attacks which you seeing

395
00:15:15,339 --> 00:15:20,740
nowadays in many other enterprises and

396
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:23,230
systems out there right so the

397
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:24,279
requirements around that is really make

398
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:26,559
sure that you when you implement

399
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:28,990
autonomous security you're looking at

400
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:30,790
one view into all the data that you have

401
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:34,449
a system where you can bring all this

402
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:35,920
information into a place where you have

403
00:15:34,449 --> 00:15:37,420
a single source of truth

404
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,099
you can have a single pane of glass

405
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:41,589
where you can review and monitor all

406
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:43,810
this information and have ability to

407
00:15:41,589 --> 00:15:46,089
kind of know what's going on associated

408
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:49,060
with your systems you can do real-time

409
00:15:46,089 --> 00:15:51,190
analysis using a IML algorithms and and

410
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:53,920
capabilities there to make sure that re

411
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:56,380
mediating potential issues I really have

412
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:58,660
a whole mindset around the complete life

413
00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:01,540
cycle around threat medication where you

414
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:03,939
were able to prevent detect respond and

415
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:07,240
predict sophisticated attacks so it's

416
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:08,860
not just about kind of really finding

417
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:11,230
attack issues but also be able to

418
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:12,699
remediate as well and then once you have

419
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:15,459
all these things you want to be able to

420
00:16:12,699 --> 00:16:17,620
now do adaptive response associated with

421
00:16:15,459 --> 00:16:19,388
that really be able to share these

422
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:21,430
things across heterogeneous environments

423
00:16:19,389 --> 00:16:24,370
as well so their systems which are

424
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:26,349
across on Prem cloud you might be

425
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:28,630
running multiple vendor technologies as

426
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:29,860
well how do you integrate them and make

427
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:31,990
sure the information is shared across

428
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:34,000
that as well as multi cloud environments

429
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:36,100
where many many customers we speak to

430
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,670
are using cloud solutions from many

431
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:41,050
vendors and if you have a very siloed

432
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:42,670
interface associated with that there's

433
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:44,920
no way to know what's happening across

434
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:47,890
your systems as well and then you want

435
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:49,630
to be consistently monitoring as well

436
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:51,910
the ways as well as tracking any

437
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:54,339
suspicious activities so that you have

438
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:58,029
ability now to really prevent those

439
00:16:54,339 --> 00:17:00,279
things and remediate as well so we've

440
00:16:58,029 --> 00:17:02,529
seen this kind of systems been used by

441
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:05,020
many customers just some examples here

442
00:17:02,529 --> 00:17:07,540
but again you can hear a lot more across

443
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:09,250
the industries in terms of how to

444
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:10,780
prevent some of these things company

445
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:13,230
like companies like small company like

446
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:17,020
outsourcing in Japan they have a lot of

447
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:19,480
seasonal workers and based on projects

448
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:22,540
they really need it needed to make sure

449
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:24,490
that users identities are really secured

450
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:26,379
and you have a single sign-on

451
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:28,230
capabilities and you have perimeter

452
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:30,820
security associated with that as well

453
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:33,520
company like a reco which is trying to

454
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:35,939
do again identity solutions across

455
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:40,150
multiple apps both on-premise and cloud

456
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:42,809
they Coe in Korea they have a lot of

457
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:45,100
training staff for education and

458
00:17:42,809 --> 00:17:47,168
similarly they want to have an enhanced

459
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:49,510
security using autonomous capabilities

460
00:17:47,169 --> 00:17:50,980
to make sure the users are legitimate

461
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:52,870
seasonal workers who work in that

462
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:57,160
environment are getting the right kind

463
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:58,780
of access right so Oracle again from our

464
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,370
side we have been in the security space

465
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:03,250
for many years we've been delivering

466
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:05,199
security software our database as you

467
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:07,540
know has been known to be the one of the

468
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,610
most secure software out there but

469
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:13,210
beyond that we've been also adding a lot

470
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:15,310
of capabilities around cloud access

471
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:18,310
security broker technologies around

472
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:19,929
identity and the user management things

473
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:21,909
around system management and log

474
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:24,280
analysis so you're really thinking of

475
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:26,350
this holistically into instead of pieces

476
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:28,540
of silly C's of technology to really

477
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:31,570
help you manage your security as well so

478
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:34,030
years of investment 30 years of security

479
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:36,700
and identity services out there a lot of

480
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:39,610
many years in person years of investment

481
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:41,590
in our security software as well and

482
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:44,320
thousands and thousands of customers who

483
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:45,730
depend on it today so you can really

484
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,530
start thinking about when you're talking

485
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:49,270
about autonomous security you have to

486
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:51,399
look at it a little more end-to-end and

487
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:53,560
you look at you have to look at how this

488
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:55,540
can work in heterogeneous heterogeneous

489
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:58,810
environment and how you can really apply

490
00:18:55,540 --> 00:19:00,220
to the new areas so as a way to kind of

491
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:02,919
look at security you have to look at

492
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:05,890
autonomic autonomous really make sure is

493
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:08,200
hybrid and heterogeneous as I talked

494
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:09,820
about where you have multi cloud as well

495
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:12,190
as very different systems been

496
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:15,580
integrated together a bring in machine

497
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:17,590
learning to really are automate your

498
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:20,379
functions but also really do these

499
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:21,699
things in real time and what what is

500
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:23,950
important is really to have a single

501
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:26,050
pane of glass which cuts across all

502
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:27,520
these different systems so you get get

503
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:29,139
complete visibility across your

504

environment and you're able to really

505
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:34,060

507
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:39,179
