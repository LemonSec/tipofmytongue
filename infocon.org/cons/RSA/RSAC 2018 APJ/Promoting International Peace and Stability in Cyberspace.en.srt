1
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:09,870
good afternoon everyone how you were

2
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,879
doing I hope you've had an amazing

3
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:13,500
experience that this incredible

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,019
conference it's an absolute privilege to

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,940
be here for a second year in a row Wow

6
00:00:16,018 --> 00:00:18,869
how about that and a great audience to

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,400
come and speak to and a great

8
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:22,800
opportunity to talk about some of the

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,750
work that that we're doing down under in

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,830
this area so I'm totally freaking in it

11
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,840
as you've just been told and I'm

12
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:30,869
Australia's ambassador for cyber affairs

13
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:34,440
so I mean what do many of you think

14
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:36,870
about if you were thinking about what an

15
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,120
ambassador might be you probably think

16
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:42,510
about cars with flags ruffling in the

17
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:45,149
wind and you know embassy parties with

18
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:47,460
endless flowing champagne and canapés

19
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:49,469
and maybe tabletops full of chocolates

20
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:53,789
and fare of Roche so I do some of that

21
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:56,039
sometimes but also I'm a builder and I

22
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:57,719
like building things and most of my time

23
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:59,489
is actually spent in this job of

24
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:02,459
building things and and working

25
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:03,388
exclusively on an exciting renovation so

26
00:01:02,459 --> 00:01:05,489
let's get a bit of audience

27
00:01:03,389 --> 00:01:07,020
participation I want to see a few hands

28
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:09,950
here how many of you have tried

29
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:12,210
renovating a house go on don't be shy

30
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:13,680
good now I could get an idea that's

31
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:15,449
quite a few people who try it it's

32
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,790
pretty hard work isn't it I bet most of

33
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,650
you have sweat you know blood sweat and

34
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:21,420
tears over trying to renovate a house is

35
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:23,700
pretty hard but in the end once you get

36
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,230
your final product it's worth it isn't

37
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,880
it because you get that amazing new

38
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:29,430
renovated field or something you've

39
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,070
produced yourself so I'm working on a

40
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:34,020
long term project of renovation here of

41
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:37,139
essentially a very old an ancient

42
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,640
monument maybe akin to what you can see

43
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,850
there on the slide and it's being built

44
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,740
for many many generations and the house

45
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:45,419
is the International rules-based order

46
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:47,039
which you probably hear a lot about in

47
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,440
your newspapers from your politicians

48
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,080
and it's really gradually being built

49
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:54,149
over many many years of testing and

50
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:56,158
evaluation and failure at times over

51
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:58,740
over decades it's being built by

52
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,560
monarchs by presidents by ambassadors

53
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:03,780
and other diplomats as well and today

54
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:07,050
though however we meet at a critical

55
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:10,109
juncture also an exhilarating juncture

56
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:12,540
in in human history but the house is

57
00:02:10,109 --> 00:02:13,510
being renovated in order that we can

58
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,239
meet the challenge

59
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:18,099
the digital age presents us all and as

60
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,500
government's we really are incredibly

61
00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:23,078
aware now might not be in the case 10-15

62
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:24,819
years ago but we're so aware that there

63
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:26,379
is a risk that probably all you in this

64
00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:28,780
room have known about for a long long

65
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:31,359
time that unrestrained and irresponsible

66
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:33,909
behavior in cyberspace has the ability

67
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,940
to really cause considerable damage to

68
00:02:33,909 --> 00:02:39,760
society and old institutions sometimes

69
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:41,920
need a bit of time to catch up and many

70
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,840
of our current policies essentially are

71
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,940
the Allegra see of the analog era and

72
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,739
they need to be reinterpreted for this

73
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:50,109
digital era that we now find ourselves

74
00:02:47,739 --> 00:02:54,819
in so if you like the gap between

75
00:02:50,109 --> 00:02:56,799
technology 4.0 and policy 1.0 really

76
00:02:54,819 --> 00:02:59,170
needs to be bridged and more rapidly

77
00:02:56,799 --> 00:03:01,359
than any other policy area that we're

78
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:03,099
dealing with currently so digital

79
00:03:01,359 --> 00:03:05,349
connectivity is the engine that we know

80
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:08,230
is driving our modern societies our

81
00:03:05,349 --> 00:03:09,940
economic growth but the benefits that

82
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:11,379
we're now enjoying come with risks and

83
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,250
you'll hear that all the time won't you

84
00:03:11,379 --> 00:03:14,440
I'm sure you've had so many

85
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:16,690
presentations that tell you that but

86
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:18,459
it's it's worth reinforcing and the

87
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:20,980
difficulty we see now is that cyber

88
00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:24,040
security incidences that are global in

89
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:25,869
scale have been the possibility for an

90
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,099
awful long time and again many of you

91
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:29,079
professionals in this room will have

92
00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:31,179
known that for an awful long time but

93
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:33,190
now we're seeing that come of age and

94
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:35,349
actually being enabled and actioned in

95
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:38,319
the global environment so now we think

96
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:40,750
it's a vital period in time in order

97
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:43,238
that we act and ensure that the benefit

98
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:45,519
that we all want to enjoy in in the

99
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:47,769
digital space and for digital

100
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,629
connectivity is protected and that

101
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:52,720
essentially we protect also in the same

102
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:54,280
token global security and stability so

103
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,379
Australia what we're doing is we're

104
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:58,090
upgrading our diplomacy that's my

105
00:03:56,379 --> 00:04:01,780
responsibility in order that it's fit

106
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:04,989
for the digital age so I've got the

107
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:06,370
honor of being the ambassador for cyber

108
00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:07,599
affairs it's the first of its kind in

109
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:09,250
Australia is the first time we've done

110
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,798
it and it's a recognition at the fact of

111
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:13,840
how important this area of diplomacy is

112
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:16,900
now to Australia's interests in the

113
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,608
global area but there's scarcely an

114
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:20,019
international issue that you will see

115
00:04:18,608 --> 00:04:23,409
which doesn't have some kind of cyber

116
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:25,810
component in its background and really

117
00:04:23,409 --> 00:04:27,940
many of the people in in the world

118
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:30,220
I work in that world of multilateral

119
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:33,310
diplomacy and the digital world hasn't

120
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:35,770
quite made its mark if you like in into

121
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:38,740
the workplace so diplomacy is quite a

122
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:39,969
strange and arcane language and symbols

123
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:41,770
and I'll share some of that with you

124
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:43,810
because you might not even know you know

125
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:45,969
under have been made aware of that in

126
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:48,550
the past so ambassadors are appointed by

127
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:50,860
letters of credence and they're sealed

128
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:53,110
copies which are sent to kings and

129
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:54,580
queens and presidents prime ministers in

130
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:56,770
order that those credentials are

131
00:04:54,580 --> 00:05:00,039
delivered and in some countries

132
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:01,450
ambassadors present their credentials to

133
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,610
a head of state and horse-drawn carriage

134
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:05,020
there's me in a horse-drawn carriage

135
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:06,100
it's pretty pretty nifty computer work

136
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:08,409
that isn't it to get me into that

137
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:10,860
carriage certainly isn't me in that

138
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:13,000
carriage but essentially that is a

139
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:15,370
ambassador's carriage of a particular

140
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,870
country no names and your seniority is

141
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:18,340
judged on the number of horses that you

142
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:20,110
have at the front of that carriage

143
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:25,179
there's four there I would probably

144
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:26,889
require 10 no ego here at all we still

145
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:28,870
call our official language cables

146
00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:31,000
because they they were based on the

147
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:32,740
telegram telegrams that we know and

148
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,870
enjoy from the past we transact business

149
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:36,430
in notes verbally with language that

150
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:39,700
wouldn't be out of place in a Jane

151
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:41,710
Austen novel and we also de marsh people

152
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:43,150
when we're pretty upset with them so you

153
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:45,250
can see there's quite a challenge in

154
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:46,719
front of us but least of all me trying

155
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,910
to get my carriage with at least ten

156
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,789
horses on the front but in the past year

157
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:53,440
more seriously what we now know is that

158
00:05:51,789 --> 00:05:55,750
there is an increasing catalogue of

159
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,300
these instances which have global

160
00:05:55,750 --> 00:06:00,760
impacts and affect us all not pettier

161
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:03,220
and one acquire two examples of this and

162
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,599
in the last year and we know that

163
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:06,280
there's been this long-held potential

164
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:08,289
but as I say it's now being recognized

165
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:11,440
and there are course many instances that

166
00:06:08,289 --> 00:06:13,389
will never make the public profile of

167
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,610
these two instances and you'll see those

168
00:06:13,389 --> 00:06:16,960
in your jobs every day but not pettier

169
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:18,789
cause billions of dollars worth of

170
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,010
damage and and we even know that

171
00:06:18,789 --> 00:06:23,440
worryingly it impacted the radiation

172
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:25,180
monitors at Chernobyl wanna cry hits

173
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,100
hundreds of thousands of computers

174
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:29,440
worldwide 150 different countries

175
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:32,020
impacted including the National Health

176
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,580
Service in in the UK a significant

177
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:34,780
critical infrastructure impacts that

178
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:37,300
we're seeing

179
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:38,830
and what we're concerned about now is

180
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:40,090
the significance of these these

181
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:42,669
instances shouldn't be underestimated

182
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:45,400
and that states and their proxies are

183
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:47,560
viewing cyberspace as a domain to exert

184
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:50,200
influence power and we're witnessing

185
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,670
that increasingly more frequently now in

186
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:54,099
the modern era than we ever did in the

187
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:56,770
past and it's being used to undermine

188
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:58,720
the security of other countries and

189
00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:00,940
malicious and irresponsible cyber

190
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,830
activity is increasingly part of a

191
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:06,940
pattern of reckless and deliberate

192
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:08,680
conduct by States and their proxies we

193
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:11,320
think that's a growing threat to the

194
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:14,890
international security and international

195
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:17,590
stability that we know and enjoy and the

196
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:19,570
growth in scale scope and severity of

197
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:21,969
cyber instances demands more than just

198
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:24,400
that technical response the safety and

199
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:25,780
security of cyberspace we think is it

200
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,219
has a direct bearing on the

201
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:28,929
relationships between states we're

202
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:30,580
seeing that play out in your newspapers

203
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:32,980
I guarantee everyday you'll pick up a

204
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:34,960
newspaper and see some kind of cyber

205
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:36,669
incident that impacts upon the way that

206
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,890
states talk to one another and interact

207
00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:40,810
and in that increasingly globalized

208
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:42,930
world the ability of all of us to go

209
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:45,490
about our daily lives is being impacted

210
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:47,050
but we have the good foundations for the

211
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:49,000
renovation of this house that we're all

212
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:50,860
renovating together here but we don't

213
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,720
need to bulldoze that house and start

214
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:55,960
over again we think that there are

215
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,880
existing groundwork to build on in this

216
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:59,560
area and the international rules based

217
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:01,510
order it's supported the kind of

218
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,310
economic prosperity that we all enjoy in

219
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:05,650
this room and we are keen to ensure that

220
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:07,140
that continues so we're working on

221
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:09,549
implementing what we call an

222
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:11,560
international cyber stability framework

223
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:13,630
which will renovate that international

224
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:16,120
rules-based order to meet the challenge

225
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:17,680
of the digital age and our renovation

226
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,780
has five key pillars which you'll see on

227
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,100
their slide on the slide there we think

228
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:24,489
that the application of international

229
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:26,410
law to cyberspace is vital and to

230
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:29,200
developing and implementing norms of

231
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:31,000
behavior for States is important as well

232
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:33,280
three deterring and responding to

233
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,520
malicious instances is incredibly

234
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:38,530
important to and for implementing

235
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:41,559
confidence-building measures is a vital

236
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:43,299
importance of five building capacity to

237
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:44,959
manage cyber threats wherever you are in

238
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:47,270
the world is increasingly important

239
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:49,339
and these all of these things need to be

240
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:50,660
carried out on a global scale so now I'm

241
00:08:49,339 --> 00:08:53,060
going to break some of that down for you

242
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:55,100
so international law let's let's look at

243
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:57,739
that first it's a major pillar of what

244
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:59,450
we do as States cyberspace is not a nun

245
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:01,459
governed space as far as states are

246
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:03,649
concerned the domain is new but the

247
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:05,750
rules aren't the international community

248
00:09:03,649 --> 00:09:07,700
including the powers that you would

249
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:11,149
envisage being agreement on these issues

250
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:14,360
US UK China Russia we've all agreed and

251
00:09:11,149 --> 00:09:15,890
Australia included that the fundamental

252
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,720
starting point is the international law

253
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:19,819
replies in cyberspace as much as it does

254
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:21,589
in the physical space and that means

255
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:24,200
that countries need to act in accordance

256
00:09:21,589 --> 00:09:25,310
with that law and with the same legal

257
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,930
obligations that they would think about

258
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:28,339
in the physical environment too so

259
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:31,300
rather than trying to tie ourselves up

260
00:09:28,339 --> 00:09:34,220
in knots reinventing the wheel and

261
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:36,380
renegotiating new treaties which will

262
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:38,060
take decades and decades and decades we

263
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:40,790
think we have that groundwork to build

264
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:42,890
on and we just need to further in our

265
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:44,630
understanding of how international law

266
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:46,480
replies so we're making good progress on

267
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:49,339
that front and we're working well

268
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,959
secondly going to talk about norms so

269
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:53,240
we've squared away a bit about

270
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:56,029
international law as we've seen it moves

271
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:57,709
slowly but you can compliment the fact

272
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:59,750
that everything is cyberspace moves so

273
00:09:57,709 --> 00:10:02,599
fast by implementing norms which are a

274
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:04,010
bit more flexible and we can perhaps do

275
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,870
a little bit more about them well what

276
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:08,120
are what are norms I don't know in

277
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:10,070
society we have certain behavioral norms

278
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,779
I guess so when you meet and greet

279
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:14,180
somebody you might shake hands with them

280
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:15,589
that's a social norm you might kiss the

281
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:17,540
cheek of someone that you meet again

282
00:10:15,589 --> 00:10:19,550
there's societal norms behaviors that

283
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:21,529
develop to ensure that we all work

284
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:23,390
together harmoniously and have mutual

285
00:10:21,529 --> 00:10:24,709
bit of respect for each other and what

286
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:27,470
we're doing so good progress has been

287
00:10:24,709 --> 00:10:29,449
made in this area 2015 we squared away

288
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:32,420
that 11 norms of state behavior

289
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:35,089
are agreed to through UN grouping we've

290
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:36,170
put that with Australia into policy and

291
00:10:35,089 --> 00:10:37,820
what what are some of the things that

292
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:40,099
are included in that firstly countries

293
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:41,990
refrain from using cyber tools to damage

294
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,399
critical infrastructure secondly

295
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:45,980
countries should take appropriate

296
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:47,510
measures to protect their own critical

297
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:50,089
infrastructure from cyber threats and

298
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:52,160
thirdly essentially countries have a

299
00:10:50,089 --> 00:10:54,030
responsibility to investigate malicious

300
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,550
activity that's emanating from within

301
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:59,189
borders so it all sounds like basic

302
00:10:56,550 --> 00:11:01,829
stuff you might say that you've seen

303
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:04,350
some break some of those norms already

304
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:06,660
in the international arena and that's

305
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:10,200
where we think the next part of this

306
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:12,990
building work takes place which is

307
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:14,760
deterrence it's quite a tough topic to

308
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:16,860
talk about to be frank but there's no

309
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:18,270
point in having those rules unless there

310
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:20,280
are consequences for those who are

311
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:21,390
beginning to break them and that's what

312
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,650
we're seeing in the international scene

313
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:25,650
so we're working with international

314
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:28,079
partners to try and ensure that they're

315
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:30,060
being followed and this is our third

316
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:32,910
pillar at its simplest what is

317
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:34,800
deterrence is essentially making someone

318
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:36,870
else think twice before they conduct an

319
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,020
activity think about their risk calculus

320
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:41,130
you know those risks are far more

321
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:43,079
dangerous than the benefits that you'll

322
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:45,930
gain from a particular using a

323
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:48,840
particular piece of malware and we've

324
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:50,880
we've long practiced denial if you like

325
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:53,100
through creatives so it deterrence by

326
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:56,040
denial in terms of creating strong cyber

327
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:58,350
defenses and and we're working now as a

328
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:00,569
community to ensure that groups of

329
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:02,430
states increase the cost of that

330
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:04,470
inappropriate behavior we can't do this

331
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:07,589
alone it has to be through coordinated

332
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:09,210
efforts and I think you know as I

333
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:10,590
suggested there are states who think

334
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:14,040
they were immune to some of these issues

335
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:16,020
through issues like not pettier through

336
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:18,300
through wanna cry that these rules don't

337
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:21,120
apply to them but they do and we need to

338
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:22,890
change that and such responses that we

339
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,690
eventually take don't have to be through

340
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:25,710
cytonemes

341
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:27,150
probably will rarely be through cyber

342
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:28,410
means but they could involve all the

343
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:30,420
different levers that you have at your

344
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:34,020
disposal diplomatic measures legal

345
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:36,060
measures policing actions economic or

346
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:37,290
even in worst case scenarios military

347
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:39,989
measures it totally depends on the

348
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:42,329
incident but they should also include

349
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:44,460
you in novel ways of responding and

350
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:47,100
combining different levers of government

351
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:49,230
and also broad a private sector that you

352
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:51,420
might have and we need to understand as

353
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:53,700
so much of this capability exists in the

354
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:57,270
private sector how do we work on these

355
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:58,530
kinds of deterrence issues with you now

356
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:59,760
some of you are probably thinking you

357
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:01,980
know this will start off very nice

358
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,600
there's an ambassador on stage who's a

359
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:05,250
diplomat no none of this sounds very

360
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,010
diplomatic sounds like he's quite an

361
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:09,529
aggressive bloke

362
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:11,930
and you're probably you know wondering

363
00:13:09,529 --> 00:13:16,040
how can we do this if you don't know who

364
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:17,750
did it well doc our objective overall is

365
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:19,579
to have stability in cyberspace we don't

366
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:21,290
want another governed environment where

367
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:22,580
nobody stands to benefit and we're

368
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:23,980
worried about who's around the next

369
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:26,029
corner

370
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:27,770
but what we're understanding now

371
00:13:26,029 --> 00:13:30,170
increasingly is that attribution isn't

372
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:32,420
quite as hard and isn't impossible as

373
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:34,640
many used to say we're getting better at

374
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:36,740
that and I can assure you Australia's

375
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,970
getting much much better at this and we

376
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:39,650
can assure you that also that our

377
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:42,050
response is as and when they take place

378
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:44,689
will be proportionate and consistent

379
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:46,760
with domestic and international law we

380
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:48,350
are responsible state actors and what we

381
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:51,110
are saying is we're calling on all

382
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:53,650
countries to be responsible in the

383
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:55,850
activities that they take

384
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:57,140
confidence-building measures so this

385
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:59,870
renovation is getting a little bit

386
00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:02,000
serious now it's important to reinforce

387
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:04,400
the pillars that we're rebuilding this

388
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,350
house in so the fourth pillar is

389
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,760
confidence-building measures that we

390
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:09,620
want to build this time and they foster

391
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,030
trust between countries to prevent

392
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:15,230
misunderstandings that could potentially

393
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:17,630
lead to conflict and so when when we

394
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:19,640
respond to these malicious actors States

395
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:21,439
are confident that we're doing so with

396
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:23,900
solid justification and within the

397
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,790
boundaries of international law one of

398
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:28,640
the well well-known confidence-building

399
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:29,990
measures is the red phone which exists

400
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:31,160
between the Kremlin and the White House

401
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:32,750
so they can pick up the phone have

402
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:34,459
direct access and if anything goes wrong

403
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:36,050
they know they can actually have a

404
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:38,450
clearer understanding of what might be

405
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:39,670
there so what are some of these ways you

406
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:43,580
do confidence-building measures

407
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:45,199
transparency dialogue bringing in

408
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:46,970
broader stakeholders as well into that

409
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:48,470
conversation and the sharing of views on

410
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:51,760
different issues just getting a clearer

411
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:51,760
understanding of where you stand

412
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:56,750
risk reduction measures Australia and

413
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:58,160
Malaysia for example we're leading a

414
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:00,320
piece of work in trying to make sure

415
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,360
that we have workable points of contact

416
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:05,089
across this region so we know exactly

417
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:07,339
who to call if something goes wrong we

418
00:15:05,089 --> 00:15:09,740
know when and where to call someone and

419
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:12,980
that person can action what we're asking

420
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:14,750
them to action so for example if if an

421
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:16,670
attack on Australia appeared to be

422
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:18,290
originating from New Zealand we would

423
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:19,500
know exactly who to call and discuss the

424
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:22,810
issue with

425
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:24,940
and we also have a whole cooperative

426
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:26,319
program in australia's cooperation

427
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:28,000
program and this brings me on to the

428
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,640
final pillar which is capacity building

429
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,520
and this is where we assist in building

430
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:36,010
other sectors and other countries in

431
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:37,840
having the ability to join this

432
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:40,630
international cyber stability framework

433
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:43,060
and the private sector have a huge job

434
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:44,980
in assisting and working in this area to

435
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:46,680
will stand to benefit from better cyber

436
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:50,050
security in the region don't we and

437
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:51,729
globally so we set up the rules of the

438
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:54,040
road with international law and norms

439
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:55,810
carried and and said they're called out

440
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:58,420
we'll call out those countries that

441
00:15:55,810 --> 00:16:00,369
don't actually comply with those rules

442
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:02,050
and norms that we put in place we build

443
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:04,300
trust between states we need to ensure

444
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:06,579
that all countries are able to protect

445
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:08,380
themselves so what is Australia doing in

446
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:10,360
this regard we're investing thirty

447
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:12,250
million dollars over four years in

448
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,200
assisting countries in building their

449
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:16,360
capacities and capabilities in order

450
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:18,280
that they can also be part of this

451
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:20,770
international cyber stability framework

452
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:24,010
one of the key areas we work on is is

453
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:25,900
focusing on cybercrime were hansung

454
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:27,640
countries abilities to respond and

455
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:30,220
investigate instances through working

456
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:31,720
with their legislative measures with

457
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:33,670
their judiciary's with their with their

458
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:36,250
cybercrime experts in order that they

459
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:37,959
can really raise themselves up to the

460
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:40,420
task and another priority is cyber

461
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:41,980
incident response measures we're working

462
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:43,780
hard and investing in the region to

463
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:46,300
ensure that there's a better joint

464
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:48,880
capability in that area and in the

465
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:50,620
Pacific we're working hard on on an

466
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,270
organization called Paks on which is a

467
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:54,280
network of cybersecurity response

468
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:56,740
professionals in trying to share best

469
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:58,329
practice and make sure that they are

470
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:00,220
raising the bar together with a

471
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:02,260
sustainable capability and the region

472
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:05,620
will be stronger if we have stronger and

473
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:09,339
more capable nations in cybersecurity as

474
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:11,020
a whole so as we reach the end what are

475
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:12,550
making key conclusions apart from the

476
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:14,319
fact that I don't have a carriage of 10

477
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:16,270
horses which I do have to go home and

478
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:19,359
get something done about it so my life

479
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:21,099
isn't all parties either I kind of wish

480
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:22,419
it was but it's not the case don't think

481
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:24,520
for a second I sit there and lots of

482
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:26,920
parties at Embassy receptions I don't

483
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:28,510
actually do that a lot at all I'm often

484
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:30,490
they're not on planes carrying out the

485
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:32,658
diplomacy trying to ensure that all of

486
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:35,059
these issues are dealt with by differ

487
00:17:32,659 --> 00:17:38,330
countries in our partners and this

488
00:17:35,059 --> 00:17:40,970
renovation it's complex it's slow burn

489
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:42,769
at times it's multifaceted and we're

490
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:45,109
trying to adapt that international rules

491
00:17:42,769 --> 00:17:46,909
based order in order that it really does

492
00:17:45,109 --> 00:17:48,830
meet the challenge of the digital age in

493
00:17:46,909 --> 00:17:50,869
which we're in and despite the

494
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:52,908
criticisms that you see quite regularly

495
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:54,228
at the international wars based order we

496
00:17:52,909 --> 00:17:55,999
think has been that cornerstone of

497
00:17:54,229 --> 00:17:59,059
economic growth and prosperity again

498
00:17:55,999 --> 00:18:01,220
that we all enjoy in this room and if we

499
00:17:59,059 --> 00:18:02,928
reinforce those five pillars of the

500
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:05,479
international cyber stability framework

501
00:18:02,929 --> 00:18:07,609
it'll ensure that in cyberspace we have

502
00:18:05,479 --> 00:18:10,249
a prosperous future in cyberspace and

503
00:18:07,609 --> 00:18:11,989
not so much of a dangerous one in

504
00:18:10,249 --> 00:18:14,090
actions in cyberspace that threaten

505
00:18:11,989 --> 00:18:16,970
international peace and stability really

506
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:18,408
should not be tolerated and we as a

507
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:20,779
country and as groups of countries

508
00:18:18,409 --> 00:18:22,700
should be upholding the international

509
00:18:20,779 --> 00:18:25,369
rules based order online just as we do

510
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:26,989
offline and if you like it's not it's

511
00:18:25,369 --> 00:18:28,939
not we're not we're renovating here

512
00:18:26,989 --> 00:18:30,559
we're not demolishing and we don't need

513
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:33,200
to demolish the international voice

514
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:35,029
based order for God's sake we need to

515
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,499
understand renovations are difficult you

516
00:18:35,029 --> 00:18:38,149
need to retain the character of the

517
00:18:36,499 --> 00:18:40,039
building that you need to modernize it

518
00:18:38,149 --> 00:18:42,469
to make sure that it's ready for

519
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:43,940
everything they're set to come so all of

520
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:46,460
us in this room have a responsibility

521
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:49,429
and an interest in ensuring that that

522
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:51,470
happens and as renovations are made I

523
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:53,899
think many hands make light work so I'm

524
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:56,570
enjoying that enjoying being here but

525
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:58,998
also enjoying inviting you all to be

526
00:18:56,570 --> 00:19:00,529
part of this journey and make sure that

527
00:18:58,999 --> 00:19:02,239
we would take the international

528
00:19:00,529 --> 00:19:02,749
water-based order in for the 21st

529
00:19:02,239 --> 00:19:04,909
century

530
00:19:02,749 --> 00:19:07,929
and make it right for the digital age

531
00:19:04,909 --> 00:19:07,929
thank you

532
00:19:08,029 --> 00:19:10,090
you
