1
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:13,610
this just in 50 million customers data

2
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:15,440
was not compromised this will link in a

3
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:23,470
security breach that didn't happen Wall

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:25,509
Street not rattled at all everything

5
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:28,310
thank you with threat intelligence

6
00:00:25,509 --> 00:00:31,669
behavioral analytics play lesson 6,000

7
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:40,489
experts you saw then IBM security will

8
00:00:31,669 --> 00:00:42,440
help keep you out of the news so I want

9
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:45,710
to start right now talking about every

10
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:49,250
single person in this room so as humans

11
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:51,650
were wired to detect danger and we're

12
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:54,470
constantly scanning for threats and our

13
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:58,070
brains react much more quickly and

14
00:00:54,470 --> 00:01:01,519
powerfully and persistently to bad news

15
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:03,800
versus good news and this is what

16
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,900
behavioral scientists call a negativity

17
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,399
bias or a negative bias and it's not

18
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:09,920
such a bad thing actually it's what

19
00:01:07,399 --> 00:01:13,729
helped us or helped us as a species

20
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,799
survive but it's also a big reason why

21
00:01:13,729 --> 00:01:19,549
we sometimes ignore when things are

22
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:20,810
going well and we see this in research

23
00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:23,030
over and over there's been a lot of

24
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:25,909
research on negativity bias but we also

25
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:27,499
see it in our personal lives too so for

26
00:01:25,909 --> 00:01:29,990
a moment just imagine that you're

27
00:01:27,499 --> 00:01:31,670
outside okay outside by the marina and

28
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:33,530
you've got your workout clothes on and

29
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:35,209
you're ready to go for a jog but there

30
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:37,520
just happens to be really really strong

31
00:01:35,209 --> 00:01:39,079
winds coming right at you and you're

32
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,490
running right into that wind

33
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:42,648
what are you thinking about when the

34
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:44,270
winds in your face you're thinking about

35
00:01:42,649 --> 00:01:45,469
gosh I wish this was over if you're if

36
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,689
you're me you're just giving up you're

37
00:01:45,469 --> 00:01:48,859
done waiting for a better day now if you

38
00:01:47,689 --> 00:01:50,089
turn around and go in the opposite

39
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:51,889
direction and the wind is at your back

40
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:54,109
what are you thinking well maybe for a

41
00:01:51,889 --> 00:01:56,630
split second you're thinking that wow I

42
00:01:54,109 --> 00:02:00,109
felt good but then you move on to other

43
00:01:56,630 --> 00:02:02,449
things she sort of obsessive and don't

44
00:02:00,109 --> 00:02:04,098
obsess about the positive and I see this

45
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:05,569
in my own family actually when my family

46
00:02:04,099 --> 00:02:07,429
gets together for holidays and we start

47
00:02:05,569 --> 00:02:08,990
talking about memories it's always a

48
00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:11,120
memory like this when I was five years

49
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:13,070
old and I was running in my basement and

50
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,460
I tripped over Legos it's always Legos

51
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:19,700
and I split my head open

52
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:21,650
it was traumatic these are the things

53
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:24,140
that we remember the negative things

54
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:25,640
sometimes and certainly in the press the

55
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:27,769
old saying goes if it bleeds it leads

56
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:29,899
and that's for a reason people pay

57
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:31,370
attention to the negative and that's why

58
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:33,230
I like that opening video so much

59
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:35,600
because it sort of plays a trick on our

60
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:37,519
minds and makes us focus on the positive

61
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:40,310
especially in this industry we're in

62
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:44,990
cybersecurity and the message there is

63
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:47,570
that it's not all bad news we have made

64
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:48,590
fantastic progress in security we have

65
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:50,930
made progress

66
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:54,470
I mean look no further into your pockets

67
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:56,390
take out your mobile phone and marvel

68
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:58,280
out all the security features that are

69
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:59,089
embedded within it you've got two factor

70
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:03,040
authentication

71
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:05,420
you've got authenticated applications

72
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,679
default encryption all the way down to

73
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:09,200
the hardware layer and we're seeing this

74
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:11,060
in other aspects of Technology operating

75
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:14,209
systems are incorporating this in the

76
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:16,490
data center mainframes etc and it's not

77
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:19,730
just technology we've seen progress in

78
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:23,090
leadership in security as well it was

79
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:24,799
with a group of CISOs just yesterday ten

80
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:26,660
chief security chief information

81
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:30,050
security officers from this region and

82
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:31,549
they were they were remembering how it

83
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:33,110
used to be only a few years ago when you

84
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:35,150
could just walk into a boardroom meeting

85
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:37,370
and give an update or talk to their

86
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:39,170
peers of the CEO even the CIO and you

87
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:40,850
could dazzle them with a story about the

88
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:44,019
latest threat there's only a few years

89
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:47,440
ago now it's not the same security

90
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:49,490
leaders are being challenged by others

91
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,440
they're getting tough questions act

92
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:53,870
asked them and that is a sign of

93
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,660
progress but sometimes progress happens

94
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:58,730
actually fairly slow ok much like a

95
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:00,380
progress bar and I know you've all have

96
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:02,420
installed software in your life and what

97
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:04,850
happens when the progress bar extols for

98
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:06,410
a minute it only takes a minute that's a

99
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:07,640
long time a second you start thinking

100
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:09,980
something's going wrong here I want to

101
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:13,279
start over but sometimes progress takes

102
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:14,720
a long time and we have had wins and

103
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,310
security actually bet that just about

104
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,988
everybody in this room has successfully

105
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:20,000
stopped some sort of cyber attack just

106
00:04:17,988 --> 00:04:21,829
doing basic hygiene maybe you work in a

107
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,640
sock you're doing amazing work we do

108
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:27,050
amazing work in this industry so maybe

109
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,219
it's up to me is a representative of

110
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:29,690
somebody whose work

111
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:33,650
for a company that's been around for a

112
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:35,090
hundred and seven years 107 years IBM to

113
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:36,890
say that we're taking the long game we

114
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:38,810
must take the long game in security

115
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:42,580
there's there's no magic solution here

116
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:45,560
but sometimes to make visible progress

117
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:48,859
to make big leaps in a tough area

118
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:51,880
complex area like security it takes big

119
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:57,230
bets big bets to make visible progress

120
00:04:51,880 --> 00:05:00,020
now before you paint me as a dumbfounded

121
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:02,570
optimist outta touch you know I do

122
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:05,390
realize and I empathize because I meet

123
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:08,800
with customers every day that we're in a

124
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:11,599
tough fight a tough fight in security

125
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,920
it's almost cliche to say is very cliche

126
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,150
to say that attackers are getting more

127
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,220
sophisticated but they are they're

128
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:18,710
working more in groups they're using

129
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:21,470
modern techniques to divide their labor

130
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:24,500
to work together and it doesn't take

131
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:26,840
much anymore to get access to zero to

132
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:30,020
exploits to be able to rent some

133
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:32,030
machines to work with others on the dark

134
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:34,159
web and kick off a campaign and then you

135
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:36,799
think about that's just kind of the

136
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,660
novices what are more seasoned criminals

137
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,520
doing what they're doing is they're

138
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:42,830
causing us a lot of pain and it's

139
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:45,740
costing us a lot of money it's a fortune

140
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:47,030
so let's walk into this and just set

141
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:49,700
some context for how much it's costing

142
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:51,650
us so we have the privilege of working

143
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:53,180
with the Ponemon Institute putting

144
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:54,919
together a study on the cost of a data

145
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:57,200
breach and this isn't any other you know

146
00:05:54,919 --> 00:06:01,190
marketing study it's a true study that's

147
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:02,539
been going on for over 13 years and just

148
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:05,510
last year the Ponemon Institute

149
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:07,460
interviewed over 500 companies who

150
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:10,070
exhibited a breach in the previous

151
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:11,719
calendar year they asked him a lot of

152
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:14,270
questions about what are the costs or

153
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:16,160
the technical costs or the operational

154
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:18,620
costs what are the hidden costs like

155
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:21,200
lost money from business that was not

156
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:22,729
able to be obtained and what they found

157
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,530
is that all across the world that those

158
00:06:22,729 --> 00:06:26,810
costs are rising and in fact here in

159
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:28,760
Singapore alone the average cost of a

160
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:32,810
data breach is about 3.4 million dollars

161
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:37,909
and that cost has risen since last year

162
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:39,169
about 6% and as you dig into this report

163
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:40,490
and I encourage you to do that I'd

164
00:06:39,169 --> 00:06:42,120
encourage you to dig into the support

165
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:44,699
there is reams of information

166
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:48,750
by region geo there's one fascinating

167
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:50,550
thing about the number one factor that

168
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:53,190
attributes to these high costs and it's

169
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:57,300
the time that it takes to successfully

170
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:58,680
identify and contain that breach so what

171
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,720
do you think the average time is to

172
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:03,510
contain or identify and contain a breach

173
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:06,210
thirty days sixty days a month or two

174
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:09,870
it's way worse than that the average

175
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:11,310
time if you're an average sized company

176
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:12,900
and we're talking about a breach of

177
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:15,240
about a hundred thousand records or less

178
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:18,620
it takes almost two hundred and sixty

179
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:24,240
seven days to identify and contain that

180
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:25,860
195 to identify 72 to contain it now to

181
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,600
put that in perspective I have three

182
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:29,190
young children that's about the time it

183
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:32,729
takes for them to get through and

184
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:34,050
progress a year in school for those of

185
00:07:32,729 --> 00:07:35,520
you who don't have kids another

186
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:37,800
perspective that's about the time it

187
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:41,010
takes to launch a spacecraft from Earth

188
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,960
to Mars when the orbits align two

189
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:45,330
hundred and sixty days fifty-five

190
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,400
million kilometers away it's just a way

191
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:48,870
of saying that that's too long okay it's

192
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,370
too long now what if you could cut down

193
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:53,370
some of that time what if you could

194
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:55,050
subtract a hundred days that it took you

195
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:57,060
to identify and contain the breach then

196
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:58,950
you could save actually about a million

197
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,990
over a million dollars that's the lost

198
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:04,490
opportunity here now if you identified

199
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:06,900
it really early then there's no cost

200
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:08,370
then you're really preventing the

201
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,229
threats which is what we all strive for

202
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:11,940
now saying we have to get better at this

203
00:08:10,229 --> 00:08:14,370
and saying it takes too long that's easy

204
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:18,449
it's easy to say right it's very tough

205
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:21,180
and practice to do very tough now I

206
00:08:18,449 --> 00:08:23,039
think it's time we also made some big

207
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:27,090
bets when it comes to making progress

208
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:29,520
for this area as well so that's why I

209
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:31,169
want to talk today about what we

210
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,949
described is securities new force

211
00:08:31,169 --> 00:08:37,529
multipliers and what is a force

212
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:40,500
multiplier okay a force multiplier is

213
00:08:37,529 --> 00:08:42,870
when you combine the best of say man and

214
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,520
machine to get an exponential result the

215
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:46,170
term comes from physics where you have a

216
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:48,329
simple machine that you do a little bit

217
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:50,099
of effort and you get exponential

218
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:51,480
progress out of that it also comes from

219
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:56,190
the military in a more complex

220
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:58,829
environment where soldiers are augmented

221
00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:02,279
with gear satellites intelligence

222
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:03,959
analysts aircraft tankers and that

223
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:06,000
individual unit or that individual

224
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:07,229
soldier can do much more than they than

225
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,750
they could possibly do if they didn't

226
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:12,689
have that right so what are the force

227
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:13,949
multipliers we have in security so I'm

228
00:09:12,689 --> 00:09:15,870
gonna walk through three of them today

229
00:09:13,949 --> 00:09:17,849
and the ultimate goal is to make

230
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:20,129
everybody everybody in this room

231
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:23,579
everybody in the industry get smarter

232
00:09:20,129 --> 00:09:29,430
respond faster and work together smarter

233
00:09:23,579 --> 00:09:30,599
faster together that's the aim and how

234
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:33,479
many people we have in the room right

235
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:35,879
room up to a thousand thousand we get

236
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,290
I'm trying to make this room this room

237
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:38,790
with a thousand do the work of ten

238
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:40,829
thousand and if they get that right and

239
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:42,990
work together effectively and get

240
00:09:40,829 --> 00:09:44,189
smarter that group of ten thousand can

241
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:46,290
do the work of a hundred thousand this

242
00:09:44,189 --> 00:09:48,149
is how we make significant improvement

243
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:50,099
when we're facing a skills gap when we

244
00:09:48,149 --> 00:09:51,930
don't have enough people so let's walk

245
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,279
through the three of these okay I'm

246
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:55,109
gonna start with the first one so the

247
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,759
first one is augmented intelligence now

248
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:59,730
I know there's a lot that's been said at

249
00:09:56,759 --> 00:10:01,290
this show and Beyond around AI augmented

250
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:03,449
intelligence machine learning so let's

251
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:05,490
dig in a little bit I want you to think

252
00:10:03,449 --> 00:10:08,839
about this a little bit differently okay

253
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:12,300
so the way I like to think about

254
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:13,889
augmented intelligence think about

255
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:16,589
somebody that you know who's an expert

256
00:10:13,889 --> 00:10:18,720
in their field okay and they might be in

257
00:10:16,589 --> 00:10:20,459
finance and they look at an Excel spread

258
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:25,139
and they just can see something in the

259
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:28,109
data or a chess grandmaster who just

260
00:10:25,139 --> 00:10:31,230
looks at the board and can instantly

261
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:33,449
know what's going on that's actually

262
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:36,149
what chess grandmasters have said they

263
00:10:33,449 --> 00:10:38,758
do they rely on some sort of intuition

264
00:10:36,149 --> 00:10:40,680
that they've built up that they can

265
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:44,130
instantly notice and recognize the

266
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:45,420
position of where they're at and there

267
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:47,220
have been studies around this as well

268
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:49,349
where they've taken chess grandmasters

269
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:52,259
and amateurs and they've analyzed their

270
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:54,420
brain waves to see what's going on when

271
00:10:52,259 --> 00:10:56,970
they're playing a game and the amateur

272
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:58,110
when the chessboard is laid out they're

273
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:59,309
trying to figure out and use their

274
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:00,779
cognitive part of their brain to

275
00:10:59,309 --> 00:11:01,980
understand what's going on to look at

276
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:04,199
all moves to really think through

277
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:06,660
everything chess grandmaster actually

278
00:11:04,199 --> 00:11:08,579
retrieves from memory from a different

279
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:10,019
part of the brain exactly what's going

280
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:12,238
on almost like if you were to put

281
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:13,350
five or six items out on a table I could

282
00:11:12,239 --> 00:11:15,269
tell you that there were five or six

283
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:17,040
items without thinking about it I didn't

284
00:11:15,269 --> 00:11:17,929
count one two three four five I just

285
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,420
knew

286
00:11:17,929 --> 00:11:22,860
and so that's some sort of superhuman

287
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:24,839
intelligence that they've built up

288
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:26,670
playing thousands and thousands and

289
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:29,519
thousands of hours of the game the only

290
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:30,748
thing that I can compare to is in the

291
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:34,199
morning when I'm in the shower

292
00:11:30,749 --> 00:11:35,699
bear with me and I'm thinking about my

293
00:11:34,199 --> 00:11:37,889
day and I'm trying to do something

294
00:11:35,699 --> 00:11:40,920
creative that day and it's on my mind I

295
00:11:37,889 --> 00:11:43,769
pause and I'm like did I just wash my

296
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:46,139
hair I have no idea I have to you know

297
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:47,489
ask myself a minotaur to figure out that

298
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:48,899
I wash my hair this happens to me all

299
00:11:47,489 --> 00:11:50,699
the time but my body just kind of took

300
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:53,819
over I'm using the cognitive part and

301
00:11:50,699 --> 00:11:56,639
the rest of it just happened now not

302
00:11:53,819 --> 00:11:58,949
that superpower but more like the expert

303
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,809
in their field what if you had expert

304
00:11:58,949 --> 00:12:02,069
intelligence at your fingertips if you

305
00:12:00,809 --> 00:12:04,949
were trying to respond to an incident

306
00:12:02,069 --> 00:12:07,829
and that's where we've been moving with

307
00:12:04,949 --> 00:12:11,069
augmented intelligence at IBM we had

308
00:12:07,829 --> 00:12:14,029
this very ambitious goal to teach a

309
00:12:11,069 --> 00:12:17,729
machine the language of cybersecurity

310
00:12:14,029 --> 00:12:19,529
and why did we do that well we noticed

311
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:21,899
within security operation centers

312
00:12:19,529 --> 00:12:24,119
security analysts I'm based in Atlanta

313
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:26,369
Georgia in the US we've had a sock there

314
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:28,860
for as long as I can remember 20 years

315
00:12:26,369 --> 00:12:30,569
in fact and the sock analysts on their

316
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:32,009
break what do they do they talk to one

317
00:12:30,569 --> 00:12:33,809
another they might come back from a

318
00:12:32,009 --> 00:12:34,889
conference like this at RSA and describe

319
00:12:33,809 --> 00:12:37,529
what they learned they might read

320
00:12:34,889 --> 00:12:39,809
research papers documents blogs SEC

321
00:12:37,529 --> 00:12:42,839
lists org they're there they're trying

322
00:12:39,809 --> 00:12:44,899
to find information and it's not just

323
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:47,339
codified threat Intel it's also

324
00:12:44,899 --> 00:12:49,529
intelligence from written accounts from

325
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:51,600
other researchers so we had an ambitious

326
00:12:49,529 --> 00:12:53,160
goal to try to go ahead and teach Watson

327
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,990
the language of cybersecurity so it

328
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:57,089
could retrieve and build a corpus of

329
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:59,910
knowledge just like humans do and it

330
00:12:57,089 --> 00:13:01,350
took a long time and we fed it thousands

331
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:03,269
and thousands of documents but it's

332
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:04,949
building a corpus of knowledge from

333
00:13:03,269 --> 00:13:07,319
those that body of intelligence and

334
00:13:04,949 --> 00:13:09,449
we're actually now allowing customers

335
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:11,488
and analysts to tap into that when

336
00:13:09,449 --> 00:13:13,290
they're trying to find out whether or

337
00:13:11,489 --> 00:13:15,720
not there's something they should dig

338
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:17,759
into within the sock it's augmenting

339
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,709
their Intel which is quite fantastic and

340
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:21,720
it's taking in investigations that

341
00:13:19,709 --> 00:13:23,729
sometimes would require a couple google

342
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,889
searches and possibly a hit it's

343
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:29,070
coming back with real intelligence

344
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:30,360
quickly taking what might take hours

345
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:32,639
down down to minutes

346
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,500
that's superhuman intelligence we need

347
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,300
for the sock I'm not going to go

348
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,860
in-depth on other types of AI but

349
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,880
certainly machine learning is a big deal

350
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:41,279
and you're gonna hear about it on the

351
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,110
show for and in other talks it's making

352
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,430
an impact and I should say security is

353
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:46,860
no stranger to machine learning we've

354
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:48,750
been using machine learning in various

355
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:52,350
forms for decades that's how everybody's

356
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:53,880
email inboxes have been filtered but

357
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:56,100
because of the new tools that we have

358
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:57,810
around this area we've been applying it

359
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:59,610
to things like source code analysis to

360
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:01,709
identify false positives and it's

361
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:05,610
working really great because instead of

362
00:14:01,709 --> 00:14:07,469
being driven by patterns it learns the

363
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:10,260
way in which a human programs which is

364
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:12,329
hard to write pattern analysis around or

365
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:14,370
user behavior analytics where it's very

366
00:14:12,329 --> 00:14:16,290
hard to understand what all of us do in

367
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:19,589
our daily lives to know whether or not

368
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:21,899
we're acting appropriately so instead of

369
00:14:19,589 --> 00:14:25,320
programming a machine to identify via

370
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:27,180
triggers you baseline and learn and then

371
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:28,440
it can identify what's abnormal so

372
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,819
machine learning is helping out here

373
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:32,550
that's the first force multiplier

374
00:14:29,819 --> 00:14:36,000
augmented intelligence the second force

375
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:36,810
multiplier is security orchestration so

376
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,610
the way I want you to think about

377
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:41,310
security orchestration is this now

378
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:43,500
you're a pilot okay now you're a pilot

379
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:45,180
just like this and you've just taken off

380
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,949
and you're two minutes into a flight

381
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:48,839
with a hundred and fifty passengers in

382
00:14:46,949 --> 00:14:52,560
the back you hit a flock of birds and

383
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:55,250
both your engines go out that's exactly

384
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:57,449
what happened almost 10 years ago so

385
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:59,250
famous they made a movie about it

386
00:14:57,449 --> 00:15:01,229
starring Tom Hanks I'm sure you've heard

387
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:03,000
about the miracle on the Hudson so what

388
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:05,310
a captain solely do the pilot of that

389
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,500
plane immediately he put the nose down

390
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:08,670
immediately he talked to the copilot and

391
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:11,519
they went through a three page tech

392
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:13,380
checklist he radioed air tower air

393
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,940
traffic control they ground stopped all

394
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:16,740
the flights from where they took off and

395
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:18,540
then he had to make a split-second

396
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:20,190
decision using his own intuition of what

397
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:22,199
to do next and he landed the plane in

398
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:24,899
the Hudson and everybody was saved

399
00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:25,410
nobody got hurt no casualties it's a

400
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:27,389
miracle

401
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:29,130
well the miracle happened because he was

402
00:15:27,389 --> 00:15:30,839
trained the miracle happened because he

403
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:33,149
had a plan and playbooks the miracle

404
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:34,709
happened because he was following a set

405
00:15:33,149 --> 00:15:37,379
of procedures and he had the right data

406
00:15:34,709 --> 00:15:39,179
at the right time the right people

407
00:15:37,379 --> 00:15:41,129
to make the right decision and that's on

408
00:15:39,179 --> 00:15:43,379
not unlike what we deal today in a

409
00:15:41,129 --> 00:15:45,809
crisis with incident responders if

410
00:15:43,379 --> 00:15:49,649
there's a breach and so defining

411
00:15:45,809 --> 00:15:51,389
playbooks is a big big area where

412
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:53,069
there's so many steps there's not one

413
00:15:51,389 --> 00:15:55,229
person within an organization that knows

414
00:15:53,069 --> 00:15:57,839
all the steps around any given incident

415
00:15:55,229 --> 00:16:00,179
who to contact what to do how much time

416
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:02,279
it takes what the consequences are

417
00:16:00,179 --> 00:16:04,529
that's why defining those steps in an

418
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:08,609
incident response set of playbooks is so

419
00:16:04,529 --> 00:16:10,169
important it's so important and it takes

420
00:16:08,609 --> 00:16:11,879
what could be a complicated mess of

421
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:14,129
steps that no single person could

422
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:16,229
understand and it puts it into a process

423
00:16:14,129 --> 00:16:18,809
that can be repeated such that you can

424
00:16:16,229 --> 00:16:20,459
do things in drills that might take

425
00:16:18,809 --> 00:16:22,409
eighty five minutes now you're taking it

426
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:23,819
down to ten minutes or you have triggers

427
00:16:22,409 --> 00:16:26,519
with the right people involved its

428
00:16:23,819 --> 00:16:29,728
coordination at its finest and this is

429
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:32,189
all about orchestration now it's not

430
00:16:29,729 --> 00:16:34,949
just enough to orchestrate you also have

431
00:16:32,189 --> 00:16:36,689
to practice so you can have play books

432
00:16:34,949 --> 00:16:39,809
and write them down and do tabletop

433
00:16:36,689 --> 00:16:42,329
exercises but my favorite saying here is

434
00:16:39,809 --> 00:16:45,358
nobody has ever learned how to swim from

435
00:16:42,329 --> 00:16:46,888
watching YouTube videos I have a

436
00:16:45,359 --> 00:16:48,449
three-year-old she's not learning how to

437
00:16:46,889 --> 00:16:50,579
swim by watching youtube videos you got

438
00:16:48,449 --> 00:16:52,049
to get in the water and you have to test

439
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:53,638
those muscles you have to be in an

440
00:16:52,049 --> 00:16:58,319
environment where you can fail and you

441
00:16:53,639 --> 00:17:00,149
can work together and that's what cyber

442
00:16:58,319 --> 00:17:01,978
ranges are all about and not just any

443
00:17:00,149 --> 00:17:03,869
cyber ranges right cyber ranges

444
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:05,429
historically have been technical places

445
00:17:03,869 --> 00:17:07,379
where you gather packet capture

446
00:17:05,429 --> 00:17:08,939
information and you dive into tools and

447
00:17:07,378 --> 00:17:10,829
analyze malware I'm not talking about

448
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:12,929
that at all I'm talking about places

449
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:16,678
where you can test cyber security

450
00:17:12,929 --> 00:17:18,389
leadership skills in moment of crisis we

451
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:21,029
built the cyber range around that and

452
00:17:18,388 --> 00:17:23,309
it's been widely successful over 1,500

453
00:17:21,029 --> 00:17:26,579
security professionals heads of state

454
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:28,289
CEOs various leaders have come into this

455
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:31,019
and they get in with their team and we

456
00:17:28,289 --> 00:17:32,940
simulate a breach and then we figure out

457
00:17:31,019 --> 00:17:36,029
who's gonna lean in and who's gonna lean

458
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:38,850
back it's all about that leadership and

459
00:17:36,029 --> 00:17:41,460
we've learned three things here from

460
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:44,340
running these exercises one culture

461
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:45,929
counts so when there is a crisis if you

462
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:48,149
have a culture within your company to

463
00:17:45,929 --> 00:17:50,070
empower the people who work for that

464
00:17:48,149 --> 00:17:51,110
organization to make decisions you're

465
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:55,010
far better off

466
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:57,080
that's number one number two you may

467
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:58,700
define playbooks but when the heat is on

468
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:00,559
all bets are off

469
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:03,110
so you got to practice them because they

470
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:04,879
crack under pressure and number three

471
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:06,678
which is the most surprising for us is

472
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,840
that sometimes you think the best

473
00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:11,120
leaders during a crisis are going to be

474
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:12,439
ones that run the organization now

475
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,418
what's a common thread about people who

476
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:16,880
typically run organizations well they

477
00:18:14,419 --> 00:18:19,190
probably have MBAs they've probably been

478
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,990
taught over there history to analyze

479
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:23,000
vast amounts of data make slow

480
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:25,370
deliberate decisions these are not the

481
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,980
people that you want necessarily to be

482
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:29,439
the leaders if there is a crisis so who

483
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:32,029
does really well in these scenarios

484
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:34,220
people with military experience people

485
00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:36,590
with emergency medicine people who are

486
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:39,049
cool and calm under pressure and can

487
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:41,750
make decisions quickly with conviction

488
00:18:39,049 --> 00:18:44,658
and again assess what's going on very

489
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:47,120
very quickly so that's the second force

490
00:18:44,659 --> 00:18:49,460
multiplier orchestration and as a part

491
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,649
of that you've got a practice and then

492
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:54,260
finally the third force multiplier here

493
00:18:51,649 --> 00:18:57,289
is open collaboration so we have a full

494
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:59,120
room here people from different parts of

495
00:18:57,289 --> 00:19:03,260
the globe different organizations

496
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:04,879
different professions but there's one

497
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:07,669
thing that unites all of us and then

498
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:10,880
everyone who might be watching this in

499
00:19:07,669 --> 00:19:12,799
the in video form we all are here

500
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,440
because we want to make the world a

501
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:17,389
safer place we want to protect our

502
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,830
society our organizations we're all here

503
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:21,289
for security and so we have to work

504
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:23,689
together better as an industry as a

505
00:19:21,289 --> 00:19:26,210
community and there's been a lot that's

506
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:27,380
been talked about here I don't have

507
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:29,419
enough time to go through all the

508
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:31,460
details of security collaboration but I

509
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:33,409
do want to say something I do want to

510
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:37,220
challenge everybody in this room or

511
00:19:33,409 --> 00:19:40,850
anybody who's watching ok if you're a

512
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:42,830
customer or a vendor vendors open up

513
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:44,539
your tools as much as you can so that

514
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:46,580
they work with other tools so that they

515
00:19:44,539 --> 00:19:49,429
integrate properly share information

516
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:52,100
share action we're all better off for it

517
00:19:49,429 --> 00:19:56,149
if you're a customer demand that your

518
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:58,158
vendors do that if you're a security

519
00:19:56,149 --> 00:20:00,168
researcher or government share your

520
00:19:58,159 --> 00:20:02,090
threat intelligence now there might be

521
00:20:00,169 --> 00:20:03,590
certain circumstances where that might

522
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:04,990
not be appropriate but for the vast

523
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:07,030
majority of threats it is a

524
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:08,590
appropriate and we're all better off if

525
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:10,660
we share threat Intel so we can work

526
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:12,639
collectively to identify where those

527
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:13,840
threats are and I know there's even some

528
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,370
vendors that want to build a business

529
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,770
out of threat intelligence but it's far

530
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:21,219
better to share as much as we possibly

531
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:24,490
can and then finally if you're in the

532
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:27,059
world of academics partner so you can

533
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:29,940
test out your new tools your algorithms

534
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:32,260
you have new theories get them tested

535
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:34,210
get them out there in practice to see if

536
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:36,520
they work so that's my challenge around

537
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:39,040
open collaboration now if you need help

538
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:41,050
around open collaboration we're here to

539
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:43,120
help is IBM now this isn't a product

540
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:45,340
push everything you see here is an area

541
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,830
where we're trying to invest and bring

542
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:49,780
and lift up all boats in the industry so

543
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:50,559
the first area is around app exchange in

544
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:52,300
the far-left

545
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:53,860
this is our marketplace where we

546
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:56,409
encourage if you're a vendor in the room

547
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:59,678
come work with us let's integrate our

548
00:20:56,410 --> 00:21:02,500
tools together this is all about sharing

549
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:03,420
tools and working together as an

550
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,800
industry

551
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:07,510
the second area here is around threat

552
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:09,970
intelligence and the picture you see is

553
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:11,500
x-force exchange that isn't necessarily

554
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:14,320
the only place to share threat

555
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:17,260
intelligence but we at IBM and our

556
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:20,110
x-force team decided to open up 9

557
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:22,590
terabytes of threat intelligence 900

558
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:24,428
terabytes of threat intelligence a lot

559
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:28,149
historical threat intelligence from

560
00:21:24,429 --> 00:21:31,390
decades it's constantly being fed and we

561
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:33,280
have almost a half a million unique

562
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:35,050
users each month that are getting access

563
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,190
to this platform and they're researching

564
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:38,290
threats and they're sharing it's

565
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:40,540
completely free get on it today log on

566
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:44,230
search x-force exchange there's no

567
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:45,760
reason not to and third we as an

568
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:48,460
industry also need to help for the

569
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:55,900
greater public good and the third area

570
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:59,230
here is quad 9 IBM donated our 999.9 IP

571
00:21:55,900 --> 00:22:01,510
address to the packet Clearing House who

572
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:06,429
provides a free and privacy focused

573
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:08,679
security DNS service 9 billion request

574
00:22:06,429 --> 00:22:11,500
DNS requests going through this address

575
00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:14,890
and these servers each day and it's

576
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:17,070
about having security for all of us I

577
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:20,670
encourage you to check it out

578
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:22,710
so with that I'd like to end where I

579
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:23,910
began I began with talking about

580
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:26,640
everybody in the room and I might end

581
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:29,760
with everybody in the room okay to make

582
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:33,930
meaningful visible progress we need to

583
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:36,300
get smarter we need to respond faster we

584
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:40,410
need to work together and I think the

585
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:43,710
three force multipliers augmented

586
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:45,600
intelligence security orchestration open

587
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:48,390
collaboration are the way that we do

588
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:50,250
that and in the spirit of now matters

589
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:53,760
these are things you can have access

590
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:57,640
today I know you will I know you will

591
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:58,950
use these IBM's betting on you thank you
