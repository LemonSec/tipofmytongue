1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,150
- Well, good morning and good afternoon

2
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:04,137
to everyone depending on where you are.

3
00:00:04,137 --> 00:00:07,859
And, you know, if you've
been watching the news

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:11,400
at all any time over
the last couple of weeks

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,580
between executive orders and incidents,

6
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:20,580
both at the state local and
pretty much the corporate areas,

7
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:25,900
well, you've noticed that
everyone's having issues

8
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,160
with cybersecurity.

9
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,580
But as forefront of mind,

10
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:31,439
the solutions are also forefront of mind.

11
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:36,440
So we brought together three
experts from varying viewpoints

12
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:39,892
and backgrounds to talk to us

13
00:00:39,893 --> 00:00:43,380
or walk through with us some
of the state of security

14
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:46,830
for state, local, tribal organizations,

15
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:50,690
as well as SMB, small
business organizations.

16
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:52,470
Because there's more commonalities

17
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:55,850
than you would think as well
as more resources available.

18
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:57,980
So with that, we're
going to go through each

19
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:00,930
of the presenters who will
talk to us for a little bit

20
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:01,947
and then we'll have a question

21
00:01:01,947 --> 00:01:04,730
and answer session at the end.

22
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:08,290
So for those who I haven't
met or worked with before,

23
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:12,960
I'm Elizabeth Wharton, and I
am chief of staff at SCYTHE.

24
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,225
And first up, we're
going to have Tony Sager

25
00:01:15,225 --> 00:01:19,360
who's the senior vice
president and chief evangelist

26
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,740
for the Center for Internet Security.

27
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,229
Tony, are you ready to
walk us through some,

28
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:28,100
I mean, y'all haven't been
busy at all, have you?

29
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,220
(Tony laughs)

30
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,510
- No it's been a busy,
not only the recent past

31
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:33,470
but the last several years

32
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:35,000
around the elections and so forth.

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,400
So anyway, hello RSA.

34
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,950
Welcome. Thank you for
joining us here today.

35
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:38,900
We really appreciate it.

36
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,260
And we're here today to
talk about a shared problem

37
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:43,180
and I'm not talking about
sharing among just the three

38
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:44,740
or four of us here on the panel,

39
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,580
but all of us have in common.

40
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,860
And here's the problem.

41
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:52,640
In cyberspace, most of our economy

42
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,410
cannot defend itself in the current model.

43
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:56,789
And by current model you know what I mean.

44
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:58,850
The build it yourself for security, right?

45
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:01,530
Struggle to understand a
really complicated problem,

46
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,930
buy a lot of stuff, operationalize it,

47
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:06,810
train all your people
to be aware, et cetera.

48
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,459
It's just not working, okay?

49
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:10,949
If you don't have the staff or the ability

50
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:11,970
to understand information,

51
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:14,170
no amount of threat sharing
is going to save you.

52
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:15,792
If you don't have any kind of funding

53
00:02:15,793 --> 00:02:17,650
then you're not going to buy fancy tools,

54
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:19,890
you're not going to pay
for expensive assessments.

55
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:22,359
And, you know, if you don't have the staff

56
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,530
to even manage the complexity of them,

57
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:27,040
there's no security framework,
no compliance regime,

58
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,109
nothing like that is really
going to make a big difference.

59
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,240
I mean, that's the reality

60
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,740
that most of our economy lives in.

61
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:34,410
So yes, I'm talking about
small, medium businesses.

62
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:36,380
Almost all of them are affected by this

63
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,160
but also state, local, tribal,

64
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,790
territorial governments, right?

65
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:41,690
And that's really the
area I'm going to talk

66
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:42,850
to you about first here.

67
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:45,820
This community has a lot in common.

68
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,670
We'll hear more about
that later but, you know,

69
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:48,950
but kind of my quick phrase is,

70
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:51,179
they're outgunned, they're undermanned

71
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,160
and they're underserved by our industry.

72
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,840
And yet, these are my neighbors.

73
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,810
These are my tradespeople.

74
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:56,820
I live in a rural county.

75
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,440
My doctor, my lawyer, my dentist,

76
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,020
they're all small businesses.

77
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:03,330
The county elections board,
you know, the school board.

78
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:05,510
This is the environment in which we live

79
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:07,769
and they are targeted in big ways now.

80
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,529
And so, you know, and we could
blame the victim all we want

81
00:03:10,529 --> 00:03:12,440
but that's not helping anything either.

82
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,690
I spent a lifetime working with
state and local governments

83
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:16,130
but also with small businesses.

84
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:17,329
And these are good people.

85
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:18,163
They're not lazy.

86
00:03:18,163 --> 00:03:19,440
It's not that they don't care,

87
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,285
it's that this problem is too complicated

88
00:03:21,285 --> 00:03:23,030
to solve on their own.

89
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:26,230
And so, even if you work for
a big, bad government agency,

90
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,780
lots of funding, big
financial sector company,

91
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,720
you know, these are your neighbors.

92
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,660
These are your tradespeople.

93
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,140
These are the local governments

94
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,279
that provide services to you.

95
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,980
So we're all in this problem

96
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,670
whether we recognize it or not.

97
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:39,100
And we have to realize
that traditional approaches

98
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:42,210
of educating buying, et
cetera, are not gonna work

99
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:44,250
the way we'd like to
think of them as working.

100
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,680
So in this session, we're gonna look

101
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,380
at the nexus of small businesses,

102
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,850
state and local governments
and sort of what's in common,

103
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:51,516
what's different and what's
really going on out there

104
00:03:51,516 --> 00:03:54,820
and then some ideas on
what we can do about that.

105
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,920
I'll talk about state
and local governments

106
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,119
because I'm part of the
Center for Internet Security.

107
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,630
We're a nonprofit home.

108
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,500
One of our major missions is we are

109
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:07,090
the multi-state information
sharing and analysis center.

110
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:10,850
So the ISAC, and that's
the sort of gathering point

111
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:13,060
for state and local
governments across the country,

112
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,330
24/7, operational mission.

113
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:16,640
People are reporting incidents,

114
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,801
we're providing guidance,
bulletins, advisories,

115
00:04:18,801 --> 00:04:20,320
all that kind of stuff.

116
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,329
In the last couple of years

117
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:23,669
we've stood up the election
infrastructure ISAC

118
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,580
and you can imagine how lively that's been

119
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,000
for the last several years.

120
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,920
And it's a similar infrastructure,

121
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,601
but dealing with the specifics

122
00:04:30,601 --> 00:04:32,060
of the election infrastructure

123
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,190
at the state and local levels.

124
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:37,540
And so, these are
complicated, large scale,

125
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:40,660
highly distributed you might
say, enterprises, right?

126
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:43,670
So imagine 90,000 separate entities

127
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:45,030
across the state and local governments.

128
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:45,909
So not all are governments,

129
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,720
many of them are governments,
tens of thousands,

130
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,450
but also what are called
the specialist entities

131
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:51,420
or special authorities.

132
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:55,200
So things like water, sewer, power,

133
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,050
you know, airports
things like that, right?

134
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:59,120
They all, they don't pass laws

135
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,350
but they also provide services directly.

136
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:05,140
And they're all at risk in
this kind of environment here.

137
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,330
So part of what we do

138
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:09,530
in helping that community
is try to understand it

139
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:11,239
in addition to all of
these operational services.

140
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,140
So we run a big annual survey

141
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:16,200
of the 11,000 plus members that we have

142
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,557
inside the multi-state ISAC.

143
00:05:17,557 --> 00:05:20,140
And just summarizing really briefly

144
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:23,180
a long, complicated story,
the multi-state ISAC,

145
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,300
these are the key problems

146
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,800
that were identified overwhelmingly

147
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,580
by the state and local governments.

148
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,310
And none of these are a surprise

149
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:32,140
and they have not
changed in several years.

150
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,479
So lack of funding, we
all feel that pain, right?

151
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,100
Especially if you're a local government

152
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:36,933
that's really been hurt

153
00:05:36,933 --> 00:05:40,200
by tax revenues over the last year plus.

154
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,140
The struggle to keep
up with the technology

155
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:42,973
and the attackers, right?

156
00:05:42,973 --> 00:05:44,370
We're all struggling
to make sense of this.

157
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,488
There's so much going on
in both new technology,

158
00:05:46,488 --> 00:05:49,160
but business use of it and
then what attackers are doing,

159
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,630
and then the lack of professionals.

160
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:53,190
Imagine trying to hire top end talent

161
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:55,620
with the kind of budgets that
these folks are dealing with.

162
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,692
On the positive side, here
are some of the factors

163
00:05:57,692 --> 00:06:00,261
that came out during the survey around

164
00:06:00,261 --> 00:06:02,590
what can lead to success, right?

165
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:04,219
What are good signs of maturity?

166
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:07,270
Well, having professional security staff

167
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:09,700
is a big contributor to
success into maturity

168
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,170
and many state and local
governments have none.

169
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:14,220
No professional security staff.

170
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:16,610
IT staff, it's often a
very similar picture.

171
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,110
Many have one or none.

172
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:19,050
Use of a framework.

173
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:21,810
Any framework shows dramatic improvement

174
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:24,490
in maturity and success
of a security program.

175
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:26,830
And then governance, we've
done a study around this

176
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:29,144
but also the involvement of executives

177
00:06:29,144 --> 00:06:30,960
in these decisions, right?

178
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,645
You know, visibility goes a long way

179
00:06:32,646 --> 00:06:34,760
to both understanding the problem

180
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,090
but also putting the right emphasis

181
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:37,830
and the right resources in place.

182
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,580
So what are we going to do about it?

183
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,380
Well, you know, the place to start,

184
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,560
if you are a state, local, tribal,

185
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,550
territorial government is the ISAC.

186
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,550
It's paid for by Homeland Security, right?

187
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,780
Most of the services are
available free to you.

188
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,330
It's a wide range of services,

189
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:55,330
active information services and
most provided ahead of time.

190
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:57,814
We're also a major best practice creator

191
00:06:57,814 --> 00:07:00,550
and distributor at the
Center for Internet Security.

192
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:04,180
So the CIS benchmarks or the CIS controls.

193
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,650
These are resources that come

194
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:07,890
along with your membership
to multi-state ISAC.

195
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:11,550
And so, again, it provides
this distributed community

196
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:13,750
that shares ideas, best practices,

197
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,280
help learn from each other.

198
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,280
And that's how most of us
learn in this business, right?

199
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,320
Learning from someone that's like us

200
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,820
and how do we take best
use of our resources

201
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,719
but not have to experiment,
not to overspend

202
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,320
to get to the place where we really need

203
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,120
to do something that will really deal

204
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,530
with the kinds of attacks
that we see today.

205
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:35,090
But another key part for us
is about getting started.

206
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:36,940
It's more, we've spent a lot of time

207
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:37,990
and I've been in this business

208
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,010
for four and a half decades now.

209
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:41,760
We spent a lot of time
admiring the problem.

210
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,960
We need to get to work.

211
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,180
And the, we also need to focus in on sort

212
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,550
of what are the first steps to do,

213
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,598
what are the basics,
what are the foundation

214
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:52,010
of a cyber defense?

215
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:53,530
We provide that kind of information

216
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:55,030
for you at the Center
for Internet Security

217
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:57,059
and it's a part of how we support state

218
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,010
and local governments.

219
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,370
Anyway so that problem,

220
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:01,990
I just wanted to set the table for it.

221
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:04,210
The, this is an ongoing challenge

222
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:06,239
that affects every one of us as a citizen.

223
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,240
Next, I'm going to pass it over

224
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,030
to Lawrence who sees this as
a manager and service provider

225
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:12,059
who happens to have customers,

226
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,780
lots of state and locals,
but also small businesses.

227
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:15,638
He'll talk about that challenge

228
00:08:15,638 --> 00:08:17,159
and then kind of what is in common

229
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,710
and what might be different about that.

230
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:20,419
Lawrence over to you.

231
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,430
- Fantastic.

232
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:22,401
Thank you, Tony.

233
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:25,260
My name is Lawrence Cruciana and I work

234
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:28,510
with Corporate Information
Technologies, CIT for short.

235
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:31,020
Thank you for taking the time to join us

236
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,750
and talk about this very important topic.

237
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,539
I lead the security practice for CIT

238
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:37,357
and I'm principally
involved in identifying,

239
00:08:37,357 --> 00:08:41,709
measuring and remediating
risk in smaller organizations.

240
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:44,650
Mostly mid-market and
small government clients.

241
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:46,199
Now our security practice focuses

242
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,200
on the area of the business that sits

243
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,414
between the technical evaluation
and demonstration of risk

244
00:08:51,414 --> 00:08:54,810
and the, helping the
executives that are responsible

245
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:57,089
for governance and risk
management functions,

246
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:59,443
interpret and make decisions about,

247
00:08:59,443 --> 00:09:01,670
about and then using that data.

248
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:03,920
We kind of sit between the GRC

249
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,410
and focused purple team
activities if you will.

250
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:09,390
Understanding us about
our practice is important

251
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:12,080
as we'll discuss here in just a minute.

252
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,570
Now at CIT, we do use the CIS controls

253
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:18,562
for our assessment and
risk governance work.

254
00:09:18,562 --> 00:09:22,620
In my experience, they provide
a very approachable mechanism

255
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,060
and a very level playing field

256
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,162
for the organizations that adopt them.

257
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:30,310
And the word approachable
is the important one there.

258
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:32,599
And what I mean by that is
they offer a starting point

259
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,450
that is generally accessible

260
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:38,320
and understandable to most organizations.

261
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,860
Now, while their approach
is different than NIST,

262
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:44,300
CSF or CMMC, they provide
a very effective set

263
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,160
of controls that incorporate

264
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,930
both the organization's size

265
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:51,140
as well as information
centric areas of exposure

266
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:53,670
in the prescribed
safeguards that they make.

267
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:56,099
Now, before we move on, I have to share

268
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,380
that I have a special
interest in small business.

269
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:01,689
I've spent the last decade
plus of my life working

270
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:03,040
with smaller organizations

271
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,492
and I've come to love the
agility, just the innovation

272
00:10:06,492 --> 00:10:09,760
that they're just
consistently imbued with.

273
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,010
These organizations are worth
safeguarding and protecting

274
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:15,840
and that's why I'm here.

275
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,730
I firmly believe that it's critical

276
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:19,570
for us as cybersecurity professionals

277
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:21,580
to meet others where they are.

278
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,090
Especially related to their,

279
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:25,960
where they are in their
cybersecurity journey.

280
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:30,210
This is especially true
for smaller businesses,

281
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:32,300
for smaller organizations.

282
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:36,579
The very often enterprise ESQI aesthetic

283
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:39,290
of cybersecurity causes the leadership

284
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:44,079
of SMBs to do nothing
because they're afraid

285
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,313
that it's not the right thing to do.

286
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:50,910
But it may not surprise you
to learn that roughly 99%

287
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:52,920
of all of the businesses in the US

288
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,395
are categorized as small business.

289
00:10:55,395 --> 00:10:57,316
They represent a workforce

290
00:10:57,316 --> 00:11:02,316
of approximately 47% of all US employees.

291
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:05,959
These organizations very often have far,

292
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:09,840
far fewer resources to their
large enterprise counterparts.

293
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,760
They have an internal IT function

294
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,260
that's principally focused
on the business systems

295
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:18,810
and keeping those running,
not on IT security.

296
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:21,510
At least not as a dedicated function.

297
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:26,380
In 2020, roughly 28% of all
of the reported cyber attacks

298
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,960
were perpetuated against
smaller businesses.

299
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,340
And that is, again, that's the only one,

300
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,830
the ones that are reported.

301
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:35,070
Anecdotally, I reached out to some friends

302
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,448
that are in the cyber insurance business

303
00:11:36,448 --> 00:11:38,480
and asked kind of how that felt?

304
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,952
Did that statistic resonate with them?

305
00:11:40,952 --> 00:11:44,890
Their estimate back to
me was maybe 20 to 30%

306
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:48,740
are actually reported
by non-regulated SMBs.

307
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:51,970
So the number could actually
be considerably larger.

308
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:54,032
Now, as I mentioned
earlier, we perform a number

309
00:11:54,032 --> 00:11:57,440
of risk assessments annually
using the CIS controls.

310
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,900
And as we started
formalizing the aggregation

311
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,579
and analysis of that data,

312
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,840
I started to notice some
very interesting trends

313
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,020
between our small and mid-sized clients

314
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,760
and smaller government clients.

315
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,740
Specifically, the areas
of their shortcomings seem

316
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:13,430
to line up in the same control areas.

317
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:15,890
It's important to say here
that I only included data

318
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:19,819
from assessments that were
conducted in, using IG2,

319
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,240
implementation group two of the controls.

320
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,930
If you're not familiar with
how the controls are organized,

321
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:27,030
IG2 by its very nature,

322
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:30,400
excludes the smallest and
the largest organizations,

323
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,699
those in implementation
groups one and three

324
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,610
from the dataset.

325
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:37,356
We have some resources
later in the presentation

326
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:39,950
if you're not familiar with
how the controls are set up

327
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:42,410
and want to learn more about that.

328
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:45,100
But thinking that this
data that I was seeing,

329
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,230
this pattern I was seeing might

330
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:48,130
have been an aberration in the data set,

331
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:49,360
I started to look externally

332
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,640
and got very strong
confirmation in correlation

333
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,112
of this observation from some
broader studies conducted

334
00:12:55,112 --> 00:12:58,160
across the information security industry.

335
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,020
Now equally, I found
that our larger clients

336
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:03,400
also didn't have the same
patterns of exposure.

337
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,209
So why is it important?

338
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:09,350
SMBs and SLTT organizations
are often not considered

339
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:11,540
in the same class of risk modeling, right?

340
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,089
One's government one is commercial.

341
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:16,210
Apples and oranges, right?

342
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:18,470
Well, if we think like an adversary,

343
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:20,330
well, that would meet us to consider

344
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:22,549
the potential impact of a targeted attack

345
00:13:22,549 --> 00:13:25,689
against these two types of organizations.

346
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:28,710
That impact could be catastrophic.

347
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:31,150
But there's also another commonality here

348
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:34,260
between both SMB and SLTT organizations.

349
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:37,630
And that is that both
very often heavily rely

350
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:40,883
on the services of a managed
services provider or an MSP.

351
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,890
MSPs clearly fit into this risk equation.

352
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,863
After all, approximately 87%

353
00:13:46,863 --> 00:13:49,380
of SMBs outsource some or all

354
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,763
of their IT function to an MSP.

355
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,410
I think it's important
before we go on though

356
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:55,490
to understand a little bit

357
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:58,160
about what organizations
comprise the MSP market

358
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,339
and who these businesses are.

359
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,354
Looking to multiple publications

360
00:14:01,354 --> 00:14:03,220
that measure that sort of thing,

361
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:07,620
in 2019, the average size
of an MSP was 16 people.

362
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:11,573
It had an total top line
revenue of just over $3 million.

363
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,077
These organizations, the MSPs

364
00:14:14,077 --> 00:14:16,290
are small businesses themselves.

365
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:18,189
They're quite often responsible

366
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,390
for everything that either has

367
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:21,220
a blinking light coming out of it

368
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,463
or an ethernet cable
hanging out of the back.

369
00:14:23,463 --> 00:14:26,209
At least for their small business clients.

370
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:27,320
Now we had a small subset

371
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,640
of data set of assessments
that we had conducted

372
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,423
against some security minded MSPs

373
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:34,750
but that really wasn't significant enough

374
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,370
to draw conclusions from.

375
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:39,540
So I approached a number of MSPs and asked

376
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,839
if they would participate
in the benchmarking study

377
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,530
and their response is what
allowed this third dimension

378
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:46,240
of risk to be quantified.

379
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,430
And as it turns out, the
same areas of exposure

380
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:52,400
that SLTT and SMB organizations have,

381
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,240
also line up well with MSPs.

382
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,130
And here's the key takeaway.

383
00:14:57,130 --> 00:15:00,900
Controls one, five, nine, 11 and 14,

384
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,601
are consistently weaker across
all of these organizations.

385
00:15:04,601 --> 00:15:06,760
It's a common set of exposure

386
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,350
across a huge number of organizations.

387
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:12,040
Potentially somewhere north
of 32 million of them.

388
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:15,069
Collectively, they're more
likely to suffer a catastrophic

389
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:17,930
or even fatal outcome
following a cyber attack.

390
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:19,260
Most of them are self-reporting

391
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,120
that they're under-resourced with limited

392
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,580
to no dedicated information
security training or personnel.

393
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,830
It seems like it's a situation that's rife

394
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:30,050
for something bad to happen and it does.

395
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:31,693
Attacks against both
of these organizations

396
00:15:31,693 --> 00:15:35,170
have increased double digits every year,

397
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:37,300
especially in the last 10 years.

398
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,991
MSPs especially are being targeted

399
00:15:38,991 --> 00:15:41,660
by various sophisticated threat actors.

400
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,740
They're viewed as a golden goose.

401
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,970
Successfully compromise an MSP,

402
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:49,220
you often have unfettered
administrative access to dozen

403
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:52,810
or potentially hundreds of
other smaller organizations,

404
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:54,069
their clients.

405
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:55,640
Now the good news here
is we have something

406
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,449
we can do about the situation.

407
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:58,430
We have a roadmap,

408
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:00,030
we have a prioritized set of controls

409
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:02,579
that prescribe the
things that we need to do

410
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:05,980
and there are very, very
accessible mechanisms

411
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,910
to carry those things out.

412
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:09,800
Now, to tell you more about those things,

413
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,290
I'm going to pass the mic over to one

414
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:12,790
of the smartest guys that I know

415
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:14,819
and someone that has an extreme passion

416
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:18,280
for this in both the MSP and SMB space.

417
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,730
I'm gonna pass over to Harry.

418
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:24,040
- Aren't you too kind.

419
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,319
Hi. My name is Harry Perper

420
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,640
and thank you for joining us today.

421
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,189
I work for the MITRE corporation.

422
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:31,762
However today I'm
representing my own passion

423
00:16:31,762 --> 00:16:33,109
for cybersecurity.

424
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:36,700
So the comments,
recommendations and opinions

425
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,050
that I express today are strictly mine

426
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:41,483
and not those of the MITRE corporation.

427
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:44,670
Next slide please.

428
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,280
So I want to talk to you today about

429
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,697
what I believe are the
most important things

430
00:16:48,697 --> 00:16:53,697
that you can do to move yourself
up the cybersecurity chain.

431
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:56,949
Move yourself from being
that low hanging fruit

432
00:16:56,950 --> 00:17:01,950
to a branch or two
higher in the tree, okay?

433
00:17:02,918 --> 00:17:06,190
The criminals and adversaries are looking

434
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:07,430
for low-hanging fruit.

435
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:09,849
Just taking yourself
off of that branch makes

436
00:17:09,849 --> 00:17:12,780
a big difference and they're low cost

437
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,530
and no cost cybersecurity steps

438
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:17,540
you can take right now to do that.

439
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:20,409
So the first one is culture.

440
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:22,430
You have to have a security

441
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:25,609
or cybersecurity culture
in your organization.

442
00:17:25,609 --> 00:17:27,299
That means that anyone
in your organization

443
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:29,650
who receives an email

444
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:31,550
or sees something funny on their computer,

445
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,470
should be able to ask the question

446
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:38,470
without being penalized or rejected

447
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,310
from any conversation up
and down the entire chain.

448
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,190
It has to start at the top

449
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:45,620
and all the way through the organization.

450
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:49,429
And one way to achieve that
culture is through education.

451
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:54,140
An educated workforce understands
some of the basic ideas

452
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:59,140
and concepts and is interested
in looking and detecting,

453
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:07,637
detecting malicious or out
of the ordinary aspects

454
00:18:07,637 --> 00:18:11,360
of what's happening in their email

455
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:16,360
or actually on the screen
in front of them will be,

456
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:19,230
you significantly increase
the detection capability

457
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:20,158
across your organization

458
00:18:20,158 --> 00:18:24,219
and can very quickly identify
something that's not right

459
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,080
an adversary moving around

460
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,713
the IT infrastructure of your company.

461
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:34,060
The National Institute of
Standards and Technology

462
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:37,000
has created something
called the NICE framework.

463
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
The National, the NICE
framework, (chuckles)

464
00:18:43,354 --> 00:18:48,250
which is what I call a
dictionary or a encyclopedia,

465
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:51,480
all the different skills and job titles,

466
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:55,546
jobs that need to be done by
people in IT and cybersecurity.

467
00:18:55,546 --> 00:18:58,205
There's no sense having,
making up or rewriting

468
00:18:58,205 --> 00:19:01,790
these skills descriptions in,

469
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:05,360
whether it's in HR as far as a career path

470
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:10,000
or as you're creating
requisitions to hire new people.

471
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,550
All these descriptions
have been created for you,

472
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:17,483
you copy and paste and use
them in your HR organization.

473
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:20,510
Passwords.

474
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:22,850
Please stop reusing passwords inside

475
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:24,409
and outside your organization.

476
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:27,310
My recommendation is
that you give everybody

477
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:29,960
a password manager for use personally,

478
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,100
as well as in the company.

479
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,092
That will significantly increase the,

480
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,072
your security across your organization.

481
00:19:38,072 --> 00:19:41,209
And also increase the personal security

482
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:43,890
of your employees and by doing that,

483
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:48,150
you are going to help
your business security

484
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:50,760
by preventing issues with your,

485
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:54,323
with the personnel's private security.

486
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,201
Multifactor, multi-factor authentication.

487
00:19:58,201 --> 00:20:02,893
We know of it, we know
it's called, MFA, 2FA.

488
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:08,610
That should be activated
everywhere in your organization.

489
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:10,659
You should encourage all your employees

490
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:14,030
to use it wherever they can
in their own personal lives.

491
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:18,473
This is a very significant
and becoming a basic tool

492
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:27,230
in just about every cloud servers today.

493
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:29,000
More and more of them are going to insist

494
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,150
on implementing MFA for every
account that you turn on.

495
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,710
Microsoft has done studies

496
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:36,495
that multi-factor authentication

497
00:20:36,495 --> 00:20:39,496
for email reduces your chances

498
00:20:39,497 --> 00:20:43,940
of someone taking over
your account by about 99%.

499
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:46,363
And it's very cost effective.

500
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,923
In some cases, zero cost.

501
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:51,750
And that's what I'm all about.

502
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,680
I want to help you move up that tree

503
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,000
at the very lowest cost possible.

504
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,120
And then there's backups.

505
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,070
Without backups, your business is at risk.

506
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:05,689
Significant risks, existential risk.

507
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:07,490
You've got to plan those backups,

508
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:10,930
understand what data's
important to back up.

509
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:12,530
How long do you need to keep it?

510
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,879
Where are you going to store that back up?

511
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,950
You're going to store a copy online,

512
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:20,170
you're going to store a copy offline.

513
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:22,380
I suggest to all of the above.

514
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,730
How often are you going
to update those backups?

515
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:26,510
You do it daily, hourly, weekly,

516
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:28,926
whatever makes sense
for your organization.

517
00:21:28,926 --> 00:21:31,199
If you are a tow truck company,

518
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,540
you probably don't need to
backup that data as often

519
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,683
as if you are a hospital.

520
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:40,010
And do it in, do it in small chunks.

521
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:41,480
Three months sprints.

522
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:44,710
Pick the most critical data,
find the most critical,

523
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:46,420
do you know what the most critical data

524
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:47,873
is for your organization?

525
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,180
Pick that, back it up somewhere,

526
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:53,470
back it up a couple different places.

527
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:54,915
Put a copy, if you're a small business,

528
00:21:54,915 --> 00:21:58,440
maybe one of those
places in your basement.

529
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,420
Copy it, take it home

530
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,520
and put it in the basement someplace safe.

531
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:06,760
Larger businesses will
probably have online services

532
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:11,030
and insist on those online
services having offline copies

533
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:15,399
so that you are not
strictly network connected

534
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,683
in those backups.

535
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:20,800
So Lawrence, that's
really, Tony, Elizabeth,

536
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,912
that's really my recommendations.

537
00:22:22,912 --> 00:22:24,570
There's a lot of free,

538
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:27,473
we're gonna post some of these I believe.

539
00:22:27,473 --> 00:22:29,728
There's a lot of great resources online

540
00:22:29,728 --> 00:22:32,080
where you can get more information.

541
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,699
Like DHS, NIST, the National Institute

542
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,370
of Standards and Technology.

543
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:41,420
The FTC, SBA, CIS,

544
00:22:41,421 --> 00:22:44,631
they've all published
cybersecurity recommendations

545
00:22:44,631 --> 00:22:46,076
and guidance.

546
00:22:46,076 --> 00:22:48,070
It's out there to be used,

547
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,990
please take advantage of it.

548
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:51,440
And I'll hand it back to Liz.

549
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,532
- And so one of the things,

550
00:22:56,532 --> 00:23:00,560
thank you gentlemen for
giving us a great overview

551
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,909
and a reminder to everyone.

552
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:04,220
If you'll look at the screen now,

553
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:06,800
take a moment, we have coordinated

554
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,137
and pooled together several
different resources.

555
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:13,620
There's a QR code that we'll provide links

556
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:15,530
additional information.

557
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:20,530
And kind of undercover, so
to speak, as Harry noted,

558
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:26,379
prior to my joining my current startup,

559
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:29,970
I was senior assistant city
attorney for City of Atlanta.

560
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:31,410
And one of the things,

561
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:35,320
so while I gained valuable experience,

562
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:39,600
I neither speak for the city nor make any,

563
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,192
any, I don't know, commonalities,

564
00:23:42,192 --> 00:23:45,730
what is at the disclaimer
at the beginning of books.

565
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:48,960
That names and everything had been changed

566
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,620
to protect the innocent and
it's purely coincidental.

567
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:57,620
But on March 22nd, 2018,
there was a ransomware attack.

568
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:02,325
And from a city that hosts
the world's busiest airport,

569
00:24:02,325 --> 00:24:04,870
and as Tony noted,

570
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:07,679
we not only do you have the city functions

571
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,360
the watershed department,

572
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,899
but you have the Department of Aviation.

573
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,700
So you've got all of
these different pieces

574
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,150
playing together.

575
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:17,399
And one of the first things
that stuck in my mind

576
00:24:17,399 --> 00:24:21,899
that I wanted to kind of
go to both what Lawrence

577
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:26,410
and then Harry were
talking about is that data

578
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:29,250
and knowing what data you have.

579
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:32,420
Because it's easy to say, we're a city.

580
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:34,900
We feel like we're a small business.

581
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:39,550
We're, in Harry's example,
we're tow truck company.

582
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:43,470
But how do you, and Lawrence,
I guess going to you first,

583
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:45,810
how often, how frequently do you have

584
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:47,870
to have that conversation of,

585
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:49,428
do you know what data you have

586
00:24:49,428 --> 00:24:54,428
with your customers and
helping them figure it out?

587
00:24:55,799 --> 00:25:00,008
- Liz, that's an incredibly
insightful question

588
00:25:00,008 --> 00:25:02,820
and one that is obviously informed

589
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:04,914
from some of your experience.

590
00:25:04,914 --> 00:25:06,170
It's something that

591
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:08,420
that I have to have that conversation

592
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:11,310
with every single client because so often

593
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:14,419
in the small business
space, as I mentioned,

594
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:19,330
the kind of enterprise
ESQI era of infosec,

595
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,640
small businesses don't think that way.

596
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,920
They don't think that they're a target.

597
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,870
They don't think that they can do anything

598
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:30,969
against the attacker or they're
too small to be considered.

599
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:35,150
So, you know, doing a solid
inventory of the data,

600
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:36,240
that's step one.

601
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:41,240
It's every engagement
and almost without fail,

602
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:45,300
there is some data that they have

603
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:47,550
in their possession that has some type

604
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:52,169
of external regulation
or legality around it.

605
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:55,073
And that as most of the business owners

606
00:25:55,073 --> 00:25:57,780
or those that are responsible
for managing risk,

607
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,889
it could be an IT manager,

608
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:01,760
they don't even know that it's there.

609
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,090
So they don't know what their risks

610
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:05,399
and the exposure is
just for regulated data,

611
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,150
or even asking a simple question,

612
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:10,090
what are the crown jewels?

613
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:12,328
What is the piece of information

614
00:26:12,328 --> 00:26:16,379
or the system that really is most valuable

615
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,990
to the organization?

616
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:21,550
And an exercise that I
run through with clients

617
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:24,970
is to ask that question separately

618
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:27,760
of those that are involved
operationally in the business,

619
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,010
and then those that are
near the executives.

620
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:31,810
The owner, the board of directors.

621
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:33,260
Asking that question separately

622
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:35,060
and seeing if you get the same answer,

623
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:38,750
and most often, you
don't, at least I don't.

624
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:42,380
And then bringing two very
disparate answers back

625
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:44,740
to the person responsible for IT,

626
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:46,260
and they go, I didn't even know I needed

627
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,290
to secure that or protect
that or back that up.

628
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:49,808
I didn't know anything about that.

629
00:26:49,808 --> 00:26:53,590
So how can you protect something
if you don't know about it?

630
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:57,870
- Well, and once you've
identified it and you now get

631
00:26:57,870 --> 00:27:00,696
a better idea of what is in your system,

632
00:27:00,696 --> 00:27:05,696
how do you prioritize,
and this is kind of for,

633
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,230
Tony I'm going to come
after you with this one too

634
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:13,070
because you have crafted
the, some of these controls

635
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:15,095
and worked on this.

636
00:27:15,095 --> 00:27:20,095
So how do you identify and
kind of audit your own systems

637
00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:22,409
to meet some of the definitions?

638
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:23,700
Because no offense,

639
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:26,100
when y'all are creating
some of these controls,

640
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:29,060
I mean, picking on CIS,

641
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:31,330
but also when you look
at the NIST standards

642
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:33,730
and you look at ISS or
you go through all this

643
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:37,300
and you're thinking, what
is reasonable security?

644
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:41,270
Like, what are, how do you
meet these definitions?

645
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:43,206
Who do I go to when I
have questions like that?

646
00:27:43,206 --> 00:27:44,250
(Harry laughing)

647
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:45,490
- That's another loaded question.

648
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:46,650
You have a good questions Liz.

649
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:48,650
The reasonable question,

650
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:52,170
so you, I think last time I
was on a panel with a lawyer

651
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,610
he said something like,
I think the majority

652
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:56,830
of the states have some sort
of statute that calls for use

653
00:27:56,830 --> 00:28:00,169
of reasonable practices to
protect a certain kind of data.

654
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:02,570
But that word, reasonable,
is left undefined.

655
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:05,270
And so that's part of the
dilemma that we have here, right?

656
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:08,520
Reasonable being in the
eye of the beholder and I,

657
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,940
sort of a philosophy for CIS,

658
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,940
the way I think of it is,

659
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,330
we tend to think of the worst case

660
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:15,840
and try to solve the worst problem first.

661
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,510
My philosophy usually goes the other,

662
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:19,910
like, what is the problem
that we all have in common?

663
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:21,890
And let's work on that because it's often,

664
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:23,580
that's a place to share resources

665
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:26,320
and ideas and get
everyone up to some level.

666
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,379
And so this notion to me is,

667
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:31,810
how do I protect all data
at some level, right?

668
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:35,240
Not with expensive, you
know, overkill kind of tools,

669
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,640
but how do I protect everything,

670
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,030
but recognize that there
are things that are critical

671
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:41,810
to the function of the business

672
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:43,429
and therefore deserve
more protection, right?

673
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,680
Deserve extra care,
deserve extra oversight.

674
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,460
And separating the problem that way is one

675
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:50,170
of the ways we try to help
people make sense of this at CIS.

676
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:52,720
I think that has been a useful way.

677
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,073
The other thing that
we try to focus on CIS,

678
00:28:54,073 --> 00:28:55,900
and again, we're technologists, right?

679
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,520
So we live in this world technology but,

680
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,310
you know, a business leader typically

681
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:03,690
is not going to have
that depth of technology

682
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:06,010
no matter how much we
educate or make them aware,

683
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:08,314
but they should be able
to answer questions about,

684
00:29:08,314 --> 00:29:11,850
what loss of resource would
be catastrophic financially

685
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:12,683
to your business, right?

686
00:29:12,683 --> 00:29:15,680
They should have some sense
of the business question

687
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,960
so that folks like Lawrence
and Harry could translate

688
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,600
that into IT speak.

689
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,959
But too often we try to get people

690
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,490
to sort of become educated about security

691
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:26,130
the way security pros are and
that's just a losing strategy.

692
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:27,450
You know, 'cause it's the rare executive.

693
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:28,831
By the way, they're running companies,

694
00:29:28,831 --> 00:29:31,229
they're juggling risk, personnel risk

695
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:33,410
and reputational risk
and financial and audit.

696
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:36,570
You know, they're juggling
risk in umpteen dimensions,

697
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:39,050
cyber issues just happened
to be one of them.

698
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:41,200
And they're only important in their radar

699
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,756
to the extent that it affects
the successful operation

700
00:29:43,756 --> 00:29:45,620
of the company.

701
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:49,050
- Well, and you raised
a great point in kind

702
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:52,860
of the introduction of the topic in that,

703
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:55,610
budget, it's all about the money.

704
00:29:55,610 --> 00:30:00,610
When, especially from a state,
a local, tribal, territorial

705
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:04,970
like, we only have, the pot is only so big

706
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,238
and we're getting pulled

707
00:30:06,238 --> 00:30:08,623
in a lot of different directions.

708
00:30:08,623 --> 00:30:13,623
And whether, well, we can't
provide police, water services

709
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:17,670
or well, would you rather
get your bags on time

710
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:21,203
or know that in delivering
some other services

711
00:30:21,203 --> 00:30:25,139
at the airport, well,
there might be a breach

712
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,720
and all of the other stuff.

713
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,160
So one of these are prioritizing

714
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,960
and kind of building
through and connecting us,

715
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,150
Harry, what are some of the,

716
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:35,610
you pointed out some good resources

717
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:36,783
and that information sharing,

718
00:30:36,784 --> 00:30:40,109
what are some of the other ways that,

719
00:30:40,109 --> 00:30:41,962
to kind of move the conversation forward

720
00:30:41,962 --> 00:30:45,570
in the work that you're
doing as well outside,

721
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:47,492
both with MITRE, because
MITRE does some great stuff

722
00:30:47,492 --> 00:30:52,143
but also in your, I guess,
more passionate free time?

723
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:57,130
- Yeah. So my passionate
free time is adding

724
00:30:57,130 --> 00:31:01,720
to my LinkedIn group called,
CyberSecurity on a Budget

725
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:05,042
where we talk about these kinds of issues.

726
00:31:05,042 --> 00:31:08,490
What are the cybersecurity techniques,

727
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:11,480
what are the tools that
you can deploy at very,

728
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:16,260
at low or no cost that help
you move along the journey,

729
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:19,870
move up the tree so that you're no longer

730
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:23,860
the lone antelope in the
herd on the outside, okay?

731
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:27,053
How many analogies can I put
together at one time here?

732
00:31:27,054 --> 00:31:28,904
(both laughing)

733
00:31:28,904 --> 00:31:33,904
- Well, it is, you've spoken
before as well about the,

734
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:37,770
the low hanging fruit
that you want to kind

735
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:40,260
of make attackers work for it.

736
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:41,980
- [Tony] Correct.
- And through

737
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:44,500
that pyramid scheme as well.

738
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:47,774
But a good kind of pyramid
scheme, not a bad one.

739
00:31:47,774 --> 00:31:48,929
- Right. Right.

740
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:52,960
So the pyramid scheme is,

741
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:57,960
that's the MSPs that Lawrence is involved,

742
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:02,940
operates and his buddies, the
vendors in that community.

743
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:07,940
There's probably a 10 to 1,
maybe 100 to 1 ratio there

744
00:32:08,283 --> 00:32:11,979
from MSPs to small business and SLT teams.

745
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:13,230
So if you think about,

746
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:17,300
if we're able to teach MSPs
how to do security better

747
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:20,659
than they do now, that
is going to flow downhill

748
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:25,410
in an order of magnitude
or more to their customers.

749
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:27,971
One of the things I
learned is that the MSP,

750
00:32:27,971 --> 00:32:31,940
the MSPs are doing, are really trying hard

751
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:35,350
to come move themselves along
in the cybersecurity journey.

752
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:37,270
And as they do that,

753
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:40,790
I believe that they will
understand how to translate

754
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:43,770
that for their small business customers.

755
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:46,431
One thing that I think Tony mentioned

756
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:50,670
about our adversaries
and I want to make clear

757
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:53,410
is that this is not personal.

758
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:57,490
Our adversaries are
attacking us using automation

759
00:32:57,490 --> 00:32:59,480
while they're out playing golf.

760
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,932
That automation is going to identify all

761
00:33:01,932 --> 00:33:06,932
the organizations that
are lowest hanging fruit.

762
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:11,010
Many of them might have exposed some,

763
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:15,210
some IT device to the public
internet without any security

764
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:17,121
or with some password that everybody

765
00:33:17,121 --> 00:33:19,530
has used many, many times.

766
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:22,149
So they're using automation to do this.

767
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:24,370
They're not picking on
any one particular person.

768
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:27,820
They don't care how big or
small your organization is.

769
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:30,750
This is all, this is all,
I want to say free money

770
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:35,717
but their return on investment
is huge compared to our,

771
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,141
compared to an average organization

772
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:40,930
or the organizations that
they happen to attack.

773
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:45,930
So people need to remove
that mindset that I'm too big

774
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:50,580
or I'm too small to be of
any interest to a criminal.

775
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:53,810
Individuals are not too
small for a criminal.

776
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:56,419
They can make a little money,
they're going to do it.

777
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:59,360
So assuming that you're
too small or assuming

778
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,449
that you're going to hide under the radar,

779
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:03,813
is absolutely the wrong thing to do.

780
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,580
- Well, and one of the things we saw,

781
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:11,841
allegedly, in a city that
may or may not be located

782
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:14,717
in the State of Georgia and comparing

783
00:34:14,717 --> 00:34:19,332
that against colonial pipeline
who we heard acknowledged

784
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:25,060
a over 4 million, almost
$5 million ransom payment.

785
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:30,060
The ransom demand for the City
of Atlanta was around 52,000.

786
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:34,170
And so you think of, well,
yes, both had the impact

787
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:38,757
or potential impact to just
paralyze various things.

788
00:34:38,757 --> 00:34:40,000
And so it kind of goes back

789
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,070
to what Lawrence also had highlighted

790
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:44,810
in building on that is,

791
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:48,659
the attackers don't always
know, don't always care,

792
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:49,859
it's just sometimes they may

793
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:52,260
have stumbled on to as you noted.

794
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:56,013
You've left something
open and you don't have

795
00:34:56,013 --> 00:34:57,799
a reminder that you don't have

796
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,440
to build the expertise in-house.

797
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,900
You've already got a constrained budget.

798
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:05,877
So Lawrence, you had
spoken previously as well

799
00:35:05,877 --> 00:35:07,930
about the Verizon data breach report

800
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:12,136
and some of the trends there and how,

801
00:35:12,137 --> 00:35:17,137
you know, the SMB trend is
accelerating everything.

802
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,360
Have you seen additional shifts,

803
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:23,330
I mean, now that we've scared
everyone and told them,

804
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:26,940
Hey, your SMB, your state and local,

805
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,580
you're going to come under attack.

806
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:30,130
What are some of the
other trends that you saw

807
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:31,223
from Verizon's report as well

808
00:35:31,223 --> 00:35:33,680
as some of the other reports coming out?

809
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,299
- Well, that's a great question.

810
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:39,623
And I think, you know, the
one point I want to make sure

811
00:35:39,623 --> 00:35:44,070
I illustrate here is in,

812
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:47,620
in surely with this crowd
and this audience at RSA,

813
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:49,500
you know, this is the,

814
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:52,653
represents the best and the
brightest in the industry.

815
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,740
In most small businesses,

816
00:35:56,740 --> 00:36:00,080
they can't afford to be part of this.

817
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:04,960
Most managed services
providers don't know of RSA.

818
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,660
They can't be here.

819
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:09,020
Most small government, they can't be here.

820
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:10,640
They're not hearing this information.

821
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,240
They're not hearing and
taking the advantage

822
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,330
or having the advantage that we all do

823
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:17,160
from being able to hear
from amazing people

824
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:20,490
and truly thought ideas in the space.

825
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:25,069
So, and I say that only to elude

826
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:29,440
to the fact that the trends
that we see both prac,

827
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,870
you know, actually practically
those being demonstrated

828
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:34,214
and those that are coming out

829
00:36:34,214 --> 00:36:37,924
in things like a Verizon
data breach report,

830
00:36:37,924 --> 00:36:40,150
there are a number.

831
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:44,358
Even some of the FBI
pins that have come out,

832
00:36:44,358 --> 00:36:47,870
the notices that FBI has issued.

833
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:51,870
These are not, the attacks and the methods

834
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:55,480
that are being used are not
the latest sexy zero day.

835
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,754
This is low-hanging fruit.

836
00:36:57,754 --> 00:37:01,150
It really is some of the most fundamental

837
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:03,350
and elemental pieces of infosec

838
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:05,427
that maybe if you're a
part of the enterprise

839
00:37:05,427 --> 00:37:08,723
you think, oh, everyone has
MFA or everyone has SSO,

840
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,730
that's not the case.

841
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:14,270
The, in fact it's so not the case,

842
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:17,363
it is a minority of clients,

843
00:37:18,668 --> 00:37:23,470
our SMB clients that we see
that have MFA enabled or SSO,

844
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:26,520
or even really understand
what zero trust is.

845
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,210
So the trends that we see,

846
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:29,380
I mean, things like RDP.

847
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:30,933
RDP is ubiquitous.

848
00:37:30,933 --> 00:37:33,470
Unpatched RDP is ubiquitous.

849
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:35,230
Machines that can't be patched

850
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:37,760
because they're running a
critical controls system

851
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,310
or they bridge the IT and OT network,

852
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:43,580
and, you know, there are no mitigations.

853
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:47,170
The vendors themselves
say, no AV, don't patch.

854
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:49,660
This has to be running Windows 98.

855
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:50,841
Not kidding.

856
00:37:50,841 --> 00:37:51,850
(Elizabeth laughing)

857
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:53,170
Those things are out there, right?

858
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:54,290
And they're running,

859
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:57,990
they're running major parts of our society

860
00:37:57,990 --> 00:38:00,740
and the organizations that
are responsible for them,

861
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:01,995
they might know that there's a problem,

862
00:38:01,995 --> 00:38:04,240
they might not even know
that there was a problem

863
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,595
with that either because of a culture

864
00:38:07,595 --> 00:38:09,850
to the point that that Harry brought up,

865
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:11,170
that it's not, you know,

866
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:13,301
we're too small, we're whatever

867
00:38:13,301 --> 00:38:15,220
or they don't know what to do.

868
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:19,680
So it's not the sexy zero days
that are getting burned here,

869
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:23,236
but the criminals are absolutely
still making their money.

870
00:38:23,236 --> 00:38:26,854
And Liz, I really appreciate
the fact that you,

871
00:38:26,854 --> 00:38:30,823
you brought up the difference
in these ransom demands.

872
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:34,314
That is like the, you know,

873
00:38:34,314 --> 00:38:37,899
attack and then exfiltration of data

874
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:40,390
and then the re monetization of that data

875
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:42,180
is absolutely happening.

876
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:44,470
And in many small businesses,

877
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:46,959
they didn't even know that was a thing.

878
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,360
And so they're getting

879
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:53,330
these multi-million dollar ransom demands

880
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:58,330
and often the attackers already
know how much cash they have

881
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:01,230
because they downloaded
their bank statements.

882
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:02,063
- Exactly.

883
00:39:02,063 --> 00:39:02,896
And that tailored,

884
00:39:02,896 --> 00:39:04,674
and it sounds like
tailoring the solutions.

885
00:39:04,674 --> 00:39:08,565
So last second, thank you
to everyone who joined,

886
00:39:08,565 --> 00:39:11,066
listened in and the panelists.

887
00:39:11,066 --> 00:39:15,220
Do you all have a two word partying,

888
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:18,183
partying shot across the
bow starting with Harry.

889
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:23,840
- First, I got to find the unmute button.

890
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:26,823
Two words, culture and education.

891
00:39:28,292 --> 00:39:30,680
And Thank you for inviting me.
- Excellent.

892
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,556
Now, Tony.

893
00:39:32,556 --> 00:39:35,400
- I'll repeat my message of get started.

894
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,463
There's plenty to work with.

895
00:39:36,463 --> 00:39:38,870
We can admire the problem
we can agonize over

896
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:40,799
or we can just get to work and there's,

897
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,700
we provide some guidance
to help people get started.

898
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,142
- Thank you and Lawrence.

899
00:39:45,142 --> 00:39:47,480
- I'm going to echo
largely what Tony said.

900
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,683
Start now.

901
00:39:49,611 --> 00:39:50,879
- Excellent.

902
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,220
Well, thank you so much again to everyone.

903
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:55,029
Please check out the resources

904
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:58,943
and enjoy the rest of your RSA experience.
