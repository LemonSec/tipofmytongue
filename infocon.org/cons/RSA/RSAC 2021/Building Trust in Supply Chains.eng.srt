1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:02,183
- Hello.

2
00:00:02,183 --> 00:00:04,810
My name is Shingo Hane.

3
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:06,423
It is great to meet you.

4
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,330
Today I'm going to talk
about building trust

5
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:11,423
in supply chains.

6
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:15,780
I'm sure you are all shocked

7
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,759
by the SolarWinds hacking program

8
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,173
they build at the end of last year.

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,860
It has called the attention of many people

10
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,122
because of the extent of damage.

11
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,520
Today I'm going to talk about

12
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,010
the result of the research and development

13
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:38,003
on supply chain security and trust,

14
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:43,882
using attack on SolarWinds
supply chain as an example.

15
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:50,433
Attacks on supply chains
are not something new.

16
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:55,790
A few years ago, a number
of data falsification cases

17
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:59,360
surface at the development
and production site

18
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,363
of several well-trusted
Japanese companies,

19
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,723
which made headlines.

20
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:09,950
There's also a report
suspicion of the small chips

21
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:13,660
being illegally inserted
into the motherboard

22
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:17,100
in the upstream stage of the supply chain

23
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,823
in order to extract data.

24
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,960
Since then, figuring out
how to protect supply chains

25
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,429
from illegal actions and attacks

26
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:30,343
have become a pressing issue.

27
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,279
And we have been researching

28
00:01:33,279 --> 00:01:37,982
what we can do to make supply
chain secure and trustworthy.

29
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,100
We will note a service and approach

30
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:46,923
to protect against individual
illegal actions and attacks.

31
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:51,200
Instead, we will create framework

32
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,700
fair organization in the supply chain.

33
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:58,700
We'll use evidence to demonstrate
that the supply process

34
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,770
of product and services

35
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:04,982
is consistently secure and trustworthy,

36
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,342
and allow client to confirm it.

37
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:12,970
We have received significant
support from the state

38
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:14,970
for this activity.

39
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:18,033
As a leader, I have
worked on it together with

40
00:02:18,033 --> 00:02:19,512
several companies.

41
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,210
I'm going to talk about
this activity today.

42
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:28,720
Now that it is established
and because I believe

43
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,703
that we should share the
results with the wider audience,

44
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:39,470
we will work together with
public research organizations.

45
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:42,620
Dr. Yamada from AIST

46
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,470
is going to share the detail with you.

47
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:48,543
Thank you for joining
us today, Dr. Yamada.

48
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,760
- Thank you very much Hane san.

49
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,519
I'm going to show examples of incidents

50
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,050
that can damage trust,

51
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:01,443
propose method to overcome this program,

52
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:07,300
and the activities that we
plan to conduct going forward.

53
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:13,060
What happened to SolarWinds

54
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:16,910
was profoundly serious incident.

55
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:19,850
When updating a software called Orion,

56
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:24,783
the software was distributed
with malware inside.

57
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:30,810
The attack has sneaked in
a malware called Sunspot

58
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:33,210
in the software build process.

59
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:38,210
And Sunspot in turn downloaded
a malware called Sunburst

60
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,543
which entered Orion.

61
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:45,060
In this case, the software was falsified,

62
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,370
but the falsification was not detected

63
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:53,370
by the change management, nor
the design and code reviews.

64
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,360
As a result, confidential information

65
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,123
of countless organization
was collected by the malware.

66
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,120
This is the security incident

67
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,630
caused by an attack on the supply chain,

68
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:13,150
but let us take a
broader look at incidents

69
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:17,103
that affected the
trustworthiness of supply chains.

70
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,680
In the first case, a computer system

71
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,780
at a semiconductor
manufacturer's plant in Asia

72
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:29,123
was infected by a ransomware.

73
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:34,620
It happened because a
malware-contaminated software

74
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:38,770
was installed without
checking for viruses,

75
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:43,020
which led to over 10,000 Windows PC

76
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,570
on the internal network being infected

77
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:51,550
by neglecting just this one
step of checking for viruses.

78
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:56,350
The company sales in the
third quarter of 2018

79
00:04:56,350 --> 00:05:00,221
was set to have dropped by about 3%

80
00:05:00,221 --> 00:05:03,100
because the incident delayed shipments

81
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:06,360
and incurred cost for countermeasures

82
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,120
when Bloomberg announced that one country

83
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:15,120
had tampered with server
computers of 30 US companies.

84
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,349
According to Bloomberg,

85
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:20,930
super small chips for attacking

86
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:23,050
was sneaked in the motherboard

87
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:28,050
of one of the world's largest
server motherboard suppliers

88
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,890
during an outsourced production process.

89
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:36,810
As a result, a backdoor was
opened in the running OS,

90
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:39,553
and confidential information was leaked.

91
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:44,130
The third case involve

92
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:46,550
a flawed inspection in Japan

93
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:51,550
for industry rubber products
using tankers and other things.

94
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:55,900
Even though the company had
agreed with the customer

95
00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:00,017
to randomly inspect one
out of five products,

96
00:06:00,017 --> 00:06:04,173
the company only checked
1 out of 10 or 20.

97
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:07,700
In the press release,

98
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,409
the company blamed personnel negligence

99
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:13,683
by the inspecting officer.

100
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:17,830
Low awareness of compliance with rules

101
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:22,750
and insufficient management
and supervision among others.

102
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,580
If one of the products used for tankers

103
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,849
turn out to be defective.

104
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:31,113
It could've caused a
catastrophic accident.

105
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:34,210
- Thank you.

106
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:37,349
We look at the issues
greeting supply chain

107
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:39,483
have occurred in high numbers.

108
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:45,210
But how are we to understand
that trust in this context

109
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,983
that you have talked about?

110
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:53,173
- Right, let us have a
deeper look into trust.

111
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:57,500
According to Miriam Webster's dictionary,

112
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:02,500
it is assured reliance on
the character, ability,

113
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,390
strength, or truth of
someone with something.

114
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:13,390
International standard, ISO/IEC 25010,

115
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,880
systems and software quality models

116
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,840
define trust as degree to which a user

117
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,859
or other stakeholder has confidence

118
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,763
their product or system
would behave as intended.

119
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:33,159
Customers completely trust the products

120
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,770
and pay the correspondent value for them.

121
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:40,359
However, we may have reached the point

122
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:44,753
where we need to reevaluate
that implicit assumption.

123
00:07:47,547 --> 00:07:51,730
How do a supplier and an
acquirer trust each other?

124
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,900
An acquirer has certain
expectation and criteria on trust

125
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:02,763
regarding the products and
services they have ordered.

126
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:06,979
To meet the acquirer's expectation.

127
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:09,700
The supplier develops trustworthiness

128
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,663
for their products and services.

129
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:15,730
The international standard organization

130
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:20,040
ISO/IEC JTC 1/WG 13

131
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:23,920
defines trustworthiness as ability

132
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,910
to meet stakeholder expectations

133
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:32,183
in a demonstrable, verifiable,
and measurable way.

134
00:08:37,255 --> 00:08:40,419
Upon receiving the products and services,

135
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:44,540
the acquirer judges whether
the products and service

136
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:49,540
have fulfilled the expectations
and expected criteria.

137
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:53,370
If they do, trust is formed.

138
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:54,590
- Thank you.

139
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:57,810
Indeed, it looks there's various way

140
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:00,443
to look at trust being discussed.

141
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:05,373
(indistinct) how are we
to develop this trust?

142
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:09,433
- Yes, let us think about that.

143
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:14,143
Products need to be
trustworthy to be trusted.

144
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:20,360
For trustworthiness to meet
stakeholder's expectations

145
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:25,360
in a demonstrable,
verifiable, and measurable way

146
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,943
as defined in the previous slide,

147
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:33,363
suppliers need to make
organizational efforts.

148
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:37,160
The efforts are then documented

149
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:41,492
and becomes the organizational
rules and requirements.

150
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:45,199
Now let us take a closer look

151
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,510
at SolarWinds' incident
from that viewpoint.

152
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:51,939
First, attackers are no longer attacking

153
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,603
user environments only.

154
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:59,610
They are attacking supplier's
development, environments too.

155
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:04,540
If they successfully attack suppliers,

156
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:08,793
the damage would spread
to acquirers in seconds.

157
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,599
In this particular incident,

158
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,830
the development empowerment was falsified

159
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:17,403
to include malware.

160
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:24,030
The company need to detect
it, but fail to to do so,

161
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:29,270
suggesting that the company
did not have sufficient rules.

162
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,440
Let us take a deeper look
at the four incidents

163
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,873
from the point of view of company rules.

164
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:43,520
This table shows where the
incident occurred and by whom,

165
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,763
in relation to the company rules.

166
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:53,800
Incident occur not just
during the production process,

167
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,632
but during the testing process as well.

168
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:03,053
They can come from external
attackers, as well as employees.

169
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:09,130
In some cases, company rules
are not thorough enough

170
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:13,050
and sometimes they are broken deliberately

171
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:14,363
or by accident.

172
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:20,340
This analysis suggest that incidents

173
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:23,003
can happen during any process.

174
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:26,689
When we look at the relation

175
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:31,080
between incidents and company rules,

176
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:36,080
we identify whether there
is any flaw in the rules

177
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:41,600
or whether the rules
get broken deliberately

178
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,460
or by accident.

179
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:47,820
The problems may not always occur

180
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:52,820
at the company that
caused the problem either.

181
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:56,073
To prevent these incidents,

182
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:01,935
it is vital that we
comply wit company rules.

183
00:12:01,935 --> 00:12:04,369
These diagram shows an issue

184
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:08,610
that arises in the upstream stage

185
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:11,900
can create programs downstream.

186
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,663
- Thank you for the outline.

187
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:16,510
Could you tell us about the detail

188
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:19,490
of our approach a bit more?

189
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:23,283
- Yes, I'm going to explain our
approach for building trust.

190
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:27,420
First, I'm going to
explain about the risks

191
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:30,329
associated with supply chain trust.

192
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:32,430
If a company makes the product

193
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:37,653
with a company from a supplier,

194
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:42,600
the component may be held liable

195
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:47,600
for the incident caused by that component.

196
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:52,293
The closer you are to the
end of the supply chain,

197
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:57,480
the more serious the impact will be

198
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:03,400
if liability becomes an
issue when problems occur,

199
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,190
which creates a business risk.

200
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:13,190
To that end, the risk of
trust in the supply chain

201
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:17,372
cannot be resolved by
just one company alone.

202
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,570
The list can be minimized

203
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:26,570
only through the joint efforts
of all companies involved.

204
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:33,220
I'm going to explain the basic
approach for building trust.

205
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:36,350
As I have explained,
following company rules

206
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:40,530
is vital for developing trust.

207
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:44,439
Therefore, if you track
whether company rules

208
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,503
have been followed, you can track trust.

209
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,203
When placing our order,

210
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:56,090
the acquirer needs to make
explicit request regarding trust.

211
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:03,000
The supplier demonstrates with evidence

212
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
that it needs those request
and provide products

213
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:15,600
and services in compliance
with company rules.

214
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:20,900
By having this relationship

215
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,403
spread throughout the supply chain,

216
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:29,790
trust for the whole
supply chain can be built.

217
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,603
Let me explain with the diagram.

218
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:38,580
Acquirer B places an order

219
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:42,700
and increased requirements
for trustworthiness.

220
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:45,973
When delivering products and services,

221
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,280
supplier A presents evidence

222
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:56,200
that it has followed company rules.

223
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,670
This leads to the building of trust

224
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:02,219
between the two companies.

225
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:06,290
By connecting all companies in
the supply chain in this way,

226
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:10,132
trust for the whole
chain can be established.

227
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,360
A cyber physical space
is the best environment

228
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,893
for building trust.

229
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,020
Trust performed in the physical space

230
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:23,252
can be collected with
sensors and digitized.

231
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:25,719
Using that data,

232
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,090
companies can check and record

233
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:30,710
whether task have been performed

234
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:33,883
in compliance with their company rules.

235
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:38,400
If rules are not adequate,

236
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:42,143
immediate measures can be
taken in the cyberspace.

237
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,920
Request about trustworthiness

238
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:51,450
evidence that their request
have been satisfied,

239
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,310
and the request results

240
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:59,189
can all be automatically
saved in the cyberspace.

241
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:02,910
Trustworthiness in the
cyber physical space

242
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:07,700
creates a new paradigm for trust

243
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:11,810
reduces incidents and eventually

244
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:15,173
reduces the total cost for the society.

245
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:19,300
Let us look back at what I've talked about

246
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,370
using this diagram.

247
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:24,920
Tasks in the physical space

248
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:29,469
can be modeled in the
cyberspace by task group

249
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:33,050
including the information
about the relationship

250
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:37,170
between the task groups and
the details of the rules.

251
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:41,209
Sensors can log the task
for each task group,

252
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:43,850
which can be compared with the rules

253
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:45,390
within the models

254
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:49,100
to check whether the
rules have been followed.

255
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,883
- How exactly do you check that?

256
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:56,660
- After checking the company
rules have been followed,

257
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:01,140
the results have saved
us digital evidence.

258
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:06,040
In principle, this digital
evidence may not be disclosed.

259
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:11,040
The digital evidence is
compiled to create a certificate

260
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:14,860
that indicates trustworthiness of the

261
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:20,409
manufacturing process, et cetera,

262
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:23,880
and is stored in a Trust Store.

263
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,270
Let me explain in a diagram.

264
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:28,670
Suppose there is a supply chain

265
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:30,633
as shown in the top right,

266
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:36,909
company A manufactures product A.

267
00:17:38,793 --> 00:17:41,689
Digital evidence is generated

268
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:46,690
and certificate is stored
in the Trust Store.

269
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,590
The same happens for
companies B, C, and D.

270
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:55,423
But

271
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:01,560
if the products are interrelated,

272
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:06,280
links will be created to
connect the certificates

273
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,660
within the Trust Store.

274
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:13,660
Users can make inquiries
to the Trust Store

275
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,100
about the trustworthiness
of various products

276
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:21,800
and receive the result in
the form of certificates.

277
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,993
- What are the effects of this method?

278
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:29,850
- First, this will make
trustworthiness more transparent.

279
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:33,010
The acquirer's request to the supplier

280
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:36,823
will be explicitly presented.

281
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:41,540
And the fact that that
request has been fulfilled

282
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:46,300
will be explicitly expressed
in the certificate.

283
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:49,399
Product trustworthiness will be visible

284
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,820
not just to the acquirer,

285
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,473
but to the associates too.

286
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:56,699
As a result, trustworthiness

287
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:01,213
will become a way to differentiate
products more than ever.

288
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,720
- Good method to develop trustworthiness

289
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,423
have prevented that SolarWinds incident.

290
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,822
- It could have alleviated the problem.

291
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,030
Best practice in change management,

292
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:18,330
development review and security

293
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:21,453
are vital in software development.

294
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:26,430
This approach checks
whether the best practice

295
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:31,430
have been performed
according to company rules.

296
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:35,373
The acquirer can also see the results.

297
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:39,950
Using this method, the acquirer

298
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:44,480
can explicitly request for integrity

299
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,703
and checks whether the
request has been satisfied.

300
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:53,810
How can we apply this concept?

301
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:58,659
First, know that protecting
your company's product

302
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:01,490
means protecting your company.

303
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:06,490
To do that, you must clarify
core value of the product.

304
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,370
Have you done everything you could

305
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:11,892
to protect that value?

306
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,350
Make the actions you have taken to protect

307
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:18,342
the product value visible.

308
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,800
If you used the approach

309
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,149
for the method to build trust.

310
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:28,500
You can track the evidence
of trustworthiness.

311
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:33,050
- Could you explain the activities
that are in the pipeline?

312
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:33,883
- Yes.

313
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:37,370
I'm going to talk about that.

314
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:39,622
How would this method change trust?

315
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:43,637
When placing and receiving product orders,

316
00:20:45,461 --> 00:20:50,170
explicit request for
trustworthiness and certificates

317
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:54,110
that serves as answers to those request

318
00:20:55,687 --> 00:20:59,689
would become a communication
tool for companies

319
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:04,113
that attach great significance
to trustworthiness.

320
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:08,400
If explicit request for trustworthiness

321
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,860
are presented in an e-marketplace,

322
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:15,990
suppliers may be able to find new clients

323
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:18,510
by evaluating whether their products

324
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:21,439
match their acquirer's requests.

325
00:21:21,439 --> 00:21:25,010
Acquirer's can check
certificate in the Trust Store,

326
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:27,950
and they identifier suppliers

327
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:32,230
who satisfy the level
trustworthiness they seek.

328
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:34,090
But before that happens,

329
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:38,199
interoperability needs to be established

330
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:42,913
for each international
standardization must happen first.

331
00:21:43,901 --> 00:21:45,620
That's the first step.

332
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:47,889
We have launched an activity

333
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:50,823
in IIC's trustworthiness task groups.

334
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:55,149
The results would be released soon

335
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:58,500
as the trustworthiness
framework foundations.

336
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:02,698
The next step to take is
international standardization

337
00:22:02,698 --> 00:22:04,403
with ISO and IEC.

338
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:09,380
Lastly, let me show you a video

339
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:11,453
on the method to build trust.

340
00:22:13,657 --> 00:22:14,500
(gentle music)

341
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,730
- [Narrator] In the supply chains

342
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:18,360
of the Society 5.0 era,

343
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:21,159
trust underpins the interconnections

344
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,513
between companies and organizations.

345
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,330
Let's introduce our technologies

346
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:30,080
that will create safe
and secure supply chains

347
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,622
connected by trust.

348
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:36,562
This shows a factory assembly line.

349
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:41,180
To ensure all products
to be safe and reliable,

350
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,600
firstly, the right model

351
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,340
for the value creation process

352
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,840
needs to be established

353
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,740
for the process of producing products.

354
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:55,300
The VCP notation and its
use can make the VCP model

355
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:58,653
by defining the production
process and its standards.

356
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,720
Secondly, collecting data
from each implemented process

357
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,880
and comparing it to the VCP model

358
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,923
from six points of view
enables conformance validation.

359
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:16,060
The data used in this process
and the verification results

360
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:18,810
are saved as digital evidence.

361
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:21,750
The evidence assures the
product's reliability

362
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:24,203
that causes the product to be trusted.

363
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:28,380
Moreover, based on this trust,

364
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:31,800
certificates are created
with a common formate.

365
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:35,690
Organizations add
certificates to Trust Store

366
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:39,480
so that shows their
connections to be trusted.

367
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,960
As these interconnection
spread wider and wider,

368
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,900
everyone would be able to evaluate

369
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:48,483
reliability of the product
supply chain entirely.

370
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,490
In this way, trust
constructs the Trust Chain

371
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:56,250
by underpinning the entire supply chain,

372
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:58,223
including consumers.

373
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:03,340
By using secure data tracking technology

374
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,179
that limits authorized viewers

375
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:07,510
on interconnection of certificates,

376
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:10,250
companies and organizations can use safely

377
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:12,343
and protect sensitive information.

378
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:17,660
These technologies and their combination

379
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:21,403
implement the safe and
secure supply chain.

380
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:25,110
Our technologies are a key piece

381
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:28,602
to support society connected by trust.

382
00:24:30,407 --> 00:24:34,240
- Thank you very much
for your kind attention.
