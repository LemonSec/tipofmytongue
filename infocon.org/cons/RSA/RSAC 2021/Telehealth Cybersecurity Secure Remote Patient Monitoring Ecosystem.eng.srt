1
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:02,803
- Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:02,803 --> 00:00:05,810
Thanks for tuning in to our session today

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:07,492
on Telehealth CyberSecurity:

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,420
Secure Remote Patient

5
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:13,230
Monitoring Ecosystem.

6
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,210
My name is Nakia Grayson,

7
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:19,080
and I'm an IT Security Specialist

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,889
at the National Institution
of Standards and Technology.

9
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,930
I'm the Principal Investigator
for the Healthcare Sector

10
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:31,313
at the National Cybersecurity
Center of Excellence.

11
00:00:32,993 --> 00:00:34,576
The National Cyber-

12
00:00:36,338 --> 00:00:40,108
security Center of Excellence, NCCoE,

13
00:00:40,108 --> 00:00:42,349
a part of the National
Institution of Standards

14
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:44,410
and Technology, NIST,

15
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:47,370
is a correlative hub

16
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:51,260
where industry, organization,
government agencies

17
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:55,390
and academic institutions, come together

18
00:00:55,390 --> 00:01:00,390
to address business's most
pressing cybersecurity issues.

19
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:02,610
The NCCoE

20
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:05,129
apply cybersecurity standards

21
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:08,699
and best practices, to develop

22
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,557
the easily adaptable example,
cybersecurity solutions.

23
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:20,410
So additionally, Patients
Monitoring System

24
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:24,509
has been deployed in
controlled environment

25
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:29,490
such as healthcare facilities.

26
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:34,490
Increasingly Healthcare
Delivery Organizations,

27
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,480
HDOs, are

28
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:42,300
relying on Telehealth
Remote Patient Monitoring,

29
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,233
RPM capabilities,

30
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:49,380
so that they can care
for patients at home.

31
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,770
The NCCoE

32
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:54,065
worked with 10 industry

33
00:01:54,065 --> 00:01:58,720
collaborators and build
an example solution

34
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,929
with a Reference Architecture,

35
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:05,420
to demonstrate how
organizations can implement

36
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:09,449
their security and privacy controls

37
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:14,450
to enhance the resiliency of
their telehealth services.

38
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:19,310
Now I'll let the panel
introduce themselves.

39
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:24,083
I'll pass it over to Axel
to introduce himself.

40
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,273
- Thanks Nakia.

41
00:02:26,273 --> 00:02:28,100
And yes, hi, my name's Axel Wirth.

42
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:31,829
I'm the Chief Security
Strategist for MedCrypt,

43
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:34,600
the San Diego-based Cybersecurity company,

44
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,040
with focus on the medical device industry.

45
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,679
This is actually my third
NCC healthcare project

46
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,193
I've been participating in.

47
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,859
This time my role was as
a Cybersecurity Advisor

48
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:49,000
and Subject Matter Expert,

49
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,300
and has once again been a great experience

50
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,217
working with the the team at NCCoE

51
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:59,050
and producing this
hopefully beneficial outcome

52
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:00,263
to the larger community.

53
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,780
- Thank you, Axel.

54
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,170
Hello everyone.

55
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:07,179
I'm Steve Waite, Executive Director

56
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,300
for the Office of Information Security

57
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,270
at the University of
Mississippi Medical Center.

58
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:14,960
In that capacity, I serve
as the institution's

59
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,440
Information Security Officer.

60
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,310
UMMC was one if the only

61
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:22,763
two Telehealth Centers of
Excellence in the United States.

62
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:24,493
Sue.

63
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:26,579
- Thank you, Steve.

64
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:27,480
Hello everyone.

65
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,220
My name is Sue Wang and I'm a Principle

66
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,930
Cybersecurity Engineer and MITRE,

67
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:37,840
a nonprofit company and provides research

68
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,820
and support to federal agencies.

69
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,910
For this project I serve
as a Technical Lead

70
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:47,103
and for the NCCoE healthcare team.

71
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,031
- Great.

72
00:03:49,031 --> 00:03:51,330
Thank you everyone.

73
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:55,750
We'll get starting with
discussing the project motivation

74
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,550
and the scope of the work.

75
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:00,780
Sue, let's start with you.

76
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:05,780
What motivated the NCCoE
team to take on this topic?

77
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,713
- Yeah, thank you.

78
00:04:07,713 --> 00:04:09,010
That's a good question.

79
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:11,899
And in the late 2018,

80
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:16,334
as effort to identify
the pipeline projects,

81
00:04:16,334 --> 00:04:18,630
they waited some research

82
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:23,630
and decide on to expand our
work into the telehealth space.

83
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,600
I will say we have three major motivations

84
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,610
for the NCCoE healthcare
team to take on this topic.

85
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:35,500
First, our community of
interest and the stakeholder

86
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:40,080
from the industry, express
the interests and the needs

87
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,599
of the Cybersecurity Guidance
in the telehealth space.

88
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,520
And secondly, our NCCoE
healthcare team also

89
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:53,010
had that desire to expand our work into

90
00:04:54,893 --> 00:04:58,820
the other areas in the
healthcare landscape.

91
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:01,170
As at that time, we already

92
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:03,800
worked with industry collaborators

93
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,070
and published this three
Cybersecurity Guidance,

94
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:12,950
which were all focused on the
HDO enterprise environment.

95
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:15,090
And the third motivation will be,

96
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:19,616
and we realized that the
increase, the security

97
00:05:19,617 --> 00:05:23,690
and the privacy concerns,
in the connected house

98
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:28,440
and beyond the HDO
enterprise environments.

99
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:32,760
So once we decide on working
in the in telehealth space,

100
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,317
we then scope down this project down

101
00:05:35,317 --> 00:05:40,317
to focus on the Remote Patient
Monitoring, RPM ecosystem.

102
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,060
And I work across three
domains, the patient home,

103
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,573
a telehealth platform provider and HDO.

104
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,913
- Thanks Sue.

105
00:05:50,913 --> 00:05:52,680
Steve what are some of the

106
00:05:54,793 --> 00:05:58,150
challenges that you have
seen in the industry,

107
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:00,780
that made it important for NCCoE

108
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,563
to take on this topic?

109
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:09,419
- Well Nakia, in Mississippi residents

110
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:12,863
in 53 of the states, 82 counties,

111
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:17,810
they must drive more than 40
minutes to see a specialist.

112
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:20,760
That challenge is not unique to our state.

113
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:25,270
When we created the Delta
Diabetic Network in 2014,

114
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:28,760
we saved the initial 100
participants in that trial

115
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:32,090
more than 9,454 miles,

116
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:33,630
in driving to specialists

117
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:36,530
in Jackson Mississippi or Memphis.

118
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:39,530
And not a single
participant was hospitalized

119
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:43,179
or visited in emergency
room due to complications

120
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:47,983
of their diabetes, saving
payers more than $300,000.

121
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,500
- Thanks, Steve.

122
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,713
Axel, what are your thoughts?

123
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:59,060
- No, as Steve was pointing out,

124
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:03,860
telehealth is a relative recent
evolution in care delivery,

125
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,170
and it addresses multiple challenges,

126
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:08,800
including improving access to care,

127
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,800
reducing the cost of
care, but also addressing

128
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,550
the need to care for an
increasingly aging population.

129
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:19,620
The baby boomers that are
heading for retirement age

130
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,793
and an age of more chronic diseases.

131
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:27,514
It is also in many cases,
preferred by the patients.

132
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:29,810
They like they like to
receive care at home

133
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:31,450
rather than in the hospital.

134
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,849
They'd like to avoid the travel
as Steve was pointing out,

135
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:37,053
rather than sitting in traffic.

136
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:39,740
And certainly, the recent pandemic

137
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,803
has accelerated these trends.

138
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,910
Some even say by more than a decade.

139
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:48,937
And I'm sure that most of these
changes towards a telehealth

140
00:07:48,937 --> 00:07:52,610
and Remote Healthcare Delivery
Program, are here to stay.

141
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:54,970
They will be with us for the future.

142
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:55,803
- Thanks Axel.

143
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,290
Axel, as you and Steve
talk about some of the

144
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:04,289
challenges and telehealth services,

145
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:09,100
it will be great to hear how
you and your organization

146
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,490
benefit from working with this topic.

147
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:13,300
And Steve, feel free

148
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:17,483
to jump right in after Axel.

149
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:22,093
- So from my perspective and
my organization's perspective,

150
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:26,430
you're clearly any collaboration
across stakeholders

151
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:31,010
and with other subject matter
experts, it's beneficial.

152
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,819
It provides a reality check.

153
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:38,820
It provides a way to think
about and implement security

154
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,549
in the real world context

155
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:42,809
and in the practical clinical environment,

156
00:08:42,809 --> 00:08:44,510
rather than thinking about

157
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:46,860
and dealing with security
more in the abstract.

158
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:49,693
- Well for us,

159
00:08:49,693 --> 00:08:52,329
it was just an opportunity
to learn other ways

160
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:56,440
on how to secure an RPM environment,

161
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:01,140
where proprietary devices are
not available or practical.

162
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,220
Our practices has been to use proprietary,

163
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:07,090
secure proprietary devices

164
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:09,960
in the past.

165
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,480
And then also to learning how
to manage voice assistance,

166
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,330
which is a new challenge
from a security perspective,

167
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:20,460
in a home and other video aspects,

168
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,000
and then how to account for them

169
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,637
when putting together
such an architecture.

170
00:09:25,637 --> 00:09:27,989
And then we learned to how to account for

171
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,680
all of the variables,

172
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:34,380
and how to mitigate the
security risks they pose,

173
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,540
by structuring it

174
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,190
in various stages for
various environments,

175
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:45,633
on how we would manage the
Remote Patient Monitoring.

176
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:48,783
- Great.

177
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,450
To follow on to that, actually

178
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:55,630
what benefits can panel

179
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:01,910
guests and organizations,
take away from this work?

180
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,230
- So what are we gonna
talk about in this session

181
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:09,170
and what the larger project
was about is really how to

182
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:15,430
implement and effectively realize an RPM

183
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:20,130
system that leverages the
existing infrastructure

184
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:24,360
that is in place, leverages
existing technologies

185
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,110
and leverages existing
approaches to cybersecurity

186
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:31,940
to again implement and realize

187
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:34,563
an RPM-based care delivery model.

188
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,293
- So,

189
00:10:40,497 --> 00:10:42,969
it exposes the need and
the business challenge

190
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:46,210
within the (indistinct) industry.

191
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:49,541
Remote Patient Monitoring
is growing exponentially,

192
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:51,600
and as Axel said previously,

193
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,750
it's pretty much the expectation
for our patients right now.

194
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:59,490
And from an HDO perspective,
it also helps us in

195
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:02,550
infection control, because
we want our patients

196
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:06,010
back in the home, as
is quickly as possible.

197
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:10,750
And the other thing for
us and what attracted us,

198
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,670
is this wasn't a vendor promotion,

199
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:14,729
but it's rather a template

200
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:17,330
for establishing a secure
Remote Patient Monitoring

201
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:20,790
environment, while still
engaging the outside resources

202
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:24,069
that you at your organization
are most comfortable with.

203
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,920
- Great.

204
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,160
Steve, in the context of technology,

205
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:37,240
how does technology organization

206
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,723
view the healthcare industry?

207
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:44,640
- Well in UMMC, we're all in accord.

208
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,090
We have a security
council that meets monthly

209
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:50,380
and includes members
from hospital leadership,

210
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:53,020
frontline healthcare workers, students,

211
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:55,680
and we're also responsible
for the seven schools

212
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,282
on our campus, legal
compliance and procurement.

213
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:03,210
You cannot wait for
this type of engagement,

214
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:04,950
you must command it.

215
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:07,710
And it should be easy
really in today's world,

216
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:11,510
because Remote Patient
Monitoring and telehealth

217
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:15,930
they are a necessary business
lines, as is the security

218
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:19,030
and privacy protections of our patients.

219
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,427
- Great, thanks.

220
00:12:20,427 --> 00:12:21,260
Axel.

221
00:12:22,312 --> 00:12:23,145
- Yeah.

222
00:12:23,145 --> 00:12:27,560
So maybe to add to that
thought and that incident,

223
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:31,673
I think healthcare is still
challenged with cybersecurity.

224
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:36,250
For example, if you look
at the breaches report

225
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,823
to health and human services,

226
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:43,700
we saw a 26% increase in
reported breaches in 2020.

227
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,760
And certainly there are many reasons

228
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,650
for healthcare challenges, right?

229
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:51,653
One is the complexity
of health technology,

230
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:54,960
the slim profit margins,
which make it difficult

231
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,453
to invest in security,

232
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,300
the lack of healthcare specific frameworks

233
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:03,439
and best practices to implement security.

234
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:08,440
And we believe that your
projects like this NCCoE project,

235
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:13,479
are a good step that
they'll help the industry

236
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,440
to improve their security posture

237
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,650
or as in the case of
Remote Patient Monitoring,

238
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:24,650
adopt new technology without
taking on undue security risks.

239
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,049
- Thank you both.

240
00:13:26,049 --> 00:13:31,049
As earlier stated in the
beginning of today's session,

241
00:13:31,161 --> 00:13:33,640
NCCoE

242
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,540
applies NIST Standards and best practices

243
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:41,540
to develop easily adaptable
example cybersecurity solutions.

244
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:47,288
And for this project, we also looked at

245
00:13:47,288 --> 00:13:50,820
potential privacy risks
that may occur when

246
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:54,850
deploying RPM devices in patient's home,

247
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:59,593
and provided possible solutions
to mitigate those risks.

248
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,280
So Axel, how did NIST Standards

249
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:07,560
such as the NIST Cybersecurity Framework

250
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:11,107
and a NIST Privacy Framework,
benefit this project?

251
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,240
- So the NIST Cybersecurity
Framework has been

252
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,590
with us for a number of years,

253
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:20,700
and it has very quickly established itself

254
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:24,553
as a defector standard,
actually both nationally

255
00:14:24,553 --> 00:14:28,930
as well as internationally,
on good security practices

256
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:32,939
and how to communicate around security.

257
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:36,640
So as a minimum, I think any organization

258
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:41,010
that looks at implementing a
new technology, new program,

259
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:42,990
new approach to security,

260
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:46,230
should look at the NIST
Cybersecurity Framework

261
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:50,470
as a standard that should
be met and implemented.

262
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:54,573
The NIST Privacy Framework
which is actually more recent,

263
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:59,360
is similar being adopted
across industries.

264
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,180
And I think it's quite meaningful

265
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,400
to an industry like healthcare that has

266
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:08,913
very strict privacy
regulations to comply with.

267
00:15:08,913 --> 00:15:13,913
And adopting these kind
of standard approaches,

268
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,280
I think makes it easier to not only

269
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:20,650
implement a good approach to security,

270
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:22,900
but also maintain that
approach all the time.

271
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,710
- Steve, what are your thoughts?

272
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:30,700
- So,

273
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:33,160
I'll echo what Axel

274
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,969
just said.

275
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:39,660
And also say that, this
project, this initiative

276
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:42,380
helped emphasize the need to ensure

277
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,833
Remote Patient Monitoring was considered,

278
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,610
so that we do meet the
standard established

279
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:50,270
by the HIPAA Safe Harbor Law,

280
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:53,033
which was signed January 5th of this year.

281
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,750
- Great, thank you both.

282
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:58,320
Axel, what could happen if a RPM

283
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,620
ecosystem is

284
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:03,463
compromised?

285
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,810
- So, I mean, looking at the
slide that is actually up

286
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:10,910
on the screen right now, certainly

287
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:14,449
the Remote Patient Monitoring
ecosystem is quite complex

288
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:17,270
as it reaches from the patient's home,

289
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:20,060
over a typically
cloud-based service provider

290
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,750
across a public network,

291
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,770
and then to the healthcare provider.

292
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:27,939
And any compromise at any point in this

293
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:33,510
data flow can lead to unintended privacy

294
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:35,470
or security compromise,

295
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:39,630
but can also have a safety implications

296
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:43,470
as compromised patient
data could compromise

297
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:45,310
the safety of a patient.

298
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:49,229
And therefore the system's ability

299
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:54,110
to maintain confidentiality,
integrity and availability

300
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:58,140
of sensitive data across
the entire structure

301
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:01,153
is paramount, and is
critical to implement.

302
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:04,930
- Great.

303
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:06,017
Thank you.

304
00:17:06,017 --> 00:17:07,593
Steve, what are your thoughts?

305
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:10,800
- So, (clears throat)

306
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,990
if there was an incident

307
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:17,030
it would initiate an
incident response on our end,

308
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:20,030
in which we would determine
if it's an isolated instance

309
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:23,230
to a specific home or environment,

310
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:24,730
or if it was

311
00:17:25,609 --> 00:17:28,149
more broadly to that initiative,

312
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:30,690
that Remote Patient Monitoring initiative,

313
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:33,730
or if our entire ecosystem
needs to be revised

314
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:38,730
to ensure the privacy protections
of all our RPM patients.

315
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,409
So, all three would be considered,

316
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:44,330
and then we would mitigate and resolve

317
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,133
based on our findings.

318
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,330
- Great.
Thank you.

319
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:53,540
Sue, could you briefly
describe how this project

320
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,909
evaluated the risk to the RPM

321
00:17:58,350 --> 00:17:59,183
ecosystem?

322
00:17:59,183 --> 00:18:01,110
And what approach does this project use

323
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:03,709
to tackle that challenge that

324
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:08,850
you all have been discussing so far?

325
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:11,129
- Sure, certainly thank you, Nakia.

326
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:12,910
So just like any

327
00:18:13,796 --> 00:18:15,420
NCCoE projects,

328
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:18,450
the security RPM ecosystem project

329
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:21,700
we'll use the risk-based approach.

330
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:25,690
And what we do there is, we
develop a control framework

331
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:30,690
focused on the use of
three core NIST Frameworks.

332
00:18:31,358 --> 00:18:35,570
The Risk Management Framework,
the Cybersecurity Framework

333
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:36,943
and the Privacy Framework.

334
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:41,790
As far as the risk assessment goals,

335
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:46,790
when we thought about this
RPM Distributed Architecture,

336
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:50,889
we decided to take a
Threat-Centric Approach,

337
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:54,770
in understanding and
mitigating those risks.

338
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:58,790
So as we all know, the risk is made up

339
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:03,110
of two components, the threats
and the vulnerabilities.

340
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:07,760
So essentially the
Threat-Centric Approach,

341
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,653
that means is, we try
to disrupt the threats.

342
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:15,139
For this RPM project,

343
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:20,100
we conduct a generic
threat monitoring exercise.

344
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:23,879
We described a generic threat monitoring

345
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:30,090
the methodology, for example,
the threats in the system.

346
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:33,610
And we go through and the
exam those components,

347
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:37,310
and that is deployed at the patient home

348
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:39,510
as a representative to showing

349
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:42,490
how to conduct a threat monitoring.

350
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:45,879
When we select controls, and there was

351
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,440
we figured out what's vulnerable,

352
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:52,780
either when we set control
for this RPM Practice Guide,

353
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:55,720
we really select those
controls could limit

354
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,240
or prevent the threat action.

355
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,630
Remember we said, it's a
Threat-Centric Approach, right?

356
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:07,140
And we try to focus on the RPM context.

357
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:11,620
We will like to assume that
the healthcare organization

358
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:16,620
have implement or well implement
a broader set of control

359
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:21,590
that extended beyond the
scope of telehealth RPM.

360
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:24,970
One important thing we
really need to point out is

361
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:30,680
any organization when they
deploy a RPM solution,

362
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,950
they could use that example solution

363
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:36,950
for their implementation.

364
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:40,863
However, once you can recognize is,

365
00:20:40,863 --> 00:20:45,593
this is one of the many
implementation at the architecture.

366
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:50,590
Nothing can beat the organization, really.

367
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:54,250
They need to perform
their own risk assessment

368
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,120
and to implement the control

369
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,743
based on their own risk posture.

370
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:03,660
- Thank you, Sue.

371
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,770
Axel, it would be great

372
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:08,433
if you can share your thoughts as well.

373
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:10,803
- Sure.

374
00:21:10,803 --> 00:21:12,410
I think one thing we
need to realize is that

375
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:16,100
implementing good security is not easy.

376
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,850
Security is actually quite
hard, especially in light of

377
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:23,100
real life and practical
constraints and limitations

378
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,469
we need to live with.

379
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:28,150
And I think as Sue was referencing,

380
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:30,310
the NIST Cybersecurity Framework,

381
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:35,310
as well as the Privacy Framework,
are good starting points

382
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,650
for any type of organization.

383
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:40,440
Doesn't matter whether they're
large, medium or small,

384
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:43,760
to define their reference model

385
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:48,164
and their path towards a
more secure infrastructure.

386
00:21:48,164 --> 00:21:51,590
And these frameworks are
not intended to compete

387
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:53,270
with existing regulations.

388
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:56,020
Like for example, HIPAA or CCPA

389
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:58,653
or other regulations
that may exist locally.

390
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:02,800
They are more intended
to help with the actually

391
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,389
the implementation of the regulations,

392
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:08,520
and they can be used as a tool

393
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:12,160
to demonstrate how the requirements of,

394
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,170
for example the HIPAA Privacy

395
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:16,434
and Security Rules, are being met

396
00:22:16,434 --> 00:22:19,093
through the trials of the right framework.

397
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:22,463
- Great.

398
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:24,950
Back to you Sue.

399
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:28,720
What is the practical solution

400
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,160
that HDOs can implement,
to mitigate the risk

401
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,510
and increased cybersecurity

402
00:22:35,898 --> 00:22:39,763
within the telehealth RPM ecosystem?

403
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:41,543
- Right.

404
00:22:41,543 --> 00:22:42,580
Yeah, that's a good question.

405
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:45,800
And so, it come back to our
product, what product, right?

406
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,360
The Cybersecurity Guidance.

407
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:51,500
And let me share some, the building

408
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:54,800
and design principles at NCCoE.

409
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,139
Whenever we design

410
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:59,050
and building a cybersecurity solution,

411
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:03,190
and we follow certain principles,

412
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:07,550
such as and our solution
will be standard-based,

413
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:11,230
modulized, useful and repeatable.

414
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:16,030
And we also using the
commercial available technology.

415
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:20,240
So whatever we implement
and the HDO can really,

416
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,420
and they'll be able to find
the existing technology

417
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:26,350
already there, what were used.

418
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:28,250
The other thing is, a key thing is

419
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:33,710
all our work open and
transparent to the public

420
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:37,070
and everybody can have access to it.

421
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:38,340
Then let's come back,

422
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:43,014
talk about specifically
this RPM Practice Guide.

423
00:23:43,015 --> 00:23:47,870
This guide and we defined
it in three volumes.

424
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:51,120
You can think of those volumes as address.

425
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,300
We can say why,

426
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:58,003
and what, and how of this
project respectively.

427
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,000
Volume A.

428
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,780
The volume A Executive Summary.

429
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:08,780
And it is a high-level document
for those decision makers

430
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,070
to understand the challenging

431
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:16,070
and that a enterprise facing
in the secure RPM ecosystem.

432
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:21,910
So if Volume A can also
have them to be aware

433
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:26,260
of this example solution,
and build at NCCoE,

434
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:31,260
and the benefits of adopting
those example solutions

435
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:34,620
into their organizations.

436
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,989
And let's talk about the Volume B.

437
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:41,460
The Volume B is it scraps
those Risk Assessment Approach,

438
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:45,730
that we used during the
course of this project.

439
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:50,300
And the reader will find that the tables

440
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:54,790
and we put together
crafts map, they controls,

441
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:58,730
and we select in a number
of industry standards,

442
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:03,460
as well as how they align
with the NIST Frameworks,

443
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,630
including the Cybersecurity Framework

444
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:07,570
and the Privacy Framework.

445
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:11,120
And then we also, showing in those table,

446
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,810
to see how these align with
the HIPAA Security Rule.

447
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:17,040
You can see that's a one place

448
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:20,460
and the cross map multiple standards,

449
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,820
and it really depends on your background.

450
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:26,770
You can always find
something and in common,

451
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:30,980
and when we map them back to
the Cybersecurity Framework

452
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:35,560
as Axel said, and that's a
way for us to communicate

453
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:38,653
and talking to, compare app to app.

454
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:42,960
The technology, how
can we use that, right?

455
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,690
The technology and the
security professionals

456
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:48,910
can really take the
advantage of the Volume B,

457
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:52,690
and what we did and the why we did,

458
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:55,560
in terms of the Risk Assessment Approach,

459
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:59,409
the Reference Architecture and
the Security Characteristics

460
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:01,470
of this RPM Guide.

461
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:06,030
They can then take the steps
and to doing what we did,

462
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:08,780
to either understand the risk

463
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:12,040
that might be involved
in their environment,

464
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:16,080
and how they might be
able to deploy controls

465
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:20,260
to better safeguard
their overall ecosystem.

466
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:23,960
So the last part of
the RPM Practice Guide.

467
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,190
I said last part, I put the code

468
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:30,290
and you might hear something
more and it's our Volume C.

469
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:33,820
The Volume C is really
at the engineer book,

470
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:37,800
and we document those
procedures and the steps

471
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:41,570
on how our lab environment
was constructed.

472
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:44,370
We work with technology partnership

473
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:49,340
to bring their technology,
based on our architecture design

474
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:51,169
put them into...

475
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:52,690
Build them and test them,

476
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:55,770
making sure that our solution works

477
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:58,920
and produce the cybersecurity capability

478
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,853
as what we intend to do.

479
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:06,100
So all those steps of the
deployment and configuration

480
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:08,193
are documented in that Volume C.

481
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:14,900
And so, IT and the security professional

482
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:19,170
can use this Volume C to reprocate

483
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:22,800
the part or how example solution

484
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,520
when we build into the lab.

485
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,940
- Great.

486
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,723
Steve, what are your thoughts?

487
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:33,830
- So my first recommendation
is to go to school

488
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:37,260
on the three volumes Sue just detailed,

489
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,720
to create a volume four.

490
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:43,040
And the volume four would
be specific to the patients

491
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,730
and their caregivers.

492
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:47,890
So in plain and simple language,

493
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:51,150
there's a clear
understanding of the need for

494
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:55,530
and how to protect their own privacy.

495
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:57,270
And so, and a quick example I'll give

496
00:27:57,270 --> 00:28:00,453
is when we established the
Delta Diabetic Network,

497
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:06,180
each of the participants was
given a proprietary tablet

498
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:09,890
and the questions that
they had to answer daily

499
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:12,490
where the fifth grade reading level,

500
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:16,850
and if that was too much
to manage for the patient

501
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:21,750
or their caregiver, there
was also an audio portion.

502
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:26,750
So, remember your patient
when you're implementing these

503
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:31,092
and provide them the security protocols

504
00:28:31,092 --> 00:28:35,440
in a very easy to understand manner,

505
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,283
and emphasize why it's important.

506
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,060
- Great.

507
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,780
Thank you all both.

508
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:46,360
That was very great points.

509
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:51,149
Axel, what role does the industry play

510
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:56,150
in developing solutions to
these cybersecurity challenges?

511
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,810
- As I said initially,

512
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:03,210
the goal of these NCCoE projects is really

513
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:08,260
to demonstrate a practical
and implementable solution

514
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:10,970
to securing a given infrastructure.

515
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:13,760
In this case Remote Patient Monitoring.

516
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,810
And the industry representatives

517
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:18,629
and you see the logos here on the slide,

518
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:22,050
they provided the the
hardware and software

519
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:23,879
as well as the expertise needed

520
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:27,810
to build these model implementations.

521
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:31,840
And then includes the clinical technology

522
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,560
and the infrastructure technology,

523
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,649
but also the security solutions

524
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:37,963
that were applied in these use cases.

525
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,793
- Steve.

526
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:47,060
- So industry must be cognizant
of the exponential growth

527
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:51,929
of RPM, and modify its
cybersecurity review practices,

528
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:55,560
pre and post-market, much
like the FDA has begun to do,

529
00:29:55,560 --> 00:30:00,550
following the full IGE
audit in the fall of 2018.

530
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:05,550
Industry must recognize that
RFPs request for proposals

531
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:08,710
will require detailed security practices

532
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:10,810
as part of the bid proposal.

533
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:14,050
We must also recognize
that the use of FHIR,

534
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:18,210
Fast Healthcare
Interoperability Resources,

535
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:21,430
and our patients growing
reliance on mobile apps,

536
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:24,683
has made multifactor
authentication a necessity.

537
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:28,590
- Steve, so I'm gonna come back to you.

538
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:30,949
How can this project apply to

539
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:37,490
organizations that utilize
cloud-based services,

540
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:41,060
or need to secure access

541
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:46,973
assets across a wide geographic region?

542
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:52,670
- So the model implementation
included the cloud component

543
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:54,940
for data hosting and routing.

544
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:57,760
And in cloud relevant
security considerations

545
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,629
that were included in the project analysis

546
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:03,630
and implementation based upon that.

547
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:07,070
And so, HDOs need to
provide access to the cloud

548
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:12,070
where broadband is unavailable,
expensive or unreliable.

549
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:16,053
What is the most secure
and economical solution?

550
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:21,650
And in some cases, that
may be a MiFi device,

551
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:25,360
depending on how rural your patients are.

552
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,219
But again, that doesn't take away

553
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:30,940
from the structure that
we've created here and

554
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:36,820
we've accounted for, in the RPM solutions

555
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:37,852
that we've provided.

556
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:42,800
- Great.
Thank you.

557
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:47,033
Axel, can you please share your thoughts?

558
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:48,943
- Yeah, sure.

559
00:31:48,943 --> 00:31:50,180
Just to add to Steve's point, right?

560
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:54,810
In that sense, this project can
be used as a reference model

561
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:58,419
for providing and implementing security

562
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:00,630
in an age of the disappearing

563
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:03,620
traditional enterprise security perimeter.

564
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:07,590
Whether it's remote care
or any other scenario,

565
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:11,510
we need to realize that that
user's, devices and data

566
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:13,560
are moving out of the enterprise,

567
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:17,730
and we need to adopt a
new approach to security

568
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:21,580
so that we can assure continued protection

569
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:24,810
of the critical data that is now

570
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:29,139
out there in a much broader
ecosystem than it was before.

571
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:34,000
- Great, thank you both.

572
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,730
So we were planning to do,

573
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:39,453
to work on this project prior
to the COVID-19 pandemic.

574
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:43,610
However, the COVID-19 pandemic

575
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:46,110
has definitely accelerated our work.

576
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:49,600
Steve, how has the COVID-19 pandemic

577
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:54,490
altered the use of telehealth services

578
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:57,130
throughout 2020 and beyond?

579
00:32:57,130 --> 00:32:58,860
Well, we have a similar

580
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:04,840
telehealth security and
privacy concerns are more.

581
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,470
And we have a few minutes.

582
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:08,420
So if you all both, Steve,

583
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:11,610
if you can just talk for
one minute, that'd be great.

584
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:13,763
And then we'll move over towards Sue.

585
00:33:15,877 --> 00:33:16,710
- Sure.

586
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:19,890
So again, the pandemic
accelerated the need for RPM

587
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:23,240
and the process of RPM to
reduce patient exposure,

588
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,940
manage case loads, prehospital capacity,

589
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:29,800
and enable compliance with
lockdown recommendations.

590
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:33,210
So, patients prefer because of this,

591
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:35,440
patients have come accustomed to it.

592
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,890
They prefer to wait in the comfort,

593
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:38,700
privacy and security of their own home,

594
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:42,710
rather than an environment
with other people who are sick.

595
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:47,710
So again, we have to
emphasize and educate them,

596
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:51,310
as well as make sure that
we have the process in place

597
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:54,023
in our own organizations.

598
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,162
- Great, thank you.

599
00:33:58,162 --> 00:33:59,600
Axel.

600
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,613
- Yeah.

601
00:34:00,614 --> 00:34:02,490
Just maybe to add a few thoughts to that.

602
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:06,840
I mean, obviously we will
continue to see security

603
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:09,900
and privacy concerns increase, right?

604
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:13,670
Security because hackers are
getting more sophisticated,

605
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:16,480
privacy because more and
more regulations and laws

606
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,639
are being put into place
to protect citizens data.

607
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:23,549
And the

608
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:26,449
guidance was developed by an NCCoE

609
00:34:26,449 --> 00:34:28,819
for the Remote Patient Monitoring Case,

610
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:31,870
is a useful model I think,
to have organizations

611
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:36,870
to adopt and implement a forward
looking security strategy,

612
00:34:37,489 --> 00:34:41,049
not only for the RPM
program, but also beyond,

613
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:45,170
as we certainly are facing
an interesting future

614
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:48,420
between increasing cyber threats

615
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:51,953
and increasing need to move
care out of the hospital.

616
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:57,323
- Great, thank you.

617
00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:01,700
Before we get ready to conclude, Steve,

618
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:05,028
how can we best reach HPOs to share this

619
00:35:05,028 --> 00:35:09,462
Cybersecurity Guidance and
Reference Architecture?

620
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:13,950
- So create awareness
by sharing with peers

621
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:16,180
at conferences and in webinars.

622
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:19,370
It's rare that security
is not an agenda item

623
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:23,310
or a hallway discussion or
both at a cybersecurity event.

624
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:25,020
Don't be afraid to speak up,

625
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:28,610
and don't be afraid to share
if someone reaches out to you.

626
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:32,390
Remember, we're all in this
together and we need each other.

627
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:34,272
And this was the first step.

628
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,910
- Thank you.

629
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:37,743
Axel.

630
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:39,663
- Yeah.

631
00:35:39,663 --> 00:35:40,570
Maybe a closing comment here.

632
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:42,550
Looking back, this has been a great

633
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:46,070
and very beneficial project
for us to participate in,

634
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:49,893
and I hope it also was useful
for the general audience,

635
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:54,280
listening to this presentation here,

636
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,220
but also then have the ability

637
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,372
to access the practice guides.

638
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:02,490
In hindsight, it was
certainly a timely project,

639
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:05,439
considering the changes
that COVID forced on us

640
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:09,320
and Telehealth and Remote
Care are here to stay.

641
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:12,930
They're not gonna go away once
we are through the pandemic.

642
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:16,069
And we need to make sure
that whatever we build

643
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:19,250
and whatever we deliver to our patients,

644
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:21,850
is gonna be safe and secure.

645
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:24,880
And is a model that can be

646
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:27,830
trusted by all participants,

647
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:29,252
especially the patients.

648
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:31,930
As I mentioned earlier,

649
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:35,399
cyber episodes are becoming more targeted.

650
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,370
They're becoming better in their craft.

651
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:42,370
And they're looking for more opportunity

652
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:46,130
to steal data, to ransom money,

653
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:48,870
to develop their tech strategies.

654
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:52,750
And looking at some of the
statistics that are out there,

655
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:54,870
we are not getting ahead of them, right?

656
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:58,279
We are still seeing breaches grow.

657
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,810
We see more and more attacks

658
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:03,100
and we need to double up all efforts

659
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:07,180
and reverse the tide, because
the longer we hesitate,

660
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:09,279
the more difficult it will be to catch up.

661
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:12,920
- Great.

662
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:16,614
Thank you to all the panelists today.

663
00:37:16,614 --> 00:37:21,614
I hope, well we hope,
that our panel discussion

664
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:23,960
provided

665
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,770
a great overview

666
00:37:28,775 --> 00:37:31,153
and insight for our correlative effort

667
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:34,569
in securing

668
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:37,500
RPM ecosystem.

669
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,880
We are happy to let you know

670
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:43,130
that we just released the second draft

671
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:46,170
of the NIST Cybersecurity Practice Guide,

672
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:50,580
special publication SP 18-30 in early May.

673
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:53,400
It is currently available
for public comment.

674
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,240
So what's next?

675
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:58,899
We would like to offer some action items

676
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,710
based on a timeframe as

677
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,490
adjusted by the RSA Conference.

678
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:10,450
So next week we ask that
you all download, review

679
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:13,609
and participate in our
public comment period

680
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:16,490
for the second draft
of the Practice Guide.

681
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:19,549
And the first three
months, we ask that you

682
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:23,490
refer to the Volume B of a guide

683
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:28,490
to conduct a risk assessment
in your own environment.

684
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:31,450
We'll do this in six months.

685
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:36,040
The next step is to adopt some
of the Reference Architecture

686
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:40,240
and security capabilities from the guide

687
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:45,240
to enhance your overall security posture.

688
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:48,695
Before we end this session,
we're happy to answer

689
00:38:48,695 --> 00:38:51,960
any questions that you might have,

690
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:55,110
and you can also follow up

691
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:56,960
with us (mumbles) with your feedback,

692
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,930
and here's our contact information.

693
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:02,700
Thank you very much for
attending our session,

694
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:05,620
and thank you to the panelists

695
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:08,042
for this very insightful conversation.
