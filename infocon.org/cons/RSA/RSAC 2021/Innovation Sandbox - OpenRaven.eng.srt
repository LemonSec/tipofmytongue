00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,820
- [Announcer] Please welcome Co-Founder

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,820
and Chief Executive Officer
of Open Raven, Dave Cole.

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,780
- As companies migrated
their cloud last decade,

5
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:23,620
security was far too
frequently left behind.

6
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:27,360
Once again, we're at an
inflection point as data floods

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,770
into the public cloud
and into a new generation

8
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:34,500
of data services and the
problems are all too familiar.

9
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,320
We find ourselves in a
position too frequently

10
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,520
where we can't answer
basic questions about data

11
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,710
such as where it is,
what type of data we have

12
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,460
and how it's protected
with the inevitable result

13
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,140
ultimately being data breaches

14
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,520
and increasingly regulatory penalties.

15
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,740
The singular focus of Open Raven

16
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:52,240
is to restore the visibility and control

17
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,150
of security teams need in
order to keep data safe

18
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:57,202
at modern speed and scale.

19
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,960
At Open Raven, we focus
on the massive amount

20
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,260
of passive data at rest as opposed

21
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,630
to the small amount of data
comparatively that's in motion.

22
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:10,750
And we begin by auto
locating all data services

23
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:12,850
using both serverless
technology and machine learning

24
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:16,570
in order to pinpoint data stores
that are commonly forgotten

25
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:21,529
on generic compute with an
inventory and classified data

26
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:22,950
as well as infrastructure controls

27
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,230
so that data exposure
can be readily identified

28
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:27,260
in order to prevent incidents.

29
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:30,130
We make it easy in order
to spot regulatory data

30
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:32,649
that's simply out of place expanding scope

31
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:34,940
and increasing business risk.

32
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:38,110
Sensitive data such as
source code that could flow

33
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:41,033
across international borders
can be spotted visually.

34
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:45,530
And lastly partner data sharing
agreements can be written

35
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:48,793
as policy and code and
automatically enforced.

36
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:51,320
Our focus on passive data

37
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,880
and serverless design
eliminate the visibility gaps

38
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,940
at far too frequently result in breaches.

39
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:01,210
We locate, discover, classify inventory

40
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:04,500
and ultimately protect data
using function as a service

41
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,180
which brings analysis
straight to the data itself.

42
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:10,590
This keeps it both the
data itself private as well

43
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,513
as it makes Open Raven
cost-effective at petabyte scale.

44
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:17,970
In contrast to legacy,
security and privacy solutions

45
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,150
Open Raven is up and running in minutes

46
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:22,310
using the familiar model
of connecting accounts

47
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:25,243
versus the point of proxy,
sidecar or an agent.

48
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,590
Further, we built our
platform on open models

49
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:31,650
so that others could
create new data sources

50
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:35,220
new data class, classification
rules, and new policy rules

51
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,793
all in a familiar language.

52
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:41,019
The open in Open Raven is
also about transparency

53
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:44,030
at the heart of our go-to-market
is clear technical content

54
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,440
and community outreach.

55
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,150
Since we launched a few short months ago

56
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:50,350
we've been translating this
trust into business traction.

57
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:51,560
As we count among our customers

58
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:55,060
a top three auto manufacturer,
a top 10 gaming company,

59
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:58,413
a major FinTech company, and
a leader in software testing.

60
00:02:59,853 --> 00:03:01,720
The impact of our team has been felt

61
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,200
across the industry for
decades, whether it's founding

62
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,530
the Open Web Application Security Project

63
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:08,940
or creating iconic
products from Foundstone

64
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,222
to CrowdStrike Falcon.

65
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,280
As data floods into the cloud

66
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,990
we refuse to be left behind once again.

67
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:20,385
