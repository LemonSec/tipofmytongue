1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:02,690
- Welcome to our presentation,

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:04,760
Three's Company: unpacking and settling

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:06,620
in with three NIST frameworks.

4
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:08,380
Before we begin, we wanna take a moment

5
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:09,690
to introduce ourselves.

6
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:10,809
I'm Christina Sames.

7
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:13,050
I'm a lead cyber security engineer

8
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:16,110
at MITRE working
cybersecurity risk management.

9
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:17,663
Dave.

10
00:00:17,663 --> 00:00:18,980
- And I'm Dave Weitzel,

11
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:22,920
I'm a principal cyber
security engineer at MITRE,

12
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,790
I've been doing cyber for a long time.

13
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:27,990
Actually started as telecom became cyber

14
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:29,049
through the decades.

15
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:30,450
I'm a techie with a law degree,

16
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:33,433
so often live at the
law of technology Nexus.

17
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,030
- Hi, I'm Julie Snyder.

18
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:41,060
I'm a principal privacy and
cybersecurity engineer at MITRE

19
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:42,760
and I'm the privacy lead for our center

20
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,419
that supports the National Institute

21
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,730
of Standards and Technology or NIST.

22
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:49,510
And I've spent the last 22
years working in various areas

23
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:51,589
of privacy and cybersecurity
risk management

24
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:53,910
for US federal agencies
and critical infrastructure

25
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:56,610
industries and in recent years
have also been supporting

26
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:58,620
other nations in building
their cybersecurity

27
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,242
and privacy capabilities.

28
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,220
So today, during our brief time together,

29
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:05,740
we'll quickly introduce you to MITRE,

30
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:08,289
then dive into the topic at
hand regarding Three NIST,

31
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:10,000
cyber cybersecurity
and privacy frameworks,

32
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,090
and ways you can use them together.

33
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,110
We'll spend time up front
providing an overview

34
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:15,950
of each framework before
drilling down a layer

35
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,380
into some of the core
concepts in each of them.

36
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:20,530
And then finally, we will
walk through an example

37
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:22,170
of how to bring those
core concepts together

38
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:23,890
in your organization.

39
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:25,980
So just briefly, a quick
note about the organization

40
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,820
your three speakers to hear from today.

41
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,759
MITRE is a not-for-profit organization

42
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,610
that operates federally funded research

43
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:33,440
and development centers
in the public interest

44
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,610
to tackle challenges to
the safety, stability

45
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:37,173
and wellbeing of our nation.

46
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,710
And as a brief frame
for our discussion today

47
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:43,300
the three frameworks we're discussing vary

48
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,380
in terms of how long
each has been available.

49
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:46,679
They can each function alone,

50
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,460
but you can get more benefits
out of using them together.

51
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,360
We'll show an example of
what using them together

52
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,960
can look like in the last
section of our discussion.

53
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:00,397
Let's start with a quick
overview of the three framework.

54
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,940
The cybersecurity framework
was originally developed

55
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:06,740
to help critical infrastructure
organizations establish

56
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:09,210
or improve their cybersecurity program.

57
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:11,280
However, the cybersecurity
framework is broad enough

58
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,770
that it has been official
for any type of organization

59
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,990
not just critical infrastructure.

60
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:17,410
It was developed through a year long

61
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:19,140
public collaborative process.

62
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,500
version 1.0 was released
in 2014 and version 1.1

63
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,720
the current version was released in 2018.

64
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,130
The cybersecurity framework includes

65
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:29,579
a high level privacy
methodology, but privacy is now

66
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,393
more robustly covered in the
new nest privacy framework.

67
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,250
The privacy framework
builds on the success

68
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,960
of the cybersecurity framework in terms

69
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,790
of a public collaborative
process to develop it

70
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:41,720
and the structure of the framework.

71
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,620
Similar to the cybersecurity framework,

72
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,460
the privacy framework focuses on programs.

73
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:48,210
It also, in addition to that though,

74
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:51,180
focuses on how to apply privacy,

75
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,100
to products systems and services.

76
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,670
And the first version
of the privacy framework

77
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:57,780
was released last year in 2020.

78
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,530
And then finally the
risk management framework

79
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:02,040
or RMF, was established
to help federal agencies

80
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,890
address cybersecurity risk.

81
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:07,420
It's also widely used by
private sector organization.

82
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:10,130
So RMF includes discussion
regarding enterprise risk

83
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:12,720
though it is often applied
at the system level.

84
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,980
It was updated in 2018 to integrate

85
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,260
the cybersecurity framework
and privacy concepts.

86
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:20,036
This was before the privacy
framework was available.

87
00:03:20,036 --> 00:03:21,570
And the use of these
frameworks as voluntary

88
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:22,720
for the private sector.

89
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,300
A little more about the content

90
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,610
in the cybersecurity
and privacy framework.

91
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,470
They follow the same structure.

92
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,970
They each have a core that
provides a three layer menu

93
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:36,960
if you will, of cybersecurity
or privacy activities

94
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,673
and outcomes that organizations
may want to achieve.

95
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,260
The profiles concept
describes ways organizations

96
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,340
can use the core to
determine the current state

97
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,410
of their program and
in the case of privacy,

98
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:50,290
also the state of their
product systems and services,

99
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:53,400
as well as their target
or desired future state.

100
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,910
Organizations and industries
use framework profiles

101
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:58,460
to customize their use of the
core by aligning their mission

102
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,560
and business objectives and values

103
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,700
with the cybersecurity
and privacy activities

104
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,399
and outcomes that support
those objectives and values.

105
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,620
Implementation tiers, help organizations

106
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,470
review their programmatic capabilities

107
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,910
to determine whether they have
the right resources in place

108
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,553
to achieve their desired state.

109
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,040
And informative references
are optional resources

110
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,300
that can help an organization

111
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,720
either implement new
activities and outcomes

112
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,620
or crosswalk their current practices

113
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:26,320
to demonstrate how they
relate these to the framework.

114
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:32,250
Looking at the layers of
the core and each framework,

115
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,500
the top layer is called functions.

116
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,070
Both frameworks happen
to have five functions.

117
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:39,450
The cybersecurity has identify, protect,

118
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:41,393
detect, respond and recover.

119
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,230
The privacy framework also has functions

120
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:46,360
for identify and protect.

121
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,820
In addition to those, it has
three different functions

122
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:51,000
for govern control and communicate.

123
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,640
And then the privacy framework points back

124
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,990
to the cybersecurity framework

125
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:57,170
for activities under
detect, respond and recover.

126
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:59,100
These terms at the
function level are intended

127
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:02,050
to be broad enough that any
risk management professional

128
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:02,883
can understand them.

129
00:05:02,883 --> 00:05:04,490
They don't have to be a cybersecurity

130
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:08,740
or a privacy expert for
you to have conversations

131
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:11,720
about privacy and security
using these functions.

132
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,510
This can be very helpful
when you're trying to speak

133
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:15,700
to others outside of your organization

134
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,000
or your immediate cybersecurity

135
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,360
and privacy program when it comes

136
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,853
to leadership and the board.

137
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:25,070
Functions are divided
into multiple categories

138
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:27,110
which are groups of similar outcomes.

139
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,920
So if you look in the
diagram across the screen

140
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,810
you can see how the core breaks
down with these functions

141
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,940
into categories and then each category

142
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,450
has one or more subcategories

143
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:38,150
which are specific outcomes
based activity statements.

144
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:39,710
And both frameworks have about 100

145
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:41,203
of these subcategories.

146
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,320
Each subcategory points to witness called

147
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,200
informative references that can be used

148
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,700
to facilitate implementation.

149
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,300
Then informative references are based

150
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,090
on common or widely used standards

151
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:53,530
and we'll see some examples of that

152
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:57,330
at the bottom of the slide and
the cybersecurity framework,

153
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:00,240
the informative references
are included in the document.

154
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,720
This is in the process of
moving to an online model

155
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,910
for informative references.

156
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:05,960
So the privacy framework
informative references

157
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,690
are available online.

158
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:09,060
And then this is in the process

159
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:12,460
of a new online informative
references structure

160
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:15,690
for managing the relationships
and taking a deeper look

161
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:17,690
at how the standards relate to each other,

162
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:20,980
as well as other authoritative resources,

163
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,860
including these frameworks.

164
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,270
And then I do also wanna point out

165
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:26,810
in the cybersecurity framework,
you see common standards

166
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:29,760
like ISO, COBIT, COSO and others.

167
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,289
In the privacy realm,
there aren't as robust

168
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:35,970
sets of standards yet, and
so in the privacy framework

169
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,670
you'll see primarily NIST standards

170
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:39,520
and then you'll actually
see a few subcategories

171
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,719
where there aren't yet
standards identified.

172
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:44,650
So Christina, with that
quick introduction,

173
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:47,270
I'll turn it over to you for the RMF.

174
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,640
- Thanks Julie.

175
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,430
So as Julie briefly introduced earlier,

176
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:54,640
this is the RMF firmness SP 800-37

177
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,430
which provides a robust
risk management framework

178
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,960
for information systems and organizations

179
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,109
often applied at the system
level for handling risks.

180
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:05,960
RMF is a seven step
risk management process

181
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,520
with preparing the center and
then starting with categorize,

182
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:12,030
select, implement, access,
operate and monitor.

183
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:14,909
To manage information security
and privacy risk related

184
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:17,190
to operating systems
and describes key roles

185
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:19,510
and responsibilities that
are part of managing risk

186
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:21,490
within an organization.

187
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:24,520
All steps in the RMF have
purpose statements tasks

188
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,710
and outcomes for each task.

189
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:30,549
In the latest 2018 revision
NIST updated 800-37

190
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,440
to integrate concepts such
as supply chain, privacy,

191
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,000
and as Julie mentioned the
cybersecurity framework.

192
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,390
These may be reflected through RMF tasks

193
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:42,180
document references,
artifacts, or responsibilities.

194
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,600
The new prepare step, the
gray box in the center

195
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,120
brings in a central activities

196
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,080
to help ensure organizations
are ready to manage security

197
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:53,130
and privacy risks when using
the main six steps of the RMF.

198
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:55,830
Prepare helps an organization be prepared

199
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:57,490
to implement the RMF consisting

200
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:58,950
with mission business objectives

201
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:01,950
and risk management strategies
from senior leadership.

202
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,099
And this is just one of the ways

203
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,660
that RMF now connects to the CSF.

204
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:08,610
Organizations may already be
doing some prepare activities

205
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:12,610
by adding it to 837 and
2018 formalized tasks

206
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:14,750
that may have been vague previously.

207
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,300
This graphic also provides
a suite of new standards

208
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,470
and guidelines in the blue and gray rings

209
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:21,900
outside of the RMF
steps that are available

210
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:25,070
to help support implementation of the RMF.

211
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,760
As I mentioned, each step in the RMF

212
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,030
has a purpose (indistinct).

213
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:30,409
And this slide lists each of the RMF steps

214
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:33,929
and captures the general
purpose statement of each step.

215
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:36,489
It's important to note that
although presented sequentially,

216
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:40,320
starting with prepare at the
top and moving down to monitor,

217
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,240
there is some flexibility and movement

218
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,840
after the prepare step
between the main six steps

219
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,180
of the RMF.

220
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,829
From categorize to monitor
the steps can be conducted

221
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:51,720
in non sequential order
as long as organizations

222
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,200
can still meet applicable
requirements and manage risk.

223
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,190
Steps may be carried out
in a non sequential order

224
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:01,570
so that organizations can
revisit a step as needed.

225
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:05,050
For example, moving from
implement back to select,

226
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:07,250
rather than going from
implement to assess,

227
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,750
to ensure that the appropriate controls

228
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:12,510
for safeguarding a system in
managing risk are selected.

229
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,310
At this point, I'll turn it over to Dave.

230
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:16,026
- Great. Thank you Christina.

231
00:09:16,027 --> 00:09:19,080
But we're now gonna talk
about framework profiles.

232
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,650
You heard from Julie about framework core

233
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:26,800
and now the profile is
an adaptation of the core

234
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,120
for an enterprise or a
group of enterprises,

235
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,150
sometimes supply chain partners.

236
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:36,020
So, what is the framework profile?

237
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:38,770
You have the core, so that's on the left.

238
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:43,130
We discussed that there's
the privacy framework core

239
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:47,970
and then for profiles,
you want to do an analysis

240
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:52,080
of your current use of
identify, govern, protect

241
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,750
and so on down through the
category and subcategory level,

242
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:59,230
and that will develop an as is profile.

243
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:01,670
But what most importantly you want to do

244
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,689
is to create a target profile.

245
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:06,330
So get the appropriate
stakeholders together

246
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:11,330
and then walk through and
identify govern, control,

247
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:14,170
communicate and protect
for the privacy framework

248
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:17,150
and identify, protect,
detect, respond and recover

249
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:19,180
for the cybersecurity framework

250
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,880
and work from those five functions

251
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,760
down through the categories,
to the subcategories

252
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,460
but align to the organization's goals,

253
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:30,000
how it manages its data processing,

254
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,270
legal and regulatory requirements,

255
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:35,319
risk management, priorities
and privacy needs.

256
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,010
But most importantly, we're
going to be tying this

257
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:41,083
to the business functions
of the organization.

258
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:46,780
So we're going to talk
about mission objectives.

259
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,910
And the purpose of a mission objective

260
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:52,230
is to start to tie that business logic

261
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:55,180
to the cybersecurity framework
and privacy framework.

262
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:58,109
So a mission objective is
the purpose of an operation

263
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:01,960
of an industry or
subsector or organization

264
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,530
to the processes and systems that support.

265
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:07,630
So think of it as what business we are in.

266
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:09,770
If you're used to enterprise architecture

267
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:12,720
it's the kind of stuff over
business reference model.

268
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,880
And then you have to
prioritize those missions.

269
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,580
What is the most important thing

270
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:20,960
that your enterprise does
have to relist those missions

271
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,120
and to prioritize them.

272
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,183
And then sometimes
missions have dependencies.

273
00:11:28,499 --> 00:11:32,100
So I certainly need to do
the HR mission objective

274
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,420
if you have one to fulfill
making sure enough people

275
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:40,420
are supporting the
manufacturing mission objective

276
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,630
or the transportation mission objective

277
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:44,040
of your products and so on.

278
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,401
So there's a lot of dependencies.

279
00:11:46,402 --> 00:11:50,863
So a number of the missions
have that cross dependency.

280
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:56,370
Now we're gonna an example
of a profile rebuilt

281
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:58,150
along with United States Coast Guard

282
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:01,780
in the oil and natural gas
sector several years ago.

283
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:04,550
What we have here is something
we call a Daisy Chart

284
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:08,780
because when we're identifying
these mission objectives,

285
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:11,260
we've determined through our work

286
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:14,350
it's best to have them
in a non-linear manner.

287
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:17,420
So when we're actually running a workshop

288
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:19,530
we draw a circle and we say,
what business are you in?

289
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:23,880
We have these conversations and
same with enterprise owners.

290
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:27,640
So here we have some of the
kind of mission objectives

291
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,420
that it becomes pretty apparent

292
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:32,990
that these are top level
things that a business does,

293
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:34,990
maintaining environmental safety

294
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:38,390
and obtaining timely vessel clearance

295
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:41,040
if you're gonna go in
and offload that oil,

296
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,949
bulk liquid transfer is the transfer

297
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:48,950
of typically dangerous
hydrocarbon to shore-side facility

298
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:51,910
making sure you have the HR requirements

299
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:55,459
a lot of rules and regulations
under the Coast Guard

300
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,480
on who's doing what and what roles

301
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,180
and what training they have

302
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:02,900
making sure that you don't
do mischief with the product

303
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,780
and maintain that quality of the product

304
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,740
as it moves from ship to shore.

305
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,750
Preparedness, making
sure that you're ready

306
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:12,140
for any kind of environmental
or other concern.

307
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:15,250
Operational security,
you want to make sure

308
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:19,140
nobody's doing mischief to
these processes as they move.

309
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:22,130
There's almost always a regulatory aspect

310
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:26,150
to many businesses, so audits,
inspections, regulatory side

311
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:29,310
and then be continually
determined when we've worked

312
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:34,130
with operational technologies,
maintaining personnel safety.

313
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:38,023
Making sure that people
aren't injured or die

314
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,770
is part of the business function.

315
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:44,860
So all of those safety
controls are critical

316
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:48,400
business objectives here
that were identified

317
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,579
and the Bulk Liquid Transfer profile.

318
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,590
And what can we do next?

319
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:56,270
But here you see that Daisy
again for Bulk Liquid Transfer,

320
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:58,433
we then map against the CSF.

321
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:02,020
Excuse me, the cybersecurity
framework as Julie described

322
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,840
through the functions and the categories

323
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,000
and the subcategories, ultimately

324
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,470
that creates something there on the right

325
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:10,180
that we call a dot chart.

326
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:14,010
If you go through the 108 subcategories

327
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:16,939
of cybersecurity framework, version 1.1,

328
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,850
that'll run about 10 pages.

329
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:22,560
If you can fit all of your
mission objectives on one page.

330
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,010
So you see there top left
the eight mission objectives

331
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:28,290
around the Daisy you see on the right

332
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:30,110
if you have the eight columns.

333
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:32,500
So each one of those columns is one

334
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,890
of the mission objectives.

335
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:37,870
So go through that with
a little more specificity

336
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:39,620
on the next slide.

337
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,603
So here's the dot chart again.

338
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:47,330
What you see is scoring
against these dots,

339
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:49,660
where three dots is the high priority,

340
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:52,010
two dots is a moderate priority,

341
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:54,640
one dot is other
implemented subcategories.

342
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,000
And we have an X cause sometimes

343
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,960
in operational technologies,
there's certain subcategories

344
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,880
you need to be very careful of.

345
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:05,560
There's no Patch Tuesday
on an operational plant,

346
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,209
so you need to be very careful of

347
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:08,543
when you're doing port scans and stuff

348
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:11,970
because you don't want to
mess up pressure and heat

349
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:15,320
and temperature and sensor,
fire suppression systems.

350
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,950
You wanna make sure that they're okay.

351
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:20,120
So some subcategories you
have to be very careful with.

352
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,650
We see here in the top left

353
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:23,870
of the dot chart mission objective one

354
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:27,460
in this case for the
risk management strategy

355
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,900
IDRM one has three dots for mission one.

356
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:34,209
So that's a strong candidate
for doing that early.

357
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:36,380
We see about four rows down,

358
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:38,200
we have a couple of two dots,

359
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,970
but their mission
objectives three and eight.

360
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:42,940
So probably not the highest priority

361
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:46,450
if you haven't already
taken care of the priority,

362
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:49,990
three for mission
objectives one and so on.

363
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,920
Over time, of course you need to move

364
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,610
through all of these from
high, moderate priority

365
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:57,780
to other implemented systems.

366
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,280
Ultimately, you don't have a choice

367
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:02,720
of whether you're gonna
implement 108 subcategories.

368
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,110
It's a question of timing and resourcing

369
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:07,090
and what you do next and the creation

370
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:09,910
of this profile helps
you along those lines.

371
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:12,949
If you've already had or we beholden

372
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,610
to the three dot, two dot, one dot,

373
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:17,380
if you have a regime that
you might already use

374
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:22,370
for prioritization, and your
enterprise feel perfectly good

375
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:25,640
to use that instead of
this three dot, two dot,

376
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,563
one dot regime.

377
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:31,090
Now, how do you use a profile?

378
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,810
So we've created the profile,

379
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:36,550
so we have this customization
of core for an organization

380
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:40,770
a sector or subsector, we fuse
the mission business logic

381
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:46,610
as we say, the boardroom
can talk to the server room,

382
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:49,450
we have an alignment of
cybersecurity requirements

383
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:51,650
with the operational methodologies.

384
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:55,140
What cyber protections
do you have in place?

385
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,033
People process in technology?

386
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:02,400
And how is that tied to
those alternate subcategories

387
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:06,349
of the CSF and then aligned
to those mission objectives

388
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:09,119
and the basis for assessment of a current

389
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,379
and a target state and
a decision support tool

390
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:15,640
for you to use in those
governance processes.

391
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,540
Now for framework profile development,

392
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:20,990
I'm not gonna get into
the details of this slide,

393
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:23,609
but if you see that cloud organization

394
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:26,750
or community focus creation
of a target profile

395
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,550
that's what we're focusing on here,

396
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:30,720
the development of
those mission objectives

397
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,510
against that target profile.

398
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,950
How do you do that?

399
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:36,310
We have six steps here
again, they're iterative

400
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:39,280
so get back to the beginning of this

401
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,860
as you do it on a regular schedule

402
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:47,350
as you evaluate that and use that against

403
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:50,312
your governance of your
cybersecurity investment.

404
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:55,750
So then one last thing on
profile development approach

405
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:59,170
I want to focus you to
the bottom two boxes here.

406
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:00,690
So creating the profile's right

407
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:02,740
but we don't want it to be shell square,

408
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:07,400
we want it to use it in our
governance of our IT systems

409
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,620
and IT security and we
wanna be able to use it

410
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,699
for cyber investment planning

411
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,200
and allocation of resources and budgets.

412
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,190
'Cause with these priorities,
if I have a funding situation

413
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:22,010
where I don't have this year's
budget, the way I expect it

414
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:25,260
I can move things to the
right, or if I have a windfall

415
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:28,070
and more budget available
to me, we can move stuff

416
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:31,879
and make the spend in
this year versus next year

417
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:35,640
and this profile gives you
the opportunity to do that.

418
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:39,210
And with that, I'm gonna turn it over.

419
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:40,043
- Thanks, Dave.

420
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:44,470
As a reminder, what I'll be
doing now is I'll just walk

421
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:47,940
through some assembling and
security and privacy controls.

422
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:51,100
Now, as a reminder at
this graphic shows the RMF

423
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,296
the steps involved in the RMF

424
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,590
and some of those guiding documents,

425
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:56,939
standards or publications that can help

426
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,210
with the implementation of the RMF.

427
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:02,340
From categories through monitor
controls can have a role

428
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:05,260
in the RMF and see where
it's at select controls,

429
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:08,090
implement controls and they will be part

430
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:09,830
of the example that
Julie will cover later.

431
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:12,850
So we'll spend the next few
slides covering controls

432
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:15,969
and how they can be used
when implementing the RMF.

433
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:17,810
So what are controls?

434
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:19,580
Controls are descriptions of safeguards

435
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:22,669
an organization puts into place
to help protect the system

436
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:24,760
and the information on that system

437
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,360
and achieve security
and privacy objectives.

438
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,449
And they're selected and implemented

439
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:31,550
to satisfy system requirements.

440
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:32,990
And this example shows a control

441
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:35,000
from the audit or a U family.

442
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,850
Specifically a U dash for
audit storage capacity.

443
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:40,830
The U family is one of
20 families that are

444
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:43,590
in NIST SP 800-53

445
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:45,530
and each family contains controls related

446
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:48,410
to a specific topic such
as awareness and training,

447
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:52,000
incident response, PII
processing and transparency

448
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,620
or supply chain risk management.

449
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,652
Or in this examples case audit.

450
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:59,070
This slide shows a control structure

451
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:01,139
which all controls and
control enhancements

452
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:05,400
in an SP 800-37 follow the structure.

453
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,120
This includes a control identifier.

454
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,580
So again, that AU-4 that
represents what family

455
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:13,189
the control is a part of,
the name of the control,

456
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:16,920
audit storage capacity and
a discussion of the control.

457
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,970
A control may have
organizationally defined parameters

458
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:23,170
in the base control or
control enhancement language.

459
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:25,050
And these are bracketed statements

460
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:27,570
in that language that offer an opportunity

461
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:30,830
for an organization to
document specific content

462
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:34,699
or details that may need to
be identified as it relates

463
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:38,350
to the control and help with
that controls implementation.

464
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:40,360
So now that we understand
what controls are,

465
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,750
what our baselines?

466
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:44,210
So baselines are general sets of controls.

467
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:47,280
On the security control
baselines are based off

468
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,430
of a set of assumptions,
such as systems exist

469
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:53,340
in network environments and
our general purpose and nature

470
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:56,470
and organizations have the
necessary structure, resources

471
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:59,100
and infrastructure to
implement the controls.

472
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,760
In this baseline example,
you can see those controls

473
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,760
from the awareness and training family

474
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,480
that are in the NIST security
and privacy control baselines.

475
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,480
In addition to security control baselines

476
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:13,650
and NIST SP 800-53B,
there's also a privacy

477
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:15,080
control baseline.

478
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:18,179
The new privacy control
baseline helps an organization

479
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:21,540
determine from a privacy
programmatic perspective

480
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:24,530
what security and privacy
controls may be important

481
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:28,240
to implement to manage
privacy requirements and risks

482
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,120
and again from a programmatic perspective.

483
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,070
To know which baseline to start with,

484
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:36,129
activities from the category
step must be completed

485
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:38,180
for determining the
impact if there is a loss

486
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:40,990
of confidentiality,
integrity or availability,

487
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:44,780
which are security objectives
as it relates to a system.

488
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,840
This loss is expressed as having low,

489
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,899
moderate or high impact.

490
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,290
And then NIST impact
levels are represented

491
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:53,710
by NIST as security control baselines

492
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:56,390
and help serve as a
starting point for systems.

493
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:59,460
Note that not all controls
are applied to the baselines.

494
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,760
So once the security
control baseline is selected

495
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,740
tailoring can then occur
as part of the select step.

496
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:09,580
Specifically, the task
control tailoring in select.

497
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:12,480
Tailoring activities include
adding or removing controls

498
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,490
from a baseline based on
factors such as threats,

499
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:17,740
type of system, what's needed to protect

500
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,790
and manage risks to that system,

501
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:21,810
addressing security requirements

502
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:24,659
and supporting mission and business needs.

503
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:27,210
All tailoring decisions,
whether focused on security

504
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:30,060
or privacy considerations
or based on issues

505
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:33,370
such as cost and schedule
should be documented.

506
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:35,570
And one form of tailoring
includes overlays

507
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:37,320
which I'll cover on the next slide.

508
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:42,670
So overlays are a set of controls
for specific applications

509
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:46,840
or use cases and serve as
a type of bulk tailoring.

510
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,490
They can be used with or without baselines

511
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:52,810
and are targeted for a very
specific set of conditions,

512
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:54,850
environment, type of technology

513
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:57,870
or information such as
classified information,

514
00:22:57,870 --> 00:23:00,899
privacy or industrial control systems.

515
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,440
Overlays are typically the result

516
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:06,240
of subject matter expertise
or community consensus.

517
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,750
Because baselines are developed
for specific situations,

518
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:12,400
they can provide more
control specifications

519
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,770
than baselines can.

520
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:16,270
Such as supplemental guidance
for implementing controls,

521
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:19,060
perimeter values or regulatory references

522
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:21,179
that a control helps address.

523
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:23,830
On this slide, the type
of guidance and content

524
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:25,970
that an overlay typically includes

525
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:28,630
is on the left, in the light green box.

526
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:30,980
On the right of the slide
is part of table three

527
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:33,200
from the privacy overlays and show some

528
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,433
of the security controls that
privacy overlays include.

529
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,729
Overlays may still require some tailoring,

530
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:42,850
just like baselines to ensure
it's implemented accurately

531
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:47,030
within a system and reflects
any security or privacy needs.

532
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:49,770
So now that we've spent a
bit of time with the RMF

533
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:53,400
and understanding controls and
how they relate to the RMF,

534
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,510
it's important to also
understand how the framers

535
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:58,490
can help implement the RMF.

536
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:02,160
The RMF benefits from
linkages to the cybersecurity

537
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:05,480
and privacy frameworks, because
these frameworks do offer

538
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,250
a more strategic view
of risks an organization

539
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:10,640
may have to consider while using the RMF

540
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,760
to manage risks to system.

541
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,820
The frameworks are great

542
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,919
for creating communication opportunities

543
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:19,240
within an organization between
as Dave mentioned earlier

544
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,350
the boardroom and the server room

545
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:23,899
because the frameworks
are based on language

546
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,090
that doesn't require someone
to be a cybersecurity

547
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:28,230
or privacy expert and this is critical

548
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:30,500
to connect people in
roles at different levels

549
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,590
in an organization and
share risk information

550
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:36,300
and support risk-based decision making.

551
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,889
Profiles are helpful because
they can help inform risk

552
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:42,210
and resource decisions and
RMF steps such as prepare,

553
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:45,160
categorize and select
and ensure RMF decisions

554
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,340
align with risk management strategies

555
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,530
from the organizational level.

556
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:52,610
Having the strategic organizational
risk management insights

557
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:55,620
that the frameworks provide
can help make implementation

558
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,929
of the RMF at the system
level more successful

559
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:00,770
and inclusive of mission
and business parodies

560
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:04,120
through identifying and
deconflicting requirements

561
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,159
so that the RMF doesn't become a checklist

562
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,220
or compliance exercise.

563
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,980
Moving to slide 27, we
can see more specifically

564
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,940
how profiles may influence each RMF step

565
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:16,050
and activities within those steps.

566
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:18,129
This table shows how each RMF step

567
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:20,930
from prepare to the main
six steps of the RMF

568
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:23,610
then categorize select implement, assess,

569
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:27,320
authorize and monitor
is impacted by profiles

570
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,260
and captures the link between information

571
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:31,840
from a profile related to
risk management priorities

572
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,340
and helping with making an
informed risk management

573
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:36,780
decisions throughout the RMF.

574
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,790
Profiles help when
thinking about questions

575
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:41,860
such as where to focus
and prioritize resources,

576
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:44,659
how robust assess and
monitor activities should be

577
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:46,820
and identify if there
are controls to tailor

578
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:50,129
during select to support
mission and business needs.

579
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:53,610
Profiles may help inform
authorization decisions as well

580
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:55,479
providing an AO with information

581
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,900
about organizational risk tolerance

582
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,420
and how a system may be important

583
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:02,220
to a specific mission
or business objective.

584
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:04,700
Without communication to
understand senior leadership

585
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:07,390
priorities or decisions,
or without risk management

586
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:09,150
at the organizational level,

587
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:11,880
risk management at the system
level can be challenging

588
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,940
and can create gaps in
information that could be critical

589
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:18,150
to other a system should be
authorized to operate or not.

590
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:21,420
RMF in revision to now
includes references for tasks

591
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,940
under each of its steps to
parts of the cybersecurity

592
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:26,010
framework, such as profiles.

593
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:28,250
This is an example of an update to the RMF

594
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:29,950
that further emphasizes the link

595
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:31,860
between system level activities

596
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:34,949
with organization level of
risk management activities

597
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:38,930
and decisions and highlights
where the RMF and the CSF link.

598
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,160
I'll turn it back over to Julie now.

599
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,050
- Thank you, Christina.

600
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:45,419
So let's look at, we can bring
all of these things together.

601
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:47,590
Imagine if you will, that
we're in an organization

602
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:49,949
that has a mobility and logistics program.

603
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:52,110
And as part of that program
we have a new system

604
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:56,020
we're designing for a
dynamic flight routing.

605
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:58,430
So we'll be moving
equipment and also people

606
00:26:58,430 --> 00:26:59,650
with this system.

607
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:01,170
And the system is gonna use things like,

608
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:03,510
international navigation
libraries, real track

609
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:07,300
and real-time air traffic
data, current weather forecast

610
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:09,010
and crew and passenger information.

611
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:11,610
And the whole purpose of this
system is to optimize fuel

612
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:13,882
and time in generating flight plans.

613
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:17,260
So if you're the system owner,

614
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,790
or the system security manager,

615
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:20,490
you're going to follow the RMF steps

616
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:22,220
that Christina has walked us through,

617
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,700
and you're gonna land with a baseline

618
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,250
that looks something like this.

619
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,000
In case you don't have
time to count all of that,

620
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,520
that's 450 controls that
you are now responsible

621
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,980
for figuring out how to implement
for this brand new system.

622
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,500
And I know you can't read all of these,

623
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,480
that's actually part of
the point of this graphic

624
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,390
is to convey that sense of overwhelm

625
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:43,180
that a system and program
manager often feel

626
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:44,840
when they're determining "Oh my gosh,

627
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,330
how do I tackle all of this?"

628
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:48,909
Because every program
has limited resources

629
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:50,310
how do I do all these things?

630
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:52,590
How do I prioritize all of these things?

631
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:55,550
And how do I implement all this?

632
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:56,383
But lucky you.

633
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:59,490
Your organization has done
a cybersecurity framework

634
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:01,460
and privacy framework profile.

635
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:02,960
So you have some tools to help you

636
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,260
with that decision making.

637
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:08,470
So if we look at the next slide,

638
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:13,050
this is an example from one
of the Coast Guard profiles.

639
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:14,610
So we're gonna borrow for a moment

640
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:18,000
from their oil and natural gas,
offshore operations profile.

641
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,020
And in that profile,
there's a mission objective

642
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:23,370
called maintain continuity
and integrity of operations.

643
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:25,939
And this mission objective is
about preserving the ability

644
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:27,770
to operate at the intended level

645
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:29,570
within the desired timeframe.

646
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:31,590
So pretty important if
you're trying to plan routes

647
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:33,980
and use real time
information and get people

648
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:36,270
and things where they need to be on time,

649
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:38,160
seems like a pretty important objective.

650
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,190
In this case, it was the
number four objective

651
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:42,560
out of 12 in terms of priority.

652
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:45,620
So in the orange box, on
the screen, there's a slice

653
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:49,379
of the subcategory priorities
for this mission objectives.

654
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,830
So we're gonna pull that
thread a little further.

655
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:55,950
Let's look at the asset
management category

656
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:57,900
under the identify function.

657
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,580
In this case for this mission objective,

658
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:03,530
we identified four high
priority subcategories

659
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:06,580
and one moderate priority subcategory.

660
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,120
So let's drill down a little bit further

661
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:11,040
into what those subcategories look like.

662
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,210
When we look at these five subcategories,

663
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:16,700
we see that there are
11 different controls

664
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,580
associated with those subcategories.

665
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:20,199
So these are the controls that are going

666
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,810
to help us implement our priorities

667
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:25,830
that are articulated in this profile.

668
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:29,169
Of these 11 controls,
or of the 450 controls

669
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:32,240
from your baseline rather,
these 11 are going to be some

670
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,780
of the most critical to implement.

671
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:36,300
Because you know right
away, they're attached

672
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,780
to your number four mission objective

673
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:41,270
which is pretty important and
those (indistinct) out of 12.

674
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:42,530
So we know these are things

675
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:44,460
that we need to get priority for.

676
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:46,190
And so when you think
back to some of the things

677
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:49,060
Christina was talking about at
the end of the last section,

678
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,520
you know, these are the controls

679
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,610
that you may need to robustly monitor,

680
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:55,250
these are the controls that
you may need to robustly assess

681
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:56,560
before you implement.

682
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,010
And you can think through things like

683
00:29:58,010 --> 00:29:59,920
as I implement these controls,

684
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,550
can I rely on policy and
procedures to implement them

685
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,530
or are they important
enough that I really need

686
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:07,100
to invest in a tool to do that?

687
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:11,100
So of these 11, these
are the important ones.

688
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,949
And then another thing
that I wanna point out.

689
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:18,590
So we identified 11 controls
with these five subcategories,

690
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:21,699
but one of those controls is
in italics in the far right

691
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:24,610
under subcategory ID-AM 5.

692
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:26,830
And that control is SC-6.

693
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:28,699
That one's in italics because we realized

694
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:32,820
in looking at our baseline
SC-6 is not in our baseline.

695
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:35,149
So when thinking about
the tailoring process

696
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:36,770
and is the baseline right, or do we need

697
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:39,870
to make some adjustments to
accommodate our specific risks,

698
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:42,486
we're gonna look at
whether we need to add SC-6

699
00:30:42,487 --> 00:30:43,653
to our set of controls.

700
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:46,670
And then let's shift
gears for a moment here

701
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:49,030
and think about this from
a privacy perspective.

702
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:52,050
You can use the privacy framework
profile in the same way.

703
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:54,280
So in this system, we're
dealing with passenger

704
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,850
and crew data, so your
profile and the decisions

705
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:58,399
in your profile can help you reason

706
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,660
through things like levels
of identity assurance

707
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:03,130
that you need for certain system processes

708
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:06,420
or identifying where you may
be creating unintended records

709
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:08,630
of patterns and location tracking

710
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:10,540
and so your profile will
help you reason through those

711
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:14,580
and identify controls to
address those risks as well.

712
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,689
So if you'd like to go deeper into this,

713
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:18,610
this is a very quick example

714
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:20,949
where we are doing a lab later today,

715
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:25,050
lab 4-T14 called hands-on
three NIST cybersecurity

716
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,790
and privacy risk management frameworks.

717
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:29,430
And that's at 12:45 to be specific.

718
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:32,390
So back to our title of Three's Company.

719
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:35,220
So we've unpacked these frameworks a bit

720
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,700
and hopefully we've helped you see

721
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,920
that they are good roommates
and can be good roommates

722
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:42,040
in your organization and
helped you understand a bit

723
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:45,240
about how they can
successfully live together.

724
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,160
So one of the key takeaways
that we were hoping

725
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,030
that you got out of this discussion is

726
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:52,379
that risk management is not
just a system level activity.

727
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,720
It needs a connection
back to enterprise risk

728
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,990
and the priorities of your organization.

729
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:58,580
So this keeps you out of the situation

730
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:00,310
where you're doing cybersecurity thing,

731
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:02,540
just for cybersecurity
sake or privacy things,

732
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:04,360
just for privacy security sake,

733
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,050
you've got that clear link back

734
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:08,580
to how they connect to
your organization's needs

735
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:11,013
and purpose and mission and values.

736
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:13,290
And then we talked at the beginning

737
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:15,670
and then Dave mentioned
again a few moments ago

738
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:17,790
about conversations between the boardroom

739
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:20,149
and the server room, we really do hope

740
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:22,040
that we've helped you
see how these frameworks

741
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:25,470
can be used together to
facilitate those conversations

742
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:28,100
and how profiles specifically can help

743
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:30,760
net those conversations together.

744
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:33,120
So as you think about kind of a timescale

745
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,100
we've got a notional
scale there on the bottom

746
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,090
of what that progression can look like.

747
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:39,939
So here you are today,
understanding the three frameworks

748
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:42,340
and their relationship in a month.

749
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:44,419
So you can start building
framework profiles

750
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,020
and implementing RMF steps.

751
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:48,710
Once you've got a handle
on those frameworks.

752
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:51,080
And then after you've
got your profiles built

753
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,850
you wanna think about
current and target profiles.

754
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:56,620
You can start applying
those and the RMF concepts

755
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:59,560
to connect your server
room to your boardroom.

756
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,100
And so we wanna thank
you for joining us today

757
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,919
and again, if you would
like to delve deeper

758
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,760
into these topics, please join us

759
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:09,660
for lab 4-T14 hands-on
three NIST cybersecurity

760
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:13,040
and privacy risk management
frameworks at 12:45.

761
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:13,873
Thank you.
