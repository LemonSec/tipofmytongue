00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:03,620
- Hi there, my name is Joakim Lialias

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:04,960
and I'm a Director of Product Marketing

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,020
here at Cisco Security.

4
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:10,290
And today I am pleased to be here

5
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:12,260
to kinda go through a presentation

6
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:15,129
where we're gonna talk about
how we can optimize operations

7
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:19,320
through simplification,
visibility, and automation.

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,200
And one of the things that is very common

9
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,070
is that many times you feel

10
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,880
like security goals are
often out of reach, right?

11
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,900
And one of the things that I wanna say

12
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,050
it's definitely not your fault.

13
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:35,029
So, on this slide you have a list

14
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:36,980
of many of these challenges, right?

15
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:40,709
So the difficult is in
how do you best integrate

16
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,040
security data and tools?

17
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,580
How do you enable cross team collaboration

18
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:48,010
where you now have a
situation where security

19
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:49,390
is a shared responsibility?

20
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:54,213
It's a team sport that we're
playing across IT operations,

21
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:59,010
network operations and
security operations.

22
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:00,949
Meanwhile, we have these things

23
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:02,930
where we need to kind of drive

24
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:05,660
this reduce time to detection.

25
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:07,789
And we also wanna make sure

26
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:10,760
that we have those
fractal measures in place

27
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,840
that we employ on a regular basis.

28
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,498
And of course, it's critical,
critical as ever before,

29
00:01:17,498 --> 00:01:20,530
to make sure that we have
a consistent approach

30
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:22,490
to our compliance effort.

31
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:25,410
So these are, of course,
some of the challenges

32
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:27,840
that we're facing as we kind of look

33
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,070
at maximizing our security posture.

34
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:33,800
So, one of the things, if you kinda look

35
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,940
at it from a security
operations perspective,

36
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:41,789
often you see security operations
teams being overwhelmed

37
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:42,750
with alerts, right?

38
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:47,750
So, basically, having that

39
00:01:47,777 --> 00:01:51,200
just feeling that you can't keep up,

40
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,550
you cannot parse through all of the data

41
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,530
and information that you have.

42
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:58,557
Also at the same time, you
look at it then you say,

43
00:01:58,557 --> 00:02:01,530
"Well, I do feel very
understaffed, right?"

44
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,980
And oh yes, there's a skills shortage.

45
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:07,140
So, being understaffed and
not being in a position

46
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,940
to kind of hire that skill
for your environment,

47
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,329
is really really putting a hamper on that.

48
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:15,570
As we're seeing 65% of organizations,

49
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:18,769
report a shortage of cybersecurity staff,

50
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:21,300
and there's a ton of positions

51
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:25,260
that remain unfilled actually 1.3 million.

52
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,299
So at this really kinda turns out to be

53
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,650
is that it puts many people in a position

54
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:33,840
where they feel like they're unable

55
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,263
to keep pace with the current threats.

56
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:39,390
So, one of the things too,

57
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:42,450
is that security industry
is not making it any easier.

58
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:45,630
And I've been part of the
cybersecurity industry

59
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,359
for many, many, many years.

60
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,930
And I've seen the number
of security vendors

61
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:54,950
grow dramatically and you can
take any kind of subsegment

62
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:57,049
of the security industry.

63
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:59,370
And if you look at it as an aggregate,

64
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:01,390
we see that there are more than 3000

65
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,269
cyber security vendors out there.

66
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:05,420
So, it's a vast security market.

67
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:08,049
And of course, a lot of these
cyber security companies

68
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:11,510
come up with where they're
solving a particular problem,

69
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:13,530
and having unique approach,

70
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,700
and they're in deep
providing value, right?

71
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,769
But one of the challenges
that are happening

72
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:22,040
with customers as they're
deploying these solutions

73
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,120
is that they're becoming silos, right?

74
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,400
And many of these silos are
not talking to each other,

75
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,700
are not kind of working
as a collective unit.

76
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,530
And we're seeing that customers are facing

77
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:39,430
on average about 75 security
tools within their environment.

78
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:42,810
So essentially what's happening
is that even though you feel

79
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:46,130
like you're getting the
best product deployed

80
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:47,500
for your environment,

81
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,580
it's actually reducing the effectiveness

82
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:51,730
because it's becoming
more and more difficult

83
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:56,730
to find ways to get these
products to work in unison.

84
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:00,890
And of course, being able to
kind of orchestrate alerts

85
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:02,859
across these environments.

86
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,630
And actually one of the recent studies

87
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:07,013
that we had here at Cisco,

88
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:09,960
79% of CSO said, it's very difficult

89
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:13,283
to orchestrate alerts
across their environment.

90
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:18,769
So, when you're looking
at this kind of scenario

91
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:21,829
when security solutions
are kind of designed

92
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:23,729
and built in isolation, right?

93
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,520
So, always kinda look at
it from the standpoint

94
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,640
of kinda what is wrong
with isolated solutions,

95
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,599
because many times you kind of look at it

96
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,900
from the perspective of saying,

97
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,650
well, what, I am getting best of breed.

98
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:39,770
And I'm saying, not to
say that best of breed

99
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:41,650
is not a great thing,

100
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,409
but one of the things
that we gotta look at

101
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:47,010
it is what else is
there that can be caused

102
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:49,340
by having these kind of, or the outcome

103
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,250
the negative outcome

104
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:53,220
from having these kind
of isolated solutions?

105
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,940
The first one is that data
is analyzed in isolation.

106
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:58,570
So, what happens then
is that you will have

107
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:01,550
that lack of fidelity that is necessary

108
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,490
in order to kind of detect

109
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:06,800
hidden attacks or even having these,

110
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,900
the advanced attacks being kind of exposed

111
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,450
within an environment.

112
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:14,409
Also, what you're finding
is that the alerts

113
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:16,490
that come in from the various products

114
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:20,040
are prioritized in isolation
not as an aggregate.

115
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:24,780
So basically it's finding too little time,

116
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,690
kind of malicious intent
for teams to act, right?

117
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:32,690
So, it's creating that thing
where not all of your alerts

118
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:36,660
are prioritized in the
way that they need to.

119
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,760
Also, what you're finding is that,

120
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:42,772
security teams often
are set up to kind of,

121
00:05:42,773 --> 00:05:45,360
align to many of these different silos.

122
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,910
So, they respond in isolation.

123
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:50,350
So, basically what you're missing then,

124
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,170
in many cases is the overall context

125
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:57,400
and coordination on how to
respond to a particular attack.

126
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,299
So what is the path forward?

127
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,310
One of the things that
we believe here at Cisco

128
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:04,860
is that security solutions
should empower people

129
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,220
to be in a position where
they can investigate

130
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:10,060
and respond to threats faster.

131
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:12,980
We feel that automation should reduce

132
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:16,390
the burden on the
security operations center

133
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:18,900
and of course, security
products and threat intelligence

134
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,719
should all work together.

135
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,600
And subsequently these two
things will make it easier

136
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:29,000
and faster for customers to be
able to investigate threats.

137
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,351
Now there was, of course,
looking a few years back,

138
00:06:32,351 --> 00:06:34,580
the way where we looked at saying,

139
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,440
okay, we have the solution

140
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,510
the SIM is gonna provide
the solution to it.

141
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:41,772
A source solution was gonna provide to it,

142
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:47,650
but still we're maintaining,
kind of the dwell time length

143
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:51,750
of a threat being 280 days, right?

144
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:55,740
And of course, SIEM and SOAR
tools were designed to help,

145
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:58,380
offering analytics and automation.

146
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,090
But one of the things that customers

147
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:03,840
quickly found that, most
organization didn't have

148
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,780
the resources right now both
from an investment perspective,

149
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,979
from a dollars but also in head headcount

150
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:14,010
perspective to fully implement
and utilize these solutions.

151
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:16,760
And, still customers,

152
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:20,380
remain buried in alerts and
unable to improve metrics

153
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:23,090
like meantime to detect
and meantime to remediate.

154
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:27,912
So, they didn't really provide
that kind of the solution

155
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,640
for the challenges is being able to detect

156
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:35,223
and investigate and remediate
threats more quickly.

157
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:39,130
So, one of the things that we have seen

158
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:40,830
and you've probably heard it as well,

159
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:45,080
is customers are kind of
talking about and asking about

160
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:48,739
extended detection and response, right?

161
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:53,290
So this is what is often
referred to as XDR.

162
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:58,290
And XDR is a concept that
has kind of been around,

163
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:00,560
for maybe a year or so.

164
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,423
I mean, it's still kind of emerging,

165
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:04,830
we probably have referred to it

166
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:08,320
in many different ways in the past,

167
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:12,360
because it's really kind of
helping in a few areas, right?

168
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,160
It's designed to kind of help
or support in a few areas

169
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,730
such as, how do I get better visibility

170
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:21,880
and context across my
security architecture?

171
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,560
How do I get security teams

172
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:28,193
to work better together
and act more quickly,

173
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:32,020
to threats within my environment?

174
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,900
How can I increase the threat awareness

175
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:37,480
and privatization within my environment?

176
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,690
And of course, being able to
be in a position to reduce

177
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:43,073
severity and scope of an attack.

178
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:47,250
But at the end of the day,
you feel kind of like,

179
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,620
okay, we've asked
ourselves these questions.

180
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,720
We have tried to achieve
a solution for this.

181
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,560
So, what is it about XDR
that is kind of unique

182
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,520
and different that we should be concerned

183
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,160
about or not concerned
about or should know.

184
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,339
And I think Gartner provides

185
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:09,113
a really good definition of XDR.

186
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:13,160
They define it as a
unified incident detection

187
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,740
and response platform
that automatically collect

188
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,970
and correlates data

189
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:22,440
from multiple proprietary
security components.

190
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,220
So I think, that's a really good short,

191
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,200
concise kind of description.

192
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,630
But I think more importantly,

193
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:30,960
I think that going to a couple

194
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,500
of kind of key tenants, right?

195
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,760
First, it must be able
to kind of centralize

196
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,150
the collections right?

197
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:41,847
For historic as well as
real time event data.

198
00:09:41,847 --> 00:09:45,710
And be able to present
it in a common format

199
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:49,350
and make it available
for indexed searches.

200
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:54,000
So, this is that kind of
context and visualization

201
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,560
and visibility into your environment.

202
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,989
And then of course it needs to be

203
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:00,290
in a position where it can apply,

204
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:02,310
multiple machine learning techniques,

205
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:05,589
to be able to analyze this
kind of real-time data

206
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:10,460
but also historical data, to
be able to kind of detect,

207
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:14,020
that subtle malicious
activity that may be going

208
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,439
on in your environment.

209
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,910
And lastly, it must kind of offer

210
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,880
those automation capabilities

211
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:23,480
because one of the things
that we've seen automation do

212
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,360
is that will help to accelerate response

213
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,250
or even proactively provide a protection

214
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,730
and posture for your environment.

215
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:34,220
So, those are some of
the key things, right?

216
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:36,750
It has to centralize the
collections of historic

217
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,542
and real-time event data,

218
00:10:38,542 --> 00:10:42,420
be able to apply that multiple
machine learning techniques

219
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:47,420
to find those subtle or
hidden malicious activities,

220
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:50,220
and also kind of provide that automation.

221
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,870
So these are kind of the three kind

222
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:55,720
of core pillars that support
that overall definition.

223
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:00,390
But kind of stepping back
and kind of looking at it

224
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:03,540
from from the standpoint of
what are the basics, right?

225
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:07,819
So, one of the things
is that XDR capabilities

226
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:10,942
need to enable certain capabilities

227
00:11:10,942 --> 00:11:14,343
across the network cloud and endpoint.

228
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:20,610
EDR is something that has
been around for awhile.

229
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:23,670
It is, fairly widely deployed

230
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:27,870
and that is delivering the
visibility quick detection

231
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:28,920
easy to response

232
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,010
for all endpoints in a
customer's environment.

233
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:35,300
Then of course you have NDR
network detection and response,

234
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,370
which helps to analyze that flow

235
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:41,640
between any entity to
cover unmanaged devices

236
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,560
or cloud native systems.

237
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,880
So that is providing the visibility

238
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:51,420
and the insight into your
network and cloud environments.

239
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:55,670
And of course, between these two solutions

240
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:58,990
there needs to be a way to
kind of find that unification

241
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:03,990
of data analytics and automation
across ADR, NDR and beyond.

242
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:05,959
And when I say beyond,

243
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:09,600
there are other very
critical control points

244
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,690
that needs to be part of what I call

245
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:16,130
kind of that additional extended XDR

246
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:21,130
such as your cloud security,
email security, firewall,

247
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:25,300
a secure web gateway.

248
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:28,099
Those are all really, really
critical control points.

249
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,360
But the key here is that
you need to kind of start

250
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,690
with the EDR or the endpoint
detection and response and NDR

251
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:37,760
the network detection and response,

252
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,920
in a way for you to be able
to kind of elegantly unify

253
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,033
that data and analytics and
automation across those two.

254
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:49,360
So, couple of things
from a Cisco perspective

255
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,470
that we believe that a robust XDR solution

256
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:56,140
needs or should deliver, right?

257
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:58,569
I think first and foremost,

258
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,800
it is kind of looking at the X, right?

259
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,949
What does the X really kind of mean?

260
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,750
And I think this is the (indistinct)

261
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,350
of being able to kind of bring together

262
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:11,640
many different control
points and data sources.

263
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,020
And then of course, once we have that,

264
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,410
you need to be in a position

265
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:18,930
to kind of make detections
smarter and faster

266
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:21,780
with machine learning enhanced analytics.

267
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,990
So that's kind of your D right.

268
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:27,610
And then you need to be
able to reduce dwell times,

269
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:30,470
by making investigations easier,

270
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:35,470
being able to be in a position
to respond to threats faster,

271
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:39,560
and being able to have
that ability to automate

272
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,310
this in a better way.

273
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:46,310
So that is kind of your alright response.

274
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:49,620
So, these kind of three key areas

275
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,060
is one of the things that we feel

276
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:56,969
a robust XDR solution
needs to deliver, right?

277
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:01,970
So, how can an XDR solution help, right?

278
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:05,100
I mean, we have seen many customers,

279
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:08,830
being able to, kind of get that visibility

280
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:11,010
across networks endpoints
and applications.

281
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:13,830
Because it is absolutely critical.

282
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:15,640
Then being in a position to quickly

283
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:19,162
and easily apply that
analytics automation to detect,

284
00:14:19,162 --> 00:14:22,770
analyze and hunt and remediate threats.

285
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:25,449
So it's really kind of
getting that detection,

286
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:30,090
investigation, and
response, sped up in a way

287
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:35,090
that you can kind of pivot to respond to,

288
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,980
any incident within your environment,

289
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,560
much, much more quickly.

290
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,760
And again, I think it's
important also to look at it

291
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,660
from the standpoint of,
how well does it extend

292
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:46,060
across other organizations

293
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:49,540
that are kind of, have the
security responsibilities.

294
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:53,449
So, whether it's being IT ops, or net ops,

295
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:55,630
as well as of course SecOps, right?

296
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:58,650
But I think there are
four kind of key benefits

297
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:01,150
that we've seen customers
being able to achieve, right?

298
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,720
So it's enhanced visibility and context,

299
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,323
increased threat awareness
and privatization,

300
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:09,342
kind of providing security teams

301
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:13,830
a better position from where
they can act more quickly.

302
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:18,100
And then of course, ultimately
this will help reduce,

303
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,960
kind of the severity and
the scope of the attack.

304
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,600
One of the key things, the
last, this is an emerging kind

305
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,763
of area and an emerging kind of solution.

306
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,240
I think it's important to kind of say,

307
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:35,430
we shouldn't trust everything
that is labeled XDR.

308
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:37,969
It seems like a very simple concept

309
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:40,690
but it can be very difficult to execute.

310
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:44,160
So, getting to the point
where you're gonna be able

311
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,010
to kind of unify the data sets

312
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:48,840
it is a challenging activity, right?

313
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:53,840
Manage security solution often lack APIs,

314
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:57,410
compatible database structures
and data normalization

315
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,459
there of course, kind of
these loose partnerships

316
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:05,940
that you can't really
deliver on the promise of XDR

317
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:09,490
to be really having that
extended detection and response.

318
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:12,491
Because, it's not quite there in terms

319
00:16:12,491 --> 00:16:15,420
of the partnerships.

320
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:19,890
And lastly, I mean, some of
the XDR solutions out there

321
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:21,780
require costly data lakes.

322
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,430
Then I think many
customers are looking this

323
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:26,380
at this from the standpoint of,

324
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:30,010
I don't want to have all of
these multiple data lakes.

325
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:34,300
I wanna have an intelligent
river that kind of flows

326
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,849
with telemetry into a system

327
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:40,983
that can derive that extended
detection and response.

328
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:47,210
So, if you're thinking
about an XDR solution

329
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:49,920
or where to start,

330
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,819
I mean these are some of the
important questions, right?

331
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:55,080
So, to kind of ask yourself,

332
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,260
and I think we wanna make sure

333
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:59,480
that you have some of these questions

334
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,380
so that you can ask the vendors
like ourselves and others.

335
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:06,670
Is, does your XDR help to unify data

336
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:09,010
from your security technologies?

337
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:12,210
So, you're gonna have multiple vendors

338
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:13,400
within your environment.

339
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:18,150
And the question that I think
is really really important

340
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:21,000
is how do you bring about
that unification of data?

341
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,410
Because this is the foundation
for everything else.

342
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:27,430
So, if you cannot get to this point,

343
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:32,430
it's almost like, do
not proceed any further.

344
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:36,040
So, the other one is kind of what role

345
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:39,409
does analytics play in
bringing together insights

346
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:41,280
from across attack vectors?

347
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,170
So how do you analyze all this information

348
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:45,460
that you get from your endpoint

349
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,010
that you get from your network,

350
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:48,800
that you get from your cloud?

351
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,770
And doing that in a
very, very effective way.

352
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:55,498
And what kind of machine
learning capabilities

353
00:17:55,498 --> 00:17:57,520
does the vendor have,

354
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,307
in order to kind of make
that kind of smart analytics

355
00:18:00,307 --> 00:18:02,783
in play here for the XDR solution?

356
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,459
Is your endpoint security
doing enough, right?

357
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,090
I mean, from one of the key
things that you're looking

358
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:10,560
at an XDR solution,

359
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,500
is taking that telemetry and
insight from the endpoints.

360
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,223
So is that doing enough?

361
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,150
Is automation the answer for you?

362
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:22,659
Where should you be
looking at those scenarios

363
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:26,520
where you can eliminate
your threat response?

364
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,810
And how will you make

365
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:31,639
better security decisions with XDR?

366
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:35,360
So how is it ultimately going to help you

367
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:40,240
make better decisions in terms of keeping,

368
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,840
a positive kind of move up to a better

369
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,949
more mature kind of a security posture?

370
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:51,290
So, I think the key thing there
is like looking at the KPIs

371
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:55,000
that you may have for your organization,

372
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,850
and take a hard look at that and saying,

373
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:58,949
going down that list right?

374
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:02,497
And saying, "Where's XDR
really going to help us

375
00:19:02,497 --> 00:19:04,657
"make better security decisions

376
00:19:04,657 --> 00:19:07,133
"and subsequently meet those KPIs?"

377
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:13,620
But I think, if you look
at XDR from the standpoint,

378
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,139
if it is done right,

379
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:19,720
it can definitely help
you achieve three things.

380
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,840
I think the first thing is simplicity.

381
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,600
It will help to simplify your environment

382
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:28,050
in terms of driving faster
detection and response.

383
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:31,060
Visibility, it will
absolutely help to provide

384
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:34,610
that visibility across
endpoints networking cloud,

385
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:37,260
and being able to gather that information

386
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:41,010
into a contextual view where you can apply

387
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:44,480
some advanced machine learning
to make better decisions

388
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,990
and you can be able to
detect, and then of course,

389
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:50,930
investigate and subsequently
remediate faster.

390
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:52,370
And then automation, right?

391
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:54,010
I think automation is critical

392
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:59,010
in terms of, yeah, this is
needed in order to make sure

393
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:04,000
that you can respond and remediate faster,

394
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,130
but you can do that in a
way that doesn't overtax

395
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:10,890
the resources that you have
within your environment.

396
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:13,720
So making it easier,
making it simpler to kind

397
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:16,150
of drive those remediation efforts.

398
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:18,880
And automation is also very very critical

399
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,410
in creating that kind of
proactive security posture

400
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:24,083
for your company.

401
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,410
So, with that I wanna thank you so much.

402
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:30,670
And I know that was a
quick run through on XDR

403
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:31,940
but I hope you got a little bit

404
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,520
of our kind of point of
view and our perspective

405
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:38,060
on what XDR means and
what it should deliver.

406
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:40,360
And also kind of what to look for

407
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:43,270
as you are evaluating an XDR solution,

408
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:45,090
and some of the key
questions that you can ask.

409
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:48,530
So, with that again, thank you very much.

410
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:50,330
Again, my name is Joakim Lialias

411
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:52,530
and if there are any questions,

412
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:54,097
please ask them, thank you.
