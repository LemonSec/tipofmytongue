1
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:02,100
- Hello, I'm Bill Hill,

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,030
the CISO for the MITRE Corporation.

3
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:06,270
And with me is Dr. Stan Barr,

4
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:07,880
our Capability Area Lead

5
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,719
for cyber denial, deception,
and adversary engagement

6
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,460
and our favorite mad scientist.

7
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:14,910
We're here to introduce you

8
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,320
to a recently published
resource called MITRE Shield

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,340
and discuss what it means to learn

10
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:24,133
from your adversaries using engagement.

11
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:27,050
For those of you who don't know us,

12
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:29,120
MITRE's public private partnerships

13
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,480
and federally funded R and D centers

14
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,300
work to tackle challenges to the safety,

15
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,949
security, and wellbeing of our nation.

16
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:38,910
As part of our public interest mission

17
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:40,889
we work to bring communities together

18
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:43,223
to develop more effective cybersecurity.

19
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,380
With MITRE Shield, we've
introduced some things

20
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:50,390
that we think are kind of
game-changing and groundbreaking

21
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:52,310
but they're not just ideas.

22
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:54,760
As Stan are gonna talk about
throughout this presentation,

23
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,160
they're all grounded in experience.

24
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,760
Stan and I have been
working together on and off

25
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,719
for quite a long time, a
number of years in this area.

26
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:05,850
And so we're gonna try to bring you

27
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:09,490
both the Cisco view and
the practitioner view

28
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:13,548
of what the activity
behind Shield really means

29
00:01:13,548 --> 00:01:16,390
and how you can benefit from it.

30
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:18,680
So if you're ready for
that, Stan, are you ready?

31
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,220
You wanna jump in?

32
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,202
- Yeah, no, I'm just excited to be here.

33
00:01:22,202 --> 00:01:24,240
It's great to work with Bill.

34
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,869
I've gotten to work with
Bill for like 26 years now

35
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:29,610
off and on, and he's one
of my favorite mentors

36
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:33,160
and it's great to be on
stage, virtual stage with him.

37
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,610
And I look forward to
talking about this subject.

38
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:37,633
- Okay. So here we go.

39
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:41,532
- So I guess I'm gonna start the talk off.

40
00:01:41,532 --> 00:01:43,710
I'll just give you a little organization

41
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:47,399
about how the talk is
gonna be a run today.

42
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,740
We're going to start off with
our evolutionary approach

43
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,699
how we got to where we are

44
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,220
then me and Bill are gonna talk

45
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,360
about where we are right now with Shield.

46
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,130
And then finally, we're gonna close out

47
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:59,080
with where we're going with Shield 2.0.

48
00:02:01,096 --> 00:02:05,000
Shield builds on a lot of work from MITRE,

49
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,900
everything it MITRE builds from
past work that we have done.

50
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,160
We've done a lot of work

51
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,990
in the areas of deception,
of adversary engagement

52
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:18,310
and understanding malware and bad guys.

53
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,750
So there are some things up here.

54
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:24,010
You'll see some of our authors,
some of our MITRE brethren

55
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:27,590
and sisters have put together
a book called cyber denial,

56
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:31,320
deception, and counter
deception, phenomenal book

57
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,109
you should go out and pick it up.

58
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:36,450
We have some work that you can
come to our website and see

59
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:40,530
about the idea of the cyberspace
advantage, letting them in.

60
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:44,220
So this is a white paper
on the use of deception

61
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:48,530
and I'm sure everyone in the
audience has heard of CVE.

62
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:51,410
And so, MITRE puts a lot
of this stuff together

63
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:54,680
and it's how we sort of
build a new work, right.

64
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,150
We figure out what we learned
from all these other things

65
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,260
and we adapt them and
we bring it all along.

66
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,269
So Shield is yet another piece

67
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:04,683
of interlocking puzzle
pieces of MITRE's work.

68
00:03:06,098 --> 00:03:09,253
I'll just start out with the bottom line.

69
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:13,864
MITRE Shield, it maps to attack, right?

70
00:03:13,864 --> 00:03:16,780
(indistinct) shocks, where
that we MITRE connects

71
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,710
to a lot of other things that we do.

72
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:23,710
And the idea, if you
look at both MITRE Attack

73
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:28,180
and MITRE Shield there,
what you're gonna see today

74
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:33,180
is that it comes from a long understanding

75
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,140
of our adversaries.

76
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:38,769
So I started MITRE's Cyber
Deception Operations Program

77
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:41,340
in 2008, and we were really interested

78
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,610
in learning about our adversaries, right?

79
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:46,110
And we wanted to have this idea

80
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:51,110
of how do we map the adversaries
TTPs to engage with them.

81
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,820
And as we've gone, we've
built that up, right?

82
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:58,120
So we want to build a defender TTPs

83
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,620
that can work for them

84
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:02,360
and learn from the attacks
that they observed.

85
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,610
We want to show what opportunities

86
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:08,570
an adversary presents to you

87
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:12,280
and how you can use their adversarial TTPs

88
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,583
to your advantage.

89
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,839
What we're gonna do is
we're gonna talk about

90
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,722
some of the very useful defender TTPs

91
00:04:19,723 --> 00:04:21,890
and how you can actually bring them

92
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:24,130
to bear in your operations.

93
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:28,300
And we really believe
that Shield as a framework

94
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:33,300
and as a thought model can
help you build capabilities

95
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,020
that you can say, "Here's
what I'm seeing in attack.

96
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:39,400
Here's what this sort of
approach of our adversaries are.

97
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,041
Now, how do I, as a defender

98
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:46,517
sort of make make advantages
against my adversary?"

99
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,709
Bill, did you have anything
you wanted to add about that?

100
00:04:49,709 --> 00:04:51,018
- No, keep rolling.

101
00:04:51,018 --> 00:04:53,650
You're saying everything.

102
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:54,575
- Okay.

103
00:04:54,576 --> 00:04:58,820
When we set the stage for
Shield there is a couple

104
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:01,250
of things that we're really
looking to do, right?

105
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,670
So I'm gonna lay out

106
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:05,760
where we're going with Shield,
why is Shield important?

107
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,190
And let's start with looking

108
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:11,570
and trying to lay out somewhat
of an X, Y axis, right?

109
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:16,570
And where we want to wind up
is not relying on luck, right?

110
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:25,100
So many times defenders are
stuck with whatever happens.

111
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,784
We wanna move the defender from luck

112
00:05:27,784 --> 00:05:30,930
to a proactive skill where they can

113
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,950
actually accomplish things that are useful

114
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:36,110
for their mission for defense.

115
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:39,060
And at the same time with that skill

116
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:43,450
we want to develop
knowledge about the APT.

117
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:45,760
And so we've sort of
laid this out in sort of

118
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:49,620
a logical progression of how
technologies can help you.

119
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:53,400
So, of course there is what
everyone needs to be doing.

120
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,770
There is a bunch of
necessity, things that come

121
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:58,539
along with this is logging, and IDS,

122
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:01,528
and all the rest of the
stuff that you're told about.

123
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:03,690
And those are really great

124
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:08,600
for forensic analysis later
on of what happened, right?

125
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:13,600
But the problem is all you
learn about is what has happened

126
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:16,162
and hopefully you get it in your log.

127
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:21,400
So, moving up the up the chain

128
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:25,299
of sort of building information advantage

129
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:29,090
and skill advantage is
simple honey pots, right?

130
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:34,090
Even today, there is some value
in standing up a honey pot

131
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:36,950
and seeing what happens,
who touches that, right?

132
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,840
Who touches the honey pot?

133
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,840
What do they try and interact with it?

134
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:44,400
You start learning about where
the adversary is coming from.

135
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,969
You can start to learn
about how they interact

136
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:49,453
with objects on your network.

137
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:54,660
So moving up and looking at
today's active deception,

138
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:57,050
and when we talk about active deception

139
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:59,730
we're talking about sophisticated systems

140
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:03,920
that have lures, and
sinks, and credentials,

141
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:08,760
and real information that
confirms the adversary

142
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,599
that he's on the right place

143
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,740
and fake information that
throws him off, right?

144
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:17,150
And this is idea of actively
deceiving your adversary

145
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:20,799
to confuse him, to adjust
to sort of ambiguity knob,

146
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,880
where sometimes we want the adversary

147
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,450
to think he's not being observed,

148
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:27,370
and so we have a deception system

149
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:31,190
with all sorts of stuff
analyzing and monitoring,

150
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,620
and he's allowed to do anything.

151
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:36,580
And sometimes we, we might
turn the ambiguity knob all up

152
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:39,010
and say, here's a million shares

153
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:40,360
with a whole bunch of users

154
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,380
and you can't figure out what is real.

155
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:46,719
And that idea of seeing
how the adversary interacts

156
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,250
with that environment is really exciting

157
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,890
and can really teach you a lot

158
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:55,813
because your adversary has to engage.

159
00:07:55,814 --> 00:07:58,860
But what we are trying
to focus on in Shield

160
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:03,440
is sort of at this point,
which is adversary engagement

161
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,770
and it is the intentional
interaction with threats.

162
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:09,389
And there are a lot of ways to do that.

163
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:13,200
Sometimes you may create
a synthetic environment.

164
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,200
We'll talk about that later
on about the value proposition

165
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,300
of creating a synthetic environment

166
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,890
and using sort of deceptive technologies

167
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:23,219
to get your adversary to operate.

168
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,160
And I will say that adversary engagement

169
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:30,100
is also the is not pulling the plug

170
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,500
the very moment you find

171
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,100
that a threat on your network, right?

172
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:38,520
And so adversary engagement
is about the safe operation

173
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,860
and figuring out what you need to do

174
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,860
to make sure that you
can learn what's going on

175
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,070
before you pull the plug
to make sure you have

176
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:47,750
a good understanding of it.

177
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,000
And there's a lot there
and it can be dangerous.

178
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,915
And you have to have

179
00:08:51,915 --> 00:08:55,010
a lot of things in place to
make sure you do it right.

180
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:57,930
But man, just pulling the plug may pulling

181
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:00,516
the only thread that you will have to find

182
00:09:00,517 --> 00:09:03,003
more about your adversary.

183
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,940
Moving a little farther up on that

184
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:09,420
and where you might wanna go,

185
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,990
there's a lot of definitions
of adversary engagement,

186
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:14,470
active deception, active defense.

187
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:17,087
And I sort of use the DOD lingo for this,

188
00:09:17,087 --> 00:09:21,960
which is active defense is
limited or offensive activities.

189
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,550
We're sort of, that's
out of scope for Shield.

190
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:27,810
And certainly lastly
out of scope for Shield

191
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:29,449
is the idea of hack back,

192
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:32,030
where we don't wanna be focused there,

193
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:35,860
we want to focus Shield
on the point of right here

194
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:38,700
where we're engaging with our adversary

195
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,540
and we're interacting with them.

196
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:43,209
And our goal with interacting with them

197
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:45,430
is to learn about their weaknesses,

198
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:48,109
to learn about how they operate,

199
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:51,680
to be able to expose what's going on.

200
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,364
And hopefully by understanding it

201
00:09:54,365 --> 00:09:56,980
and better being prepared for it,

202
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:01,000
we can reduce the threat
posed by these adversaries.

203
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,090
It's not about going toe to toe with them.

204
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:05,880
It's about reducing adversary aggression

205
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:09,810
by understanding their weaknesses
and using that weaknesses

206
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:13,780
against them to sort of maybe
hopefully make them go away.

207
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,242
And so that's what I'll say about

208
00:10:16,243 --> 00:10:19,080
how we're setting the stage for Shield.

209
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,450
Bill, did you wanna add anything?

210
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:21,810
You want to chime in on here?

211
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:23,310
- No, I think the only
thing I might mention

212
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:28,050
is that the the honey pots
is a form of deception,

213
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:31,911
but as typically done, it's
sort of all comers, right?

214
00:10:31,912 --> 00:10:35,370
Those are often exposed to anybody.

215
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:37,780
So one of the big advantages
of moving up the scandal

216
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:40,420
also is that you're being more selective

217
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:42,839
about who you're engaging.

218
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:46,100
It's either because, as Stan talk about

219
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,770
something that's already
happening on your network

220
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:49,130
and say, well, if someone has chosen you

221
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:52,680
and they've gotten that
far, or as you'll see later

222
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:56,040
we talk about, in some
cases you can choose

223
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,166
sort of the adversary you wanna study in

224
00:10:58,167 --> 00:11:00,260
and sort of the time and place of that.

225
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,950
So it's a little different

226
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:05,073
it's taking honey pots to a
much more selective place.

227
00:11:08,314 --> 00:11:10,689
- So, I'm gonna let you
take this slide Bill.

228
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:11,523
- Yeah.

229
00:11:11,523 --> 00:11:14,550
- Yeah, so we talk a lot
about adversary engagement.

230
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:17,500
Everybody has a lot of different sort of

231
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:21,380
these terms aren't really solidly
all agreed to in industry.

232
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,213
So we thought, okay,

233
00:11:22,213 --> 00:11:24,141
let's set the stage a little bit.

234
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:26,420
What are we talking about

235
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,829
sort of in a hands-on level, right?

236
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:31,220
So all of us, all of the systems,

237
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,436
all of us corporate defenders

238
00:11:33,436 --> 00:11:35,575
find ourselves with malware, right?

239
00:11:35,575 --> 00:11:39,570
Your detonation systems,
your filters, whatever

240
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,390
can restrict these things for you,

241
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:45,020
hopefully you're blocking them.

242
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:47,490
But now here, in some cases

243
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:49,690
here you have a piece
of this on your hands.

244
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:52,140
The first thing that everybody can do

245
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,319
is take a look at it.

246
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,650
You can reverse engineer it, right?

247
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:57,223
And there are things
you can learn from that.

248
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,590
It's getting to be, there's less and less

249
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:03,270
you can learn from that every day

250
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:05,699
because our adversaries
know that we do this.

251
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,320
And so they try to defeat
reverse engineering

252
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,170
in a number of ways.

253
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:12,786
So then when you move on
from that, you could say,

254
00:12:12,787 --> 00:12:14,590
"Well, what's the next thing you can do?

255
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:15,860
Let's run it, right?"

256
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:19,341
It's going beyond the sort
of the static analysis

257
00:12:19,341 --> 00:12:20,174
or the isolated analysis.

258
00:12:21,845 --> 00:12:26,845
You could certainly run it in a glass jar

259
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,819
and it probably won't do anything

260
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:31,460
because it cannot talk to its
command and control network.

261
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,060
It understands that
this is one of the ways

262
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:37,699
you study malware is you run
it on an isolated system.

263
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:41,560
So what we're talking
about really is running it

264
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,810
in a pseudo realistic system.

265
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:45,770
So you take that malware,

266
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:48,103
let's say you have a deception network

267
00:12:48,104 --> 00:12:52,320
that could be either simple
or it could be complicated.

268
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,840
And in fact, sometimes it
can be surprisingly simple

269
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,410
but it probably does need to
be connected to the internet.

270
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:01,587
And so what typically happens
is you run these things

271
00:13:01,587 --> 00:13:04,430
and the first thing they
do is phone home, right?

272
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:06,609
So they need command and control.

273
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:11,330
They're going to make
themselves known to their owner.

274
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:14,487
And thus begins this sort of the second,

275
00:13:14,487 --> 00:13:18,290
third and onward stages
of the exploitation

276
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:21,252
which is the adversary goes hands-on.

277
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:24,550
Sometimes that might be
automated for a little while,

278
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:27,010
but for the kind of studies we do,

279
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:30,030
we're eventually ending up
with there's an operator

280
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:34,290
at the other end running
this thing in your network.

281
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:39,079
And because you own this whole thing,

282
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,916
with one more click on the, on the slide,

283
00:13:41,916 --> 00:13:44,840
you're able to see every bit of this

284
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,410
from the moment that
things starts executing

285
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,150
through the command and control.

286
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:50,600
And since you own that environment

287
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,410
and you've planned for this,

288
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:53,969
you can collect as much as you want.

289
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:56,540
So you can collect off the target system.

290
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,790
You can collect off the network

291
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:00,339
as it goes by the networking gear.

292
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,120
And so in some cases you can have

293
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:06,340
fairly elaborate collection systems,

294
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:09,400
and you can use these to
both watch it in real time.

295
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:13,270
And also later when the engagement's over,

296
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:15,310
these are rich areas for study

297
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:18,459
sometimes it's hard to make complete sense

298
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,100
of what's going on in the moment.

299
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,960
And then you go back and you can really

300
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:25,810
sort of dissect this over
time at your leisure.

301
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:30,810
So this sort of gives you an
idea of the simplest thing.

302
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:35,199
And like I said, this can
be as surprisingly simple,

303
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,670
this could be in a what I would call

304
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,880
a coffee house operation.

305
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,170
And in fact we began this way, right?

306
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:46,510
One computer and a wifi,
and you potentially

307
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:50,307
have a deception environment
as Stan can tell you.

308
00:14:52,387 --> 00:14:56,140
- Yeah. So, I mean, I absolutely agree.

309
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,800
And we did start a lot of our operations

310
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,410
trying to make them look
really simple in the beginning.

311
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:06,420
And we learned a lot from
those simple engagements

312
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:11,420
and we have increased
our complexity with that.

313
00:15:11,629 --> 00:15:16,629
And we now have a small office,
home office type setups,

314
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:21,420
medium size setups, virtual and physical

315
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,969
and cloud assets that we put together

316
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:27,293
to sort of make this look more
and more like our network.

317
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:33,370
- So, and then of course you can increase

318
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:35,570
your sophistication as Stan mentioned

319
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:38,830
but I think we've sort of come away--

320
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:41,180
So thinking about this

321
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:46,122
as sort of the the cartoon
for adversary engagement,

322
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,250
but it's more like an iceberg, right?

323
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,670
There's a lot there below the waterline.

324
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:53,276
And so we've tried to
do some sense-making,

325
00:15:53,276 --> 00:15:56,199
as we've learned a lot about this.

326
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,310
And I think we came away from at least

327
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:02,290
for this session with three
kind of big ideas about this.

328
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:04,709
Number one, it's easier to
get started than you think.

329
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:07,300
A lot of people, when we
first started talking to them

330
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,237
about doing deception think,

331
00:16:10,237 --> 00:16:14,620
"Oh my gosh, well how would I
replicate my whole enterprise

332
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:19,620
and active directory and email
server and this and a that?"

333
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:23,110
Our experience says you can have robust

334
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:26,570
meaningful interactions
where you learn a lot

335
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:28,830
about your adversary with environments

336
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,760
that are far simpler than that.

337
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:34,553
So this is easier to get started
on than most people think.

338
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,286
And so that's sort of number one.

339
00:16:37,286 --> 00:16:40,770
Stan, I don't know if you
wanna jump in on that or.

340
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:43,800
- No, I think you've covered
that one really well.

341
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,632
- All right.

342
00:16:44,633 --> 00:16:46,880
So then second thing we'll tell you,

343
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,990
and Stan knows this one all too well,

344
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:52,353
is this also easier to
mess this up anything.

345
00:16:53,524 --> 00:16:56,790
We have learned a lot of lessons

346
00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:01,270
and I think that that's
not a reason not to do this

347
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,650
but it is a reason to think about it.

348
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:08,410
And we've hit some landlords
landmines along the way.

349
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:11,359
And so I think one of the
things that we're hoping for is

350
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,139
as people consider getting into the space

351
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,609
and you'll see the commercial at the end

352
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:18,849
we're hoping for potentially a community

353
00:17:18,849 --> 00:17:22,119
of people that are doing
this to work with each other

354
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:24,149
and share those war stories.

355
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:28,509
Not that we have any,
war stories. (laughs)

356
00:17:28,509 --> 00:17:31,140
- Yeah.

357
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:34,154
We don't definitely, we've
never made a mistake.

358
00:17:34,154 --> 00:17:36,080
I can remember this one operation

359
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:41,080
where we had this a USB
stick and I told the kid

360
00:17:41,205 --> 00:17:43,879
that was setting up the rig to operate,

361
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,530
to take the malware, put
the malware on a USB stick,

362
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:50,000
put the stick in the computer,

363
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,430
copy the malware to the desktop

364
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:53,900
and then run the malware, right?

365
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:57,810
And he did exactly what I
said and nothing I didn't say.

366
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:00,350
And what I should have said
before he ran the malware

367
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:03,897
was remove the USB stick
from the computer, right?

368
00:18:03,897 --> 00:18:05,826
And so a classic thing

369
00:18:05,826 --> 00:18:08,140
of when you're building these operations

370
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:10,788
is thinking about every
step that you have to do

371
00:18:10,788 --> 00:18:13,000
and what those tells are,

372
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,060
and what will the adversary
do to your computer

373
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:20,330
when he gets running
and he does a directory

374
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:25,330
and he sees his malware on a
USB stick called malware.exe.

375
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:29,690
So that didn't work out so
great in that operation.

376
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:31,740
- Right. 'Cause it's in the story, right?

377
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,187
Adversaries, if they figure out

378
00:18:34,187 --> 00:18:36,659
they're in a deception environment

379
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:39,017
or they're being observed, they're gonna,

380
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:40,477
that's the end of the engagement,

381
00:18:40,477 --> 00:18:43,720
that's the end of the useful engagement.

382
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,730
And I think we got a free
freshly formatted drive

383
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:48,710
out of the operation

384
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:51,320
'cause I don't think he liked
the idea very much, did he?

385
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,419
- He wasn't impressed.

386
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,700
- So that's the second piece.

387
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,470
And the third big sort of takeaway

388
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:00,470
from all of this sort of
combines the other two

389
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:02,613
which is that you wanna be strategic.

390
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:08,310
Unlike a lot of other things
this is spy counter spy,

391
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:10,440
move counter move, this is a chess game,

392
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,160
not a checkers game.

393
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,660
And so it really does pay to think

394
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:17,733
about what are your objectives.

395
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:23,625
In Shield version one we
talked a lot about mechanics,

396
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:29,120
I would say, and we did some
talking about objectives,

397
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,709
but I think that's a growth area for us

398
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:34,530
to talk about sort of strategies

399
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:36,870
and what are the potential objectives

400
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:40,840
and then what are your
plans to meet those.

401
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:45,500
And I think we have a lot
of our operating principles

402
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,560
come out of both not only our objectives

403
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,221
of what we want to happen

404
00:19:50,221 --> 00:19:52,830
but what we don't want to happen, right?

405
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:54,872
Stan lives by those every day.

406
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,053
- Yeah. I know.

407
00:19:57,053 --> 00:19:59,440
Like for instance, when people talk

408
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,827
about running operations, they say,

409
00:20:00,827 --> 00:20:03,470
"Hey, use your gold image", right?

410
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:08,470
Use the image so that the
adversary has a good belief

411
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,899
that this is your network
by using a gold image.

412
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,630
Well, the problem with using a gold image

413
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:18,330
is sometimes you may have files

414
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:22,939
on your gold image that
reveal something about you

415
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,680
and that can be dangerous.

416
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:29,210
You don't want your ed adversary
to get to learn from you

417
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:31,630
you want to learn from him.

418
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:32,463
- Right.

419
00:20:32,463 --> 00:20:33,700
Yap. So I can tell you, with CISO,

420
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,350
we don't use our gold image,

421
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:38,947
where we're not trying
to train our adversary

422
00:20:38,947 --> 00:20:41,090
so that one day they'll figure out

423
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:42,399
how to defeat all of this,

424
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,100
far from it, we intentionally are using

425
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:49,130
a sort of a different system.

426
00:20:49,131 --> 00:20:50,993
So, I think we should move on.

427
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,139
So the last piece of this

428
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:57,270
that I think in terms of motivation

429
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:59,537
before we sort of dig
into Shield a little bit,

430
00:20:59,537 --> 00:21:00,950
is to think about,

431
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:02,220
well what do you get for doing all this?

432
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,140
We talk about, what can you learn?

433
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:08,379
So we've got this little,
a series of graphs,

434
00:21:08,379 --> 00:21:12,600
just to show you these come from,

435
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:17,600
a set of actual operations
that we have run at MITRE.

436
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:21,340
And so we began to try to quantify,

437
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:26,250
to explore this option of what is the ROI?

438
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:29,390
So imagine that you
get pieces of knowledge

439
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:32,090
and in this graph, they
can be different things

440
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:33,649
but you get piece of knowledge

441
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:35,180
that are useful to a defender.

442
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:39,080
So that could be a hash
of a file that's bad

443
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,610
or an IP address that's bad,

444
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:43,806
let's just call them,
items of intelligence.

445
00:21:43,807 --> 00:21:48,807
So here's a list, if we were
not to do deception operations

446
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:53,050
if we did just say, did
static analysis and so forth,

447
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:56,050
we get a couple of those per case,

448
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:58,909
per piece of malware or whatever.

449
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:01,310
Look at what happens as we start

450
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:04,330
to add adversary engagement to the mix.

451
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:07,659
So the first thing that
happens is indicators.

452
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:12,330
These are more in terms of
network addresses and so forth.

453
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:15,590
These are all things that
I can put into my defenses.

454
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:18,637
These are things that
we can add to filter out

455
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:22,020
the bad guy or the look for him.

456
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,350
One of the system's biggest question

457
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,699
is how do you know
they're not already here?

458
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,748
It's like, well, every one of those things

459
00:22:26,748 --> 00:22:28,620
that is a sign of the adversary

460
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,250
is something that we can go look for

461
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,700
in our logs and our files to find.

462
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,810
So we get those additional indicators.

463
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:35,659
You can start seeing

464
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:39,090
that the scale on this chart is changing

465
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:41,800
because of all the additional
information we're getting.

466
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:45,129
So we get more indicators,
we get more files.

467
00:22:45,129 --> 00:22:48,230
When you deal only with the
malware that's sent to you

468
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:51,190
what you're missing is the
second stage, the third stage,

469
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:54,300
the fourth stage, all the
tools that the Emissary brings

470
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,730
and every one of those,
if you ever find them

471
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:59,680
in your enterprise is a
sign of something bad.

472
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:03,110
And so one of the things
we like to think about is

473
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:06,421
we will not necessarily
always catch the first sign

474
00:23:06,422 --> 00:23:08,520
of an adversary being there.

475
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:11,500
But if those are the only signs we have,

476
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,843
what does that time?

477
00:23:12,843 --> 00:23:16,990
So the more signs that we
can have of later periods

478
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:18,900
in their life cycle,
the better off we are,

479
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:22,300
and the more resilient
we are to them changing

480
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,990
their first stage attack.

481
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:27,210
So more indicators, more
files, more signatures

482
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:29,600
then you see now, we're dwarfing

483
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,939
what originally knew.

484
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:33,920
In each one of these operations,

485
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,600
what we originally knew

486
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,719
looks like almost nothing
compared to what we learn

487
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,820
from the engagement itself.

488
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:42,649
So I think that tells
a really great story.

489
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:44,460
If you're a hands-on guy

490
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:47,580
and you wanna show your CISO something,

491
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,572
this can get your attention.

492
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:54,020
- So, yeah, I think so.

493
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:57,103
Hopefully everyone got a chance
to screenshot that last one.

494
00:23:58,453 --> 00:24:02,129
You'll get them in the slides
when those are printed out,

495
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:05,103
I don't know exactly how
that's being done this year.

496
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:08,560
So when we talk about what Shield is,

497
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,973
and I know we still
haven't showed you Shield

498
00:24:10,973 --> 00:24:13,760
that say, "We're waiting
for the big reveal here."

499
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,260
It's really about creating a framework

500
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:21,960
that allows defenders
to safely engage, right?

501
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:26,960
And we want to enable
CISO's three fundamental,

502
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:33,669
to be able to answer three
fundamental questions, right?

503
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:36,210
I think these are important questions.

504
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:40,764
How do you go about finding
internal and remote threats?

505
00:24:40,764 --> 00:24:43,250
And I think that's something important

506
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:45,440
that we're all interested in doing.

507
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,010
We wanna understand the
threats that we observe.

508
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:51,100
We wanna know what's happening, right?

509
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:55,770
As we know that dwell time is in the days

510
00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:57,562
sometimes into the months,

511
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:00,980
so when you see something going on,

512
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:04,090
you need to think this may
have been going on for a while,

513
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:06,340
how do I understand it better

514
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:09,649
before I shift the fight
in our favor, right?

515
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:12,250
'Cause that is ultimately
what this is all about

516
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:15,390
is being able to find
things, understand it

517
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:18,130
and then use what we have learned

518
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:20,220
to shift the fight in our favor.

519
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:22,023
And that's really what we wanna do.

520
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,520
So I'm gonna go through a
little pretty quickly here

521
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:30,949
how we sort of look at what we're doing.

522
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:34,700
So Shield's attack
mapping is how do we apply

523
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:38,040
one of those goals of find
and understand and effect?

524
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:43,040
How do we map that to a
specific tactic and a technique

525
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:48,700
one for what we see the adversary
do and what is the tactic

526
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:52,100
and techniques that we
can use against them?

527
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:55,459
So the way we look at
this is like, for example

528
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,510
so if you go to the Shield website

529
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:59,640
and you look at our mappings, right?

530
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,580
So on the left-hand side,
you see an attack technique.

531
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:06,949
And so this maps to a very
specific attack technique

532
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:11,150
in the matrix and the
adversary in this case,

533
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:15,010
wants to gather victim
identity information.

534
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:16,760
So they're looking to figure out

535
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,930
what's going on on the victim.

536
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:20,650
So in Shield, we then look at that

537
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:22,770
and we call that an opportunity space.

538
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:26,470
And there's an opportunity,
when he does this,

539
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:29,570
there's an opportunity for you

540
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:32,830
to influence your
adversaries future actions.

541
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:34,470
And you ask, how is that?

542
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:38,031
So, one use case is that
a defender can deploy

543
00:26:38,031 --> 00:26:40,820
a decoy user accounts

544
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,820
to make that system look more realistic.

545
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:45,530
So he uses that tactic.

546
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:47,930
When he uses an attack technique

547
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:50,450
to gather identity information

548
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:52,130
you give him as much as you want.

549
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:56,579
And so what we have here is
this idea of attack technique,

550
00:26:56,579 --> 00:26:59,010
the opportunity that presents you,

551
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:01,640
how you go about using
it, and then we map that

552
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:06,640
into a adversary
engagement technique there.

553
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:09,433
And so that's how we are looking at this.

554
00:27:10,822 --> 00:27:14,280
I'm gonna sit down here
and for the next two hours

555
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:17,270
we're going to go through
every single block in this.

556
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:19,629
It's gonna be exciting,
hang onto your seats.

557
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:20,886
No.

558
00:27:20,886 --> 00:27:24,260
When we look at Shield,
we're trying to map

559
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:27,860
and we have a set of our own
columns here, channel, collect

560
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:31,250
contain, detect, disrupt,
facilitate, legitimize, and test,

561
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:33,300
and I'm not gonna go through all of them,

562
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,780
'cause we otherwise we'd be here forever.

563
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:38,500
But let's go back to
the very simple example

564
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:43,013
that Bill showed in the
beginning of the coffee shop op.

565
00:27:43,013 --> 00:27:46,340
So the first thing that we looked at there

566
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:48,199
was we looked at detection.

567
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,498
And so if you go to our detect column here

568
00:27:50,498 --> 00:27:55,498
partially way down through
the list is detonate malware.

569
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:58,600
Because when you detonate
a piece of malware

570
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:01,270
you learn what happens when it starts out,

571
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:03,790
what registry keys does it look for?

572
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:05,340
What DNS domains, right?

573
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:07,459
So you are starting to figure out

574
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:10,581
how you can go about
doing a detection, right?

575
00:28:10,581 --> 00:28:13,740
And so then we started
looking at what do we do?

576
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,730
What other columns, right?

577
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:19,940
So we can create, we can
go to the legitimize column

578
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:22,700
and we can say, we can
create a decoy network.

579
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:27,320
We can put a decoy information,
decoy assets out there.

580
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:30,006
And when an adversary sees that they go,

581
00:28:30,007 --> 00:28:31,170
"Oh, this is real.

582
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:33,760
This looks real to me.

583
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,840
And I'm willing to operate here."

584
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,750
And then you look at the test column.

585
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:40,420
So, what can we drag from the test column?

586
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:43,190
There's this idea of decoys content,

587
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:46,240
what do you put on this
machine that on the desktop

588
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,800
when he gets a snapshot of
that or on the file system,

589
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,010
what does he see?

590
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:52,530
What does he go after?

591
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:55,580
Does he go after secret product X?

592
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:58,240
Or does he go after financial information?

593
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,920
And so you can start maybe picking apart

594
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,380
what your adversaries interests are

595
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:07,770
and you can test him and you
can understand him better.

596
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:10,160
And then as Bill talked about earlier

597
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:13,930
one of the things that we do
at the end of our operations

598
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:17,430
is we build dissectors
and protocol decoders.

599
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:22,430
And that allows us for one,
for during our operations

600
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:27,230
because malware or APTs
often reuse the same tools

601
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:30,560
next time we see it, we can
decode the traffic much faster.

602
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,350
Second, it can also
help your MNR operations

603
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:36,310
when you're trying to figure
out something bad that happens

604
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:38,050
and you're able to decrypt that traffic

605
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:39,430
and decode that traffic,

606
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:44,430
man, that's a powerful
concept and use case.

607
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:47,470
And so that's in our collection, right?

608
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:48,830
You collect your packet,

609
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:51,260
you build your decoders
and then presto magic,

610
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:53,210
you can understand things a lot better.

611
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:57,580
So, we are moving.

612
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,460
we are excited about Shield.

613
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,160
We have been out there.

614
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:05,650
Shield is on, we see people
talking about it on LinkedIn.

615
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:08,640
We get a lot of requests
in the Shield mailbox.

616
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,670
And we are really excited about Shield V2.

617
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:14,530
We're working on Shield V2.

618
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:18,280
We will have Shield to
beta out soon for people to

619
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:22,120
and maybe even before
this goes to goes live,

620
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:27,120
but we are going to take that
feedback that we've gotten

621
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,149
and we are really gonna up the game

622
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:33,010
on enabling adversary engagement, right?

623
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:36,070
So we're going to make
it a little more clearer

624
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:38,820
on how to support those three use cases,

625
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:41,280
find, understand and effect.

626
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:44,639
We're reorganizing it a little bit

627
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,040
to make sure that we have a singular focus

628
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,720
on the defender's point of view.

629
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,749
And we're trying to create a
little cleaner of a taxonomy.

630
00:30:51,749 --> 00:30:54,690
But most important, what
we're trying to do is

631
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:58,000
incorporate feedback from the community.

632
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,010
And if you are interested
in adversary engagement,

633
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:05,343
if you wanna understand
how to use deception

634
00:31:05,343 --> 00:31:08,960
in your enterprise, if you have ideas

635
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,965
that you don't see us working on,

636
00:31:11,965 --> 00:31:14,909
we want to get some feedback from you.

637
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:16,660
So some of the things
that we're gonna focus on

638
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:19,170
and crispen up is the idea

639
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:21,780
of how we're doing
collection and detection.

640
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:24,250
We're really gonna be
focusing in the next version

641
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:29,050
of Shield on planning and analyzing.

642
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:31,649
How do you make sure that
you set up a way to plan?

643
00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:34,430
How do you actually have a plan of attack,

644
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:37,240
and how do you look at your
operation and analyze the data.

645
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,370
That's gonna be a foundational piece.

646
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:40,729
And then we're gonna sort of crisp it up

647
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:43,720
this idea of prevent, direct and disrupt.

648
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:46,999
And so these are the columns
that you'll see in Shield V2.

649
00:31:46,999 --> 00:31:48,629
And we are excited

650
00:31:48,629 --> 00:31:52,629
to roll this out in the very near future.

651
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:55,800
And please, as you look at Shield,

652
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,600
as you guys hear us today,

653
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:01,570
I hope you guys are typing
questions into the chat box.

654
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:03,889
And we want to engage with you.

655
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:05,610
We want to get the feedback.

656
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:08,660
We want to make adversary engagement

657
00:32:08,661 --> 00:32:11,150
something that is accessible

658
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:14,880
to every organization
who wants to be involved

659
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,820
to make it harder for our adversaries.

660
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:20,409
We need to stop giving them a free pass.

661
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:22,323
Bill, did you wanna add anything here?

662
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:24,003
- No.

663
00:32:24,003 --> 00:32:25,439
Just other than to give a commercial

664
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,370
for the follow on Q and A.

665
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:29,689
So, we should've mentioned

666
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:32,000
you could be typing
your questions in early,

667
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,350
but for some reason, we're out
of time with questions here

668
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:38,679
there's gonna be a follow
on session with Q and A.

669
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:42,640
- So we were asked how
people can apply Shield.

670
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,960
And so, what should you guys do next week?

671
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,200
The first thing you should do

672
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,030
when you get back from RSA
and you're done with all this

673
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:52,030
don't look through your email box

674
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:53,530
because that's the worst thing you can do.

675
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:55,840
The first thing is review
the Shield framework, right?

676
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,629
Look at it. See what's going on.

677
00:32:57,630 --> 00:33:00,520
Determine if adversary
engagement is right for you.

678
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,620
And if you think it's right for you

679
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:04,850
if you think this is the worst idea

680
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:06,620
send it to the Shield mailbox.

681
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:09,110
I'm excited. I will read this stuff.

682
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:11,815
I wanna hear what people
are really thinking, right?

683
00:33:11,816 --> 00:33:13,860
Tell us what you think about Shield.

684
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,510
Tell us what you need from it.

685
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:17,950
What is the future that
we can bring to you?

686
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:21,000
And tell us if adversary
engagement is right for you.

687
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,440
Tell us if you want to be a part

688
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:26,230
of a coalition of the willing
to try these things out.

689
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:27,820
We're looking for partners.

690
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:29,500
MITRE is an open place

691
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:33,040
where we try and engage
with the whole community.

692
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:36,360
What I'd like to see is
people within three months

693
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:39,993
develop a plan to run malware safely.

694
00:33:40,838 --> 00:33:44,510
I can't strenuously enough say that

695
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:46,916
if you don't know what
safely means, right?

696
00:33:46,916 --> 00:33:49,149
If you really like, "I don't know",

697
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:50,700
then it's not safe, right?

698
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:53,260
You should be able to say,
"Heck yeah, this is safe".

699
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:56,660
And if you're gonna run
malware, make sure it's isolated

700
00:33:56,660 --> 00:34:00,750
try something out, use
a junk computer, right?

701
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:03,280
It's something that you wanna
be able to dump in a dumpster

702
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,290
when you're done with it

703
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:06,058
and not have to worry that it's gonna

704
00:34:06,058 --> 00:34:10,550
wind up being someone's
lifeline in the future, right?

705
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:12,960
Throw that thing away when you're done.

706
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,040
And then within six
months, I really want you

707
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,529
to run a piece of malware.

708
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:19,033
Share what you learn, share it with me,

709
00:34:19,033 --> 00:34:22,480
send it to the Shield mailbox.

710
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,750
Send me a PDF.

711
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,721
Send me a word document
with macros enabled.

712
00:34:25,721 --> 00:34:26,760
I'll open it.

713
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,139
I promise I'll open it
on my MITRE machine.

714
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:30,339
No. Don't do that.

715
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:32,989
Bill is terrified now.

716
00:34:32,989 --> 00:34:33,822
No.

717
00:34:33,822 --> 00:34:37,699
Seriously run a piece of
malware if you're inclined,

718
00:34:37,699 --> 00:34:39,250
you will learn something about it.

719
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:42,469
Your guys will be excited
about the chance to engage

720
00:34:42,469 --> 00:34:45,449
with an adversary and learn
about some of these things.

721
00:34:45,449 --> 00:34:48,848
And seriously, share that stuff out.

722
00:34:48,849 --> 00:34:52,469
And share it with your organizations
and your localized sack

723
00:34:52,469 --> 00:34:53,560
and all the rest of it.

724
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,799
And I think you will
find that it's exciting

725
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,250
and you will learn something.

726
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,980
And, Bill, do you have any final words

727
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:02,403
other than don't send me?

728
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:05,930
- Do not send us malware.

729
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:07,279
We are not asking for that.

730
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,973
But no, I think you hit it.

731
00:35:09,973 --> 00:35:14,310
It is approachable,

732
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:18,250
we're approachable and we wish you luck.

733
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:20,550
- Yeah. And yeah.

734
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:21,383
Go RSA.
