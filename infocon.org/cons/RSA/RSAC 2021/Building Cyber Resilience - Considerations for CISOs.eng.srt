44
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:00,200
I've been with the bank

45
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,000
I used to work at Deloitte

also acknowledged and recognized
in this field as well.

66
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,409
I'm also a co-founder

- Thank you, Abeer. Biju.

79
00:03:48,692 --> 00:03:50,963
- Salaam aleikum and good
afternoon everyone at RSAC.

80
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,320
I've been in the field of cyber security

81
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,700
at a number of design
operations, leadership roles

82
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,269
across multiple sectors
for the past two decades.

83
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:01,970
So at about 13 years, I've
been in the aviation sector.

84
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:04,370
I've also had the privilege
of being associated

85
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:07,887
for the past few years with
regional sector advisory groups

86
00:04:07,887 --> 00:04:10,250
for the likes of Gartner,
Palo Alto, McAfee,

87
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,990
Heriot-Watt university MPCs to name a few.

88
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:15,440
Having spent a good
number of years setting up

89
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,399
and heading the cybersecurity
program at the airport.

90
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,950
I currently head up
infrastructure technology

91
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:24,500
and operations function, and
I spent a considerable amount

92
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,810
of time now planning and
enhancing security and resilience

93
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:31,223
around the IT/OT
ecosystems back your Tamer.

94
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,520
- Thank you very much our dear panelists.

95
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,120
It gives me great pleasure to
moderate this session for you

96
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,340
and I'm really looking
forward to share with you

97
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:42,030
a lot of insights and a
lot of discussions around

98
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:43,659
cybersecurity resilience.

99
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,800
As you are aware in our discussion today

100
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:50,170
we are going to be asking you questions

101
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:53,120
and we hope that we get
the answers from you

102
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,063
but feel free at any point of time

103
00:04:55,063 --> 00:04:57,311
if you would like to comment
on any of these questions.

104
00:04:57,311 --> 00:04:59,419
I'll start with Abeer if you don't mind.

105
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:02,320
My first question is going to be,

106
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,183
as one of the leaders in a renown bank,

107
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:08,890
can you share with us some insights

108
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:13,800
on how NBE is transforming
its cyber resilience program

109
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,660
and what challenges a CSO can face

110
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,693
during this ongoing transformation?

111
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:22,550
- Thank you, Tamer for this question.

112
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:23,420
So let me start first with the challenges.

113
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:28,400
Of course, the constantly evolving threat

114
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,652
landscape is the primary
challenge we face here.

115
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:35,130
Digital transformation in banking means

116
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:36,850
that you offer your services

117
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:39,740
to your customers via
multiple channels today

118
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:44,740
from the internet to mobile,
to new disruptive technologies

119
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:47,470
like blockchain based applications

120
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:50,270
that we are starting to recently use

121
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:54,260
for remittance transfer
to electronic wallets

122
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:57,990
that we outsource to
FinTech companies to manage.

123
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:01,220
In addition, of course,
now to open banking

124
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:03,610
where you have to integrate

125
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:06,990
with several third-party systems.

126
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:09,200
So there are no borders anymore

127
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,373
and the attack surface
is constantly widening.

128
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:16,330
You find that you as a
financial institution

129
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:20,770
you are targeted also by also
it's all the threat actors,

130
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:23,740
the organized criminals
that are behind the money,

131
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:26,650
banks, the skilled hackers

132
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:28,950
certain Nation States as well, of course,

133
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:32,630
being a National bank and
even hacktivists, you know

134
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:35,159
in Egypt during the couple of revolutions

135
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,910
that we pass through in the past years,

136
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:43,910
banks would be regularly
targeted even by DDoS attacks

137
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,590
from groups like Anonymous
and hacktivist groups.

138
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:51,150
So in addition to those
threats, we find also

139
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:56,150
that normal to any organization
irrespective of its industry

140
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:59,719
we're also faced with
the most common threats

141
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,210
like the malware, the
phishing, the ransomware

142
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:08,210
as well as the insider threats
that is often overlooked

143
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,830
when in fact it can have the most damaging

144
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:14,390
financial impact and financial loss.

145
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:17,530
So this necessitates that as a bank

146
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:19,570
we maintain and constantly

147
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:24,320
evolve also our cyber
resilience program accordingly.

148
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,860
So in addition to paying special attention

149
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:30,450
to enhancing our threat
detection capabilities

150
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:35,450
and constantly updating our
user and customer awareness

151
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,960
on how to deal with those evolving threats

152
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,580
we are also ensuring that
we have an effective defense

153
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:45,840
in depth strategy effectively
implemented in place

154
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,210
to guard against a
possible control failure

155
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:53,640
at any one layer and also
to minimize the impact

156
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,913
in case of an incident.

157
00:07:55,830 --> 00:08:00,830
Also as our ISO 27 001
certification mandates

158
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:04,340
we also ensure continuous improvement

159
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:08,219
in our incident response capabilities

160
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,990
and emphasizing applying preventative

161
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:15,973
not only corrective actions in
case of any control failure,

162
00:08:17,893 --> 00:08:21,130
and other important factor
that we pay attention to

163
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:24,140
is measuring actually the effectiveness

164
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:26,772
and improvement of our program.

165
00:08:27,635 --> 00:08:31,099
This is key, which is
also reported regularly

166
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,913
to management and the
board to keep them aligned.

167
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:36,372
- Brilliant, brilliant.

168
00:08:36,373 --> 00:08:39,610
I think Abeer plenty of of takeaways

169
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:41,090
from the answer to this point.

170
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:42,370
And I couldn't agree more,

171
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:45,070
I think specifically when we talk

172
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:47,540
from financial services institutions

173
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,310
the threat landscape is pretty wide.

174
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:52,880
And I think you've highlighted
a lot of key points

175
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,900
in terms of the
effectiveness of the program

176
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:58,836
and the importance of looking at all

177
00:08:58,836 --> 00:09:01,810
the cybersecurity capabilities
and implementing them

178
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:07,390
to be up there with the leading practices.

179
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:09,360
Which takes me actually
to the next question

180
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,857
to Dr. Reem and from a previous CSO

181
00:09:13,857 --> 00:09:16,390
and the current digital
transformation leader

182
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:19,540
in Kuwait Oil Company, which
is a company that takes care

183
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:23,550
of the National GDP and
contributes significantly

184
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:25,402
into the national economy of Kuwait.

185
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:31,567
How would you define the
cyber resilience program

186
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:34,416
for such an organization?

187
00:09:34,417 --> 00:09:36,560
And what do you think
are the key challenges

188
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,319
you face from IT and from OT perspective?

189
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,700
Because we know in the oil
and gas industry and probably

190
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,580
in other industries that
we will discuss later today

191
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:47,213
there's an IT and OT environments

192
00:09:47,213 --> 00:09:50,069
and maybe the cyber resilience program

193
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:52,890
will look into multiple level challenges

194
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:55,213
rather than the ones
just discussed by Abeer.

195
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,290
- Very good question.

196
00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:00,180
And I would retaliate and actually equal

197
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,839
with what Abeer has
mentioned from the threats

198
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:06,490
because this is being seen
to the financial sector

199
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:07,960
as well, as the energy sector,

200
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,713
as we are both highly targeted.

201
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:13,190
Securing this Kuwait Oil Company

202
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:15,650
which is seen as a national
critical infrastructure

203
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:19,340
contributing to more than
93% of our national income

204
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:22,460
is seen very critical and
full of challenges as well.

205
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,880
But as I always believe
where there's challenges

206
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,950
there's always opportunities
lays beneath them.

207
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:29,830
And so when we talk about
cyber resilience within

208
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,870
Kuwait Oil Company,
it's actually a journey

209
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:35,900
it's never a specific project
or a specific initiative.

210
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:40,069
It's about creating the
culture, embracing the whole

211
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:43,400
the three components, people,
process and technology

212
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:47,030
where you will be ensuring
thaT address all of these

213
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:51,360
with the mindset of a CSO and
a business partner as well.

214
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,243
And this is what we
have been always looking

215
00:10:53,243 --> 00:10:56,150
into building that cyber
resilience and compatibility.

216
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:59,520
And to making our
culture, being cyber aware

217
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,620
and being able to react
because as we all know

218
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:06,210
it's never a question
of, will we be attacked?

219
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:07,600
It's a matter of when.

220
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,450
And that's, when is really
the measure of our readiness

221
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:14,090
in a case in our energy sector

222
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:19,090
where we need always to be and resilience

223
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:23,124
towards planning,
implementing, and of course

224
00:11:23,124 --> 00:11:28,124
reacting within time and
minimizing the impact.

225
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:31,400
This cannot be done
within one day or a night

226
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,720
or within a specific initiative.

227
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,980
It's an ongoing journey,
which we have started

228
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:39,870
with KOC and actually
within our whole oil sector.

229
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:42,980
And we made sure that such challenges

230
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:47,220
when it comes to IT and
OT where cybersecurity

231
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,193
have a different level of impact.

232
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:54,950
We are very aware of that in
OT the cyber risks stretches

233
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:57,820
its physical arm to impact not only data,

234
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:02,680
not only let's say a loss of
dignity or even confidentiality

235
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,810
we have impact on people's safety

236
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:06,300
and sometimes on people lives.

237
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,890
We have seen that in the energy sector,

238
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:09,720
we have seen that in health sector.

239
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,100
So with this big challenges of securing

240
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,420
such critical assets,
it comes to integrate

241
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,563
rather than convert the IT.

242
00:12:18,577 --> 00:12:19,410
With IT we need to integrate,

243
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:21,420
we need to have a common
language between both

244
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,670
and this is where it
comes the partnerships

245
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:26,810
very important as a critical factor.

246
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:29,420
With that common practice
we should be having a common

247
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:32,260
language with having a
cyber aware collectively

248
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:35,290
in both environments, we will
be able to become resilient

249
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:38,490
and we always thrive toward
building that continuously.

250
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:41,920
So it's a continuous journey
and it takes the whole team

251
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,020
to work collectively toward that

252
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,490
and takes a lot of initiatives

253
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:47,923
and a lot of collaboration
and the benefit.

254
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,229
- Couldn't agree, more doctor.

255
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:53,350
And thank you for saying this actually,

256
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:56,010
the point of collaboration
and the importance

257
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:59,680
of collaboration as part of
any cybersecurity program

258
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,113
and of course, cyber resilience programs

259
00:13:02,113 --> 00:13:04,290
is of an extreme importance

260
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:06,959
because we all know that from
cybersecurity perspective

261
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:11,960
it takes only one key weakness
to break the entire chain.

262
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:17,650
So, with that said I would
like to ask Arwa a question

263
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,220
in relation to that sort of
communication and collaboration

264
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:25,660
as part of the telecommunication
industry and as a director

265
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:30,400
of a major telecom
establishment Arwa like SDC

266
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,930
which is aimed at connecting
people, loved ones

267
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:36,530
at the professional level
and at the personal level.

268
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:40,490
What strategies have you found effective

269
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:45,490
to enforce cybersecurity
programs and to make sure

270
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:48,440
that such cybersecurity
programs are addressing

271
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,333
targeted and emerging threats?

272
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,590
- Okay, thank you so
much for your question.

273
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:55,370
First of all, I would like to talk about

274
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:56,780
telecommunication sector

275
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,930
and how they play a vital role

276
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:02,560
especially we saw that evident
in the COVID-19 pandemic.

277
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,670
So can you imagine the
pandemic without internet?

278
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:09,079
So this brings me to a question,
how old is the internet?

279
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,620
The internet has started in 1983,

280
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,330
so it's two years older than me,

281
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:15,003
so I consider its still young.

282
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:19,290
It's 38 years old and let
me give you a brief history

283
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:21,689
about telecommunication and Saudi Arabia.

284
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:26,140
So landlines, they were
born way before I was born

285
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:28,960
and currently I believe
they are endangered species

286
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,510
because the new kid on
the block, mobile lines

287
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:34,069
have came to the world.

288
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:39,070
And that came in 1995, I was
10 years old at that time.

289
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:44,040
And currently the number of
mobile connections are 116%

290
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:49,040
of the Saudi population, then
came the internet in 1999

291
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:52,400
and that transformed our world.

292
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,000
I remember I was at
high school at that time

293
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,620
and I remember the first
internet card that I bought

294
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,930
I was really struggling how to use it.

295
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:01,699
I actually, at one point put it

296
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,400
in the floppy disk
drive, trying to use it.

297
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,250
And don't blame me Google
was not born at that time

298
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,270
so I couldn't Google it.

299
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:13,939
Then in 2011 the fourth
industrial revolution came along

300
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:18,940
and that was like, it brought
this new trendy word, digital

301
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:23,040
it's physical world with the digital world

302
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:28,040
blending together and that made
a lot of things more easier

303
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:31,190
as you see the financial
services, Abeer talked about

304
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:34,610
the oil and gas IT and OT
and different industries.

305
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:38,450
Even you can imagine that a
doctor can do an operation

306
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:41,260
from a long distance on a
patient in another country.

307
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:44,069
So this is the fourth
industrial revolution.

308
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:46,930
Looking at this history we
see that Telco companies

309
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:49,280
are moving from becoming Telco companies

310
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:52,000
to digital companies
because they need to adapt

311
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,800
to this digital transformation

312
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,780
and they need to enable it,
take it as an opportunity.

313
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:59,980
And this is what is called
organizational resilience.

314
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:04,250
So you have to prepare for,
anticipate any disruptions

315
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,840
and make sure that you
take the opportunity

316
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:10,371
to be able to survive and prosper.

317
00:16:10,371 --> 00:16:14,370
As STC named one of the
top 100 digital companies

318
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:18,380
as per Forbes we take
resiliency seriously.

319
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,670
At the top level of the organization

320
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:23,160
it's on the agenda of
the board of directors.

321
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,579
So we talk about people
resiliency, leadership resiliency

322
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:30,390
projects resiliency, and
cyber security resiliency.

323
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:32,859
If we look at the cybersecurity resiliency

324
00:16:32,859 --> 00:16:35,830
the most effective strategies
as per your question

325
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:40,790
is three steps I believe the
first one is having the mindset

326
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:44,630
make it expensive and
difficult and being prepared.

327
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:47,120
And I think my colleagues
Abeer and Dr. Reem

328
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,290
they touched about this,
but let me take you

329
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:51,329
in a bit details in each one of them.

330
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:53,500
So having the mindset, what does it mean?

331
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,420
You have to think like an adversary.

332
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:58,400
You need to always assume
that a compromise is happening

333
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,913
As Dr. Reem said, it's
not the matter of if

334
00:17:00,913 --> 00:17:02,540
it's the matter of when.

335
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:07,260
So, and we need to also
understand that the battlefield

336
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:10,140
so it's constantly changing
new threat landscape

337
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:13,589
in the region, outside the
region, and everywhere.

338
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:18,589
So and as you said,
it's an unfair equation.

339
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:20,800
The attackers needs to be right one time

340
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:24,319
however, us as defenders we
need to be right all the time.

341
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,290
So that's really difficult

342
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:28,690
we need to keep that in mind always.

343
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:32,090
the second aspect is making
it difficult and expensive.

344
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:36,060
So we need to know our crown jewels,

345
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,370
so what are we protecting?

346
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:40,489
What is the systems that are
doing the revenue generation

347
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:43,720
that has the customer
private data and so on?

348
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,130
And these are the ones
that we will invest in

349
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:49,100
and people, technology, and process.

350
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,580
And when I talk about to people

351
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:54,139
I say that the culture of the resilience

352
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:57,290
we need to have it as a
culture and people themselves.

353
00:17:57,290 --> 00:17:59,750
Of course, one of the
important points here

354
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,810
is we need to do cyber hygiene.

355
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:03,320
What do we mean by that?

356
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,530
We have been stacking up technologies

357
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:08,395
and you saw on COVID-19,
everyone was just racing

358
00:18:08,395 --> 00:18:11,090
to bring services live out there.

359
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:14,050
Was it given the proper
consideration assessments

360
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:15,600
from a security point of view?

361
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,490
We need to go back there, revisit them

362
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:20,390
and make sure that we
secure them very well.

363
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,740
The final one is being well-prepared

364
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,750
and I think they touched a lot about this.

365
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:28,000
So what we need to know
here is we need to know

366
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,430
how long it will take
us to detect response

367
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:33,200
and continue the operation.

368
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,330
Sometimes at the impact
of how the way you handle

369
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:40,139
the incident is higher than the impact

370
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,480
of the incident itself.

371
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,460
So we need to first understand
who are the stakeholders

372
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,740
internally, externally.

373
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:48,810
So externally, we're talking
about regulators, the media

374
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:54,700
other partners, and
alliances, and internally

375
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:59,500
we're talking about PR, legal,
CEO, board of directors.

376
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,660
When will we notify them?

377
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:04,220
When will we start ticketing the responses

378
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:06,560
and of course we need to
have after the stakeholders

379
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,260
would bring them together
we need to create our plans.

380
00:19:10,206 --> 00:19:11,969
A business continuity plans,
incident response plans.

381
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:15,940
We need to create some
scenarios to anticipate

382
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:19,650
what could happen and finally
we need to test our readiness

383
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:22,490
by doing joint drills, it's
not about doing it only

384
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:23,820
inside the organization.

385
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:27,389
So you need to also include
all the stakeholders

386
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:30,210
to be well-prepared and
take notes of the gaps

387
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,523
and fix them in a timely manner.

388
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,658
- Thanks a lot, Arwa.

389
00:19:34,658 --> 00:19:37,100
That's very comprehensive and I think

390
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:39,973
just said a complete set of strategies

391
00:19:39,973 --> 00:19:43,513
for all of the lessons,
so thank you for that.

392
00:19:43,513 --> 00:19:47,000
Biju, I would like to
ask you a question from

393
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,220
a bit of a different
angle, because you've been

394
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:53,420
playing a role from a CSO perspective

395
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:58,070
and also in the capacity of
operations and infrastructure

396
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,855
head at Dubai airports.

397
00:19:59,855 --> 00:20:03,140
And when these two hats actually put you

398
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:05,940
in a situation where you
can look holistically

399
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:09,510
at more challenges that faces
a critical infrastructure

400
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:14,220
that is constantly targeted
and one can imagine

401
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:18,390
in the aviation sector,
the impact is tremendous

402
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:21,450
if God forbid you are
faced with such attacks.

403
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:24,050
From your perspective and
considering this background,

404
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:26,419
what do you think are the
key challenges that you

405
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:29,070
have faced to keep your
resilience program effective?

406
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:32,370
- Thanks Tamer, and you
stated the facts right.

407
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:34,409
I mean, I did start and set up the program

408
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:36,200
at the airport and we do have a gentleman

409
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,080
who is heading up the Caesar function

410
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,629
and I head the operation function.

411
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:42,720
You have to understand the aviation sector

412
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,570
is no different when it comes to being

413
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:47,189
on the receiving end of
cyber threats and attacks.

414
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:49,160
In fact, it's also important to realize

415
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,873
and appreciate that the
sector facilitates not

416
00:20:50,873 --> 00:20:54,000
just the safe passage of passengers

417
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,410
as they go through their various
touch points in the travel

418
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:59,070
but also functions as a logistics lifeline

419
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:00,639
in the supply chain of essential goods

420
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,340
and medical supplies
through the cargo operation.

421
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:07,129
In fact, last year was a big highlight

422
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:10,330
of all of this when the
pandemic bought most other means

423
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:13,550
of transportation and life as we know it

424
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:15,430
to a grinding halt, yet air cargo

425
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:17,480
continued to operate uninterrupted.

426
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,330
All this means that, you know, any effects

427
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:22,560
of a cyber incident affects
not just the sector itself

428
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,149
but also nationally,
international interests.

429
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:26,690
The resilience of airlines and airports

430
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:29,220
and the associated
supporting functions is vital

431
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,470
in ensuring that this
critical sectors operations

432
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:33,372
works like clockwork.

433
00:21:33,372 --> 00:21:35,180
Many of the resilience programs are often

434
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:38,080
repackaged BCP and DRP activity.

435
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:42,710
What is often overlooked is
that a solid resilient program

436
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:44,733
effectively needs three core components.

437
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,740
Cybersecurity, risk management

438
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,800
and enterprise resilience,
and all that means

439
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,490
is that all of these three functions

440
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:54,550
within an organization have
to communicate, collaborate

441
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:58,180
and contextualize the risks and threats

442
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:00,920
to achieve the true resilience factors.

443
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,830
Our program are therefore three
intended key characteristics

444
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:07,379
that are the ability to
adapt to changing conditions

445
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:10,173
within our environment,
withstanding disruptions.

446
00:22:10,173 --> 00:22:12,630
When I say withstanding
it's more often effective

447
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:15,220
of ball pass but it quickly
bounces back much less

448
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:18,250
than have to pick up the
pieces and manage through

449
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:21,699
and the third one is to
ensure rapid recovery.

450
00:22:21,699 --> 00:22:23,630
And there are things that
we practice and aspire

451
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:24,990
to continue improving our own

452
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:26,900
cyber resiliency program at the airport.

453
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,860
A key tactical aspect that must be covered

454
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,790
is that we can't just
preach these objectives

455
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:33,200
within the organization

456
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,590
and expect the others to follow suit.

457
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:36,560
It's only, it's important that, you know

458
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:39,760
there is a right level of
governance, testing awareness,

459
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,790
and obviously the
technology support layers

460
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:44,409
that are put in place by these teams

461
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:47,210
but a key aspect of it is empowerment.

462
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:49,460
The security and the control
functions have to work

463
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:53,350
with an empowered group
of colleagues and teams

464
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:57,709
within the business to finally
get the intended outcomes.

465
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:00,050
And the last bit is,
the last point I'd like

466
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:02,020
to stress is the fact that, you know

467
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:04,260
there is a very important need to define

468
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:07,020
quantitative metrics to measure
and understand resilience,

469
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,389
targets, and capabilities.

470
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:11,790
Often there's a lot of
perceptions and assumptions

471
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:15,440
on what we need to do, on
what we are capable of.

472
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,510
We at DIA came up with a method known as

473
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:19,500
the resilient factor scoring system.

474
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,290
That helped us to scientifically assess

475
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:23,550
and categorize our critical
list, not just based

476
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:25,730
on the traditional RTO RPO aspects,

477
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:28,370
but also other dependencies
and capability parameters

478
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:31,219
around especially on the
people, process, and technology.

479
00:23:32,976 --> 00:23:34,211
- Thanks a lot, thank you, Biju,

480
00:23:34,211 --> 00:23:36,330
thank you very much for that.

481
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:41,330
Indeed eye-opening and I will
move now to the next question.

482
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:44,883
And in the next question, I would like

483
00:23:44,883 --> 00:23:49,719
to Abeer supported by Arwa
as well if you don't mind

484
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:53,030
to provide your inputs into this question

485
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:56,440
and it's going to handle
a different aspect

486
00:23:57,665 --> 00:23:59,300
of the topics that we're discussing today

487
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:03,240
and it will be specifically
to the, your thoughts

488
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,670
on the recent supply chain
attacks and the likes

489
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:08,860
of abuse of solar winds
by an Apt threat actors

490
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:12,250
and gaining access to
numerous organization

491
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:15,620
key infrastructure
assets even though those

492
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,949
organizations were having
cyber resilience programs

493
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:21,080
still it led to a breach.

494
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:24,409
From your perspective,
from a banking perspective,

495
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:25,730
and from a telecom perspective,

496
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:27,020
from your points of views

497
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:29,073
what are the key concerns and takeaways?

498
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,230
Abeer, should we start with you?

499
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:34,730
- Yeah, so as we mentioned earlier

500
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:38,170
the threat landscape is
evolving, but this time

501
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:41,100
in the case of the Solar Winds attack

502
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,899
the threat was not from an attack source

503
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,540
that you'd normally expect, but rather

504
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:50,889
from a trusted software that
you use to manage your network.

505
00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:54,959
However, for an organization
to be compromised

506
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,260
this meant that there
was a failure of controls

507
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,940
at multiple levels.

508
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:03,000
So it's one thing that you
get the malicious update

509
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,010
and another thing that it's activated

510
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:07,770
and this update is activated

511
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:09,760
and starts perhaps communicating

512
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,750
with its command and
control servers, which meant

513
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:15,510
that perhaps the solar
winds infrastructure

514
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:18,670
was somehow directly
connected to internet.

515
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:22,230
And the detection controls did not perhaps

516
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:24,620
detect the outbound traffic going

517
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,479
to those domains and block them.

518
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,380
So therefore impacted
organizations need to

519
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:34,530
revisit their defense in depth strategy.

520
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:38,149
And also the effectiveness
of applied controls,

521
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:41,960
check configurations, recheck
configurations of firewalls

522
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:46,210
and incorporate the lessons
learned from this incident

523
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:50,470
into their cyber resilience
programs and in such incidents

524
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:53,610
of global impact, organizations also,

525
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:57,543
I believe need to make their
management and board aware

526
00:25:57,543 --> 00:26:00,870
of this incident and their impact

527
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:03,679
and the action being taken to address it

528
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,143
in addition to any support that they need.

529
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:11,129
Many organizations I have
noticed in this particular attack

530
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:13,630
got compromised, and
perhaps they were not aware

531
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:18,220
they were compromised probably
because of limited internal

532
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:21,330
capability or insufficient
budgets that would allow them

533
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:26,330
to perhaps go hire a
forensics investigator company

534
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:28,460
to assess the risk they are facing

535
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,960
and whether they were not impacted or not.

536
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,790
I believe in such cases, I see
that the guidance and support

537
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:39,860
from national CERTs, Computer
Emergency Response Teams

538
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:42,929
should be provided to the smaller entities

539
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:46,080
who don't have the internal capabilities

540
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,842
to pursue the assessment of
the impact of that incident.

541
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,393
- Yeah, thank you, Abeer.

542
00:26:52,393 --> 00:26:54,187
I think you've covered
this question very well

543
00:26:54,187 --> 00:26:56,530
but I just like to add to it doctor.

544
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:58,560
Do you know that the supply chain attacks

545
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:02,220
have increased in 2019 by 78%

546
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:06,210
and two thirds of the
breaches are actually coming

547
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:07,960
from third party supply chain

548
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,810
or third-party vulnerabilities.

549
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:13,810
So the question is, can we
prevent, of course we can

550
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:15,679
if we stop working with third parties

551
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:19,320
and that's not possible in this
digital transformation race.

552
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,429
So if prevention is not possible

553
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:24,600
then mitigation as we need
to start lowering the risk.

554
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:28,110
So we need to put under the
cybersecurity microscope

555
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:31,020
all the aspects of supply
chain, any disruption

556
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:35,230
the people, the technologies,
even the manufacturing

557
00:27:37,044 --> 00:27:39,160
the reputation of the
supply chain that we have.

558
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,680
And of course, no one is immune

559
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:47,280
from cyber threats in this world.

560
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:50,110
Today's world, if you have cyber security

561
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:52,290
then this is a competitive advantage.

562
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:55,250
Last point I would like to
leave you with a question,

563
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:58,500
any attack or anything that
happens to your organization

564
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,270
you need to ask yourself three questions

565
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:02,830
or more than one question
based on your resiliency

566
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:06,980
or the matrix that Biju mentioned before.

567
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,220
Is it halting your business?

568
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:11,210
Is it stopping your revenue?

569
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:14,170
Is it's affecting your
reputation or brand?

570
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:16,470
And based on that and
based on the risk appetite

571
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:19,303
you can see how resilient you are.

572
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:25,020
- Thank you very much,
thank you Abeer and Arwa.

573
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:30,020
I will move now to the next
question to Dr. Reem and to Biju

574
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,250
and if you don't mind

575
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:33,690
I would like to start first

576
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:36,850
with Biju and then supported
as well by Dr. Reem

577
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:38,560
if you have something to add.

578
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:41,659
So Biju, my question is,
what are your thoughts

579
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:45,630
on emerging technologies
in enhancing cybersecurity?

580
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:47,960
How technologies like
artificial intelligence

581
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:51,610
and machine learning
will help the industries

582
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:55,620
in the future to improve
the cyber resilience.

583
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:58,780
And this is basically considering the fact

584
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:02,280
that emerging technologies such
as artificial intelligence,

585
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:06,889
machine learning, robotics will
provide a speed and accuracy

586
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:09,490
but will it have to
play that specific role

587
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:14,490
in cyber and as a CSO or as
a person who is concerned

588
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:18,450
with the cybersecurity of the industry,

589
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:21,023
would you consider that
or should we restrain?

590
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,980
- One of the biggest
challenges to tackle right now

591
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,290
especially with these
emerging technologies

592
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:30,950
is the fact that there is no
longer a definitive parameter.

593
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:32,790
I mean, emerging technologies

594
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:34,230
as is more popularly today referred

595
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:37,110
to as industry 4.0 technologies have truly

596
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:40,600
become game changers in how we approach

597
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,730
both the technology itself
and the cybersecurity

598
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:44,730
that's practiced around it.

599
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:47,487
There's also greatest emphasis
today on the fine things

600
00:29:47,487 --> 00:29:50,100
around the data itself, the ability to use

601
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:54,060
and reuse them and adapt it
to a more metaphysical realm.

602
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:56,379
It's important to understand that

603
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:59,110
there's also a lot more
emphasis on decentralization.

604
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:02,189
So as you see with the cloud,
you know, a lot of things

605
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:04,539
a lot of it moves away
from the traditional

606
00:30:04,539 --> 00:30:07,337
on-prem data centers and
with the likes of IOT and 5G

607
00:30:07,337 --> 00:30:10,170
we see a lot more of the
intelligence and connectivity

608
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:14,125
to the Edge, which historically

609
00:30:14,125 --> 00:30:16,460
I know if you take OT for
instance, so to have IOT

610
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:18,830
and 5G at your at your lower levels

611
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:23,510
within the typically isolated
and contained environments

612
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:27,180
it brings about new dimensions
of cyber risks and attacks.

613
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:30,850
So these are in fact not just
rewriting how businesses work

614
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:33,060
and in fact, if we just look
at our own personal lives

615
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,429
you know, that the little device that sits

616
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:37,970
in your pocket or your jacket

617
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:41,240
it's a mini supercomputer on its own,

618
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,280
you can do amazing
number of things with it.

619
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,800
You no longer require
this you know, room-sized

620
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,200
computing and storage power.

621
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,610
And all of this means
that, you know, the rules

622
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:54,000
of engagement now completely
needs to be redefined.

623
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,200
There is a bigger need
for agility, elasticity

624
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,810
and the reusability of
technology and data spaces.

625
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:03,820
And in fact, as the name
states, intelligence is taking

626
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,364
a much bigger role in
influencing outcomes.

627
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:09,430
For instance, take the
concept of the digital twin.

628
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:13,450
It now allows for a multidimensional
approach when it comes

629
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:16,220
to the likes of prototyping,
operations, maintenance

630
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:19,750
and support and training to
be done on virtual, augmented

631
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:23,000
or mixed reality layers
without having to undertake

632
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,180
the actual physical pain of
creating these components

633
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,820
or environments and most importantly,

634
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:30,990
without disrupting critical
production environments.

635
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:32,990
We've seen in the headlines
recently, you know

636
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:34,760
the talk about headsets, you know

637
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,650
the watch we've got like
the augmented reality

638
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:39,870
headset now helping defense forces

639
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:42,159
and the same is happening
in many of the critical

640
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,720
infrastructure when it comes to support

641
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:46,260
and maintenance, where
they were actually able

642
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:48,150
to have the complete
toolkit at their disposal

643
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:51,010
and along with the
capabilities of how to manage

644
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:52,900
support and maintenance.

645
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,840
Whilst the power of
machine learning and RPA

646
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,129
in cybersecurity has heavily been adopted

647
00:31:57,130 --> 00:31:59,870
in allowing machines to take over

648
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:02,479
the more time consuming tasks and learn

649
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,750
at the same time to
identify better patterns

650
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:08,050
of ways of doing these things
in these particular areas

651
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:11,110
especially in the areas
of security operations,

652
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:15,129
intelligence analysis, data
interpretation, and automation.

653
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:17,440
When it comes to the concept
of AI in cybersecurity

654
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,170
I'm going to be a bit controversial here.

655
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:20,380
It's still in its infancy

656
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:22,833
and it's often overrated and glorified.

657
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:26,790
In fact, my personal opinion is, you know

658
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:30,399
the broader uses of AI in
cyber today is mostly assistive

659
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:34,160
or argumentative in nature,
and much less artificial

660
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,710
to the true, you know,
sense of the word AI.

661
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:39,900
And we've seen a lot of this, you know

662
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:42,080
heavily in play, you
know, a more common use

663
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,290
of it in the technology
space the service management,

664
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:45,750
customer engagement, health care

665
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:48,130
or even personal technology
where we are seeing more

666
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:50,330
of AI being branded
along with the offerings

667
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:51,580
from these manufacturers.

668
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:55,480
Having said that, AI you know, not being

669
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,650
at the same maturity level of in cyber

670
00:32:57,650 --> 00:33:00,150
as with other domains is
not always a bad thing.

671
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:02,360
Considering the amount of
ongoing research and development

672
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:05,439
in AI it will only help
us in getting a much more

673
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,760
mature capability and the
product to the way we apply it

674
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:12,563
in cyber, because cyber, as you know

675
00:33:12,563 --> 00:33:16,380
demands a high level of accuracy
and fidelity when it comes

676
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:18,993
to decision-making across
the different disciplines.

677
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:23,350
You know, with regards
to the use of cyber ML,

678
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:26,100
AI, RPA in cyber resilience practices

679
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,169
to be more specific to your question

680
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:31,040
today, you know, I see this
as a much increased role

681
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:34,750
an involvement for RPA machine
learning coming into play

682
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:37,620
when it comes to automating
and orchestrating

683
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:42,459
more of the time and
sequence sensitive tasks.

684
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,860
And that's being done in
a more intelligent manner

685
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:46,959
eliminating the need
for humans to intervene

686
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,470
and in fact, you know, allowing for small

687
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:53,210
and mid category disruptions
to have self responding

688
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:56,470
and in many ways
self-healing to be initiated.

689
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:58,720
However, when it comes to
the bigger disruptions,

690
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,780
you know, both AI and ML will
only play a coexisting role

691
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:04,480
at this point of time
because you still need

692
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,530
the human to intervene and
just to close off on this

693
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:10,630
response in the real world
and a very simplistic analogy,

694
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:14,900
it's very pretty close to where
autonomous driving is today

695
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,530
when it comes to smart cars where the role

696
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:18,983
of the humans to control moves out.

697
00:34:21,795 --> 00:34:26,530
- Yeah, so I believe Biju
it's about this point of time.

698
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:31,530
It's about how mature these
sort of technologies are

699
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,760
in terms of supporting the cyber,

700
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,330
in terms of supporting the cyber mandate

701
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:37,929
and your opinion at this point of time

702
00:34:37,929 --> 00:34:40,889
it's augmenting rather
than taking the lead.

703
00:34:40,889 --> 00:34:44,239
So you are actually
encouraging CSOs to consider

704
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:46,259
but making sure as well
that it's not replacing

705
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:48,179
basically the human
aspect because it's still

706
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:50,350
something that we need.

707
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:53,650
Thank you for that, I personally
do agree with that view

708
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:56,280
without of course, many models in the role

709
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,980
of these technologies is going to have

710
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:00,150
in the near future and Dr. Reem,

711
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:02,370
I wanted to see your
thoughts on this as well.

712
00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:06,950
And also I would add to that question.

713
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:10,680
Do you think that leadership
have a role to play in terms

714
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:15,319
of supporting CSOs and the
cybersecurity resilience programs

715
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:19,780
in this specific area or
in other areas as well?

716
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:21,970
- Excellent, so very quickly just to top

717
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:26,279
on Biju points, I'm very much keen

718
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,810
on supporting all his points because ML,

719
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:31,850
quantum computing even are
being used in the automation

720
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:35,240
and orchestration across
the cybersecurity domains

721
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:39,310
because now to have
the zero trust security

722
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:41,360
where organizations are implementing them

723
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,770
these can be their ways to do it.

724
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:47,080
From my own perspective
and our own experience

725
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:51,893
when we, within our SOC
operations, we have billions

726
00:35:51,893 --> 00:35:52,933
of events in the SOC and
for that to be filtered,

727
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,860
to be analyzed, this is
no way for a human job.

728
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:02,900
So instead of utilizing our people

729
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:05,200
into a labor intensive operation

730
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,120
or a bit of intense operations

731
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:10,210
we utilize them into a
more high value activities

732
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:15,210
and let the AI and ML produces
this job of operation order

733
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:17,850
and let's say very
straightforward functionality

734
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:20,250
that can be utilized to reduce the time

735
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:21,843
and of course, address
the shortage of skills

736
00:36:21,843 --> 00:36:23,319
that we have.

737
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,830
Moving to your very important question

738
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:27,420
about the leadership and their role

739
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:32,040
in the empowerment of
cybersecurity teams and resilience.

740
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,800
I have a wonderful
experience with my leadership

741
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,260
because within the full
support of this leadership

742
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:42,090
and the full understanding
of the high value

743
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:47,090
of cyber risk, cyber security
was before an IT imperative

744
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:49,800
where it was down at the corner.

745
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:53,510
However, today we are
becoming a business imperative

746
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:56,300
and we're right now in the
front end, in the center

747
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,620
what does this mean?

748
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:59,740
This means that the business is keen

749
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:02,399
and depending on us to secure their roads

750
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,250
and today being the digital
transformation leader

751
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:08,280
I am now leading that
role with these two hats

752
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:11,983
of having the mindset of a
CSO and enabling the business.

753
00:37:11,983 --> 00:37:14,530
And that comes with
the leadership support.

754
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:18,350
We believe always that having
a cyber security culture

755
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:20,603
doesn't come without any efforts,

756
00:37:22,469 --> 00:37:24,187
you need to re-engineer the process,

757
00:37:24,187 --> 00:37:25,549
you need to re-engineer the mindset.

758
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:30,320
And this has been done through
collective initiatives.

759
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:33,850
We have defined the level as a majors

760
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:37,720
of smeps where a key KPI
performance is MI impact

761
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:40,980
by our executives to our
cyber security sponsorship.

762
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:43,580
So having the sponsorship
at a very high level

763
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:46,203
from leadership will, of course,

764
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:51,480
it will drop down to all the other below

765
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,830
let's say, levels of employees and staff

766
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:56,630
as our leadership is
actually walking the talk.

767
00:37:56,630 --> 00:38:01,120
And by default everyone will
do the same if not even better.

768
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:03,460
And with that, it becomes
a cyber resilience

769
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:05,300
and the whole sector is being thriving

770
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:08,360
towards that resilience
and capability as well.

771
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,960
- That's brilliant then
I couldn't agree more.

772
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:13,760
I think doctor leadership
support is always a key aspect

773
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,550
to any successful resilience program.

774
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:17,300
Be it a cyber resilience program

775
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,560
or any other resilience program

776
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,913
within the organization as noted before.

777
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:24,980
So let me move now to the next question

778
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:27,370
and this is again with you Dr. Reem,

779
00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:30,130
so from collaboration point of view

780
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:32,530
and I think this point and the importance

781
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:34,420
of having the right
collaboration and partnership

782
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:38,060
you brought this to the
attention previously

783
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:40,830
but I want to focus from your perspective

784
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:43,110
how to form collaborations and partnership

785
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:46,770
within or outside the organization as part

786
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:50,220
of building an effective
cyber resilience program,

787
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:53,560
is going to add to the value
of the cyber resilience program

788
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:56,270
and what have been in your experience

789
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:58,630
the benefits of such collaborations.

790
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:01,310
And I would want as
well after you're done.

791
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:03,330
If the rest of the dear
panelists would like to add

792
00:39:03,330 --> 00:39:04,900
to this point as well.

793
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:09,610
- I believe collaboration
is a very important aspect

794
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:11,210
in our community.

795
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:13,460
We are always stronger
together and this is one

796
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:16,780
of the things that I talk
it and I walk it as well.

797
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:19,655
And again, in our sector we have

798
00:39:19,655 --> 00:39:22,980
our very success story where
we have built the trust

799
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,730
within our oil and gas sector.

800
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:27,150
And within that trust,
we have created a forum

801
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:28,810
where we share threat intelligence

802
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:30,340
and collaborate on that.

803
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:33,110
Collaboration in threat
intelligence sharing

804
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:35,750
and providing the capabilities building

805
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:37,480
and sharing the knowledge of

806
00:39:38,485 --> 00:39:39,420
and avoid reinventing the wheel.

807
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:42,610
Collaboration will always
give us the best added value

808
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:45,660
and being ahead of time other than the

809
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,500
other than the adversaries.

810
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:52,040
I recall one of the conferences
where in the Middle East

811
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:55,400
where one of the speakers,
and I think it was you

812
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:59,030
where you have requested
to create this forum

813
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:01,600
of collaboration, and
you had it as I wish.

814
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,210
Today, Tamer and I know
you are aware of that

815
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:06,370
we had forums of collaboration

816
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:09,250
with threat intelligence
sharing and breaking the mindset

817
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:14,210
of being Middle East, you
know, a little bit conservative

818
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:17,590
of sharing intelligence and
worrying about reputation.

819
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:21,110
Now we worry about our
security as one entity

820
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:23,980
and this is happening in
Kuwait as an Oil sector.

821
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:26,060
And again, it's also within the region

822
00:40:27,126 --> 00:40:28,380
of the GC of oil and gas sector.

823
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:31,130
So we have two successful stories

824
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:32,280
of sharing threat intelligence.

825
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,180
We have weeb and we have tech and weeb

826
00:40:35,772 --> 00:40:38,955
the added value of such
threat intelligence sharing

827
00:40:38,955 --> 00:40:41,870
where would this trust,
with this operation

828
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:43,799
and professional collaboration?

829
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:47,400
We have seen how we are
becoming stronger together

830
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:51,570
by raising the defense lines
and the defense capabilities

831
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:53,200
with all of our neighbors.

832
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,439
Again, when you are being
targeted as an oil and gas

833
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,360
your neighbors are being tagged as well

834
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:01,710
and this couldn't have been
seen without such collaboration

835
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:03,780
without such visibility.

836
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:05,880
As you know, this is a long journey

837
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,370
and we should not walk it alone.

838
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:09,420
We should always utilize
the network effect

839
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:12,040
and with that network effect,
with that collaboration

840
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:15,250
we will be able this
time to be one step ahead

841
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:17,960
of these adversaries,
and to be able to cope up

842
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:22,580
with this innovative lateral
movement by these criminals

843
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:24,830
and these nation states attacks as well.

844
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:29,250
- Excellent, thank you
very much, Dr. Reem.

845
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:30,430
Rest of the dear panelists.

846
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:32,720
Any other thoughts on this point?

847
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:35,200
- I'd like to what Dr
Reem said is amazing.

848
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,149
So we really need to build trust

849
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:40,270
and to have this kind
of information sharing.

850
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:44,130
There is a report that
has been developed and STC

851
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:47,070
has a helped developing with
the World Economic Forum

852
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:50,200
and other partners in relation
to information sharing.

853
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:53,549
So we stated, we found that
there are still challenges

854
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:56,810
and we have gone a great way until now.

855
00:41:56,810 --> 00:41:59,549
However, we still have
a long way to go there.

856
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:03,510
So there are some challenges
like the incentives that we get

857
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:08,460
from our regulators, there
are the geo political matters.

858
00:42:09,970 --> 00:42:13,169
There are also gaps in jurisdictions

859
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:15,830
and there are also gaps
in technology as well.

860
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:19,100
Maybe Biju also talked
about the ML and AI.

861
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:21,950
So we need to start sharing
in a way that it's anonymous

862
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:24,569
and you can share the data without feeling

863
00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:28,160
that this will harm your
reputation or it will be

864
00:42:29,493 --> 00:42:33,130
exactly, so there's no
competition in sharing

865
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:34,680
on collaboration cybersecurity.

866
00:42:35,850 --> 00:42:38,779
- Yeah, I'd just like
to add that you know,

867
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:41,660
along with the collaboration
and partnership

868
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:45,250
one of the key aspects is how
we communicate the context.

869
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:46,760
And it's very important because, you know

870
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:49,660
if you can clearly define
and articulate the what's

871
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:52,799
in it for them, what is at stake statement

872
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,490
very clearly the collaboration
partnership falls

873
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:58,350
through very quickly and
you'll see vested interests

874
00:42:58,350 --> 00:43:02,410
and you know, everyone wanting
to pitch in and contribute

875
00:43:02,410 --> 00:43:05,379
to getting that collective
outcome when it comes

876
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:07,930
to securing these critical infrastructure.

877
00:43:07,930 --> 00:43:10,002
- Absolutely, having skill in the game.

878
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:15,620
With that said, I would like
to ask you the last question

879
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:20,509
from my side if you don't
mind to summarize it into

880
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:25,510
the key takeaways from
our today's session.

881
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:30,140
I will go through the
panelists with us today

882
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:32,440
for each of you to give
me the key takeaways

883
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:34,850
that you will take from
the sessions today.

884
00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:36,272
So I will start with Abeer.

885
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:41,109
- Yes, so I think that we need
to take a holistic overview

886
00:43:41,110 --> 00:43:44,180
as you mentioned of the
cyber resilience program.

887
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:47,020
And I see that this is achievable by a CSO

888
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:48,878
due to the wide outreach the CSO has

889
00:43:48,878 --> 00:43:53,660
not only to senior management
but also to all key partners

890
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:56,000
inside and outside the organization.

891
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,470
And this allows for better
alignment and collaboration.

892
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:03,680
Another thing that I always
alert against is just

893
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:08,339
following a checklist approach
to implementing controls.

894
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:11,910
We should not do that because
we want to have a mechanism

895
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:14,640
through which we ensure that
controls are effectively

896
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:19,160
designed and are also
operationally effective as well

897
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:22,500
to fulfill the objectives
from which they are designed

898
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:25,303
and what we want and help
us achieve what we want.

899
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:28,920
- Thank you very much Abeer, Dr. Reem.

900
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:31,870
- So my main takeaways
is first to prioritize,

901
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:33,313
you need to know your crown jewels,

902
00:44:33,313 --> 00:44:37,100
you need to know your threat
landscape and work accordingly.

903
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:38,670
Second thing is to build your trust.

904
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:41,410
You need to have that trust
of circle whether it is

905
00:44:41,410 --> 00:44:44,359
within your peace inside the
company or within the sector

906
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:47,050
or even within the
region and the community.

907
00:44:47,050 --> 00:44:51,300
We need also, as we always
say, collectively smarter,

908
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:54,810
exponentially safer, we shouldn't
walk this alone and again

909
00:44:54,810 --> 00:44:57,100
always strive toward collaboration.

910
00:44:57,100 --> 00:45:02,100
The last point is about
building our capabilities

911
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:07,150
around the KPs the process,
people and technology.

912
00:45:07,150 --> 00:45:09,940
And of course, leading that to having

913
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:13,170
a cyber resilience culture
and always remember

914
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:15,690
that it's a journey,
it's never a one project

915
00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:18,390
or a certain duration,
it's a continuous journey

916
00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:19,962
that we work toward it.

917
00:45:21,490 --> 00:45:23,589
- Thank you, Dr. Reem, Arwa.

918
00:45:23,590 --> 00:45:27,720
- Yeah, I would my key
takeaways would be first of all

919
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:29,310
we need to look at the big picture.

920
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:31,210
So looking at the big
picture means looking

921
00:45:31,210 --> 00:45:34,420
at the internal factors, the
strategy and the big picture

922
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:37,360
which is the external factors
like the national agenda

923
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:38,750
regulations and so on.

924
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:40,470
So we have to put this all in mind.

925
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:42,950
The second one is
communication, communication,

926
00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:46,950
communication and they
say the biggest problem

927
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:48,660
or the biggest challenge in communication

928
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:51,470
is the illusion that it
has been taking place.

929
00:45:51,470 --> 00:45:52,939
We might be communicating

930
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:54,980
but we're not communicating
the right thing,

931
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:57,190
maybe we're not communicating
the same language

932
00:45:57,190 --> 00:46:00,700
with our top senior management.

933
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:03,890
So we need to always communicate
using and building a model

934
00:46:03,890 --> 00:46:07,430
of something that they
understand like an index.

935
00:46:07,430 --> 00:46:11,930
And also we need to keep
on reporting to them

936
00:46:11,930 --> 00:46:14,240
our plans, our achievements,
the threat landscape,

937
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,459
what's happening, the
news, and the headlines.

938
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:19,870
And finally, I believe
that the heart and soul

939
00:46:19,870 --> 00:46:22,430
of our any company is the employees.

940
00:46:22,430 --> 00:46:24,450
And what drives them is the core values.

941
00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:29,272
I believe if the core values
are going to be, you know

942
00:46:30,430 --> 00:46:33,009
embracing the resilience,
then this helped us

943
00:46:33,010 --> 00:46:37,540
as STC to have our core values,
dynamism, devotion, drive.

944
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:41,740
So we need to create a
belonging and this will return

945
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:43,700
with benefits that that's
people will help you

946
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:47,649
during the disruption times and drive.

947
00:46:47,650 --> 00:46:50,690
We need to have bold and
courageous leadership

948
00:46:50,690 --> 00:46:53,590
that set the direction
and enable the teams

949
00:46:53,590 --> 00:46:55,040
to execute and make decisions

950
00:46:56,630 --> 00:46:59,649
- Thanks a lot Arwa, Biju.

951
00:46:59,649 --> 00:47:02,015
- Right, we usually say the power of three

952
00:47:02,015 --> 00:47:03,990
is something that helps the
human retain things right?

953
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:06,549
So I'll start off with a few here.

954
00:47:06,550 --> 00:47:08,850
The first thing is do
not assume or perceive

955
00:47:08,850 --> 00:47:10,659
that you have the right people,
processes and technology

956
00:47:10,659 --> 00:47:15,310
capabilities to respond and
to manage disruptive events.

957
00:47:15,310 --> 00:47:17,683
So measure it, define it, and manage it.

958
00:47:18,546 --> 00:47:19,890
And remember the three CS,

959
00:47:19,890 --> 00:47:23,350
which is collaborate,
communicate, and contextualize.

960
00:47:23,350 --> 00:47:25,210
And another thing that I think that's sort

961
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:28,060
of echoed a couple of times
in the session is technology

962
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:29,830
in your organizations
is not always limited

963
00:47:29,830 --> 00:47:33,009
to just enterprise acting,
operational technology or OT

964
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:37,257
have if not the same role to
play, a bigger role to play

965
00:47:37,257 --> 00:47:40,520
and your ability and the
right for you to operate as

966
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:42,470
a critical infrastructure entity.

967
00:47:42,470 --> 00:47:46,270
So identify risks, define your
responses and manage them.

968
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:48,410
And the management has to
be cascaded all the way

969
00:47:48,410 --> 00:47:50,710
from the highest level of your board

970
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:52,440
and cascades and all the way to the floor

971
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:54,430
which is at the lowest operational levels.

972
00:47:54,430 --> 00:47:55,700
And at the more important element

973
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:57,089
which I've already touched
on my previous answer

974
00:47:57,090 --> 00:48:01,419
the empowerment aspect,
just having the culture

975
00:48:01,419 --> 00:48:02,529
without an empowerment
will give you no results.

976
00:48:02,530 --> 00:48:05,487
And then finally again
just to stress on this

977
00:48:05,487 --> 00:48:07,220
and you can never stress on this enough

978
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:10,020
a true cyber resilience
mindset and a program

979
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:12,040
is a pure amalgamation of cybersecurity

980
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:14,548
enterprises and enterprise resilience.

981
00:48:14,548 --> 00:48:16,720
And it's important that all
of these three functions

982
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:19,990
work hand in hand
transparently and cohesively

983
00:48:20,895 --> 00:48:23,130
to come you know, the desired outcomes.

984
00:48:23,130 --> 00:48:25,570
And let me leave you with this,

985
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:28,690
it's all about responding
rapidly and reacting gracefully

986
00:48:28,690 --> 00:48:30,690
when you have these disruptions. Thanks.

987
00:48:31,685 --> 00:48:32,977
- Thank you very much Biju.

988
00:48:32,977 --> 00:48:34,690

995
