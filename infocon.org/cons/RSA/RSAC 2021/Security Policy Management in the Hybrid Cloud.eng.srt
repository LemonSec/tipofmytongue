00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:04,250
- Hello everyone, thanks for
joining the presentation here

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:07,260
at RSA conference 2021.

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:09,110
Today, I'm gonna talk about

4
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:11,463
Security Policy Management
in Hybrid Cloud.

5
00:00:12,626 --> 00:00:13,879
I'm Sattwik Gavli,

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,763
I'm Director of Cloud Product
Management here at Tufin.

7
00:00:17,758 --> 00:00:22,200
Been helping customers with
their cloud migration journey,

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:26,320
cloud adoption journey
the last decade and a half

9
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,320
and right now, helping them
understand what the need

10
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:34,420
and value for security
policy management and cloud

11
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:37,523
to help solve some of
the security challenges.

12
00:00:39,256 --> 00:00:44,256
Today I wanted to start with
what are the business goals

13
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,837
or of a Cloud Strategy that customers

14
00:00:46,837 --> 00:00:48,253
are actually looking for.

15
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:54,300
We've gone past the whole
discussion about saving costs

16
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:58,440
and some other things, but
I think at the end of it,

17
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:03,440
if in 2021 you're gonna ask
anyone, any enterprise exact

18
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,730
why they are trying to move into a cloud

19
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:08,960
or adopt or invest more and
more in a cloud strategy

20
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,660
it's predominantly for
these three reasons.

21
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:15,220
Competitive advantage, make sure that

22
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:16,660
you have rapid innovation,

23
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,039
your time to market is quicker.

24
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,590
You wanna make sure that you
focus a lot more on customers

25
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:26,450
and helping customers resolve
their problems faster,

26
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:28,790
help them troubleshoot their issues

27
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:31,820
and increase your satisfaction as well

28
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,550
as get more loyalty out of them.

29
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:36,399
And then obviously more importantly

30
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,393
to capture the market demands.

31
00:01:40,554 --> 00:01:43,330
All kinds of issues in past on-prem

32
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:45,510
and non- cloud environments
we've seen across

33
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:46,790
in the last 20 plus years

34
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:51,170
is anything in terms of
customer usage fluctuations,

35
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:54,780
be it anything from seasonality changes,

36
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,436
in terms of the usage and traffic.

37
00:01:57,436 --> 00:02:00,410
One of the most important
advantages of cloud

38
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:04,380
is having the ability to
elastically grow as well.

39
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:07,729
Well that being the goal
for a cloud strategy

40
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:10,470
and the investments enterprises are making

41
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:15,470
the problem arises that the
customers also wanna implement

42
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:20,350
and make sure that their
cloud deployments are secure

43
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:22,930
but not at the cost of agility.

44
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:27,040
So the main goal is to keep or
maintain or increase agility,

45
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,040
but at the same time they don't
want to impact the security

46
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,359
or vice versa.

47
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,930
Unfortunately, customers
that we've been speaking to

48
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:40,133
or we see on a daily basis
do struggle with that.

49
00:02:40,133 --> 00:02:42,210
They do struggle to achieve that.

50
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:46,093
And the reason being a lot
of times they are depending

51
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:51,120
on a lot of the tactical
or the legacy practices

52
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,713
that they used to or
which used to be on-prem.

53
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,740
A lot of reasons why customers
have been unsuccessful

54
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:02,550
in maintaining security and
agility and end up choosing one

55
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,980
or the other depending on the organization

56
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:08,859
is because they have
not found the right way

57
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:13,390
of making sure that they
embrace the newer technologies

58
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:17,230
and go beyond the
tactical legacy solutions.

59
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,109
And obviously the other problem is that

60
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:22,660
when you talk about cloud, it's
spread out, it's fragmented.

61
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,600
There's so much disparity.

62
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,250
It's very hard to keep a good sense of

63
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,430
what's happening where?

64
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:30,670
who's talking to who?

65
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,619
what is connected to what?

66
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,140
So, if you look at some stats,
if you look at some stats

67
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,989
again obviously on the left side we see

68
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:41,990
while no surprises, 81%,
very high cloud adoption

69
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:44,070
in terms of the enterprises,

70
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:46,030
but at the same time on the bottom left,

71
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:50,880
you see 72% have security challenges

72
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,560
or concerns about the security in cloud.

73
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,000
Now, that's something which is concerning

74
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,610
when you growing and adopting
cloud at such a high speed

75
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:03,915
but at the same time security
becomes such a major issue,

76
00:04:03,915 --> 00:04:07,359
you know that there is a
problem that we need to solve

77
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,150
and we need to start embracing newer ways

78
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,560
to solve the problem.

79
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:15,850
If you look at the right
corner, top five, four out of

80
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:19,579
the top five are challenges
in cloud adoption

81
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:21,700
are related to security.

82
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:26,360
Be it anything from having
the security or governance

83
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,720
or compliance concerns
all the way to even having

84
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,480
the right security skill
sets to help with that.

85
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:38,130
Now, all these things are
actually creating issues

86
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:41,700
in terms of creating
challenges for the customers

87
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:45,990
and increasing the risk
in the cloud environments.

88
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:48,650
So, if you look at misconfigurations

89
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:51,429
as being a very common issue in cloud

90
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:54,170
which are causing cloud
security breaches in past

91
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:57,000
or majority of the cloud
security breaches we've had over

92
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,943
the last few years have been,

93
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:05,900
the reasons for that has
been misconfigurations.

94
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,789
And again, they're obviously a lot more

95
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:11,690
than these four reasons why
misconfigurations could occur.

96
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:16,790
However, I chose these
top four that I see almost

97
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:20,000
on a daily basis on a
very regular discussions

98
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,742
with customers as to why they
have had misconfigurations

99
00:05:23,742 --> 00:05:27,560
or they've come out with
some root cause analysis

100
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,620
which have been a combination
of these, one or two of these.

101
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:33,860
So, starting with
anything from human error.

102
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:38,860
Now human error could be by mistake

103
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:43,760
or someone who's actually
been notoriously doing it

104
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,210
as a rogue employee.

105
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:49,080
However, if you remove the need for humans

106
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,289
to make certain actions in cloud,

107
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:53,480
that itself would be helpful.

108
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,360
And we gotta leverage the
automation you get with cloud.

109
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:01,210
So, there a lot of
different actions in cloud

110
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:06,210
which by default, by the
nature of cloud are automated.

111
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:10,510
However, not a lot of organizations
are all adopting to it.

112
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:14,360
Something as simple as
not manually entering

113
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,710
or storing keys is a good example.

114
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:21,460
The other example would
be not manually needing

115
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:26,460
to configure certain things
or apply certain policies.

116
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,060
You can obviously have automation

117
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:31,310
when it comes to applying
policies in cloud as well.

118
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,760
That's one example.

119
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,550
The other one is lack of visibility.

120
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:36,680
Again, it goes back to the normal saying

121
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,963
you cannot secure what you cannot view.

122
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,860
Very, very often we have
two sets of customers.

123
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:47,950
One we speak to would
say, or two teams within

124
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:50,469
the same customer base would say, okay,

125
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:53,770
I am on the on-prem
side and I have no idea

126
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:57,340
once my assets are out into
the cloud, I have no idea

127
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:00,830
I have no visibility into
what's happening inside there.

128
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:04,550
The other side of the teams
are the security team sometimes

129
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,600
we're like, okay, we are used

130
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,340
to managing certain
security groups on-prem

131
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,940
but we have no idea right now

132
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:13,660
once it's behind a native
firewall, what's happening.

133
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:16,700
We don't even know if it's
compliant with our industry

134
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,393
as well as the company policies.

135
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,750
So, that's another reason without having

136
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,940
the visibility people end up
creating misconfigurations

137
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:29,940
and hence being more
susceptible to attacks.

138
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,503
The other reasons is,

139
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:37,845
if you think about the
way cloud has evolved

140
00:07:37,845 --> 00:07:40,271
customers have had different teams within

141
00:07:40,271 --> 00:07:44,140
a bigger organization
who have started building

142
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:46,020
their own cloud adoption

143
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,320
or cloud journey or migration journey.

144
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:51,260
They've been different
app teams who've decided

145
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,770
that okay we are gonna adopt cloud

146
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:54,000
and this is how we're gonna adopt it.

147
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,127
So, someone could be
literally a lift and shift,

148
00:07:56,127 --> 00:07:59,840
some teams have re-factored
or re-architected

149
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,330
to fit in a cloud environment,
someone's gone down the path

150
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:06,039
of containerization and using Kubernetes

151
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:09,440
all of them are so
fragmented in a hybrid cloud

152
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,700
that the reason or the
ability to make sure that

153
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:17,700
there's a standard or
comprehensive security policy

154
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,480
that gets implemented.

155
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,740
Or all these different teams
even though their path to cloud

156
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:26,240
is different are they
all using or adhering

157
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,100
to the same corporate security
policies in from one place

158
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,830
or one management system.

159
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:36,150
Is something that's not
happening very regularly

160
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:39,380
and that's again big reasons
for misconfiguration.

161
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:43,159
And the fourth one being
the lack of skillset.

162
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:45,843
I think this could be temporary.

163
00:08:47,534 --> 00:08:49,850
Today we don't have enough cloud experts

164
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:50,990
and within cloud experts

165
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:53,500
we don't have enough
security cloud experts

166
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,970
maybe 10 years from now we
may not have the problem.

167
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,530
People are educating themselves,

168
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:01,656
people are trying to learn
more and more on cloud

169
00:09:01,657 --> 00:09:03,600
and cloud security,

170
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,510
we might have in enough experts

171
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,910
and the skillset gap would actually reduce

172
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,380
in probably next 10 years or so.

173
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,930
But today we have that problem.

174
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:13,790
Today that has been a major problem

175
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:16,839
and again, not having
the right skillset means

176
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,300
you're definitely vulnerable
to making mistakes

177
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,439
which could be then correlated
to any of the other three

178
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,350
that we talked about, from human errors.

179
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:26,340
to not using all the native controls,

180
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:29,450
to not having the right visibility,

181
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:32,810
to not understanding the right
approach to take when it's,

182
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:34,632
you're part of a fragmented network.

183
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:41,640
I'm using these next set of
slides just to give an example

184
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:46,640
of how the lack of visibility and control

185
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:50,829
is what's been a big issue
that we've seen very commonly

186
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:51,790
with our customers.

187
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,670
I do feel that this is something

188
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:58,640
that keeps coming up very often

189
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,920
so I thought this is a use case

190
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,219
I need to definitely
discuss to kind of show

191
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:06,740
how it's affecting people
and how it can be solved.

192
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,950
Again, this is an example of
a hybrid cloud application

193
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:11,920
in a customer's environment.

194
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,890
And you've tried to simplify
it to the nth degree

195
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:18,600
to just carry our point forward.

196
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,080
But if you think about it,
a hybrid cloud application

197
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,940
is where you have different
application components

198
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,700
in your particular application

199
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:30,140
which are gonna reside on-prem

200
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:33,670
and the rest of them are
gonna reside in cloud.

201
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:37,810
Now, if you think about it the security

202
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:41,719
or the ownership of the
environments on-prem

203
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,430
and cloud are different.

204
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:45,430
They're two different teams managing it.

205
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:49,689
So, if you look at the team
that manages security on-prem

206
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,440
they're used to the
firewalls and they're used

207
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,990
to the next generation firewall

208
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:55,100
which is extending into the cloud.

209
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,850
So, while they have
understanding or control about

210
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:01,560
all these firewall and the
policies on this firewall

211
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:06,540
the security groups and
NSGs the network groups

212
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:10,030
that are in the next-gen
firewall, that's all great

213
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,620
but what beyond that?

214
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,600
There is a lack of visibility in there.

215
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,880
They have no understanding of
what's happening beyond that

216
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,290
and that's where, they feel that

217
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:21,689
they have lack of visibility
and hence control,

218
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:24,380
and hence feel that they don't have

219
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:27,380
the end to end information
to help them keep

220
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:30,163
that connectivity secure.

221
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:34,810
On the other side of
course, the cloud teams

222
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:37,500
they have limited visibility
of only the cloud environments.

223
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:41,780
And in most cases, it's also
only a very specific piece

224
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,949
of the cloud environment that they own.

225
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:48,950
In fact, even some other
environments within cloud,

226
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:53,360
or let's say if it's in a
different cloud, completely

227
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,870
even the cloud teams themselves don't have

228
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:57,490
all that visibility or enough information

229
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:01,190
to feel confident about securing this.

230
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:03,880
So, I think this is again very common

231
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:07,180
of why enterprises are struggling and how

232
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:10,540
it makes sense to have

233
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:14,689
a centralized security
policy manager of sorts.

234
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:17,490
Which kind of can learn
and understand information

235
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:22,490
and see the security policies
across on-prem and cloud

236
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,790
and within cloud, it could
be your entire cloud,

237
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:28,490
it could be your multiple
clouds that you have

238
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:30,003
as your enterprise,

239
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:31,870
it could be Kubernetes.

240
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:35,310
So, a Security Policy Management System

241
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:38,349
which can actually give
you all the information

242
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:41,433
is something that would
help in scenarios like this.

243
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:46,530
Now let's talk about another
scenario within cloud

244
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:48,670
that we're seeing a lot of companies do.

245
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:52,839
And that, we understand why
we having a lot of enterprises

246
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,390
are doing that there's a reason

247
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:59,700
a lot of enterprises
are thinking that okay

248
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,170
I'm used to this on-prem
I used to just put

249
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:04,229
a firewall right in front of my network

250
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:07,010
and that firewall is
all I needed to manage

251
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:09,810
all the policies I managed in
the firewall were good enough.

252
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:12,953
And once I did that, I
was able to get all the,

253
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:17,680
the confidence of securing
and implementing policies

254
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,060
for my security for the environment.

255
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,250
And that's what they're.

256
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:24,250
They're also continuing to
do when you put your assets

257
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,200
in a particular cloud.

258
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,290
But it's not enough, right?

259
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:34,069
You need that not so traffic information

260
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:37,710
and the security policies there
are important, that's great

261
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:40,140
but you definitely need
to understand a lot more

262
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:42,250
of what's happening inside your cloud.

263
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,270
So, think about the East-West traffic,

264
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:46,939
eSports communication, what's happening...

265
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,970
who's talking to whom,
what is talking to what

266
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:49,900
within your cloud.

267
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,750
That is very much important.

268
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:54,710
If you think about it
there's so many other things

269
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:59,168
like your database,
your S3 buckets kind of,

270
00:13:59,168 --> 00:14:04,168
your different policies within
the particular Intra-VPC.

271
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:07,860
It, again goes back to
the whole argument about

272
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:11,550
Inter-VPC versus Intra-VPC.

273
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:14,060
You definitely need the
visibility from both sides

274
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:17,359
to have enough information, enough context

275
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,350
to then make your decisions.

276
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:20,880
And obviously feel more confident about

277
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,980
how your security posture is.

278
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:26,480
I think this is another very
common scenario we keep seeing.

279
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,680
and as I said, it's an
easier fix sometimes

280
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,229
to just slap a firewall in
front of your on every VPC

281
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:35,720
but it's definitely
not a scalable approach

282
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,510
and it's definitely not enough.

283
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:41,960
You wanna definitely get
more information within cloud

284
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,760
as there are much more complexities.

285
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:47,960
Talking about complexities,

286
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,497
if you think about it cloud is just

287
00:14:50,497 --> 00:14:53,729
the whole adoption to
cloud is just bigger.

288
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,870
When I say just big and it's relatively,

289
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,610
it's not more than 10 years old

290
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:00,000
if you look at a lot
of larger enterprises.

291
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,310
It's only within the last
10 years that companies

292
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:05,339
have started migrating and of course over

293
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,850
the last five years it's been much higher

294
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:10,210
the rate has been much
higher and the last two years

295
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:11,960
the rate has been even higher.

296
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,830
But if you think about it,

297
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:16,160
it's fairly new, it's only gonna get more

298
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,660
and more complex from here on.

299
00:15:18,849 --> 00:15:23,849
The whole aspect of using
network for your security

300
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:27,210
or using network policies
or network security policies

301
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:32,010
for securing your network
or your cloud environment's

302
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:33,780
is not gonna be enough.

303
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:38,010
As time passes, more
enhancements in this field

304
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:40,460
or the technology of cloud evolves,

305
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:43,500
there are more
standardizations that happen

306
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,860
you're gonna require a lot more tools,

307
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:51,163
to manage your cloud in the
right and a cleaner fashion.

308
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:55,210
What does that mean, is
now you're gonna inherit

309
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:59,390
a lot of information, a lot
of different ASP components

310
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:01,910
within your cloud, which
you would then also need

311
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:04,939
to make part of your security posture.

312
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,850
So, some examples are
obviously the identity.

313
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:11,090
So, the IAM policies have
become really important.

314
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:13,740
So, when you think of
securing a particular data

315
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,100
in your cloud environment,
you need more than just

316
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:16,933
a network security.

317
00:16:16,933 --> 00:16:19,370
You need everything from IAM policies,

318
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:23,160
you need to make sure there's
API security and API gateways.

319
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,550
Think about managing those ones once

320
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:27,740
you start using things like service mesh.

321
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:30,280
You're using a service mesh
cause that's the right way

322
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,730
of doing it, that's the best practice

323
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:34,520
but then how're you making sure

324
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,270
that all of these different
aspects or components

325
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:41,180
that you're using to manage
your cloud are also adhering

326
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,170
to the right security policies?

327
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:45,930
Now, there are one way
of doing it is every time

328
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:49,250
you build something, every
time an application gets built

329
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,910
you start going and checking with each

330
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:54,680
of these components individually

331
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,449
and then try to make sure
there's a good correlation.

332
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:58,990
Or you could have

333
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:01,910
a centralized security
policy management tool,

334
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:05,230
which can help you, address all of these.

335
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:07,400
So, it's more of a manager and rail

336
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,710
where it's got all the security policies

337
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:11,849
that your company wants you to adhere to,

338
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:14,829
that your security team
wants you to adhere to.

339
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:17,220
And all you need to do is make sure

340
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:20,530
that you are in sync with a
security policy management tool,

341
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:23,030
every time you're building
a new application.

342
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:26,160
As long as you meet all
the security policies

343
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,569
as long as the tool tells you that

344
00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:31,169
you're not violating any
particular policy, you're good.

345
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:33,260
That's the right way of going about it

346
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:36,520
and that's the right way that
you'll only be able to scale

347
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,740
as the complexities in cloud goes high.

348
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,610
The other point I wanna make on this

349
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:44,703
is Multi-cloud and Hybrid cloud.

350
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:49,430
A lot of companies, again,
this is so common is,

351
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:50,820
we started with...

352
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:53,290
The company say that we started with

353
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:55,351
just having one cloud provider.

354
00:17:55,352 --> 00:17:59,160
We decided that we are only
gonna use one cloud environment

355
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,640
and that's it we're gonna
use a cloud provider

356
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,620
for all our cloud needs.

357
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:04,620
And guess what happens?

358
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:05,453
You're a large enterprise,

359
00:18:05,453 --> 00:18:08,330
you're gonna have some
kind of acquisitions.

360
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:11,120
And then you inherit another type of cloud

361
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,290
that you're not applying to work.

362
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:17,290
So, any enterprise which is
gonna have enough Multi-cloud

363
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:19,348
is absolutely gonna happen.

364
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:21,990
So, it's hard for you
to shy away from that.

365
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:26,250
In terms of hybrid-cloud,
even if it's only 10%

366
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:29,268
of your assets, even if it's 5%,

367
00:18:29,268 --> 00:18:31,950
there's gonna be awhile because before

368
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:35,633
a large enterprise becomes
hundred percent of cloud.

369
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:41,540
Until then, this complexity
of hybrid cloud environments

370
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,330
is going to persist.

371
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:47,250
So, that is gonna stay with
you as well for a while

372
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:51,270
and dealing with the
complexities as you interact

373
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:53,530
as you migrate some of your workloads

374
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:56,340
from your on-prem into
the cloud is something

375
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,889
that's gonna be very important.

376
00:18:59,165 --> 00:19:02,070
And obviously no one has ever heard this,

377
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:04,679
no one's ever heard the fact

378
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:09,680
that don't disrupt my
developer productivity

379
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:12,200
at the cost of security, no one, right?

380
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:17,200
Because we all know that we
are completely okay to impact

381
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,850
or become bottlenecks
when it comes to security

382
00:19:23,233 --> 00:19:26,643
at the cost of going
to market pretty late.

383
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:29,563
So, obviously not.

384
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:33,600
Like we started the business
goals for cloud strategy

385
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,639
is agility and making sure
we go to market sooner.

386
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,700
So, security cannot become bottleneck.

387
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,810
And hence, there are few ways
in which you wanna make sure

388
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:47,350
that you help the application developers

389
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:51,590
in meeting their goals of timelines

390
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:52,889
and going to market quick.

391
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,139
So how do we go about this?

392
00:19:56,139 --> 00:19:59,709
so, we've talked about some
of the things about having

393
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:03,060
a centralized security
policy management will help.

394
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:06,540
There also is the whole talk about how

395
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:09,290
you wanna make sure that
there's enough collaboration

396
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:12,240
between different teams
within your environment.

397
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,430
So, we've talked about...

398
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:17,980
we've seen things like developer

399
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:22,813
and companies who've
seen that look, security

400
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,173
is a shared model.

401
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,716
It was very well defined
over the last few years

402
00:20:28,717 --> 00:20:31,760
that when it comes to
security, unlike on-prem

403
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,840
where the security team was
in charge of the enterprise

404
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:38,990
is responsible for their own security.

405
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:41,820
Then things change once you
move into cloud obviously

406
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:44,300
we learned that it's a
shared security model

407
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:47,960
where it's shared between
the cloud provider

408
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,280
as well as the enterprise.

409
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,129
Your organization and it
could be the security team.

410
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:57,530
Now, I think the same applies
even within an organization.

411
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:59,129
So, even within the organization

412
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,410
like security team used
to be the only team

413
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:06,720
which was predominantly responsible

414
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,060
for security, that's changed.

415
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:12,250
When have adopted cloud and
you've adopted things like;

416
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:16,000
DevOps, Cloud Operations, CICD,

417
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,760
you have to make sure that
Dev teams, app owners,

418
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,100
application developers, Cloud Operations,

419
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,600
and security, all work
together in collaboration

420
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,040
when it comes to security.

421
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,350
So, if you think about it, the developers,

422
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:31,379
the cloud operations and security guys

423
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,100
they need to work together for security.

424
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,413
The challenge ends up being
when developers and CloudOps,

425
00:21:35,413 --> 00:21:38,910
they're not really
incentivized for security.

426
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:41,123
They're incentivized for agility.

427
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,280
When that happens, now your
priorities and incentives

428
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,703
are not tied together,

429
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:52,649
you have to make sure
that you have certain ways

430
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:54,300
to help that collaboration.

431
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,480
So, we talk a lot about shift left

432
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,730
so that security does
not become a bottleneck

433
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:02,290
in a CICD pipeline security becomes...

434
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:05,649
or we start security
very early in the cycle

435
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:09,850
from a developer perspective
so, security is in part of

436
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:14,750
your app building development
since the beginning.

437
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,780
While that is a great idea and in theory,

438
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:21,110
that's how it should
work, not a lot of tools

439
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:23,070
out there today are helping with that.

440
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:26,429
Not a lot of customers
are able to understand

441
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:29,090
how to adopt different
technologies out there

442
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:32,310
to actually help implement

443
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:37,310
a real shift left solution or approach.

444
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:40,093
I think some of the ways you
can do that is making sure that

445
00:22:40,093 --> 00:22:41,940
there's an automation

446
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:46,567
of developers always
having access automatically

447
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:50,950
to the latest and
greatest security policies

448
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:53,050
that have been created by security teams.

449
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:54,700
What that means is,

450
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,870
while development is
building applications,

451
00:22:57,870 --> 00:23:00,610
security is also constantly improving

452
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:03,659
and fine tuning their security policies.

453
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:06,960
If there is a repository or
there's a central location

454
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,070
where not only the developers
can constantly check

455
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:14,379
if they are looking at
or they are compliant

456
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:17,570
with the most up-to-date security policies

457
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:20,260
but also if the tool can constantly check

458
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:22,420
every time the development team

459
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:25,410
or application is adding
code for new connections.

460
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:28,440
If it is in compliance or not

461
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,590
with the latest security
policies out there

462
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:36,019
that will help you
really bring up a problem

463
00:23:36,019 --> 00:23:41,019
or alert the users with the
violations that this code

464
00:23:41,659 --> 00:23:46,450
is about to create much
early in the cycle.

465
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:49,190
So, their dev actually gets
alerted and knows that Hey,

466
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:51,490
you know this connection I'm
making in my dev environment

467
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:55,000
is actually not compliant
with my security policies

468
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,210
which are the latest security policies.

469
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:59,110
Now you have real collaboration.

470
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:02,293
Now you don't not only let
the dev guys really know

471
00:24:02,293 --> 00:24:05,739
at that very early scenario,
that there is something wrong

472
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,850
with the implementation
they're trying to do

473
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:10,830
but more importantly, it
is also keeping them up.

474
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:13,560
The security guys convinced
that the development guys

475
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:17,659
are looking at it at the earliest cycle.

476
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,980
I think that's really important

477
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:23,373
in terms of helping implement something

478
00:24:23,373 --> 00:24:25,663
that like a Shift Left strategy.

479
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:29,450
Again, if it's coming from

480
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:32,600
a centralized security
policy management tool

481
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,429
what it helps is it provides
you enough information

482
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:39,380
with all the context you
need across your network.

483
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:42,670
So, a lot of times you
can avoid false positives

484
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:43,730
if you see that, okay

485
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:46,560
there are certain connections
outside the environment

486
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:49,970
and it's not always bad
because contextually I know

487
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:52,440
and have visibility for the
entire hybrid environment,

488
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,110
so I can tell you that
while it has connection

489
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:57,879
to something outside, it's still

490
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,530
within the environment still make sense

491
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:02,490
or across the entire enterprise,
it still makes sense.

492
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:04,780
and it does not violate the security.

493
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:06,970
Now this is again, something possible,

494
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:09,930
if you have one security
policy management looking at

495
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:12,073
your entire hybrid environment.

496
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:17,380
So, we've talked about having
a security policy management,

497
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:19,430
having a centralized
security policy management,

498
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:23,000
across your cloud and
hybrid-cloud environment.

499
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,700
But if you have to sum it
up, the way I look at it is

500
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:31,230
it helps you accelerate
digital transformation.

501
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:34,160
The whole point is you're
trying to adopt cloud

502
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:37,730
as soon as possible so you can
reap the benefits of cloud.

503
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:40,810
But a lot of times, as we
saw even in the initial stats

504
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:42,879
it's because of the security challenges,

505
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,150
it's because not having visibility,

506
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:48,730
you end up getting slowed down

507
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:52,850
and adoption also gets impacted.

508
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:55,280
Having an ability which
gives you enough visibility,

509
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:58,040
having a tool which gives
you enough information

510
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:03,880
to continue and obviously add
automation helps you adopt

511
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:10,310
your cloud much quicker.

512
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:12,740
The second part I would say is economics.

513
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:16,410
At the end of it while
economics is probably not

514
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:20,160
the main reasons for going
into cloud in today's world

515
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,790
you need to understand
that cloud is here to stay

516
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,744
and it's only here to grow.

517
00:26:24,744 --> 00:26:27,629
So, you wanna make sure
whatever you architect,

518
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:29,730
however you architect your cloud today

519
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,800
and for future is
something that can scale.

520
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:37,800
Because right now the growth
is exponential when it comes

521
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:41,120
to the amount of workload,
people are putting inside

522
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,949
the cloud or moving into the cloud.

523
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:45,180
What that means is, you wanna make sure

524
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:49,340
you design a particular
architecture with a certain policy

525
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:53,639
which is much more scalable
and does not really increase

526
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,750
your costs or compute costs,

527
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:58,020
resource costs, exponentially as well.

528
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:02,213
So, things like not adding
firewall to every VPC out there,

529
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:05,780
using as much as native controls,

530
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:10,530
not adding new agents or
side cars onto every cluster,

531
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,533
every node, every part of
that is very important.

532
00:27:17,005 --> 00:27:21,790
Then most importantly having a
very vendor neutral approach.

533
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:23,810
You've got to have a
vendor neutral strategy

534
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:26,790
when you're building your cloud strategy.

535
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:27,812
Again, something like

536
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:30,980
a security policy management
tool, helps you with that.

537
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:33,150
The way it helps you with that is

538
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:34,980
as a security policy management tool

539
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,630
for your entire network,
entire cloud network

540
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:40,840
you can have as many
different types of components,

541
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:43,439
from network layer, all
the way to things like

542
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,170
a service mesh to API gateways

543
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:49,840
to using different types
of IAM policies providers

544
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,250
you can have different types of components

545
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:56,960
but you're not dependent on each of them

546
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,200
to actually help you
maintain your security.

547
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,660
You're leveraging as much
of your native controls

548
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:04,960
that your cloud provider is providing you

549
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,120
and the security policy
management tool you're using.

550
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,899
If it's a vendor neutral tool

551
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:12,830
what it will do is, it will
make sure that it works

552
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:15,399
with anything as and when
you adopt new technology.

553
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:19,050
So, it gives you that ability
to adopt any new technology

554
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:22,070
and be it your cloud
provider, or it could be any

555
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:24,513
of your technology vendors
that you work with.

556
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,600
So, in terms of a takeaway,

557
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:34,520
I think the most important point here is

558
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,400
I would like to make is,

559
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,550
if you are in a hybrid cloud strategy

560
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:41,590
which majority of the enterprises are

561
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:43,820
if you have a multi-cloud as well,

562
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:46,570
which again majority
of your enterprises are

563
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:50,179
you'll need to have a security
policy management for that.

564
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:54,490
So, this is where you're
gonna actually ensure

565
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:59,170
or have the confidence that
all your security policies

566
00:29:00,707 --> 00:29:02,650
are adhered to,

567
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:05,790
there's one place for
every application owner

568
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:07,889
in a fragmented network
to actually look at

569
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:11,000
and actually make sure
that they comply with,

570
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,800
helps you with meeting your dominance

571
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:17,659
and compliance that your
companies need to make.

572
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:20,900
The second piece is
visibility, is very important.

573
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:25,797
And as we discussed
firewall Inter-VPC beyond

574
00:29:27,031 --> 00:29:29,500
your firewall is very important.

575
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,640
It's very important to understand that

576
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,410
it's the East-West
connections which have been

577
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:39,410
the major reasons or major
modes of actual breaches

578
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:42,520
that have happened over
the past few years.

579
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,379
So, not having enough visibility

580
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:46,920
for the East-West communications
beyond your firewall

581
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,210
has been a big reason

582
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:50,850
for different breaches
across larger enterprises.

583
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:54,120
So, having that visibility
is very important.

584
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:58,219
And using your cloud native
controls as much as possible

585
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:01,600
is only gonna help you
stick to best practices,

586
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,929
have a cleaner security posture.

587
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:08,220
Because the cloud providers
are investing a lot

588
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,980
in making sure that they give you

589
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:13,350
the best practice tools and abilities.

590
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:17,689
So, using native controls
help you stay on top of any

591
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:21,570
of these security breaches
that can come out there

592
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:23,470
and make sure that you're on top of it

593
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:27,810
and your security posture is maintained.

594
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:30,763
So, I would leave you with that.

595
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:36,820
As I've been answering some
of the questions earlier

596
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:40,659
throughout I would encourage
if you have even more questions

597
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:44,270
I would love to answer them even now.

598
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:46,910
But, thank you so much

599
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:51,910
for joining the presentation,
happy to be here and talk to

600
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:54,970
and discuss security
policy management with you

601
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:58,191
again feel free to contact us

602
00:30:58,191 --> 00:31:02,097
if you need any more
information, thank you.
