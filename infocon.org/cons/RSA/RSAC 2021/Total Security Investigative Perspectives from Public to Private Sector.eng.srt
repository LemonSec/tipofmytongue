1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:04,890
- Hi, I'm Shawn Henry, the
President of CrowdStrike Services

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:07,779
and the Chief Security
Officer of CrowdStrike.

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:12,780
And with me today, I've
got two long-term friends

4
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:17,050
and colleagues from the
cybersecurity industry.

5
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:22,050
CJ Moses who is the
current Deputy CISO at AWS.

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,630
And prior to being at AWS,

7
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:30,660
CJ spent over 17 years in both the FBI

8
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,570
and as a special agent
with the Air Force office

9
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:36,203
of special investigations.

10
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,060
And Mary Galligan who is currently

11
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:41,893
the Managing Director at Deloitte

12
00:00:41,893 --> 00:00:44,590
where she's been for seven years.

13
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:49,350
Prior to that, Mary retired
after 25 years with the FBI,

14
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,520
her last position was as Special Agent

15
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,570
in charge of the Cyber and
Special Operations branch

16
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,013
of the FBI New York Field Office.

17
00:00:58,380 --> 00:00:59,850
Really great to be here

18
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,692
and with these two colleagues and friends

19
00:01:02,692 --> 00:01:05,071
as three former Federal Agents

20
00:01:05,071 --> 00:01:07,800
who are now leading organizations

21
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,399
in Cybersecurity in the private sector,

22
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,153
this session really is about
how we've taken our experiences

23
00:01:14,153 --> 00:01:17,300
and transition them over
to the private sector

24
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,255
from doing counterintelligence
and criminal investigations

25
00:01:20,255 --> 00:01:22,670
and counter-terrorism investigations

26
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:25,410
and certainly cybersecurity investigations

27
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:27,978
and the skill set and the expertise

28
00:01:27,978 --> 00:01:29,890
and applying them here

29
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:32,549
to look at these total security practices.

30
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:35,780
And how do we really
protect the 360 degree

31
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:39,646
attack surface that we've
seen develop in cybersecurity?

32
00:01:39,646 --> 00:01:41,096
I know when we started working,

33
00:01:41,096 --> 00:01:44,710
the three of us in the government,

34
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:47,369
we really were focused in cybersecurity

35
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:50,777
on website to face mentioned
denial-of-service attack.

36
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:54,024
That was really the flavor of
the day 20 some odd years ago

37
00:01:54,024 --> 00:01:56,949
and then moving into Theft
of Intellectual Property

38
00:01:56,949 --> 00:01:58,800
and Financial Frauds.

39
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:03,050
And now till today where we
see these disruptive attacks

40
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:05,570
like ransomware and destructive attacks

41
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:09,810
like NotPetya up into
and including the attacks

42
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:11,310
on critical infrastructure

43
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:14,670
like adversaries using cybersecurity

44
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:18,549
or cyber breaches to access
critical control systems

45
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:20,700
in hitting water supply companies

46
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,760
to change the chemical
composition of the water.

47
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,730
So really some dynamic changes.

48
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:30,820
I know Mary, when we've talked in the past

49
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:35,709
about what we did in the
government and that mission first

50
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:38,360
and it was always about
protecting good from evil

51
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,080
and how do we protect against the bad guys

52
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,631
and then we move over
to the private sector.

53
00:02:43,631 --> 00:02:47,800
And for me, it was a bit of a
different in terms of culture.

54
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,250
I'm wondering your thoughts
about moving over to Deloitte,

55
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,900
based on what you've
done in the government

56
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:56,360
and then how you balance that and inspire

57
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,653
and invoke that same sense
in the private sector.

58
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,840
- Well, Shawn, I think
when you talk about culture

59
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,720
there was the culture for me, of Deloitte

60
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:09,126
of very large accounting
and consulting company

61
00:03:09,126 --> 00:03:11,520
and then the culture of our clients,

62
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,070
the ones that we were going out

63
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:15,329
or we still go out to and talk

64
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:17,900
and deal with cyber risks for them.

65
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:21,020
I think across the board, the
biggest cultural difference

66
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:25,480
between the private sector and
the government that saw was

67
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,250
the use of intelligence.

68
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,780
The understanding of who the adversary is,

69
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:34,480
what is that national security threat

70
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,450
and what could I have that
any nation state would want.

71
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:40,209
So we're seeing a big difference

72
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:44,020
in people trying to understand
now that attribution

73
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,561
or that threat to our economy

74
00:03:46,561 --> 00:03:49,230
but when I first came to Deloitte

75
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,375
and working with our clients,

76
00:03:50,376 --> 00:03:52,360
I think that was the biggest difference.

77
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,704
Intelligence reviewing and CJ

78
00:03:54,704 --> 00:03:57,445
was just part of our conversation,

79
00:03:57,445 --> 00:04:00,260
sharing information across agencies,

80
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,040
part of what we did every day.

81
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,670
And so now in the private sector,

82
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:07,224
you see that conversation ongoing,

83
00:04:07,224 --> 00:04:09,090
how to share that information,

84
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:10,800
how to work with the government

85
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,447
and how to use intelligence
and make it actionable.

86
00:04:14,447 --> 00:04:18,420
So I think that's the
biggest change, Shawn.

87
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:21,076
- CJ, just carry on that.

88
00:04:21,076 --> 00:04:24,179
When you and I were working
back in the early 2000s

89
00:04:24,179 --> 00:04:27,849
there was a lot of effort
against some nation States.

90
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,974
Nobody in the private sector
was talking nation state.

91
00:04:29,974 --> 00:04:32,248
We were seeing nation States targeting

92
00:04:32,249 --> 00:04:33,513
the defense industrial base

93
00:04:33,513 --> 00:04:35,453
and government organizations.

94
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,170
So two points I think, one,

95
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:42,700
Mary's point about intelligence,
how do we use that?

96
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,950
And then take that when
you move over to AWS,

97
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:48,760
those same types of processes

98
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,260
but also the same thing about culture

99
00:04:51,261 --> 00:04:52,978
and how do people feel about it,

100
00:04:52,978 --> 00:04:55,810
based on you have such
an important mission,

101
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:57,080
protect critical infrastructure

102
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,291
from foreign governments at AWS.

103
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:01,200
How does that translate?

104
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,159
- So it translates quite well.

105
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,865
I think the difference is that

106
00:05:05,865 --> 00:05:09,810
from the government perspective
versus a private sector

107
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,700
a lot of times in the private sector,

108
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:16,250
I think for a good bit of
time companies didn't accept

109
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:22,113
that nation States or others
were actually out to get them

110
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:24,440
where in the government
there was never any doubt

111
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,620
that that was the case.

112
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:31,326
So once you have verified
threats via threat Intel

113
00:05:31,326 --> 00:05:35,319
or actual attacks like
we've seen quite a bit

114
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:38,033
in the last six months or so.

115
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:43,530
Security cultures are deriving off that,

116
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:45,611
the idea that in the case of AWS,

117
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:47,685
we've been very lucky
to have security culture

118
00:05:47,685 --> 00:05:49,032
for a number of years.

119
00:05:49,032 --> 00:05:52,440
I've been there 13 years and
it was there when I got there.

120
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,150
But the idea of putting security

121
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:58,580
is the highest priority in our case

122
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:01,282
And using the intelligence sets

123
00:06:01,283 --> 00:06:03,600
that's gathered using the things

124
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,967
that we learn along the way to make sure

125
00:06:06,968 --> 00:06:10,091
that our businesses
and the business owners

126
00:06:10,091 --> 00:06:12,540
are aware of those threats

127
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,940
because quite honestly that ownership

128
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:18,240
of the business drives those owners,

129
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,570
the business leaders to actually secure

130
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,180
their space, rather than it having to be

131
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:27,306
a security specific function,

132
00:06:27,306 --> 00:06:29,450
it's actually part of the core business.

133
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:31,979
And that's what you want
in a security culture.

134
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:34,915
If you want strong ownership
from the business owners

135
00:06:34,915 --> 00:06:37,770
and those business owners will vector,

136
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:41,349
based upon a dynamic information
that's presented to them.

137
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:42,919
So just as Mary was saying,

138
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:46,169
taking that, what we would
call threat intelligence,

139
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:48,603
turning it into real
actionable types of things

140
00:06:48,603 --> 00:06:51,780
that can be done, making
sure things are patched

141
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:56,347
along those lines are the types of things

142
00:06:56,347 --> 00:06:58,977
in the private sector
using that threat Intel

143
00:06:58,978 --> 00:07:01,750
or what we used to just call
intelligence in the government

144
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,350
and turning it into actionable things

145
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:07,140
that the business owners can go ahead

146
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:10,361
and vector and make sure
that we maintain privacy

147
00:07:10,362 --> 00:07:12,100
of the information that we have.

148
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:18,180
- Yeah, you do have a
really interesting model.

149
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:21,820
I think I know what the
philosophy is behind security.

150
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,180
I think in our company in security first,

151
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,950
always top of mind.

152
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:29,039
But when I think about dealing
with the private sector

153
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,320
a lot of the companies I've dealt with,

154
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:35,197
unless they understand and
appreciate the real risk,

155
00:07:35,197 --> 00:07:37,153
I don't know that they always understand

156
00:07:37,153 --> 00:07:38,854
the need to focus on security.

157
00:07:38,854 --> 00:07:41,575
And when I think about
folks that are mid level,

158
00:07:41,576 --> 00:07:43,410
that are fighting the fight every day

159
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:44,360
they certainly get it

160
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,280
because they're dealing
with a day in and day out.

161
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,974
How do you, Mary, communicate that

162
00:07:49,974 --> 00:07:51,810
when you're in those
customer environments,

163
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:54,000
how do you communicate
that same sense of passion

164
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,945
and mission to those executives there?

165
00:07:57,945 --> 00:08:00,740
- Shawn, when I deal
with C-suites or boards

166
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,331
I do a lot of board education.

167
00:08:02,331 --> 00:08:03,830
You're absolutely right.

168
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:06,530
The key thing we need
to talk about is risk,

169
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:10,729
risk to that organization
at this point in time.

170
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,710
And then hopefully even be able to talk

171
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:15,479
about risk to the
organization in the future.

172
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,260
But when we talk to them about risk,

173
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,750
the key thing I think
for that conversation is

174
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:25,750
what is the business impact
going to be of that risk?

175
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:30,360
So everyone has an
incredible business sense.

176
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,750
And I agree with you,

177
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,250
it's not just the culture
from the top down.

178
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:37,370
It's also from the newest person up.

179
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:39,403
The security starts at the keyboard.

180
00:08:39,403 --> 00:08:42,210
So talking about the business impact

181
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:44,960
and showing people that
no matter what we do

182
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,979
to be secure, these
incidents keep happening.

183
00:08:47,979 --> 00:08:50,660
Technology issues are gonna continue.

184
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:51,935
So how do we build that resilience

185
00:08:51,936 --> 00:08:54,180
and how do we build that response?

186
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:58,349
The business impact conversation
gets everybody's attention.

187
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:00,310
If I can't produce my product,

188
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:05,000
if I can't service my
customers like I'm supposed to,

189
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,800
if I can't create new services or products

190
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,930
then I'm gonna be outgunned
by the competition.

191
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:13,670
So the business impact conversation,

192
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:18,670
Shawn, becomes the key to
these kinds of conversations.

193
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:20,310
- Yeah, I'm glad to hear that.

194
00:09:21,349 --> 00:09:25,225
I am certainly seeing a
change, unfortunately it's slow

195
00:09:25,225 --> 00:09:27,108
and sometimes people respond only

196
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:30,031
when they see the headlines
of somebody else who suffers

197
00:09:30,031 --> 00:09:32,915
and that's not related
just to cybersecurity.

198
00:09:32,915 --> 00:09:37,795
Mary, you actually broke the
glass ceiling for the FBI

199
00:09:37,796 --> 00:09:42,796
when you were appointed as
the first female special agent

200
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,840
in charge in the New York office

201
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:48,113
and having grown up born
and raised in New York,

202
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:51,239
it's a tough business world there.

203
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,164
And certainly tough from a
law enforcement perspective.

204
00:09:53,164 --> 00:09:55,566
What were the challenges
and the opportunities

205
00:09:55,566 --> 00:09:58,850
you faced both in the
FBI in that position,

206
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:02,653
and then transiting over
to the private sector?

207
00:10:03,498 --> 00:10:06,637
- So I would say the
biggest challenge I had

208
00:10:06,637 --> 00:10:08,579
in that new position in the FBI,

209
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,110
ended up becoming my best opportunity.

210
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:14,328
So you're put in charge
of special operations

211
00:10:14,328 --> 00:10:16,238
from a technical perspective,

212
00:10:16,238 --> 00:10:18,650
with people that have had expertise

213
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:21,150
and experience for 20 years,

214
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:24,357
then I have the cyber guys
who knew more about cyber

215
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:27,161
than I would ever learn in my lifetime.

216
00:10:27,161 --> 00:10:29,420
And then add into that, the SWAT

217
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,634
and the crisis management expertise.

218
00:10:31,634 --> 00:10:34,481
So I had very, very talented, smart people

219
00:10:34,481 --> 00:10:37,900
who knew more about
different areas of technology

220
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:38,770
than I did.

221
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:40,420
So that was a challenge.

222
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:43,550
And making it then the opportunity was,

223
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:45,849
I decided I was gonna learn more

224
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:49,360
and let those people
who knew the most lead

225
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,323
those parts of the investigations.

226
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,520
And I think when you look
at the corporate world

227
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,367
and now in the private sector,

228
00:10:56,368 --> 00:10:59,140
I certainly hope I didn't
the same thing at Deloitte,

229
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:01,069
but I talked to our clients about that.

230
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:04,091
If you are the head of a business,

231
00:11:04,091 --> 00:11:07,290
a manufacturing business,
you have to trust

232
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:10,670
and collaborate and work with those people

233
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,310
who are experts around the technology,

234
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:16,268
whether it's the development
of it, the utilization of it,

235
00:11:16,269 --> 00:11:18,750
and most importantly as
we're talking about today,

236
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,010
protecting that technology.

237
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:24,770
And making those folks
not be the doctor know it

238
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:27,079
as we like to say but the enabler.

239
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:30,000
So I think Shawn, it's a
challenge for business executives

240
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,215
as it was for me not coming
from that technical background.

241
00:11:34,215 --> 00:11:38,293
And it can become a very powerful
opportunity if we let it.

242
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,840
- The people looking for business acumen,

243
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:47,050
and I think some of the
expertise for you especially,

244
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:48,449
the crisis management piece,

245
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:50,520
which I actually wanna talk
about in a couple of minutes

246
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:54,079
but there's so much
value that's added there

247
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:54,990
that people, I don't know,

248
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:57,340
have a full appreciation
and understanding for.

249
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:03,380
CJ, again, going back to our
time in the Bureau together

250
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:06,355
and after you came out of OSI,

251
00:12:06,355 --> 00:12:09,496
having done some of
the major investigation

252
00:12:09,496 --> 00:12:10,823
that you'd done there.

253
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:15,570
For us, attribution was so important

254
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:17,070
to know who the adversaries were

255
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,306
so that we could take actions,

256
00:12:18,306 --> 00:12:20,664
whether they be financial sanctions

257
00:12:20,664 --> 00:12:22,490
or some type of diplomatic actions,

258
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:25,810
or some type of either law enforcement

259
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:28,638
or Intel community actions
against adversaries,

260
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,530
then coming to the private sector.

261
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:35,010
There's, I remember when I
came over nine plus years ago,

262
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:36,867
people were scoffing at attribution,

263
00:12:36,867 --> 00:12:41,120
"It's not necessarily, not
important, you can't do it."

264
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,500
I'm interested in your thoughts there,

265
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,115
and I've got some some
strong feelings about it,

266
00:12:46,115 --> 00:12:47,840
but I'm interested in your thoughts

267
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,960
about that transition for you.

268
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,400
- It definitely was a transition.

269
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:57,400
The idea that attribution was key,

270
00:12:58,078 --> 00:12:59,810
especially in the
government and especially

271
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:02,757
when you're investigating
and going towards attribution

272
00:13:02,757 --> 00:13:05,617
that was really the goal
of of investigations

273
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,200
in the government.

274
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,550
But going to the private
sector, specifically

275
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:14,084
and incident response type
functions and things like that.

276
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:17,450
There was always that discussion that,

277
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:20,333
do we really care who who's doing this?

278
00:13:21,487 --> 00:13:23,310
We just want it to stop.

279
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:25,349
And I think that's a false choice.

280
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:26,460
I don't think you can.

281
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,469
I think the reality is that
we all have to remember

282
00:13:28,469 --> 00:13:31,890
that there's a human behind
the keyboard on the other side

283
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:34,988
because when you forget
that you start reacting

284
00:13:34,988 --> 00:13:39,988
in ways that don't make a lot
of sense from the standpoint

285
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:43,680
of an example being is that if you think

286
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,310
that it's just a computer,
that's attacking your computers,

287
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:49,109
you'll try just to block them out.

288
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:51,165
But the reality is that
just by trying to block out

289
00:13:51,165 --> 00:13:55,640
that one attack as the
cat and mouse game always

290
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,795
has happened in the past,

291
00:13:56,795 --> 00:14:00,010
if you block out a human
from getting in one way,

292
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:02,078
you're going to have
that same human figure

293
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:05,370
out another way to get
in or to try to get in.

294
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:08,810
So it's gonna continue for
a very long period of time.

295
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:12,671
And I think remembering there's
a human on the other side

296
00:14:12,672 --> 00:14:14,702
and trying to gain as much information

297
00:14:14,702 --> 00:14:17,590
as you can about your
adversary in that case,

298
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:20,450
allows you to better protect, defend

299
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:23,940
as well as potentially
mitigate that threat.

300
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:26,486
So that's one of the
things that it's taken

301
00:14:26,486 --> 00:14:29,450
a good bit of time in the private sector

302
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:31,670
to make sure that
leadership is aware of that

303
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:34,660
and is willing to do the things necessary.

304
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:35,492
I know in the government,

305
00:14:35,493 --> 00:14:37,130
one of the things we always struggled with

306
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:39,470
is that we would have an intrusion

307
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:42,400
and the people that own those
systems that we were working

308
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,439
the investigation on
first thing they wanna do

309
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,472
is lock them down and clean them up

310
00:14:46,472 --> 00:14:48,520
and move on to the next
part of the business.

311
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,410
But sometimes, in order
to gain that intelligence,

312
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:51,969
you have to be able to be willing

313
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:54,625
to have those systems online
in a mitigated fashion,

314
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:56,931
as much as you can but
still allow that attacker

315
00:14:56,931 --> 00:14:59,284
to have some access in order to learn.

316
00:14:59,284 --> 00:15:00,876
In gaining that intelligence

317
00:15:00,876 --> 00:15:03,356
and understanding your adversary

318
00:15:03,356 --> 00:15:06,530
is the same in this virtual world

319
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:09,040
as it always has been
in the kinetic world.

320
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,877
And the more information
that we can gather,

321
00:15:10,877 --> 00:15:13,140
the better that you'll be
able to defend yourself

322
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,180
against them in the future

323
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:17,660
and potentially mitigate
them as a threat altogether.

324
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:21,120
- Yeah, I think that that's
such an important part.

325
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,260
I think knowing who the adversary is,

326
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:25,250
knowing who the enemy is,

327
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,628
it allows you to understand
their motivations,

328
00:15:27,628 --> 00:15:30,587
their capabilities, their tool sets.

329
00:15:30,587 --> 00:15:33,106
I've used an example in the past that,

330
00:15:33,106 --> 00:15:35,897
I walk into the CEO's office and said,

331
00:15:35,897 --> 00:15:38,770
"Hey, boss, we just had a dozen computers

332
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:41,640
that were hit with virus X, Y, Z."

333
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,641
And the boss looks like,

334
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:45,150
"Okay, what does that mean?"

335
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:47,140
Versus, "Hey, we know that

336
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:49,340
this Russian organized
crime group deployed

337
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:52,262
this specific piece of malware.

338
00:15:52,262 --> 00:15:54,781
We know that it's linked to ransomware,

339
00:15:54,781 --> 00:15:58,400
it's impacted 12 other companies
in the last four months.

340
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,850
This is what was what the impact was."

341
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:03,160
By providing that much fuller explanation,

342
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,250
I think you're in a position

343
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,169
to better defend and be proactive

344
00:16:06,169 --> 00:16:09,313
and to make a lot of
strong business decisions.

345
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:14,466
All that with the caveat that
attribution is rarely 100%.

346
00:16:14,466 --> 00:16:17,474
It can be if you actually physically see

347
00:16:17,474 --> 00:16:19,260
somebody watching them do it.

348
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:22,760
And that has happened in
certainly in the government space

349
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,080
but it's not always 100%,

350
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:29,040
but it certainly puts you
on a stronger footing.

351
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,810
And from my perspective, the
more intelligence the better,

352
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:35,359
the better prepared, the better capable

353
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,640
we're to be resilient.

354
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,699
And it's just an area that

355
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,102
I think companies need
to be thinking about

356
00:16:42,102 --> 00:16:45,890
so that they can work smarter
and more strategically.

357
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:47,423
What do you think Mary?

358
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,210
- Shawn, absolutely.

359
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:51,930
I think we've seen examples of it

360
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:55,194
when we have nation
States DDoSing our banks

361
00:16:55,195 --> 00:16:58,977
a number of years ago,
knowing who the adversary was

362
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:03,400
and how they were executing those attacks.

363
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,458
You saw that information
sharing in industry,

364
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:09,551
bank to bank, financial institution
to financial institution

365
00:17:09,551 --> 00:17:12,020
which really made a big difference

366
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:14,311
because it went for over nine months.

367
00:17:14,311 --> 00:17:16,139
And then recently seeing

368
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:20,909
the software supply
chain attack that we had

369
00:17:20,909 --> 00:17:25,359
and seeing the company sharing information

370
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:28,820
of how did the adversary
get into the software?

371
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,755
How did they change the software?

372
00:17:30,756 --> 00:17:32,785
Those are very, very important things

373
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:36,060
for the next company
to protect themselves,

374
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:38,275
to have that intelligence

375
00:17:38,276 --> 00:17:40,963
and to know what the adversary's after.

376
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,830
We can't protect everything,

377
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:46,990
so it helps us to then prioritize that.

378
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:49,740
So information sharing
and I think that anyone

379
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:52,950
who is listening to
our conversation today,

380
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:55,837
especially in industry needs to continue

381
00:17:55,837 --> 00:17:57,408
and it needs to grow.

382
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:00,820
There cannot be any competition
when it comes to security

383
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:03,668
and we need the private sector

384
00:18:03,668 --> 00:18:07,189
to share amongst themselves
as much as possible.

385
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:11,530
Of course, the caveat there
is being able to do that

386
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:14,501
without being then doubly victimized

387
00:18:14,501 --> 00:18:19,185
by either lawsuits or
find some regulators,

388
00:18:19,185 --> 00:18:22,409
but that's probably a
topic for another session.

389
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:25,300
- Yeah, look, it's a
complex issue for sure.

390
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,889
Especially when the government is looking

391
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:28,330
for Intel from the private sector,

392
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:30,210
having been on both sides of this.

393
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:32,300
I understand the complexities.

394
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,580
I think that there's a
lot of successful one-offs

395
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:37,754
and certainly the ISACs and the ISAOs

396
00:18:37,755 --> 00:18:39,135
are helpful in that regard.

397
00:18:39,135 --> 00:18:43,171
They're able to anonymize data, et cetera.

398
00:18:43,171 --> 00:18:45,990
So there's so many opportunities.

399
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:48,467
I think it behooves us to
overcome the complexities

400
00:18:48,467 --> 00:18:51,381
and the adversity there.

401
00:18:51,381 --> 00:18:53,140
The piece you're talking about,

402
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:55,090
I know relates to Iran.

403
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:57,336
And I talked to people
where they were attacking

404
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:58,844
the financial services sector

405
00:18:58,844 --> 00:19:01,920
and that went on for many months.

406
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,812
And it happened based
on financial sanctions

407
00:19:04,812 --> 00:19:07,860
that the U.S. government
implemented against Iran.

408
00:19:07,861 --> 00:19:11,788
And I tell people, here's a
great example of of Intel,

409
00:19:11,788 --> 00:19:13,610
it's happened two or three times

410
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,498
where the U.S. has levied sanctions.

411
00:19:15,499 --> 00:19:20,499
And then Iran has
embarked on DDoS attacks,

412
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,449
targeting specifically the
financial services sector.

413
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:23,283
Well guess what?

414
00:19:23,283 --> 00:19:25,229
If you're in the financial services sector

415
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,920
and the U.S. is about to
levy sanctions on Iran,

416
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,586
you might wanna work with your providers

417
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:33,800
to better load balance your environment,

418
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,303
recognizing that this might happen

419
00:19:35,304 --> 00:19:37,770
because we've seen it
happen two or three times,

420
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:39,129
it's likely gonna happen again.

421
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:41,360
Another great example of
the use of intelligence

422
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,419
to allow us to be more proactive,

423
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:45,290
understanding geopolitical issues

424
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:48,107
and how they impact the adversary's use

425
00:19:48,107 --> 00:19:51,940
of the network as a
weapon, as well as a tool.

426
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:55,430
And that actually takes
me to another point, CJ

427
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:59,800
because when I see over the last few years

428
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,348
there's much more aggressive movement

429
00:20:02,348 --> 00:20:05,010
by adversaries and the movement

430
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:08,660
into more disruptive
or destructive attacks

431
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:11,630
the movement towards the physical world

432
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:15,164
versus what we saw website to
face mints denial of service,

433
00:20:15,164 --> 00:20:17,590
or PII theft.

434
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:21,308
You and I had a really
interesting conversation probably

435
00:20:21,308 --> 00:20:22,860
about a year ago.

436
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,461
And you were talking about
this concept of total security

437
00:20:25,461 --> 00:20:28,061
and the 360 degree attack surface.

438
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:30,730
And I really found it fascinating.

439
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,150
I certainly had thought about it,

440
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:34,381
but not in the way you put it together

441
00:20:34,381 --> 00:20:37,190
and I was able to visualize it much better

442
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:38,830
after talking to you.

443
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:41,010
What are the challenges for organizations

444
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:45,360
in looking at the physical,
the operational, the digital,

445
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,870
the personnel, the supply chain

446
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:50,590
I think we should talk about
as well in greater detail?

447
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:53,179
but give me some of your thoughts on that,

448
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,440
share it with these folks here

449
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:57,350
because I really think it's appropriate.

450
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:58,389
- Yeah, absolutely.

451
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,210
And I think the context that
we were talking about is,

452
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:02,838
what is the role of the CISO

453
00:21:02,838 --> 00:21:06,170
in the totality of
security of your business?

454
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:11,090
And I think that some people may think

455
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:13,540
CISO or Chief Information Security Officer

456
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:16,607
and information almost relating to IT.

457
00:21:16,607 --> 00:21:19,809
And in many times the the
CISOs report into CIO,

458
00:21:19,809 --> 00:21:21,680
and other things in businesses.

459
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:25,140
So they unnecessarily think the scope

460
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,780
of their responsibility

461
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:30,580
is very narrow and only the
IT or many cases related

462
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,973
or refer to as the cyber space.

463
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:38,359
The reality is that in order
to protect the information,

464
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:41,650
you must be responsible
or at least they steward

465
00:21:41,651 --> 00:21:45,603
for ensuring the security
across the board.

466
00:21:45,603 --> 00:21:49,270
Everything from the physical
security of the data centers

467
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:52,180
that your data resides in,

468
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:54,960
all the way through to
the personnel security,

469
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,910
these days there's growing
and growing possibilities

470
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:00,240
for insider threat.

471
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,930
So personnel security comes
into play very heavily there.

472
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:06,970
So the idea that as,

473
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:08,920
if you're the Chief
Information Security Officer

474
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,486
that potentially you don't
own physical security,

475
00:22:11,486 --> 00:22:15,090
does not abdicate your responsibility

476
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:19,276
for the security functions
that fall potentially

477
00:22:19,277 --> 00:22:21,890
in somebody else's
responsibility or title area.

478
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:23,344
The reality is that,

479
00:22:23,344 --> 00:22:27,034
that role and the team through that,

480
00:22:27,034 --> 00:22:29,320
you can't abdicate ownership

481
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,504
of all the other facets of security,

482
00:22:31,505 --> 00:22:34,160
just because you may think that your title

483
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,989
or your written responsibilities
are within one space.

484
00:22:36,989 --> 00:22:39,820
But the reality is that the threats

485
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:43,620
to information come
from the complete cycle.

486
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:47,780
Completely everything from
physical, cyber, personnel.

487
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:49,990
So you have to keep that in mind

488
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:52,980
when putting together a security program

489
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:58,870
and ensuring that as you're
putting that program together

490
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:01,700
that even if it's not
within your job title

491
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:04,140
that you're the advocate for doing so.

492
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,740
One of the things here at AWS

493
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,390
that we're lucky to have is we do have

494
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:10,950
a very forward security culture

495
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:15,250
that we establish tenants
around those types of things.

496
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:18,591
So security, durability,
availability in that order.

497
00:23:18,591 --> 00:23:22,399
This is a very easy thing
for our staff to understand.

498
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,840
We also believe in strong ownership,

499
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,139
meaning that if you own a business,

500
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,870
you'll own it cradle to grave,

501
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:30,739
including security of that business.

502
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,759
So the profit and loss success failure,

503
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:36,880
security of your business
is your responsibility.

504
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,210
So therefore the combination
of a strong ownership model

505
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:42,490
that includes having a security culture

506
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:47,382
as well as a CISO or a
Chief Security Officer,

507
00:23:47,383 --> 00:23:51,200
whatever title it may be,
that is a strong advocate

508
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,923
for all forms of security
within the business,

509
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,980
as enablers to the business,
not as the land of no

510
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:03,884
is a key and important
role within the business.

511
00:24:03,884 --> 00:24:07,330
And it's key that, that
mindset of ownership

512
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:09,602
is throughout the business as well.

513
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:16,030
- Yeah, I think that that's
so critically important.

514
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:18,639
And I think coming from the government

515
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,960
that we think about that more often

516
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,277
than folks who've grown up in solely IT,

517
00:24:23,277 --> 00:24:25,717
they're not thinking about that totality

518
00:24:25,717 --> 00:24:28,281
but I think about cases that I've seen,

519
00:24:28,281 --> 00:24:30,129
just in the last couple of years,

520
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:31,720
foreign intelligence services looking

521
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,250
to get people hired into companies.

522
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:36,560
Foreign intelligence
services co-opting people

523
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,139
who are in companies where
people being extorted.

524
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:42,520
Innocent employees who are extorted.

525
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:47,366
We saw somebody who may
have been associated

526
00:24:47,366 --> 00:24:52,366
with organized crime according
to media reports, unclear

527
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:57,400
but looking to pay
somebody at a major company

528
00:24:57,806 --> 00:25:02,299
to introduce malware into their
system, into their network

529
00:25:02,299 --> 00:25:04,930
and where they were offered
a million dollars to do it.

530
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:06,322
So these things happen.

531
00:25:06,322 --> 00:25:10,723
And I think unless people are
thinking about that broadly,

532
00:25:12,243 --> 00:25:14,730
they're really doing a
disservice to the company.

533
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:16,060
We're missing opportunities

534
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:18,290
to better protect the organization.

535
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:21,200
Mary, pull on that because you're dealing

536
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,470
with so many C-suites.

537
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:27,182
I find it's incumbent upon
me when I talk to boards

538
00:25:27,182 --> 00:25:29,550
and executives to really introduce this

539
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:31,664
because I want them thinking critically.

540
00:25:31,664 --> 00:25:33,538
I want them thinking more holistically.

541
00:25:33,538 --> 00:25:36,710
Are you finding the same
with your experience?

542
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:38,120
- Yes, I'm finding the same.

543
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,360
And Shawn, you and I
and CJ are very familiar

544
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,990
with the phrase insider threat.

545
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:48,218
And explaining it to executives in a way

546
00:25:48,218 --> 00:25:51,160
that then they can do
something and incorporate

547
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,810
some processes in their organization.

548
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:56,418
So for example, everybody
talks about training

549
00:25:56,418 --> 00:25:58,429
when it comes to cyber

550
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:01,763
and the conversation usually
ends with phishing training.

551
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:05,210
And you can take that
conversation and say,

552
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:06,842
that's not the end of the training,

553
00:26:06,842 --> 00:26:08,863
but you have three kinds of employees

554
00:26:08,863 --> 00:26:10,910
when it comes to insider threat.

555
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:12,944
You have those that are ignorant.

556
00:26:12,944 --> 00:26:15,953
They don't know our
policies to CJ's point.

557
00:26:15,953 --> 00:26:18,507
They don't know the
culture yet, they're new.

558
00:26:18,507 --> 00:26:20,959
And so we have to train them differently.

559
00:26:20,959 --> 00:26:24,954
Then the second group which are
indifferent to the policies,

560
00:26:24,954 --> 00:26:27,149
they've been around long enough,

561
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:29,460
you're smiling 'cause we both know

562
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:33,760
that that group they're
senior, they're teen agents.

563
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,660
And so we've been around long enough

564
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:39,410
and to their credit they've
found ways to do things quicker.

565
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:42,200
They've found ways to...

566
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,010
On a Friday at five o'clock wrap up

567
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:45,460
this part of the business.

568
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:47,679
However, those bring their own risks.

569
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:50,138
And then the third group
is that malicious group,

570
00:26:50,138 --> 00:26:53,991
that malicious insider
who either willingly

571
00:26:53,991 --> 00:26:57,608
or unwillingly takes information
from your organization.

572
00:26:57,608 --> 00:26:59,623
And you also have Shawn,

573
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:03,145
the more we collaborate
in the business world

574
00:27:03,145 --> 00:27:05,384
the more we have our employees believe

575
00:27:05,384 --> 00:27:09,520
that they own this part of
the business whether it's,

576
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,360
I created an algorithm, I created an app.

577
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,352
I created this research paper.

578
00:27:14,353 --> 00:27:18,220
And so when I'm leaving
company X to go to company Y,

579
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,840
it's okay that I download
all this information

580
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:21,882
and take it with me.

581
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:27,510
No, that's data leaving the organization,

582
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:29,107
or I'm frustrated

583
00:27:29,107 --> 00:27:31,590
or angry at something at organization.

584
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:35,260
So I do something to the
operational technology

585
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:39,144
and I disrupt some type of
processes or manufacturing.

586
00:27:39,144 --> 00:27:42,971
So when you talk to business
executives about it that way

587
00:27:42,971 --> 00:27:45,940
that the training to CJ's
point of Brown employees

588
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,837
has to be much wider.

589
00:27:47,837 --> 00:27:51,480
That means someone human
resources needs to understand

590
00:27:52,957 --> 00:27:56,432
the cyber threat to the organization,

591
00:27:56,432 --> 00:27:58,453
as well as the system.

592
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:01,210
Hiring needs to understand that,

593
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:03,960
the head of the business
needs to understand that.

594
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:07,030
So I think we're gonna
continue to see that training

595
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:09,406
and hopefully become a lot more robust

596
00:28:09,406 --> 00:28:13,899
than around just phishing training.

597
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:14,733
- No doubt.

598
00:28:14,733 --> 00:28:17,350
Two important points that you made there.

599
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:21,360
I think one is, this
is a holistic response

600
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,158
and I've seen companies now starting

601
00:28:23,158 --> 00:28:25,560
these insider threat teams

602
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:28,520
which are made up of not only the CISO

603
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:31,270
but the Chief Security Officer and HR

604
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:34,790
and legal and someone from the COO shop

605
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:37,180
where you're really
looking across the company.

606
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,013
And I think it's important,

607
00:28:38,013 --> 00:28:39,929
we're not trying to develop a culture

608
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:41,690
where big brother's watching

609
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:44,450
or the company's watching
every step you make,

610
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:46,361
but really getting people
to think differently

611
00:28:46,361 --> 00:28:48,590
and recognize it's such a small percentage

612
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:49,938
of people that are gonna do it

613
00:28:49,939 --> 00:28:51,531
but the culture is very clear,

614
00:28:51,531 --> 00:28:54,081
if you're leaving to go
somewhere else, that's okay,

615
00:28:54,082 --> 00:28:56,786
everyone has an opportunity
to succeed somewhere else

616
00:28:56,786 --> 00:28:59,840
but you can't take this stuff
with you, and that's cultural.

617
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,740
And then they might be sanctioned
the repercussions there.

618
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:07,116
So CJ, going back to your three 60 piece

619
00:29:07,116 --> 00:29:09,572
one of the other areas
in addition to insider

620
00:29:09,572 --> 00:29:11,026
that we've been talking about

621
00:29:11,027 --> 00:29:14,282
and I mentioned the supply chain.

622
00:29:14,282 --> 00:29:17,730
And I know going back
to the early mid 2000s

623
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:21,620
in the government, the
Department of Defense was working

624
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:23,959
on how to secure the supply chain.

625
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,470
And we're seeing now the inability

626
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:29,134
for companies to get chips
to do their manufacturing

627
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:31,470
because they're not
manufactured domestically.

628
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:34,963
They're only manufactured internationally.

629
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:36,989
What are your thoughts?

630
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:41,990
We've seen some recent big
issues in the last months or so,

631
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,959
although I've seen them
going back many years,

632
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,575
not always publicized, what
are your thoughts on that

633
00:29:48,575 --> 00:29:51,469
and how we in the cybersecurity business

634
00:29:51,469 --> 00:29:55,262
can have a better impact
on that in our companies?

635
00:29:55,262 --> 00:29:56,211
- Yeah, absolutely.

636
00:29:56,211 --> 00:30:00,843
I think going back to the early
2000s and stuff like that,

637
00:30:00,843 --> 00:30:04,540
there was a lot of focus on supply chain.

638
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:06,909
A good bit of it was still focused towards

639
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:08,604
your hardware supply chain.

640
00:30:08,604 --> 00:30:10,840
It might've been in the cyberspace.

641
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:14,740
So computers, the actual
firmware, chips or otherwise

642
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,563
that are within those computers.

643
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:22,187
But the reality is that all
of those devices run software

644
00:30:22,187 --> 00:30:23,639
on top of them.

645
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:27,605
And that if you can get into
the software supply chain,

646
00:30:27,605 --> 00:30:30,730
many times giving our new DevOps model

647
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:34,753
or more continuous integration
and development model,

648
00:30:34,753 --> 00:30:39,753
you can actually have threats
that are self upgradable,

649
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:43,920
via the software just as
we increase the threats

650
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,670
or just as we increase...

651
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:49,612
The threats are able to
increase just as our defenses.

652
00:30:49,612 --> 00:30:54,079
So that's one of the things
that we have to stay on top of.

653
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:59,079
From a software supply chain,
the threat is quite large

654
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:01,969
from the standpoint
that a lot of companies

655
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:03,600
are using third-party software,

656
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:08,600
software that's outside of
their own remit of creating it.

657
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,360
At Amazon we create a
lot of our own software

658
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,909
but just like a lot of other companies,

659
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:15,860
we use some pieces parts
of different capabilities

660
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:19,429
from different companies
or interconnect them.

661
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:23,980
And we have to do a large
amount of security review

662
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:27,696
on where the source of
that software comes from

663
00:31:27,696 --> 00:31:30,139
and how it's gonna be implemented.

664
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:33,910
The important thing here is,
and things that others can do

665
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:37,298
in that space is making sure that,

666
00:31:37,298 --> 00:31:39,040
you talked about the Department of Defense

667
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,670
and a lot of the work that they did.

668
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:43,955
They were big on talking
about defense in depth

669
00:31:43,955 --> 00:31:48,955
and having different means
by which to detect things.

670
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,770
And I think that's one of the things

671
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:53,420
that we find that is very useful today,

672
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:55,440
although using different terminology.

673
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,800
And that is that not only
looking at the software

674
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,770
that you're using making sure

675
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:01,570
that you're aware of its origin,

676
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:03,210
as well as what it's going to do,

677
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:04,931
or what it's intended to do.

678
00:32:04,931 --> 00:32:07,366
Doing testing of that in
various different formats,

679
00:32:07,366 --> 00:32:09,970
everything from structured
testing to fuzzing

680
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:13,280
and taking all of that

681
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:18,010
and still applying mechanisms
that are belts and suspenders.

682
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:19,750
What do I mean by that?

683
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:22,382
Being able to have monitoring devices

684
00:32:22,382 --> 00:32:24,350
and I don't mean monitoring the people,

685
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:26,367
monitoring the software itself,

686
00:32:26,367 --> 00:32:29,418
looking for aberrations
on how it's communicating.

687
00:32:29,418 --> 00:32:34,418
If software is designed to do
communication between X and Y,

688
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,729
and then on every 10th day,

689
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:39,870
you see some sporadic
communication (indistinct).

690
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:41,578
That's probably something
you wanna look at.

691
00:32:41,578 --> 00:32:45,039
And that's what you can have
systems created in order

692
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:48,950
by which to look for aberrations
within that environment.

693
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:50,770
We use CrowdStrike Falcon for some of that

694
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:55,590
on our edge devices in order
to look for those aberrations

695
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:59,775
because really the totality
of the software supply chain,

696
00:32:59,776 --> 00:33:01,470
you have to start from the beginning

697
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:02,810
and work your way through it.

698
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:07,274
And at the same time be very
vigilant to the communications

699
00:33:07,275 --> 00:33:10,875
and the access that software has.

700
00:33:10,875 --> 00:33:12,850
'Cause very much just
like we were just talking

701
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:14,654
about people in the insider threat,

702
00:33:14,654 --> 00:33:17,334
the more that you can
limit the access to data

703
00:33:17,334 --> 00:33:20,348
whether to humans or to other systems,

704
00:33:20,348 --> 00:33:23,180
the better off you will be.

705
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:25,230
So a lot of future investment

706
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:28,010
you'll see going towards
continuing authorization,

707
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:29,504
or just in time off,

708
00:33:29,504 --> 00:33:32,830
meaning that people in
systems will have access,

709
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:35,953
based upon a set of
parameters that are met

710
00:33:35,953 --> 00:33:38,431
for a very specific and
short period of time.

711
00:33:38,431 --> 00:33:40,499
And then that access will go away.

712
00:33:40,499 --> 00:33:43,240
That allows you to be able
to be more fine-grained

713
00:33:44,536 --> 00:33:48,150
in the risk surface that
you have within your space,

714
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:51,132
and also helps to provide some
of those belts and suspenders

715
00:33:51,132 --> 00:33:54,880
to protect us against
software supply chain issues.

716
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,580
- Really, it's such an important piece

717
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:58,620
and it's not going away anytime soon.

718
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,364
We're all interconnected.

719
00:34:00,365 --> 00:34:02,190
Let me wrap up here.

720
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:06,730
And I think I always find
value in hearing good stories

721
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:09,550
that highlight some of the
important points that we've made.

722
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:11,016
I'll ask start with you, Mary,

723
00:34:11,016 --> 00:34:13,998
just going back to your
time in the government,

724
00:34:13,998 --> 00:34:16,561
in the Bureau maybe kind of a war story,

725
00:34:16,561 --> 00:34:18,346
something that you've gone through

726
00:34:18,346 --> 00:34:20,427
that you were able to take lessons learned

727
00:34:20,427 --> 00:34:22,550
and apply them in your current position,

728
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:24,315
in the private sector.

729
00:34:24,315 --> 00:34:28,382
- Well, Shawn, one of
the biggest war stories

730
00:34:28,382 --> 00:34:31,102
I have about one of the
biggest breaches was,

731
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:35,507
to a financial institution
where right out of the gate

732
00:34:35,507 --> 00:34:40,230
it was extremely important
to know who the adversary was

733
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:43,730
because we were trying to
determine what they wanted.

734
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:47,600
And you still see that question today,

735
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:50,418
seven, eight years later about who is it?

736
00:34:50,418 --> 00:34:51,750
What do they want?

737
00:34:51,751 --> 00:34:54,159
The second part of that breach

738
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:57,529
which was extremely at the time,

739
00:34:57,530 --> 00:34:59,071
an opportunity for me to learn

740
00:34:59,071 --> 00:35:00,903
was they had to bring the business

741
00:35:00,903 --> 00:35:03,049
and the technology
folks literally together

742
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:05,397
and sit at the table to say,

743
00:35:05,397 --> 00:35:08,060
"Okay, how do you use this technology?

744
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:11,140
What was this technology meant to do?"

745
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:13,194
And then they could have a better idea

746
00:35:13,195 --> 00:35:15,727
of the forensics around the cyber attack.

747
00:35:15,727 --> 00:35:18,339
And the third piece was
working with the government,

748
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:23,340
as an FBI, DHS, NSA and how
do you share that information

749
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:28,700
which you alluded to
earlier in our conversation?

750
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:31,779
So I still see some of those
things now with our clients

751
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:34,708
of how do you share the information?

752
00:35:34,708 --> 00:35:38,950
The forensic still takes a
couple of days, if not weeks

753
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:43,950
to really determine what
happened and what did they touch?

754
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:47,314
And so the more technology
that we're implementing

755
00:35:47,314 --> 00:35:50,582
I think the bigger those
challenges are gonna be.

756
00:35:50,582 --> 00:35:53,091
So I think that that
would be the war story

757
00:35:53,091 --> 00:35:55,660
I would share for this audience.

758
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,953
- Great, CJ, same opportunity.

759
00:35:58,830 --> 00:35:59,790
- Yeah, absolutely.

760
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:01,446
So I think probably a good example,

761
00:36:01,446 --> 00:36:04,220
going back to the old days, Shawn would be

762
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:08,272
a case that caught some
notoriety called Moonlight Maze.

763
00:36:08,273 --> 00:36:10,870
It was an investigation into intrusions

764
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:13,370
into Department of Defense,

765
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:15,589
as well as Department of Energy

766
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:18,750
and other sites around the world.

767
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:22,868
And I think it's a great
example of what today

768
00:36:22,868 --> 00:36:25,770
we would call APTs or
Advanced Persistent Threats,

769
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:27,150
wasn't called that back then.

770
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:29,843
Now we have all kinds
of names for such things

771
00:36:29,843 --> 00:36:31,339
and numbers and things.

772
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:34,300
But back then, this, I think
would be a canonical example

773
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,610
of one of our first or early APTs.

774
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:39,230
And I think the second
part coming out of that,

775
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:41,430
probably one of the
biggest lessons learned is,

776
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:44,390
it was within the government sector.

777
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:46,653
We were able to pull together
42 different agencies

778
00:36:46,653 --> 00:36:48,395
to form a collaborative working sale

779
00:36:48,395 --> 00:36:50,670
in order to be able to work together

780
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:53,433
against this common threat
that we were all facing

781
00:36:53,433 --> 00:36:56,700
and subsequently that
bled into private sector

782
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,529
and working with private sector

783
00:36:58,530 --> 00:36:59,363
from that standpoint.

784
00:36:59,363 --> 00:37:00,852
And that's the type of interaction

785
00:37:00,853 --> 00:37:03,904
that we need to see today,
not only in government

786
00:37:03,904 --> 00:37:06,429
but also the private sector
entities collaborating,

787
00:37:06,429 --> 00:37:09,044
working together against
the common threats

788
00:37:09,044 --> 00:37:13,129
in order to keep these things from moving

789
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:14,690
through all of our businesses.

790
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:17,210
So sharing of information,
sharing of the means

791
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:21,440
by which to thought
this common adversaries.

792
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,551
- So glad to see both of
your examples focusing

793
00:37:23,551 --> 00:37:25,891
on collaboration, because
actually my wrap-up point

794
00:37:25,891 --> 00:37:28,457
was gonna be specifically on collaboration

795
00:37:28,457 --> 00:37:29,560
in all of the IRs.

796
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,613
And I've been involved in hundreds of them

797
00:37:31,613 --> 00:37:32,937
over the last 20 years.

798
00:37:32,937 --> 00:37:35,495
The most successful ones were where people

799
00:37:35,495 --> 00:37:38,111
were collaborating both
internally and externally

800
00:37:38,111 --> 00:37:40,790
within the different business
units in the private sector.

801
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:43,678
And then externally
with independent counsel

802
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:45,836
or private counsel, outside counsel,

803
00:37:45,836 --> 00:37:47,640
working with other vendors,

804
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:52,071
working with the public
sector if appropriate.

805
00:37:52,071 --> 00:37:54,589
And certainly my time in the government,

806
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:56,730
working with the Intel community,

807
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:59,397
other law enforcement agencies
state, and local, and federal

808
00:37:59,397 --> 00:38:01,269
were the most successful investigations,

809
00:38:01,269 --> 00:38:03,654
because everybody brings
something of value to the table.

810
00:38:03,655 --> 00:38:05,360
Everybody brings an expertise.

811
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,171
So I'm really glad you both finished there

812
00:38:07,171 --> 00:38:08,841
because that's where I'd like to finish.

813
00:38:08,842 --> 00:38:11,470
I wanna thank you both.

814
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:14,026

815
00:38:14,027 --> 00:38:17,197
