1
00:00:00,297 --> 00:00:01,803
(air whooshing)

2
00:00:01,804 --> 00:00:04,971
(music)

3
00:00:11,979 --> 00:00:13,889
music)

4
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:16,520
- First of all, I wanna thank RSA for allowing me

5
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:20,020
and Cisco to participate in this year's RSA Conference.

6
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,240
I know the last 15 months

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,590
have been incredibly challenging for all of us.

8
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:26,180
We all had to deploy the technology

9
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:29,600
that enabled virtually every worker on a global basis

10
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,380
to shift to remote work overnight.

11
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:34,336
They were connecting over multiple networks.

12
00:00:34,336 --> 00:00:36,320
They were connecting from whatever device

13
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,670
they could possibly find to get connected from.

14
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:40,420
And we all know that during this time,

15
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:42,980
the security landscape that we were all dealing with

16
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:44,852
was becoming very complex.

17
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:49,679
We know that our employees, just by having 30 extra minutes

18
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:53,709
on a mobile device, created 20% more vulnerability

19
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,343
than you would have in a normal time.

20
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:59,370
But we also learned that industries can be transformed.

21
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:00,500
We were delivering healthcare.

22
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,333
We still are.

23
00:01:01,333 --> 00:01:02,199
We're delivering education.

24
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,100
We're actually transacting government

25
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:07,520
over these technologies, which really means security

26
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,023
is incredibly important as we go forward.

27
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,080
And 2/3 of the CIOs in all the organizations

28
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,603
that you live in have said that post-pandemic,

29
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:18,759
we will spend more

30
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:21,463
on our security investments going forward,

31
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,350
and we know that projects that used to take years

32
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,300
are now taking weeks and months

33
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,270
because of the sense of urgency that we've all been facing.

34
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:31,869
And with all this, we know that we're now dealing

35
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:34,283
with a very expanded threat surface.

36
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,940
Every individual is carrying an average of four devices,

37
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:39,840
and most of us are carrying even more,

38
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,559
and this just creates more opportunity for breaches.

39
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,560
If we think about cyber crime

40
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,393
the way we think about the GDP of countries,

41
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:50,980
it would be the third largest economy in the world

42
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:55,843
after the US and China with $6 trillion in global damages.

43
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:58,300
And we all know the real cost is not being able

44
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,610
to run our businesses or the reputational damage

45
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:04,030
that you suffer and the impact

46
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,860
on your organizations in the future.

47
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,330
But this team did an incredible job.

48
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:11,103
All of you did an amazing job over the last 15 to 18 months,

49
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,840
securing your organizations, and I wanna thank all of you

50
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,240
for your hard work, your dedication to security.

51
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:19,313
And I think we all know we're still just not done.

52
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,930
Because there are so many trends

53
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:22,650
that are happening all around us,

54
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:26,663
that threat surface is only going to continue to expand.

55
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:30,170
We have great new technologies like 5G and Wi-Fi 6

56
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:31,989
that are going to enable us to continue

57
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:34,453
to connect more and more things around the world.

58
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:37,770
We have the continued explosion of public cloud.

59
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:39,820
We still have private cloud applications.

60
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,593
We have SaaS applications.

61
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:44,440
We have workers that will work from home forever

62
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,623
or in a hybrid model as we go forward.

63
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:49,210
There is really no perimeter in the enterprise

64
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,340
to defend anymore.

65
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,480
Those same workers will be mobile

66
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:55,079
at some point in the future, in coffee shops again,

67
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,087
and we have to deal with all that.

68
00:02:56,087 --> 00:02:58,390
And we have to build security practices

69
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:01,583
around what we know is coming in the future.

70
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:05,020
And we believe that there is a need

71
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,500
as we move forward to really look

72
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,530
at an end-to-end security architecture.

73
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:12,020
We think that's foundational to being able

74
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,690
to deal with the complexity with all the number of users,

75
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:16,829
all the number of devices, the applications,

76
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:19,513
the data, everything that we see.

77
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:22,320
And right now there are over 3,500 vendors

78
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,343
who are building security solutions for you every day,

79
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,010
but we think because of that, it's just so complex,

80
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:31,653
and we need to reimagine the security architecture.

81
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,340
We need to take into consideration

82
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,290
that home user, permanently.

83
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:37,602
We need to think about that as a small branch.

84
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:39,280
We still have our regular branches,

85
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,770
we have mobile users, we have these public

86
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:43,110
and private cloud applications,

87
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:45,210
and then we have the emergence of the Edge

88
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,170
where both data and applications

89
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:49,463
will be quite prevalent in the future.

90
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,410
And we know that security has to be

91
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:53,760
at the heart of everything.

92
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,793
We believe it.

93
00:03:54,793 --> 00:03:56,190
We build it into our technology,

94
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,800
like encrypted traffic analytics

95
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,463
built into our ethernet switches,

96
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:03,133
or security built deeply into collaboration with Webex,

97
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,840
or even the full stack observability that you get

98
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,460
through ThousandEyes and AppDynamics

99
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:10,060
to help you have more insights about what's going on.

100
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,420
But we also know that you can't stop every threat,

101
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,019
and you won't stop every threat.

102
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:15,579
But we need that visibility.

103
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,260
We need to identify these threats.

104
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,260
We need to correlate the information that we have

105
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,913
from all these different sources,

106
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,873
and then somehow we need to remediate quickly.

107
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,360
And we think that this is what's driving the need

108
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:30,133
for zero trust architectures, for new SASSY architectures,

109
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,330
really the move to passwordless

110
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:34,745
and, frankly, continuous authentication.

111
00:04:34,745 --> 00:04:37,320
We have so much information about how a user

112
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,550
is navigating in your technology infrastructure.

113
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:41,943
We need to take data from all of those interactions

114
00:04:41,943 --> 00:04:45,563
and continuously authenticate those users as we go forward,

115
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:49,380
and we believe it has to be done through a platform approach

116
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:51,650
where we're taking in all of these threats

117
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,630
and we're actually correlating them

118
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:57,000
and giving you speed and information that you need

119
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,962
to actually drive that remediation as fast as possible.

120
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:02,410
And we have to do this in a way that's simple.

121
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:03,903
It has to be comprehensive,

122
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,140
and it has to be based on intelligence.

123
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,823
And if we get those pieces right,

124
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:12,423
the simplicity will help you detect, correlate, monitor.

125
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:15,190
You know, 70% of our customers have said platforms

126
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,870
like SecureX are helping simplify

127
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:20,000
their day-to-day operations and the correlation

128
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,950
of all of the threat information that they have.

129
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,342
It has to be comprehensive.

130
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:27,110
One piece of information from one security control point

131
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:30,299
is interesting, but it's not as valuable as it could be

132
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:32,850
if it was built into a comprehensive architecture.

133
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,780
We need visibility everywhere across the endpoint,

134
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,460
those users, those applications,

135
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,760
which allows you to set your policies quickly,

136
00:05:39,888 --> 00:05:42,830
and secure those control points that are so important

137
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:45,013
in this new world that we all live in,

138
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,660
and it has to be based on real-time insights.

139
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:48,650
It has to be intelligent.

140
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:50,510
It has to be leveraging great technologies,

141
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,143
like AI and machine learning.

142
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:56,060
And that will allow us to really secure and remediate

143
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,222
at a scale that we've never been able to do,

144
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:01,480
yet we've always hoped we could do.

145
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,010
And in order to do this, the technology is so important,

146
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:07,219
and I think that we and others are working hard every day

147
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:09,260
to deliver the technology that you're gonna need

148
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,820
to deal with security in the complex environments

149
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:15,582
that we're all operating, but we also need the right talent.

150
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,890
70% of the cybersecurity professionals,

151
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:21,320
70% of all of you, have said that your organization

152
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,082
is impacted by the skills shortage right now.

153
00:06:24,459 --> 00:06:27,400
We have 2.8 million cyber professionals

154
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,193
in the world right now.

155
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,550
So that's a lot of people.

156
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:34,250
We also have 4 million unfilled jobs at the same time.

157
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,490
So we have more unfilled opportunities

158
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,773
than we have active cyber professionals in the world.

159
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:40,990
We have to train people.

160
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:42,190
We have to re-skill people.

161
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:45,123
We have to continue to develop the existing talent.

162
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,330
We have to make it easier

163
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:48,282
for people to get into cybersecurity.

164
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:51,063
We have to look at untapped sources like women.

165
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:55,253
They represent just 24% of the cyber workforce today,

166
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:57,880
while they represent the majority

167
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,719
of the new entrance into the workforce.

168
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,470
This is a huge opportunity, and we've seen it at Cisco.

169
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:05,410
Talos, our great threat intelligence organization

170
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:09,663
has hired physicists, astronomers, nuclear technicians,

171
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:13,282
coffee baristas, grocery workers, translators.

172
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,820
We have to look in unconventional places

173
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,770
for people with unconventional backgrounds

174
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:21,260
that have the capacity and the capability to learn

175
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,169
and then contribute constructively as we go forward.

176
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:26,500
We also have the program like Cisco Networking Academy

177
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:30,920
where we're taking technology education into high schools,

178
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:34,853
and community colleges, universities, military,

179
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:37,880
into prisons to help educate these people

180
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,201
and allow them to participate

181
00:07:39,201 --> 00:07:43,123
and have jobs in the technology arena as we move forward.

182
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,481
In our last fiscal year, we had 2.3 million people

183
00:07:46,481 --> 00:07:48,880
participated in Cisco Networking Academies

184
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,690
on a global basis, and almost 600,000 of them

185
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,793
took cybersecurity courses.

186
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:57,710
There's so much more that we all can do

187
00:07:57,930 --> 00:07:59,283
to actually solve this,

188
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:02,770
and it is an incredibly important imperative for all of us.

189
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:05,990
It is a collective priority for us to create more skills

190
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:07,190
to continue to fight the fight

191
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,790
that we all know is ahead of us.

192
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:11,623
One of our core responsibilities is to create trust.

193
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:15,040
The security work that all of you do every day

194
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:19,973
actually leads to your employees feeling better,

195
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:22,082
your customers feeling better.

196
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,532
They all want trust.

197
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,110
They want trust that their data is being protected.

198
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,599
Again, our employees wanna know

199
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,130
that as they're working from home,

200
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:31,260
that they're working over secure connectivity

201
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,360
and that they're safe.

202
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:34,313
The networks have to be secure.

203
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:38,313
As we continue to deliver education and healthcare,

204
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,673
we have to ensure that that's secure,

205
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:43,373
and this is the opportunity we have.

206
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,503
We all understand the power of connectivity.

207
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,880
We know that when we connect people

208
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,280
in remote villages in India or other emerging countries,

209
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:55,050
or, frankly, remote communities in the United States,

210
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:57,770
or those students in underserved areas

211
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:00,270
that need to learn remotely, when we connect them

212
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:03,473
and give them the right technology, it's powerful,

213
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:07,310
but we also have a responsibility to make sure it's secure

214
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:11,920
so that we can extend the opportunity of connectivity

215
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,050
to everyone and do it in a way that we believe is safe.

216
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:18,880
At Cisco, our purpose is to power

217
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,383
an inclusive future for all,

218
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:23,990
and I believe that as we go into this recovery

219
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:25,590
and continue moving through this recovery,

220
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:27,683
it has to be an inclusive recovery.

221
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:30,360
It has to be a secure recovery.

222
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,060
People have to feel good about it.

223
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:34,209
And when we think about our purpose,

224
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:36,210
we do believe that our technology

225
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,300
can connect everyone around the world

226
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:40,720
and give them opportunity that they've never had before,

227
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,063
and deliver education, and deliver healthcare.

228
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:45,830
And we also believe that all of us have a responsibility

229
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:49,290
in our communities to continue to work to actually ensure

230
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:52,203
that it is an inclusive recovery going forward,

231
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:54,060
and we can get there with all of you.

232
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:56,620
We can get there with the right technology.

233
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,230
We can get there if we take the right approach,

234
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:02,850
and we can get there if we invest in creating more talent

235
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:05,370
like all of you that get up every day

236
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:08,763
and create a sense of security in your organizations.

237
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,870
And we can only go forward and deal

238
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,420
with the opportunity in the future

239
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,310
and the complexity of the future

240
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:18,213
if we look at security as the foundation.

241
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:20,523
It really is the most critical piece.

242
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,083
And as we do that, it allows us to do so much more.

243
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:29,300
It allows us to truly go out and live in a world

244
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:32,083
where we create inclusive opportunity for everyone,

245
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:35,610
and it allows us to really move forward post-pandemic

246
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:38,233
with a real secure, inclusive recovery.

247
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,859
And I wanna thank all of you

248
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,530
for everything you do every day

249
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:42,980
to actually make that happen,

250
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,460
and I hope you enjoy the rest of RSA.

251
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,460
Thank you very much.
