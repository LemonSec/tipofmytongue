1
00:00:00,245 --> 00:00:02,828
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,640
- Hi, I'm Rob Lefferts,

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,649
Corporate Vice-President
for Microsoft 365 Security.

4
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:09,990
I help build the products

5
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:12,370
and services that we deliver to secure

6
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:14,570
all of our customers and organizations.

7
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:16,550
- And I'm Bret Arsenault,
Corporate Vice-President,

8
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:19,140
Chief Information Security
Officer for Microsoft.

9
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,630
Essentially I protect
the Microsoft digital

10
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,590
assets as well as I'm responsible

11
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:26,350
for crisis response and
business continuity.

12
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:27,960
- So today we're going to
have a conversation when

13
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,450
those two sides of the coin
back and forth dialogue,

14
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:34,370
you as the consumer of
products and services,

15
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:37,239
and me representing the product
teams that help build those.

16
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,400
Just up front I got to say,

17
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,250
I feel very fortunate to have
your feedback, your guidance.

18
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,030
I think of you as the
first and best customer

19
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:45,960
whenever we have a crazy
idea, we like to run

20
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,190
across the hallway down the street

21
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:48,449
and make sure that we get the feedback

22
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:51,420
from you and your team about
how that's going to work.

23
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,130
And I think there's two
main topics we want to delve

24
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:56,670
into the first of those about
Zero Trust and how we think

25
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,000
about that philosophy
and approach to security.

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,950
And the second about the
crazy world we live in

27
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:06,220
and how COVID has impacted
the way people work

28
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:08,950
and how that changes
the world of security.

29
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:10,510
And what did that look
like as we come back

30
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:14,400
and then finally wrap up a
little bit of recommendations

31
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,110
go dues that folks can take away

32
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,870
with it with themselves as they go on.

33
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:22,530
So first supply chain,

34
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:24,550
the crazy news stories of the past year.

35
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:28,649
So as Microsoft CSO, I
love to hear what you think

36
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:31,940
how it's changed your approach
to security and how you think

37
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:34,210
about how to make sure you
protect Microsoft's data

38
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:35,630
and our customers' data.

39
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:36,880
- Yeah, no, that'd be great.

40
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,975
And first, thanks for coming
and hanging out with me here.

41
00:01:38,975 --> 00:01:41,130
Obviously we spent time a lot together

42
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,970
design and review and feedback
and the things we need.

43
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,600
I think the supply chain
thing, like you said,

44
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,119
we've been monitoring it for a while

45
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,340
and it's evolved much like just

46
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:51,920
box product vulnerabilities had evolved

47
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,203
and how we think about it.
But at the end of the day

48
00:01:54,203 --> 00:01:55,460
it doesn't change our fundamental goal

49
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,130
which is to protect our assets

50
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:58,729
our customer's data, and make sure we have

51
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:00,750
resilient systems that
people can count on.

52
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,140
And so I think for us,

53
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:05,300
this is really reinforcing to a strategy

54
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,050
we started on about a
little over four years ago

55
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:08,579
which was called Zero Trust.

56
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,803
And the idea with Zero Trust really is,

57
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:13,200
it started it wasn't just related

58
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,989
to supply chain, but it benefited from it

59
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:16,730
which was just this
assumed breach position.

60
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:18,459
Just assume that you've
already been breached

61
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,293
and what are you to do.

62
00:02:19,293 --> 00:02:21,430
And that's that protect,
detect and respond.

63
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:23,390
And for us, we really simplified it

64
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,010
'cause I think the industry

65
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:29,100
and vendors and suppliers
third-party ourselves as well,

66
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,160
this is just our internal
view of how we define it.

67
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,150
So we simplified it down to,

68
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,010
it's gotta be about healthy device,

69
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:37,329
strong identity and persistent telemetry.

70
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:39,380
Which I ask every one of
my vendors to make sure

71
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:41,390
they show you how they
can make that happen.

72
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:44,470
And so this has really resulted
in this Zero Trust or bust

73
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:45,810
you know no exceptions model

74
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:47,830
that we have across the entire company

75
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:49,380
which we hold everyone accountable to.

76
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,870
And so I'm really fortunate
to be able to influence

77
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:54,440
and share my perspectives on what that is

78
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,060
and what we need from the
products to make sure we

79
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,250
can meet those requirements.

80
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,350
So I think the feedback
loop is amazing though,

81
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:01,799
it's great 'cause we
get to work on design.

82
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,180
Then we get to work under the deploy

83
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,350
and then does it work in use?

84
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,190
And so, you know

85
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:07,120
our goal is just to continue
automating this work

86
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,090
and reduce the dependencies
that we have on third parties.

87
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:11,210
I think most of my peers

88
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:12,540
in the industry are really big on this.

89
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,320
Can we do reduction of
suppliers just because

90
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,560
of the reduction in entropy, right?

91
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,730
The more sophisticated or
more complex the system is

92
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,220
the easier it is to find seams.

93
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,120
And so you get economies of scale

94
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,260
and a bunch of other components
that are part of that.

95
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,310
- Sure.

96
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,040
- So as I said, my CSOs are similar.

97
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,010
I've had a call with
them today and you know

98
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,799
it's a reduction and of a supplier

99
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,990
and continue to drive
this Zero Trust mentality.

100
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:38,850
So from you from the product side

101
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:39,850
and I'll put you in the hot seat.

102
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:40,760
- Alright.

103
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,952
- So tell me what have
you done for me lately?

104
00:03:42,952 --> 00:03:45,568
What are you doing for me on Zero Trust?

105
00:03:45,568 --> 00:03:48,770
- Well so actually I
really love that model

106
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,160
about complexity and thinking

107
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,109
about how the organizations
can manage complexity.

108
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:56,270
The first thing that we like
to think about is making sure

109
00:03:56,270 --> 00:04:00,070
that we do get as broad a view
as possible, and really think

110
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:02,459
about the end-to-end approach,
make sure that we work

111
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:05,620
with you about what is that
going to look like because

112
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,590
it's been this ongoing trend
of increasing complexity

113
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:12,730
and increasing sophistication
in the threat landscape.

114
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:15,250
And so the part that has gone along

115
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,709
with that in the security industry

116
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:19,539
is increasing complexity of the tools.

117
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,140
And what we have really pushed on

118
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:24,909
to try to do is help unify
all of those tools together

119
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:26,790
so that we can help you have a sort

120
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:29,930
of a more coherent view
about what's going on

121
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:34,100
in the estate across identity
and devices and end users,

122
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,760
all of those elements that
you were talking about

123
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,800
for Zero Trust and bring it
together in a single umbrella.

124
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,277
And then the second thing,

125
00:04:40,277 --> 00:04:43,610
and this really is where
it pays off to sit closely

126
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:44,910
with your customers and listen to them,

127
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,540
is thinking about how
do we protect everything

128
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,630
that you care about?

129
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:51,080
When we started this journey a decade ago,

130
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:55,070
we were very focused on
Microsoft products and services.

131
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,690
How do we protect Windows?

132
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:59,570
And you made it very clear that in fact

133
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:02,219
Microsoft has one of the
biggest Mac Estates out there,

134
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,740
and that we had to think about everything

135
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,190
in your environment

136
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:08,860
and how we tie that together
across multi-platforms

137
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,907
like Mac and Windows, multiple
clouds working together

138
00:05:11,907 --> 00:05:16,289
and how our tools XDR and SIM,
which are Microsoft Defender

139
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:18,820
and Azure Sentinel working together.

140
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,099
And then finally the,

141
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:23,130
perhaps the most important it
part is bringing some humility

142
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:26,270
to the table and a real eagerness to learn

143
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:28,169
from you and from our other customers

144
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:30,290
about what are the most valuable things

145
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:33,500
that we need to do in order to
solve your security problems

146
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,660
and to really help.

147
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:37,660
So let me actually turn it back over.

148
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,870
What's your, what advice would you give,

149
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,700
to customers and partners
listening to this

150
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,680
on what they should go
do first and foremost?

151
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,993
- I think really when I
think about this one is,

152
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:51,230
everything that we build is
your point about simplifying

153
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:53,390
and getting an end to end
view is super important.

154
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:56,240
When I go back to this device
identity and telemetry,

155
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,990
we really care about the telemetry

156
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,470
for one thing that's
super important is just

157
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:02,630
driving what the experience
is for the users.

158
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,820
And so we really have to really work

159
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:08,010
on the things like it's amazing to me.

160
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:10,210
I see, I guess my biggest piece of advice,

161
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:11,043
I see perfection get

162
00:06:11,043 --> 00:06:13,210
in the way of progress
with so many people.

163
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:15,010
And so when we started
on this two FA journey

164
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:16,810
like multi-factor authentication

165
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:19,740
or two factor authentication
a long time ago.

166
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,470
You know, we kept looking
at the perfect system

167
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:23,480
and then we tried to make it all software.

168
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,780
And some finally, you know

169
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,349
working with the Hello for Business team,

170
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:28,850
we got to this idea where we would just do

171
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:30,780
the facial recognition

172
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,003
and then expanded into other forms

173
00:06:32,003 --> 00:06:34,169
of two factor authentication.

174
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:38,190
But the idea was, you know,
as opposed to smart cards

175
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,740
and all these things that
made it really secure

176
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,120
but allows a user experience,

177
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,290
we wanted a great user
experience that was also secure

178
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:45,720
and having all the telemetry to tell us

179
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,130
whether it was working or wasn't working.

180
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:50,820
And so I'm amazed at how
many people, you know

181
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:53,670
like would get hung up
on not doing any two FA

182
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:55,420
until they could have a
hundred percent two FA.

183
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,960
And so getting on that path

184
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,030
of working through that was super helpful.

185
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:01,700
And, you know, we did start
with Windows Hello for Business

186
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,240
and then we used Authenticator to go

187
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,940
to the Mac and all the other non platforms

188
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:07,030
and worked with industry standards.

189
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:09,340
But we got to this model
where we had the telemetry

190
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,840
where users actually, the idea is

191
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,340
that users love it in the it
department actually trust it.

192
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,890
If I can get to that for everything we do,

193
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:18,080
then I feel really, really good about it.

194
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,270
- Yeah. Actually I think
back to some of the stories,

195
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:23,320
I think I've heard from you
about the employee feedback

196
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:26,200
on the early versions of two
FA systems with smart cards

197
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,670
and their experiences
of trying to use those.

198
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:31,410
- Yeah well I think we were the classic

199
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:32,840
hammer and nail scenario.

200
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,277
Like we had the cards like
everybody thought I said,

201
00:07:35,277 --> 00:07:36,610
"Oh, let's make it software.

202
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:38,430
We'll just implement it
in the computer itself."

203
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:41,420
As opposed to stepping
back and saying, you know

204
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,710
really this is idea being
envisioned led as opposed to,

205
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:46,560
"Oh, two FA's really good
for high privilege accounts.

206
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,180
Let's just make two FA everywhere."

207
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,780
I would literally see people recoil

208
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,380
when we'd say two FA everywhere.

209
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:55,270
As opposed to, what if I changed
it to eliminate passwords.

210
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:57,669
'Cause eliminate passwords, every user,

211
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:58,940
I think it's the only time in execratory

212
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,011
they've ever gotten an applause.

213
00:08:00,011 --> 00:08:02,370
It's like when we eliminate passwords

214
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:04,160
we're driving to the same set of goals

215
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,680
but how you get there
so radically different.

216
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,740
And so this idea of eliminating
passwords is super important

217
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,300
and that was really that third leg

218
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,930
of the stool around ensuring
we have all the telemetry

219
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:16,560
so that we can get feedback
real-time from our users.

220
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,393
Is it working?

221
00:08:17,393 --> 00:08:18,226
Is it not use?

222
00:08:18,226 --> 00:08:19,059
Is it not working?

223
00:08:19,059 --> 00:08:21,260
And not just count on
customer satisfaction surveys

224
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,650
but actually real telemetry to tell us

225
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:24,700
whether we're doing
the right things or not

226
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,423
was super important. And the
other one, I think that's one

227
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:28,140
of the things most customers ask me is,

228
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,039
how did you turn on device health?

229
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,380
And how did you turn on, you know

230
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,650
two FA without an uprising
from your employees?

231
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:36,380
And there's some percentage
that are always gonna do,

232
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:38,539
you know, it's I fear change
and whatever it might be.

233
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:41,569
But I think when we gave
people a choice, when we said,

234
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:43,327
yes you have to have,
you don't have a choice

235
00:08:43,327 --> 00:08:44,980
and you have to have a
healthy device to connect

236
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,000
to the environment.

237
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,266
That doesn't mean I have to provide it.

238
00:08:47,266 --> 00:08:48,520
If you want to bring your own device,

239
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,180
that's fine we can manage that.

240
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,500
If you want to use a home PC

241
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,680
but you don't want us to manage it,

242
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,750
that's fine too, we'll give
you a virtualized experience.

243
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,950
So I get a healthy device
because it's all virtualized.

244
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:59,980
And so our users have a
lot of different choices

245
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:03,440
between mobile non-Windows, et
cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

246
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,170
And so, you know, having the telemetry

247
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,599
and this concept of digital empathy,

248
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,540
providing users choice, and
again, making that thing

249
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,650
in the back of your
head, you got to do both.

250
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,800
You got to have the people who love it.

251
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,569
And IT department said trust it.

252
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:19,950
- Not that there's any
spirit of competition

253
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:21,310
between the product teams,

254
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:24,750
but let me ask you this
important question,

255
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:28,163
as our closest and perhaps
most demanding customer,

256
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,620
what do you think is your best dollar

257
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:33,430
spent on security tools
or maybe differently

258
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:36,959
if you had a tight restricted budget,

259
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,140
where would you spend it for?

260
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,569
- Which I do.
- Which you do.

261
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:41,260
- That's because you
keep taking my budget.

262
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,414
So, no, I'm just teasing.

263
00:09:42,414 --> 00:09:44,370
- Why do you say that's
definitely not true.

264
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:45,870
- Definitely not true I get it.

265
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,500
Well, I think it, I think I'd break down

266
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,333
the problem a little bit

267
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:50,530
into the three areas that
I actually spend money on.

268
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:54,180
And so I look at commercial
off the shelf products

269
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,339
that are provided by suppliers

270
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:58,130
such as you across Microsoft,
even outside of Microsoft.

271
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,720
Then I look at the things
that I build custom

272
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,550
'cause they either don't meet
my needs or they don't exist.

273
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:04,510
And then I look at one of the biggest

274
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:05,720
investment areas is talent.

275
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,780
And they're sort of in interplay,

276
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,520
when you say what's the best dollar spent

277
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,020
is what lets me be most
leveraged across all of that.

278
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,170
- Sure.
- Right?

279
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:16,000
And I will say, if I was
to ask my team, which I do,

280
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,900
I pool my team on,

281
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,260
where do you think we did the
best with spending our money?

282
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,980
And you know, where could
we have done better?

283
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,980
And what are we thinking about next year?

284
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,300
Right now the secure operation center

285
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,209
on the team would tell me

286
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:28,610
that the Windows Defender is
by far the best investment

287
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:30,650
in the dollars that we spent so far.

288
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:32,130
I'm not saying that just
'cause you're interviewing me,

289
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:33,970
you know, I've said
this in front of our CEO

290
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:36,020
and others and customers before.

291
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,500
Because it does help me unify

292
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,180
was a complex environment
where I had over six solutions

293
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:43,209
and now I'm down to, they'll
be down to one this year

294
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:46,700
where we have an amazing
set of capabilities,

295
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:49,010
an amazing set of visibility

296
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:51,430
across the environment
that I didn't have before,

297
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:52,930
but it also lets me retire

298
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:55,819
some custom stuff I had to go, right.

299
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:58,320
That was amazing technology
that now is just commoditized.

300
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,990
And, you know, because we can amortize it

301
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:01,990
across the entire customer base.

302
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:04,540
And then lastly, and
probably most importantly,

303
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,199
all that means that it's not having

304
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,590
to train people on five systems.

305
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:09,540
And it means people who
are being more effective

306
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,030
and more efficient every day.

307
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:12,390
And it means people who are happier

308
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:14,050
because the jobs and
the work they're doing

309
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:15,420
or the value add part of the thing

310
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,800
versus some of the other
things they were doing before.

311
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,790
So when I look at, you know, simplicity

312
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:24,099
and then view better use of
people's time and resource

313
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,520
happier employees and less custom code

314
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,760
that I have to maintain for a long time,

315
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,580
yeah by far it's been the best solution

316
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:33,490
that we've prior for the last two years.

317
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:35,063
You have some hot competition though

318
00:11:35,063 --> 00:11:36,577
from the Sentinel team,
but I'm just telling you

319
00:11:36,577 --> 00:11:38,130
you're doing a great job.

320
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,330
- Well, I admire that team
and what they're building.

321
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:43,810
And so I am gratified, but
I do like the way you put it

322
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:46,349
this idea about like freeing up the team

323
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:49,540
so they can focus on more strategic issues

324
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,900
and making sure that we're giving them

325
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,280
as useful tools as possible.

326
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:56,370
As I do have to ask you to
put a dollar in the tip jar

327
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:57,870
'cause you said Windows Defender.

328
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,420
And in our series of rebranding,

329
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,160
we're up to Microsoft Defenders.

330
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:01,992
- It's terrible.

331
00:12:01,993 --> 00:12:02,826
I don't know that,

332
00:12:02,826 --> 00:12:04,310
I don't understand all the branding stuff.

333
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:06,670
- I made a promise that I
won't change the product names

334
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:07,955
for at least another 12 months.

335
00:12:07,956 --> 00:12:09,980
So really we're locked in.

336
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,640
- Fantastic. I'm sorry.

337
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,699
- No worries.

338
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,400
So as I think back over the past year

339
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,480
with the sudden change
in how everybody worked,

340
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,150
it was really interesting to watch that

341
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:22,569
for a number of companies
that were further ahead

342
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:24,240
on that Zero Trust journey, they were

343
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,910
it was an easier transition

344
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,910
because they were already
in that mindset of like,

345
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:30,270
Oh, all of my employees
might be running around

346
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:33,329
on the internet anyway and
I'll just act like that.

347
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:36,740
As we're starting to think
now about people coming back,

348
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,314
I'm sure that it'll be
a little bit different

349
00:12:38,314 --> 00:12:40,949
because some people will
come all the way back fast

350
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:42,920
and then some will want to
work in a different way.

351
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,349
But what do you think the future

352
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:46,320
of work will look like that environment?

353
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,240
And how do you think about securing that?

354
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,323
- Yeah, I think we, I mentioned

355
00:12:49,323 --> 00:12:51,010
that we did a lot of the COVID response.

356
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:52,933
So sending people away
from their work environment

357
00:12:52,933 --> 00:12:54,340
when we did shelter-in-place

358
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:57,130
and those things was pretty
rapidly over 72 hours

359
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:00,950
you go from 10% on premise
or 10% remote workforce,

360
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:02,220
to 97% remote.

361
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,950
Like I would look at the badge
ins by building every day,

362
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:08,210
you know, and I would start
with as well in this scenario

363
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:11,480
I do have great sympathy,
both sympathy and empathy.

364
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,710
Like we were very lucky
in the tech industry to

365
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:16,070
be able to continue to
work through most of that.

366
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:17,060
And many people have seen

367
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:19,109
and we've been fairly
productive through that process.

368
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:21,160
And then, you know, you
look at service industries

369
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,188
and transportation
industries and not everybody,

370
00:13:23,188 --> 00:13:26,480
it wasn't an equitable impact financially.

371
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,620
And so whatever we can do to
help those things be better

372
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:30,453
and be more effective,

373
00:13:30,453 --> 00:13:32,720
I think we, you know, we need
to continue to work on that.

374
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,850
I do think, as you mentioned

375
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:37,180
if you're already on a
digital transformation

376
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:39,780
you'd largely made your work more digital,

377
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,680
it was much easier to, you know

378
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,479
make that transition to remote work.

379
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,290
And if you did it in a way
that incorporated Zero Trust,

380
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:48,449
where you again,

381
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:50,690
you don't think of the network
as ineffective control plane

382
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:52,920
you think of identity as a perimeter

383
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,729
and device health is the key to it.

384
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:57,030
And then collecting telemetry all the time

385
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:59,890
for both user experience
and anomaly detection

386
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:01,449
it wasn't a massive transition.

387
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:02,300
Like I mentioned

388
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,490
10% remote workforce to
97% remote workforce.

389
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:07,010
The biggest complaint
I heard from customers

390
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:09,100
with their VPNs are getting hammered.

391
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,630
Back to our point on patch
Tuesday in particular.

392
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:15,013
And so, and for us that
wasn't the case like we had,

393
00:14:15,989 --> 00:14:16,850
I can't remember exactly what it was

394
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:18,154
but it's less than, I know it was less

395
00:14:18,154 --> 00:14:21,560
than 5% increase in VPN
capacity was required

396
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,829
because we already were doing that.

397
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:24,390
And as people, you know

398
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:26,120
will return it'll be interesting.

399
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:30,090
It's a lot more work, the
return to work at their stages

400
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:33,140
and there's, and well,
because sending you home

401
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,610
you are responsible for what
you had to do in your home.

402
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:37,520
But when we bring people
back into the workplace

403
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,140
now you have to have, you
know, social distancing,

404
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:42,090
the sanitary environments

405
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:45,130
and all these other things that
you didn't have to plan for.

406
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:46,050
- I hadn't even thought about it.

407
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:47,520
- Yeah it's much much more work,

408
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,660
much more work and switching
and changing offices

409
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:53,510
and using technology to go
do that and ensuring that

410
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:54,590
you don't have four people sitting

411
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:55,820
in the same office when they come in.

412
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:59,210
And so there's a lot of
things to use technology for.

413
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:00,830
And there's also a lot of examples

414
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:02,880
where we want to make sure
and maintain the security

415
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,350
and privacy of everybody in that scenario.

416
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:07,440
Like even the question today,
did you get a vaccination yet?

417
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,550
And they said, how did you get it?

418
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:11,339
That's really a very encroaching question

419
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,220
to ask somebody that, right?

420
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,740
'Cause you could have helped
me, whatever it might be.

421
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,820
You could be asking age.

422
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:19,460
So it's really a very different
workplace to come back to.

423
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,750
But I think from a
technology perspective, again

424
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:24,840
if you think of the devices,
I think people get confused.

425
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,750
Like I hear this all the time.

426
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:28,793
Oh, it's such an easy job
being the CSO at Microsoft.

427
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:30,600
- Who said really?

428
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,260
- Sasha always tells me that.

429
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:34,430
Nobody says no, but I
mean, it's the, you know

430
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:36,040
you just have to protect Windows.

431
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:36,890
- Right.

432
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:39,310
- And it's like we just
have to make, you know

433
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:41,671
Microsoft Defender for
Windows, but it's not right?

434
00:15:41,672 --> 00:15:42,505
- Piece of cake.

435
00:15:42,505 --> 00:15:43,340
- Yeah, exactly.

436
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:46,330
And so, you know, we
run, I think last time

437
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:48,710
I looked there was like 31
versions of operating systems.

438
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:50,840
Plus as you know, we have the next version

439
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,280
of operating system for which

440
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,230
all of our third parties
haven't yet tested on.

441
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:58,080
So I think that, and you know, we run iOS

442
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:01,420
we run Android, we run Mac
some windows phones still.

443
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:04,829
And it's, supposed to say that either way.

444
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:07,900
I mean, but we do have an
amazing diverse environment

445
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,740
that represents both from an end point

446
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,860
but the cloud services we use as well.

447
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:14,480
And so really I'm just
like any other customer

448
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,360
any other large global enterprise customer

449
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,790
with a mixed environment.

450
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:20,380
And in the Zero Trust model, you know

451
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:23,530
shifting that idea that my
control points go to the endpoint

452
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:25,490
which includes services, devices,

453
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:27,010
and all the telemetry around those.

454
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:29,660
And again, the cornerstone being identity

455
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:30,574
is that new perimeter.

456
00:16:30,575 --> 00:16:33,140
That's really key that we
have to keep doing that.

457
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:36,340
And so I think that my ability to do that,

458
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,850
in a way that's cost-effective,

459
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:41,530
in that can continue to utilize
the talent more effectively.

460
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:43,220
'Cause I'd love to say
I have infinite budget,

461
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,300
but even if I did the
talent, doesn't exist,

462
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,670
with 3.2 million jobs will be
left on open in this space.

463
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:51,469
And so I, we just don't have
the talent to go do that.

464
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:54,460
So how do we get technology
to give us better economies

465
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:56,360
and utilization of the
talent that we have?

466
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,330
That's, those will be the
things that we'll focus

467
00:16:58,330 --> 00:16:59,390
on with anything.

468
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:00,560
And that is hard.

469
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,890
And for a lot of people
haven't done that switch,

470
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:04,050
just think about our environment,

471
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:06,869
10 million endpoints on multiple OSs,

472
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:10,179
versus network security
which is 9,000 devices,

473
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,079
all operating system agnostic.

474
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,659
- Yeah. That's actually
a huge scale problem.

475
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:14,920
- It's big yeah, big difference

476
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,720
but so much better fidelity of data

477
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,123
and so much better ability to see things

478
00:17:19,123 --> 00:17:20,869
that you couldn't do before.

479
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:23,790
- Well, we actually, when
we talk about that strategy,

480
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:27,119
the not approved marketing phrase for it,

481
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,139
is a big brain in the cloud,
which is essentially this,

482
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,440
Oh we're going to scatter as many sensors

483
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,990
as we can into as many
corners of the environment

484
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:37,170
like all of those 10 million devices.

485
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:39,580
And then we're going to get
aggregate all that data together

486
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,850
in one place so that we can run

487
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:43,570
machine learning around big data.

488
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:45,870
And then try to give you
a more insightful view

489
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:48,270
of what's happening
across all of that stuff

490
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:51,340
even when it's wandering
around outside of the network.

491
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:53,050
- Well, I think in, and of course

492
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:55,610
while respecting the
privacy issues around it

493
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:57,709
but when you can take a global footprint,

494
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,870
you take over, you know,
whatever, how many billions

495
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,989
of authentication we do in
a given day and then the

496
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:05,010
you know, billion plus
devices that we look at

497
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:06,010
so we can see that.

498
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:08,330
And then allow me to take
your global knowledge

499
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:10,260
and then apply it to my local environment.

500
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,830
That's that's like the win-win for me.

501
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:13,830
- Yeah. Well, and a big part

502
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:16,320
of how we hope we can
help your security team

503
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,500
as you were saying earlier,
get onto those strategic tasks

504
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,240
because they get that benefit
of that global perspective

505
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,030
that global view and hopefully
we've helped fix some

506
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:27,690
of the day-to-day automation stuff.

507
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,200
So that then they also have the time.

508
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,360
- Yeah, no, I think you have,

509
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,193
I think it would be interesting though

510
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,620
when you think about return
for work and that sort of

511
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,330
this is what we're doing for our employees

512
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:36,250
and things we're doing in the proc

513
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,770
you lay it on a few of the big pieces

514
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:39,379
but it would be the top
three things you think

515
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,630
about from a product
delivery when you think

516
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:43,630
of a return to work scenario.

517
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:44,560
- Well, it is interesting

518
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,409
'cause a bunch of it is this continuity.

519
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:47,243
So I'll break it up.

520
00:18:47,243 --> 00:18:49,110
There's like things that
are gonna be the same,

521
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:51,149
things that are going to be different.

522
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:53,660
And a lot of the strategy that we're on,

523
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:55,192
as we've been discussing,

524
00:18:55,192 --> 00:18:59,110
the Zero Trust model
really continues forward.

525
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,750
But I think it puts even more emphasis

526
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,380
on this thread we keep pulling at,

527
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:05,540
which is the security
teams being more efficient.

528
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:06,930
How can we really make sure

529
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:09,520
that we help them do their jobs better?

530
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,660
Certainly the big brain in the
cloud is a big part of that,

531
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:16,500
but really AI to help
them get insights faster,

532
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,940
automation to help them
do the job more quickly.

533
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:22,700
Any place where we can
automate an investigation

534
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,310
or automate the remediation of something

535
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:27,159
that happened on an end point is something

536
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,330
that we really want to go after.

537
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:31,120
There's been a lot of investigation

538
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,419
in the years in security into this notion

539
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:35,390
of correlation and keep
bringing up telemetry.

540
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:37,855
If I can find a piece of
data from the identity system

541
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:39,350
and combine that with something I see

542
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:42,919
from the end point and see
this user across those devices

543
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,740
something weird happened, then
it can have a real insight.

544
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:47,823
But what we've learned over the years is

545
00:19:47,823 --> 00:19:49,550
that if you just do that blindly,

546
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:52,470
you end up with very sparse data

547
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:55,020
or unnecessary false positives.

548
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:58,070
And so making it really useful
is actually been this back

549
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,659
and forth with your team,

550
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:03,030
on are these the insights
that really helped you

551
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:05,310
and how do we actually
take the investigation

552
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:07,500
and actually run it more the way you would

553
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,850
so that we can produce insights
that are much more useful?

554
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:12,480
And then mapped up into the framework

555
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,210
that your team understands,
like the MITRE ATT&CK framework

556
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:18,480
and using that for
simulations to help drive how

557
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,480
we measure the quality of the tool.

558
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,020
- But I think before, let's
talk about that for a sec

559
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:27,260
to be a little honest with the crowd here.

560
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,093
So when we first were doing this,

561
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:30,590
I think I see this even
when we built our own AI

562
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:34,050
and automation, which is
when you first go do big data

563
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:35,409
or big brain work

564
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:37,780
and what you end up
getting is more detections.

565
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:38,613
- Yeah.

566
00:20:38,613 --> 00:20:40,320
- And what you end up doing
is giving your SOC team,

567
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,153
your security team,

568
00:20:41,153 --> 00:20:43,830
a longer list of work
that they already had,

569
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:45,659
that they then have to
go vet and find out.

570
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,620
And so then you go, okay

571
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:50,010
how do I tune it so I get
rid of the false positives?

572
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:52,350
What's interesting, and this
is like the evolution I've seen

573
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:54,280
from the products we've done with you,

574
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,670
which is super helpful, is
like I see when people tell me

575
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:59,220
they're still trying to
turn to no false positives,

576
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,470
that tells me on the maturity curve

577
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:01,830
they still got a ways to go.

578
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:02,780
'Cause what's more interesting

579
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:05,700
is when you get to
benign positives, right?

580
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,580
And so, but that's super important

581
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:10,040
because once you've, we
got our false positive way

582
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,370
way down now I have
these benign positives.

583
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:14,989
So that's like the difference
between like, you know

584
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:17,110
spam versus actually malware, right?

585
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,129
It's kind of that kind of a thing.

586
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:21,800
And so the idea that you automate the find

587
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,840
then you automate the fix.

588
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,322
That's when we really have it.

589
00:21:25,323 --> 00:21:28,194
- Sure and that's where
we're starting to dig into.

590
00:21:28,194 --> 00:21:30,409
We certainly have that
capability in the product.

591
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:32,960
It is one of those things
where I've heard this

592
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,910
from you and for this
from other customers.

593
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:37,410
There's some stuff that
is so clear and obvious

594
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:38,350
we should just go do it.

595
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:40,179
Like yes, quarantine that phishing email

596
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,393
just take care of that.

597
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:45,889
Or the executable that we
thought was appropriate.

598
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:47,150
And then all of a sudden acted funny.

599
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:49,590
Yes, just quarantine that and isolate that

600
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:50,899
take it off the box.

601
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,760
But there are a lot of
operations where we still

602
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:55,511
want to look for approval
and human interaction

603
00:21:55,511 --> 00:21:58,960
and make sure that we get the
blessing of the security team

604
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,210
that this is the right
security direction to go into.

605
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:05,220
But you actually, with the
false positive conversation,

606
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:08,520
I love it because when I
start talking about AI and ML,

607
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,740
I think a lot of security
folks get worried

608
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,430
that there's this vision of, you know,

609
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:14,870
the machines are going to
solve all of these problems.

610
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:16,610
Like if we can just make them smart enough

611
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:18,270
then security will be solved.

612
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:22,210
And I'm pretty convicted that
that's not where we're going.

613
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:24,720
That is actually this journey of feedback

614
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,670
from your team to our researchers

615
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:28,980
around what looks good
and what is most helpful.

616
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,650
And then the big data
machine analytics is actually

617
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:35,490
this force multiplier on,
hey, the making those turn

618
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:38,610
into insights you can use
every day rather than...

619
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:41,060
- Yeah. I think this is where
marketing hasn't helped us.

620
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,510
I think that this idea of
artificial intelligence

621
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:46,176
if they would always just called
it augmented intelligence,

622
00:22:46,176 --> 00:22:48,500
I had this great great opportunity to work

623
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,680
with Kasparov the chess player,

624
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,550
the first one to play IBM in chess, right?

625
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:53,383
- Yeah.

626
00:22:53,383 --> 00:22:56,810
- And today the best chess
masters is not computer

627
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:58,639
to computer or computer against human.

628
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,090
It is human aided by computer.

629
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:02,620
And that's how I look at the SOC.

630
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,399
I don't want a tier one SOC analyst.

631
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,710
I want that should go
away because no person

632
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:07,780
enjoys being a tier one.

633
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:10,350
So they want to be a tier two
or they want to be a Hunter.

634
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:13,389
And so having augmented
intelligence with all that stuff

635
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:14,510
that you're doing so that those people

636
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:16,280
can be much more effective,

637
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:19,270
that is I think one, it
makes them more happy

638
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:21,530
and more reassured that it's
not about getting, you know

639
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:23,040
having everything be
automated because yeah

640
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,010
people aren't comfortable, right?

641
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:26,530
That's that idea of, turn on audit first

642
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,060
before you turn on enforcement

643
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:30,690
and it's the same idea with
augmented intelligence.

644
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:33,057
Then these people can just
be so much more effective.

645
00:23:33,057 --> 00:23:35,240
And there's case after case after case

646
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,810
of all the highest end people,

647
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:40,010
chess players, formula one
drivers, et cetera, et cetera,

648
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:43,129
that are, it's always with a
computer aided augmentation

649
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:43,970
of human skill set

650
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:46,030
that you get the performance
out of something.

651
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:48,230
- Sure, and multiple
points of view and go fast.

652
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:49,380
- I'm sure the world's not going to change

653
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:50,430
to augmented intelligence,

654
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:51,754
I just wished we didn't set it that way.

655
00:23:51,754 --> 00:23:54,730
- We'll get marketing to there.

656
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:57,370
The last thing on this point,
I just want to highlight

657
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:59,889
refer back to underscore
the thing you said around,

658
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:03,230
okay, let's when we come
back to the workplace,

659
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:05,500
let's actually not change our stance

660
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,890
around how these machines operate.

661
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:09,420
Let's continue to operate in
a mode where the user feels

662
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:12,068
like they're out on
the internet and where,

663
00:24:12,068 --> 00:24:17,068
in fact we've been able to
contain the connectivity

664
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,066
between those devices

665
00:24:18,066 --> 00:24:21,720
and other things that might
even be more sensitive.

666
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,480
And it seems like that kind of a shift,

667
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,640
is something that we really want to

668
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,653
build tools that help companies do that.

669
00:24:27,653 --> 00:24:29,860
- Well, I think it's a
design goal though, right?

670
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,330
I think it's, from my perspective

671
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:32,699
if you assume it's internet

672
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:35,160
or you assume breach,
you design differently.

673
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:35,993
- Yeah.
- Right?

674
00:24:35,993 --> 00:24:37,399
And I think that, and that's how you get,

675
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,090
you need our employees
to think differently.

676
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:41,230
You need our staff to design differently.

677
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:44,810
And the reality is that not
everyone is coming back.

678
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:47,460
Like some people are going
to continue to work remotely.

679
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,610
I think there's going to be some,

680
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:50,750
there'll be a couple of things
that I think are interesting

681
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:52,290
we haven't figured out yet though.

682
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:54,450
Impossible travel is one
of those common things

683
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:55,590
you do with data.

684
00:24:55,590 --> 00:25:00,590
And so now we're going to see
a much more diverse time span

685
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,720
of work employee work like
for, you know what I'm saying?

686
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,210
Like, people won't just work
from home in their local town

687
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:07,300
they may move two hours

688
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:10,659
or they move more than
your, more to family.

689
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:13,490
So the idea of what's local, what's not,

690
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:15,410
that whole premise is
going to break up as far

691
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:17,380
as you know, how people think
about what home based is.

692
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:19,000
And that's going to be interesting for us.

693
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,830
- Yeah. I've started to see
that already where it's all

694
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:23,350
of a sudden the like get
together for a meeting.

695
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:25,590
The "where are you" becomes a very

696
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:27,030
interesting opener of the conversation

697
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:27,863
- Well I've called you.

698
00:25:27,863 --> 00:25:30,137
And you've been, you know, in
Les Bois the Valley of Trees

699
00:25:30,137 --> 00:25:32,780
you're eight hours away by car

700
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:34,629
but only one hour by time zone,

701
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:35,570
but it does change, right?

702
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:36,403
'Cause the meeting's changing.

703
00:25:36,403 --> 00:25:37,930
So when you're figuring,

704
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:40,440
when you're looking at that
as a behavioral pattern,

705
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,790
is that a normal pattern or not

706
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:42,980
or what kind of flag does that raise?

707
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,040
So I think that'll be one of the things

708
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,460
that'll be super
interesting for us to go do.

709
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:48,470
And then I think it'll be
really important that we ensure

710
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:50,510
how do you make sure those
are still inclusive meetings?

711
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:53,160
And that mixed modeling,
that's not a security issue

712
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:56,351
but it's a fundamental concern
I have 'cause I just that's

713
00:25:56,351 --> 00:25:59,210
you don't have happy and
productive workforces

714
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:01,120
if they don't feel like they're
being included and heard.

715
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,969
So how do you do that in that
all remote is an equalizer.

716
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:08,380
But 10 people in a room
and four people out,

717
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:10,270
is a very different
dynamic, as we all know.

718
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:12,220
So how do we get the great
balance we've learned

719
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:14,510
and still make it all work, but
that's not a security issue.

720
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:15,960
That's just me pontificating.

721
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:18,520
- Well, you know, we're
solving a lot of problems here.

722
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,148
We fixed artificial intelligence,

723
00:26:20,148 --> 00:26:21,016
we got a new way of working.

724
00:26:21,017 --> 00:26:23,460
- Got a new name for
candles are all burning.

725
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,980
It's all good.

726
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:28,820
- So back to the basics, the
fundamentals, ground people,

727
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:31,649
key takeaways on things
that they should go do

728
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:34,110
today to go secure their organizations.

729
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:35,790
- Yeah. I, you know, I always feel bad

730
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:37,580
'cause it's so uninspiring when I say it,

731
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:38,852
as I mentioned before.

732
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:41,290
The pedestrian like the AI

733
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:42,511
and all the other stuff is amazing.

734
00:26:42,511 --> 00:26:45,850
And we do massively leverage those things.

735
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:48,209
But the pedestrian part of
the job, you can't forget.

736
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:49,700
Like when I look at numbers that less

737
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,880
than 20% of enterprises
have a a hundred percent

738
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:55,880
multi-factor authentication,
you got to get that done right?

739
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,420
People aren't patching
more than 60% of breaches

740
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:00,070
are caused by patches that were available

741
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:01,540
that never got applied.

742
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:04,300
And so, you know, you still
have to do the basics,

743
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,419
you got to get things patched

744
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:06,760
and you got to keep them updated.

745
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:09,280
It's necessary, but not sufficient, right?

746
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:12,550
And you get to really
think about this idea

747
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:14,050
and particularly security practitioners

748
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:16,110
about progress as a path to perfection

749
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:17,850
not perfection before you make progress.

750
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:19,360
Like don't hold people there.

751
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,944
- I can just interject there.

752
00:27:20,944 --> 00:27:21,777
- Yeah please.
- I love that.

753
00:27:21,777 --> 00:27:24,200
I always ended up talking to,

754
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,180
when I talked to security teams

755
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:28,050
and I look at their to-do list

756
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:29,431
on the basics and the fundamentals.

757
00:27:29,431 --> 00:27:30,264
- Yeah.

758
00:27:30,264 --> 00:27:31,909
- My instantaneous reaction is like,

759
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:34,290
man you're never going to get done.

760
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:35,600
The list is too long.

761
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,091
You will just never get
to the end of that list.

762
00:27:38,092 --> 00:27:40,500
And then as a tool builder,
that gets me excited

763
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,540
because it makes me want to help more

764
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:44,590
on how can I help prioritize that list

765
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:46,709
and give more insight
about the threat landscape

766
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:49,450
and build tools that will
give the security teams

767
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:51,010
the view of all of a sudden

768
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:52,840
there is something new on the landscapes.

769
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,709
And so we have to shove that issue up

770
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:56,800
to the top of the list
and take care of it first.

771
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,633
- Yeah. And I do think,

772
00:27:57,633 --> 00:27:59,630
I think even my own
team struggled with that

773
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:01,400
like when I look up
some of those long lists

774
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,230
when I first came into
this thing, which was,

775
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:06,020
it's also really important to step back

776
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,129
and ask yourself to your point,

777
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:09,270
how do you use technology to
automate a lot of this stuff?

778
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:12,200
Because I always see, I
see the list of requests

779
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,130
for people and everything
else, and they're valid.

780
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:17,350
But I think it was, one
of the venture people

781
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:18,183
was always telling me like,

782
00:28:18,183 --> 00:28:19,490
figure out how you can use technology

783
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:22,630
to get four times the
output with half the people.

784
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:24,620
Not because you're going
to use half the people

785
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,229
but because of the design contract

786
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:27,330
and the things you invest in

787
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:29,110
are the things that give
you those kinds of return.

788
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:29,943
- Right.

789
00:28:29,943 --> 00:28:31,950
- And so I think that
that's super important

790
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:34,780
that people really do spend time on

791
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:37,120
is there a way to simplify
your supplier strategy?

792
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,760
So again, you're not,
you don't have people

793
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,210
that are your most valuable resource

794
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:43,685
or even most expensive resource as well.

795
00:28:43,685 --> 00:28:45,419
So that you can get force
multipliers out of that.

796
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:47,707
And so I think that's super important.

797
00:28:47,707 --> 00:28:50,860
And I also, like I said,
I've seen the satisfaction

798
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:52,570
in people who aren't just running through

799
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:53,700
the same process over and over.

800
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:54,970
Like they're doing more interesting work

801
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:55,803
and I think that's also super helpful.

802
00:28:55,803 --> 00:28:57,460
- Makes them happier.
- Yeah, it does.

803
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:59,500
And that's really key. And I
think the other thing though

804
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,060
that security people need to keep in mind,

805
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:02,700
so, you know, it's just said

806
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:06,260
stay current progress over
perfection, automation.

807
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:08,129
And I think lastly, this point

808
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:10,430
about digital empathy
that you build a listening

809
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:13,510
system that just like
we have a feedback loop

810
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:15,836
with me as a customer
and you as a supplier,

811
00:29:15,836 --> 00:29:18,350
I'm a piece of a Mac, I'm
a supplier or a vendor

812
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:20,090
but I'm also with the user base like that

813
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:22,470
people make sure they build
that kind of telemetry

814
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:24,460
into the system because you
become part of the solution

815
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:25,530
with your user base.

816
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:27,680
So that'd be the last thing I'd mentioned.

817
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:30,320
- Great, Bret, thank you for the time,

818
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,419
the conversation, thank
you for all the feedback

819
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:35,490
over the years and working
with the product team.

820
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:37,230
Thank you everyone for your time.

821
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:38,200
- Yeah. Super exciting.

822
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,470
Thanks for letting me come.

823
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:41,160
And obviously we spend a lot of time

824
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,870
giving requirements, seeing if they work.

825
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:44,500
And I think it's been super helpful.

826
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:47,180
Hopefully it's helped
make our products better

827
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:48,410
for customers that are using them

828
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:50,310
'cause we get to test them here first.
