1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:02,810
- My name is Richard White.

2
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:04,760
And thank you for
attending this presentation

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:06,900
on Cybersecurity Metrics Development

4
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,350
for Board and Risk Committee Reporting.

5
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:12,840
Before I begin, I would like to thank RSA

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,879
for providing this opportunity to me.

7
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,700
And I would also like
to thank Flushing Bank

8
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:21,530
for supporting me throughout
this entire effort. Thank you.

9
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:23,600
Things we're going to talk about today

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,020
with regard to cybersecurity metrics,

11
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:28,560
how they're developed,

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,069
why they're important

13
00:00:30,069 --> 00:00:32,592
and how they need to evolve over time.

14
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:37,630
It's no misunderstanding

15
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:40,620
that board members are holding

16
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,769
the CISO, CIO and CRO more accountable

17
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:47,040
for not having the right information

18
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,839
in front of them to make a decision.

19
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:53,790
And in that context, lots of articles

20
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:58,080
both academic and commercial are available

21
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,839
and we have two of them that
I'd like to provide you,

22
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,590
if you would like to see them.

23
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:07,170
One is thycotic.com and the
other one is forbes.com,

24
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:10,090
both focused on how boards need to have

25
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:11,630
the right information in front of them

26
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:16,473
to reduce risk and influence
risk over a period of time.

27
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,740
So cybersecurity metrics
before we get into

28
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:23,750
the development of them

29
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,580
we wanna learn a little bit about them.

30
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:30,070
Cybersecurity metrics have to
have a couple of properties.

31
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:33,160
The first one is utility.

32
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,440
Now all of these bullets
on here are things

33
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,259
that the board wants to accomplish

34
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,030
with cybersecurity metrics,

35
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:44,550
and more importantly, it can
help lead to your success,

36
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:46,380
your cyber programs success,

37
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,880
and your organization's success.

38
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,350
But more importantly,
cybersecurity metrics

39
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:55,419
need to be actionable.

40
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:58,320
And without the ability

41
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,119
of a board decision to effect
cost, maturity, or risk,

42
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,470
your reporting may be,

43
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:09,710
may be muted, it may
have less of an impact

44
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:12,940
if it's not bucketed
right or messaged right

45
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:16,368
with regard to what your expectations are,

46
00:02:16,368 --> 00:02:20,299
and the reason for reporting that metric.

47
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,260
When I was a CISO at the capitol police,

48
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:25,950
the prior to my arrival,

49
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:30,899
the capitol police had
very vague cyber metrics

50
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,610
but they didn't want to change them

51
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,760
because they were used to them.

52
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,829
The chief of police, the deputy chief,

53
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:38,340
the senate sergeant at arms,

54
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:43,340
they lightly not pretended,
but they lightly understood

55
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,929
why the metrics needed to evolve

56
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:49,000
to be more informative and
better decision-making.

57
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,610
But it wasn't something
that they had a high degree

58
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:55,940
of intent to apply resources to.

59
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:59,040
So eventually, I'm gonna use this term

60
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,113
and feel free to take it away.

61
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:07,210
I applied gentle pressure over
a prolonged period of time.

62
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:09,280
I never ceased,

63
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,110
I continue to ask questions

64
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:15,450
and continue to describe the
benefit of refined metrics.

65
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:18,060
And eventually I was successful.

66
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,020
I'm going to tell you

67
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:21,623
about the feedback later
on in the presentation.

68
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:29,190
So when I was the managing
director for Oxford Solutions,

69
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,100
one of the things that I did

70
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:35,200
as an executive in that organization

71
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,119
is I went on CISO for hire calls,

72
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,380
I went on bank sites,

73
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,730
I went on commercial sites,

74
00:03:43,469 --> 00:03:46,269
and I was there to help
them fix an audit problem,

75
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:48,950
fix a engineering problem,

76
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:51,630
or generally improve the reporting

77
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:54,023
and viability of their cyber program.

78
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:58,750
Now, I noticed that all of the customers

79
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:02,453
that I went to visit as a CISO for hire,

80
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:06,410
with few exceptions, I can't say 100%

81
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:10,010
but most of them, they
had very similar goals.

82
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:11,560
They want the board to be informed,

83
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,120
they want additional funding,

84
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,030
they want the controls to be understood,

85
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,290
they want to reduce risks,

86
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:19,540
and they want to align
themselves strategically

87
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,120
with the organization.

88
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,610
That was it.

89
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:25,723
Everything else was,
I would say haphazard.

90
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:31,170
The metrics that I reviewed
as the CISO on-site,

91
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:34,110
mostly were inappropriate
for decision-making.

92
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:37,740
They were interesting and titillating,

93
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,000
but they didn't do much in the form

94
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,920
of informing the board and how
the board can make decisions

95
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,330
with regard to cost, risk, and maturity,

96
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:49,553
to resolve the problems
that were being experienced.

97
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:54,200
So what you see here is a collection

98
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,823
of things that I began back in 2013.

99
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,510
Documentation review,
literature survey review,

100
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:05,130
asking questions and
determining the quality

101
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:09,200
of what really, determining the definition

102
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,832
of what really determines
a quality metric.

103
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:18,210
Now, one of the properties
that cybersecurity metrics

104
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:20,710
have to have is clarity.

105
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:22,450
We've already talked about,

106
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:26,090
they have to have the ability
to be actioned and utility

107
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:28,900
but they can have all of
the utility in the world,

108
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,960
and without clarity in reporting

109
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,219
it's difficult to get a positive decision

110
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,183
out of any board or committee.

111
00:05:38,029 --> 00:05:42,640
Bottom line, a board or a
committee is not going to fund

112
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:46,190
or approve anything that they don't fully

113
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,860
and clearly understand,

114
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,660
that they can discuss amongst themselves

115
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,483
with other executives.

116
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:58,010
And in my research with
regard to utility and clarity,

117
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:02,140
I really found that the board
wants to know three things.

118
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:06,729
Now this may be different
for your organization,

119
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:11,650
but for my organization and the
banking industry as a whole,

120
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:15,460
I'm very certain that these things apply,

121
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,810
and should apply to most organizations

122
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:20,349
outside of the industry that I'm in.

123
00:06:20,349 --> 00:06:21,263
Excuse me.

124
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:25,030
They wanna know if your
cyber program is working.

125
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:27,309
How effective is it at controlling

126
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:29,053
and mitigating threats today?

127
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,650
How is it fully staffed?
is it fully resourced?

128
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:35,880
And how effective will
it be tomorrow and beyond

129
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,360
at protecting from those same threats

130
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,150
and more modern types of attacks.

131
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,933
So they focus on maturity.

132
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:46,540
Is the cyber program adequately funded?

133
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,390
Board wants to know that.

134
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:52,250
Will a dollar figure
increase, fix this problem?

135
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,680
Will the application of skillsets

136
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,420
or resources fix this problem?

137
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:00,580
And is it outside of our risk appetite

138
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:03,320
or is this something we
need to take on immediately?

139
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,883
Board needs to know that
for correct funding.

140
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:11,780
And lastly, is the cyber
program reducing risk

141
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:15,919
for the organization,
for the key stakeholders

142
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:20,220
and the customers today
and proven over time.

143
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:23,470
So what we have there is,

144
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:26,423
maturity, cost and risk.

145
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:30,730
I, with regard to clarity,

146
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:34,080
I speak and present to my board very often

147
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,140
monthly, as a matter of fact.

148
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:37,800
And we talk about that even just a second.

149
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,800
But in the early days of my
tenure here at Flushing Bank,

150
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:48,719
I use the terms mean time to detection

151
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,270
and mean time to repair,
which, or resolution

152
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:56,890
and what that caused when I left the room,

153
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:59,300
was a discussion about the meaning

154
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:03,570
of those esoteric cyber metrics.

155
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:09,270
So I lost the benefit of
having a board decision,

156
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,969
I lost the time that it took

157
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:14,450
to prepare the presentation at that point

158
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:17,810
and I caused confusion in the board room

159
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:19,980
after I left.

160
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,620
We'll talk about what that meant,

161
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,190
what that meant later.

162
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:27,640
But in general, I am
fortunate to be able to meet

163
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,409
with my board on a monthly basis.

164
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:32,460
So taking small course corrections

165
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:35,250
in over a 30 day cycle is beneficial

166
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,530
and we'll talk about that
here in just a second.

167
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:42,199
Additionally, clarity comes
from not only your messaging,

168
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,159
why it's important, what they mean,

169
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,670
what the benefit will be,

170
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:47,959
but also how they're framed you know,

171
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,550
how are they logically constructed

172
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:52,319
to present a meaningful

173
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:57,230
and cyber related dialogue?

174
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:59,050
Are they easy to understand

175
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:02,040
or do you use a deep esoteric data

176
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,939
that hardly anybody would understand

177
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:07,170
particularly, a senior executive

178
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:09,372
responsible at a board.

179
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:13,270
Now, additionally, the
clarity of the message

180
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:17,536
should be such that the
board can understand

181
00:09:17,536 --> 00:09:19,770
what that cyber metric means

182
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:23,933
with regard to organizational
strategy and direction.

183
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:31,010
So understanding utility,

184
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:33,270
understanding the need
for quality metrics,

185
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:35,870
understanding the need for clarity.

186
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:37,520
Let's talk very briefly

187
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,230
about a high level development process.

188
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:42,270
I showed this slide earlier,

189
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:45,090
that was had literature review,

190
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:49,260
decision-making, board goals.

191
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,689
That was the beginning of
kind of putting together

192
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:53,523
some blocks for process.

193
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,250
And, but the high level process is

194
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,763
that we're gonna discuss
in the next slide,

195
00:09:59,763 --> 00:10:01,660
and really assess where you're at.

196
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,810
This is the beginning

197
00:10:03,658 --> 00:10:05,658
of evolving your metrics

198
00:10:05,658 --> 00:10:08,400
into quality cyber metrics for your board.

199
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,970
Assess where you're at,

200
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:14,970
do the results of the board
meet your expectations?

201
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,640
Meaning, do you get the
right types of results?

202
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,323
Do you get the right
results that are meaningful?

203
00:10:22,336 --> 00:10:25,920
Are they expected and predicted

204
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,683
based on how you recorded
and what you reported.

205
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:33,290
A literature review, look
at existing literature,

206
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:35,420
look at the governance documents

207
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:38,990
that are charged with
regulating your industry.

208
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:42,120
I'm in a very regulated
environment, banking.

209
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,603
So I need to look at FFIEC, FDIC,

210
00:10:45,954 --> 00:10:50,060
NIST, CIS, CSF, and
some others from threats

211
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:52,829
from FS-ISAC and a few more.

212
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:54,730
You may be different,

213
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:57,940
and what I'm suggesting here is that,

214
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:00,040
gather that literature, have it ready,

215
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:04,560
have the latest version, and be ready to

216
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,469
to select and define your
effort and why you're picking

217
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:10,710
or selecting specific cyber metrics

218
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:13,770
and that's an effort on the next line.

219
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:17,810
But also ask questions throughout
the development process.

220
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,369
It's not just a research

221
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:22,810
and it's not just a
documentation and guess.

222
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:24,800
Ask questions, what are your peers doing?

223
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,949
What are they doing that works well?

224
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:29,590
What are they doing
that works not so well.

225
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:30,960
What can you borrow?

226
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,650
and how can you link it

227
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,230
to what the messaging
that you need to convey?

228
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:37,893
And what do you want
your board to understand?

229
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:43,560
Ask leadership, ask individuals
who are charged with

230
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,069
or have been charged with in the past.

231
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:49,910
Board effort, board
understanding , board reporting,

232
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,650
find out what they report.

233
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:55,010
See if there's a
cybersecurity element to it.

234
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:58,600
Ask and provide what your examples are

235
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,120
and be prepared to discuss them.

236
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,270
And lastly, let's not forget.

237
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:05,829
You can ask your peers and your colleagues

238
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:06,950
an additional leadership,

239
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:09,380
but nothing is more valuable

240
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:12,610
than asking your existing board member.

241
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:14,700
Ask them if your messaging is clear,

242
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,670
ask them if they are
getting out of your report

243
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:21,120
what they think you
should be providing them.

244
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,860
And if it's off, that's
a great opportunity

245
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:27,363
to make a real solid and
meaningful course direction.

246
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:37,400
The cybersecurity development
process in more detail.

247
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,699
It really, before I get into this

248
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,000
and I will be brief on this,

249
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,190
it's for those of you there
in a regulated industry,

250
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:49,533
or not, but you are under
audit in some occasion,

251
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,453
in my opinion, and it's been
my experience that auditors,

252
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:59,490
enjoy seeing policy,

253
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:01,780
board approved governance,

254
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:04,288
and evidence that you are following

255
00:13:04,288 --> 00:13:08,320
a policy and supporting a standard.

256
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,170
This process right here will go a long way

257
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:16,663
in satisfying an auditor's
curiosity for the better.

258
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:22,320
For example, the FDIC
asked me a few years ago,

259
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,300
why was I reporting these metrics?

260
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:28,650
Well, I showed them my literature review,

261
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:30,021
I showed them my survey,

262
00:13:30,021 --> 00:13:33,360
I showed them how the metrics were derived

263
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,670
from the publications,

264
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,240
and I showed them how they were vetted

265
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,240
against our executive management
and our board members.

266
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,700
And whether they had a question

267
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:47,180
or a true amount of trouble with anything,

268
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,680
it went right away.

269
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,120
Because nothing is more substantial

270
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,520
than doing what you say you're going to do

271
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,699
and having evidence to prove it.

272
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,610
This process is a way to define

273
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:00,610
and prove to auditors and others,

274
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:03,880
that you have a quality process in place,

275
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:08,120
that's approved to define
your quality metrics.

276
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,763
So we've already talked about
these areas at a high level.

277
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,280
Assess where you're at,

278
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,300
you can't begin at the end,

279
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,280
you have to start at the beginning.

280
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,740
Where are you at?

281
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:24,260
Look for the types of decisions,
the types of discussions,

282
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:27,680
the types of questions that
you're getting from the board.

283
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,180
Is it what you expect?

284
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:33,108
If it's not, assess, look at why it's not,

285
00:14:33,109 --> 00:14:37,760
and can move that forward,
make the course corrections.

286
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:42,060
The second stage is discuss with executive

287
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:45,079
or senior leadership what you're doing

288
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,700
and why you're doing it.

289
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:50,440
Why are you developing new cyber metrics?

290
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,370
Why are you putting resources

291
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:57,110
and allocating resources into
something that we don't need?

292
00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:00,090
It's your job to describe the effort,

293
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:02,100
describe what you're doing,

294
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:05,740
why you're doing it, and
what the benefit will be.

295
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:08,930
If you can generate a consensus

296
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:11,160
among your initial stakeholders,

297
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,360
then you have something
to move forward with.

298
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,830
If you can't, look at
what their feedback is,

299
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:19,470
and understand why there's no movement,

300
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:22,380
see if there are better metrics
that are more meaningful,

301
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:27,250
or add additional metrics
that will provide the depth

302
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:30,713
and understanding that those
individuals are looking for.

303
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:35,250
Once you have a consensus
on your early stakeholders,

304
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,240
continue to do your research,

305
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,970
apply their feedback.

306
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:40,320
See and determine

307
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,490
if any additional cybersecurity
metrics are required.

308
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:47,160
If not, move forward, define them

309
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,020
and move forward to a broader discussion

310
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:51,630
with additional executive leadership.

311
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:54,270
Ask the individuals that
you've already spoke with,

312
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:56,760
if they could recommend additional folks

313
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,770
for you to vet this against.

314
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:02,970
And once you have your fully vetted

315
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:04,960
and approved set of metrics,

316
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,603
begin to report on them.

317
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:13,390
Remember that you, the board
meeting is not the time

318
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:19,350
to make or to present new
cybersecurity metrics.

319
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:22,150
If you're presenting new metrics,

320
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,280
at a board meeting

321
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,780
your chances of being successful totally,

322
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:30,010
are much less than what they would've been

323
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:32,130
if you would have had a consensus

324
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:35,683
against a fully set of vetted
cybersecurity metrics, new.

325
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,992
Additionally, once you
get to this fully vetted

326
00:16:40,993 --> 00:16:42,840
cybersecurity metrics,

327
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,770
you can take a little break

328
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:47,720
but you've just really
started the process.

329
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:52,230
Metrics stagnate, metrics need to evolve.

330
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:55,430
The industry changes,
organizational direction

331
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:57,770
and strategic visions change,

332
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:00,840
the cyber program needs to be able to flex

333
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,830
with those requirements,

334
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:03,730
the regulating bodies change

335
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:07,399
and you need to report those metrics

336
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:12,079
in a way that shows alignment,
continuous alignment

337
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:15,310
and gives the board the
opportunity to prove

338
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:17,500
and see evidence that there is alignment

339
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,623
through cyber metrics.

340
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:21,800
So that was a great segue,

341
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:26,569
because now I want to talk
about the actual rotation

342
00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:29,493
or evaluation of existing metrics.

343
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:33,160
It is, I'm not claiming

344
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:37,260
that developing cyber
security metrics is easy.

345
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,920
In fact, it's, it's difficult

346
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:44,530
but it takes, all it takes is commitment

347
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:49,020
and pressure applied
over a period of time.

348
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:52,970
Right and correctness will
always float to the top

349
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:56,523
with the right meaning and
conversation behind it.

350
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:01,030
So I wanna skip over quickly
the frequency of reporting

351
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:02,410
'cause I wanna get back to that,

352
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:04,470
I wanna end the slide with that.

353
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:06,820
But to evaluate your metrics,

354
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,990
again, you're just looking
at the same questions

355
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:11,550
you already have to develop them.

356
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:13,230
Are they generating discussion?

357
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:16,490
Does the board use them
in a meaningful way

358
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:19,840
to make decisions against maturity, cost,

359
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,092
maturity and risk.

360
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:26,300
Do the follow-up questions from the board,

361
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,760
are they meaningful?

362
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,650
And are they what you expected?

363
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:33,370
Are they discussing the
fundamental elements of the metric?

364
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:35,629
or are they discussing the benefit

365
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:39,170
of understanding that metric
and applying a action to it,

366
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:42,163
like cost, maturity or risk.

367
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:48,060
Additionally, are the metrics
that you're presenting

368
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,950
or do they continue to be actionable?

369
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:55,870
Metrics today are, today
they're fresh, they're new,

370
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:58,600
they're providing the
right type of output,

371
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,010
and it's a, it's an oiled machine.

372
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:03,900
However, over time, as I stated,

373
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:07,060
organizations change, leadership changes,

374
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:09,879
regulating bodies and requirements change,

375
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,090
direction changes.

376
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:16,750
And what was once a very
actionable metric early,

377
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:19,480
now becomes difficult
to make a decision on

378
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,090
because it's no longer applicable

379
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:23,653
or as applicable as it
once was in the past.

380
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,210
So keep that in mind as you,

381
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:28,960
as you have this course set of metrics

382
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,070
and you're documenting them

383
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:34,710
and you're framing them,
for continued discussion.

384
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:37,910
Now, I report to my board monthly.

385
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:41,300
I find that very advantageous.

386
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,669
Why? because of 30 day cycle,

387
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:46,310
if something doesn't get input,

388
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,360
I have only 30 days to wait.

389
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,639
You have another decision
or an understanding.

390
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:55,410
It's critical and it lands
itself well to my success,

391
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:58,360
my cyber programs success.

392
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:01,449
Some of you watching this
may also report monthly.

393
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,630
However, I bet it's a
bigger and a better bet

394
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:09,630
that most of you report semi-annual
or annual to your board.

395
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:11,098
And that would determine

396
00:20:11,098 --> 00:20:15,540
by your executive leadership,
the board guidance,

397
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:18,270
principles that the board operates under.

398
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:23,270
But few of you have the
opportunity to report monthly.

399
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:28,500
And I think that when you
have a short turnaround

400
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:33,370
between board gives i.e, a 30 day cycle,

401
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:37,370
you can make smaller, more
meaningful course corrections,

402
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:41,500
as well as you have, I have
access to the management team,

403
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,686
the senior management team,

404
00:20:43,686 --> 00:20:46,199
and the board members much more

405
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,710
than somebody who reports
annual to their board with.

406
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:51,547
And I don't mean that as

407
00:20:51,547 --> 00:20:54,410
that one is better than the other,

408
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:58,540
but for me at this bank,
in this organization,

409
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,350
reporting monthly to the board

410
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:02,520
and getting that output on a monthly basis

411
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,980
and understanding what their understanding

412
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:08,710
is key to continued alignment

413
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:10,423
with the organizational vision.

414
00:21:18,085 --> 00:21:19,350
So I had a survey,

415
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:22,340
and I did some analysis,
I did some coding,

416
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:25,980
and I put out a lot of surveys

417
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,700
and I asked a lot of questions

418
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,920
and I had some help from friends,

419
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:33,400
and we put together a fairly comprehensive

420
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:37,133
set of cyber metrics.

421
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:42,340
The group of people that I focused on

422
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:46,580
really, it naturally evolved
into three categories.

423
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:50,669
Colleagues, who provided
operational experience,

424
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:53,490
tactical experience, for example,

425
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:55,840
the type of vulnerability
that was exploited.

426
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,350
How long was it exploited?

427
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,770
Was there any lateral movement?

428
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:00,333
What did the logs indicate?

429
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:04,180
Those types of very in the weeds,

430
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:08,990
technically, esoteric type of metrics.

431
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:13,669
In contrast, those in
academics really focused

432
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:17,350
on providing feedback
and metrics suggestion

433
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:20,480
that was in the areas of interest

434
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,470
or areas that they currently
taught or have passed on,

435
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:26,440
or are currently teaching.

436
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,180
And they tended to
focus on administrative.

437
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:31,821
Like policy and procedure,

438
00:22:31,821 --> 00:22:34,800
risk analysis, auditing

439
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:38,570
and the elements that go
with the administrative

440
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:41,909
and administrative safeguards
for a healthy cyber program.

441
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:44,010
Able feedback, but big difference

442
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:46,963
between my peers and folks in academia.

443
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,510
In contrast, the board,

444
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:51,520
when I reached out to board members

445
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:56,343
and past organizations that
I have served on, served at

446
00:22:56,343 --> 00:23:00,170
and current, as well as the board members,

447
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:01,810
by board members to reach out to

448
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:03,690
and get their feedback.

449
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:08,290
It was nearly not 100%, but nearly,

450
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:11,760
all is on risk,

451
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,160
cost, maturity and risk.

452
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,100
And I thought that was very telling.

453
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:20,649
So if you, and if you case
you haven't get up yet,

454
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:22,320
the very core theme,

455
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:26,379
other than quality metrics
for this presentation is,

456
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,400
board members want to hear

457
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,090
the metrics reported in
the categories and context

458
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:34,070
of how does it affect cost,

459
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:36,080
how does it affect health, maturity,

460
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,903
and how does it impact risk.

461
00:23:44,075 --> 00:23:49,006
So what makes a good
metric? a good metric.

462
00:23:49,006 --> 00:23:53,164
First of all, let me kind
of describe them to you,

463
00:23:53,164 --> 00:23:56,640
what my core cybersecurity metrics are,

464
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,653
I'll see if I can do it from memory.

465
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:04,260
Some of them were mean time to detection,

466
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:08,950
containment resolution,
as well as results,

467
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:11,560
not the number of pen test
or vulnerability scans,

468
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:15,000
but the results and the
criticality of the findings

469
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,033
for the vulnerability scans
and the penetration test.

470
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,520
In addition to that, employee training

471
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,520
on how susceptible we
were to phishing attacks,

472
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,173
how phish-prone was this organization.

473
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:31,880
Also, risk assessments

474
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:35,030
and overall cyber health

475
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:40,030
and audit findings were very
key to board members overall,

476
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,899
but they really focused on,

477
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,960
those are the quality metrics that I have

478
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,770
but really all of them can
be described and categorized

479
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:52,680
within the big buckets of
cost, maturity, and risk.

480
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,710
So I thought that was very interesting

481
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:58,120
and I thought it was
leading me down a path

482
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,879
that I thought from early on

483
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,913
or midway through that was,
was correct and meaningful.

484
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,750
So what makes a good metric?

485
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,370
Metrics that can be used

486
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:12,639
to understand organizational
need and risk.

487
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,450
Understanding if the
cybersecurity program aligns with

488
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:19,400
and informs organizational strategy,

489
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:23,860
and it speaks directly through any vehicle

490
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:26,850
to cost, maturity, and risk.

491
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:29,610
So the key, the key here is

492
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:33,669
that the board is the general
consensus of my effort.

493
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:36,190
That board wants to hear certain things.

494
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:38,790
They wanna hear it in certain categories

495
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:41,270
and they want to hear how the areas

496
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:43,920
cost, maturity and risk
apply to the organization

497
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,883
through the metrics that
are, that are reported.

498
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:53,900
Again, the considerations
for the board are key,

499
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:57,590
but in order for the board
to make any consideration

500
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:59,439
of any cyber metric,

501
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,180
it has to be clear, and it has to have

502
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:03,100
a high degree of utility.

503
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,800
They need to review company
controls and peer performance.

504
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,120
That's through cyber metrics.

505
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,739
How well, and how effective
does a cyber program

506
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:14,823
protect against identifying
respond to cyber incidents?

507
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:18,760
How well is the program protect us today?

508
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,240
and how would it protect us tomorrow?

509
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,000
What is the state of compliance?

510
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,820
Do we have any material weaknesses

511
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:28,500
or weaknesses that have been identified

512
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:33,270
by an audit internal or
external state or federal,

513
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:37,620
and how do we ensure that
the board needs to know

514
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:40,659
that the projects within the cyber program

515
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,170
or information security,

516
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:45,530
the roadmap to the future is aligned

517
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:48,160
with what the organization vision is

518
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,423
and the strategic vision
of the organization.

519
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,580
We want to be able to
protect against the threats

520
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:57,090
that we will encounter
both today and tomorrow.

521
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:59,800
And the cyber program should be able

522
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,297
to provide evidence of that.

523
00:27:01,297 --> 00:27:03,540
And the board needs to see that evidence

524
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:06,360
and be able to understand
it in a, a layman

525
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,803
very meaningful decision-making manner.

526
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:13,750
This is some of the high level results.

527
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:18,430
Like I said earlier, I wrote down,

528
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:23,253
I don't know, probably
300 or 350 cyber metrics.

529
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:28,180
This is a result of what the
high level categories were.

530
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:33,180
Most of my metrics fell
into one of these buckets.

531
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,090
And this was before, I'm
showing you raw examples

532
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:39,882
of raw things right now.

533
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:44,220
But if you look closely,
you can see the cost,

534
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:46,160
you can see the maturity,

535
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:49,130
and you can see the risks throughout.

536
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:51,660
That's not accidental.

537
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:55,780
That is what the, the
finding is reporting.

538
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:59,340
And that's what the metrics
that I was gathering,

539
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:03,240
as well as the metrics that
I had discussions about

540
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:06,320
with other board members, other CISO's

541
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,120
and other executives.

542
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:13,120
So this demonstrates that,
that the process is valid,

543
00:28:14,344 --> 00:28:18,380
and the collection of
these metrics, at the time

544
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:21,224
I think it was 300 or 350,

545
00:28:21,224 --> 00:28:25,750
can be boiled down into
very meaningful discussions,

546
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:29,450
and be used for effective decision-making

547
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:32,344
if they're presented logically,

548
00:28:32,344 --> 00:28:35,933
meaningfully and framed
correctly with each other,

549
00:28:37,232 --> 00:28:40,023
prior to, and during the board meeting.

550
00:28:44,735 --> 00:28:47,939
So what do, what have we heard

551
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:49,883
and what do I want you to take away?

552
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:53,081
There are a lot of things.

553
00:28:53,081 --> 00:28:55,729
We talked about clarity and utility,

554
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:58,500
and development processes and times,

555
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:02,080
and difficulties and things
that may take more commitment

556
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,820
than other administrative efforts
that have been undertaken.

557
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:09,250
But to get started, it's simple,

558
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:12,790
but it just takes the staying
power and the commitment.

559
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:15,440
So immediate, after you leave,

560
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,430
after you conclude this presentation

561
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:19,360
and you think about
metrics the first thing

562
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,530
and you want to move on a path of quality

563
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:22,580
and improved metrics.

564
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,720
Take two weeks to
understand the effectiveness

565
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,500
of the decision-making output.

566
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:32,240
Are they, is the board
telling you what you expected?

567
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,930
or are they way off?

568
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:37,250
If they're way off, though,
that may be a problem

569
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:39,170
with the metric or the message,

570
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:41,040
or the logic and the frame,

571
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,889
with which they're presented.

572
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:48,610
So you need to develop a
framework to present metrics.

573
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:52,370
Are you using something that's predefined?

574
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:56,310
Are you using something that
a colleague used, whatever.

575
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:58,139
That is completely up to you,

576
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:00,150
and there's no one
framework I would recommend

577
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:01,610
over the other.

578
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:05,939
But to present your
metrics in a meaningful

579
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:09,240
and logical manner, framework is required.

580
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:13,000
I would consider using
cost, maturity, and risk,

581
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,596
as the biggest top buckets

582
00:30:14,596 --> 00:30:17,240
and pull everything out from there,

583
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,250
that you feel you need to report on.

584
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:23,070
As long as there's a map back
up to one of those categories.

585
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:27,770
Now, I also am gonna ask that you look at

586
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:30,760
the existing documentation
for your industry.

587
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:33,693
For me, it's, FFIEC, FDIC,

588
00:30:35,332 --> 00:30:38,630
FS-ISAC, CIS, CSF, and a few others.

589
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:42,450
It may be different or
maybe the same for you,

590
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:45,150
but while you're going through that

591
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:46,590
gathering the documentation,

592
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:49,270
looking at what's available
in the literature,

593
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:51,440
I would like you to consider

594
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,400
and this is not written down here,

595
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,270
the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

596
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:58,370
It is a, A-T-T at K

597
00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:02,320
and it's a attack tools and
techniques and knowledge base.

598
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:07,070
And it's a collection, a very
well organized collection,

599
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:10,490
of all of the attacks
that have been observed

600
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:15,160
from a cybersecurity perspective
for a very long time.

601
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:20,150
So the chain and the
organizational components

602
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:22,940
to what bad guys do
and what tools they use

603
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:25,730
and what their impact could be,

604
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:28,853
and what type of results
they're looking for.

605
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:33,610
Clearly, you can see the application

606
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:35,909
to defining cyber metrics.

607
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:37,270
Now, when you first look at it,

608
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,810
it's going to appear complex.

609
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:41,399
But if you spend a little bit of time,

610
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,820
you'll see that it's very valuable.

611
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:46,659
It's free, they're on version 8.2.

612
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,760
It is very modern and very updated,

613
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:51,390
and I highly recommend that you look at it

614
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:53,150
for your first phase.

615
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:55,050
Now, if you look at it,

616
00:31:55,050 --> 00:32:00,050
and you don't find anything
applicable to your board report,

617
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:02,900
you should contact me,
so we can discuss it.

618
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:07,620
Because I, I can't 100% guarantee you,

619
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:11,709
but I would be interested
in finding a board report

620
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:15,400
as applied to the MITRE ATT&CK surface,

621
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:19,290
and not being able to
find a quality metric

622
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:21,520
that should be derived.

623
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:25,820
That is for you and I'm happy
to chat about it any time.

624
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:28,970
Four weeks out, you
should continue to review

625
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:30,580
the literature sources,

626
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:33,060
define what metrics
you've already selected.

627
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:34,870
Why did you select them,

628
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:36,479
what are the benefit of this metric,

629
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,360
and what do you think

630
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,973
the intended understanding
will be of the board?

631
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:45,100
Once you have that written in some format,

632
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:47,070
reach out to key stakeholders

633
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:49,960
that are considered colleagues or friends,

634
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,660
but have the same insight

635
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:54,800
and understand the key elements

636
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,919
of what you're trying to accomplish.

637
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,130
Tell them what you're doing,

638
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:00,030
tell them what you think
the benefits are gonna be

639
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:04,480
and get their feedback, listen
to it and incorporate it.

640
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,270
Because what they're providing you

641
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:09,480
is their insight into board mechanics

642
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,830
and what the board discussions are

643
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:16,100
and how you can get in front
of those types of discussions.

644
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:20,010
I recommend reaching out
to the CIO and the CRO.

645
00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:23,350
You may have other titles
in your organization

646
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:25,629
but select an executive
that can provide you

647
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:26,980
the feedback that you need.

648
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:33,320
So two months and beyond,
two months to three months,

649
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,629
you need to refine and validate

650
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:37,980
the metrics that you gathered.

651
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,800
So you've had these discussions,

652
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,210
you've did these categories,

653
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:45,863
you've applied raw cyber
metrics into these categories,

654
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:49,210
you've incorporated feedback.

655
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:52,870
Now, provide that back
to your key stakeholders

656
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:54,820
that you initially spoke with,

657
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:57,629
and then ask for their opinion

658
00:33:57,630 --> 00:34:00,390
on who you should reach out to next.

659
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:03,580
Do you want a broad, you
want to end with a very broad

660
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:06,240
audience that can help vet,

661
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:11,239
that can help generate
consensus and generate dialogue,

662
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:14,300
so that you're not
presenting new cyber metrics

663
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,703
at the next board meeting.

664
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:20,650
And beyond, three months
and beyond continue to push,

665
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:24,040
continue to document, and
continue to go through those steps

666
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,500
until you get to where you need to be.

667
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:30,290
It's not, it won't happen
overnight in most cases,

668
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:34,212
if it does for you, fantastic
and I congratulate you,

669
00:34:34,213 --> 00:34:36,560
but in most cases, it's gonna be difficult

670
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,029
to get on board members calendars.

671
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:43,270
It's going to be difficult
to explain the premise,

672
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:45,110
and the benefit of what you're doing

673
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:47,810
in the timeframe maybe,
that's been allotted,

674
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:50,790
but that should not be a reason

675
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:52,790
or rationale to end the effort.

676
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:56,679
Continue to apply gentle
pressure over a period of time,

677
00:34:56,679 --> 00:35:00,120
and you will, truth
and logic will prevail.

678
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,403
You will be successful.

679
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:09,240
So in summary, we've talked
about quality metrics.

680
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,370
We've talked about the
importance of metrics.

681
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:15,060
Why does the board need metrics?

682
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:17,029
Well, they have to quality metrics.

683
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:19,320
They have to make effective decisions

684
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,401
that impact the organization wholly.

685
00:35:22,401 --> 00:35:26,399
Clarity and utility are key items

686
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:31,100
in helping the board members
understand your point of view,

687
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,980
why this area is important,

688
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:35,490
and more important than all,

689
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:39,593
what they can do about
providing a solution.

690
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:46,500
Also you want to ensure, or
at least make a solid attempt

691
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:52,069
to aligning your cyber metrics
with the big frame categories

692
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:55,022
of cost, maturity and risk.

693
00:35:55,022 --> 00:35:58,759
Board people, board
members understand that.

694
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,990
And you want to speak their language.

695
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:04,490
And if you can map a
cyber security element

696
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:09,490
to cost, maturity, or risk
directly in nonesoteric terms,

697
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:13,740
you're going to have a
better result for the board.

698
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:16,330
It's been proven to me
and to my colleagues

699
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:18,583
that have adopted similar styles.

700
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:21,530
We talked about a process

701
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:24,020
for developing quality cyber metrics,

702
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:27,800
assess where you're at,
look at it for what it is.

703
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,843
Are you getting the right type
of output from your board?

704
00:36:30,843 --> 00:36:34,170
Do your board members
have questions for you

705
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:35,970
that are focused on results

706
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:38,319
and not about the metric itself?

707
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:42,240
If so, the messaging or the
clarity may be in question.

708
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,060
You may need to revisit that,
if it happens frequently

709
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:47,232
and the same questions
continue to come up.

710
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:54,170
We also talked about the addition
of other elements metrics

711
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:57,379
from outside of your organization,

712
00:36:57,380 --> 00:37:00,280
that may be applied from other industries

713
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,990
into your industry.

714
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:02,823
It's not an issue.

715
00:37:02,823 --> 00:37:07,823
Be, be flexible to look at
other industry documents

716
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:12,290
and look at what cyber
metrics they are suggesting,

717
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:13,800
and see if there's a linkage,

718
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,050
understand if there's something

719
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:19,450
that can be beneficial in your
report to your board members.

720
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:24,359
And the last thing is, once you
go through the understanding

721
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,330
and the development of all of this,

722
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:30,200
the process, the writing, the discussions

723
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,350
and the evaluations.

724
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:34,330
You're not done, you really just begun

725
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:39,040
because remember, your
organization matures over time,

726
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,140
directions change, standards bodies,

727
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:44,609
and requirements change,

728
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:47,710
the threats make pivots and change,

729
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:52,710
your cyber program and what
you report should also change.

730
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:58,010
And if you have an issue
with the frequency of change

731
00:37:58,490 --> 00:38:03,040
or the frequency of
refinement or evaluation,

732
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,640
ask, get feedback from the board,

733
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:10,370
ask if your board, your new
rotated in cyber metrics

734
00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:12,750
are meeting the mark and
they're getting out of it

735
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:16,153
what you expect them to get out of it.

736
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,540
That's all I have.

737
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:23,610
It's been a pleasure to present

738
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:26,630
the cyber metrics presentation to you.

739
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:28,980
And if you have any questions,

740
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,610
please feel free to reach out to me

741
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:32,950
to at rwhite@flushingbank.com

742
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:35,370
I'm happy to provide the articles.

743
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:39,130
I'm happy to provide
the raw cyber metrics.

744
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:40,970
I'm happy to provide examples

745
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:44,163
of refined metrics and board reports.

746
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,569
Of course they would be redacted

747
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:50,290
but I would just show the
framing within my report

748
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:52,240
but I'm happy to share that.

749
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,620
If I can benefit you or it can
help just one organization,

750
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:58,200
I would be extremely happy with that.

751
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,290
Thank you very much.
