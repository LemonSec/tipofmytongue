1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:02,610
- Well, welcome everybody.

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:04,240
I know some people are still coming in,

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,170
but hopefully you've joined,

4
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:11,370
What Was I Thinking-
Bungled Breach Responses,

5
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:13,219
because that's what we're
gonna be talking about today.

6
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:15,360
Which, we hope will be informative, fun

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,983
and interesting presentation.

8
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:22,890
The basic premise of the
presentation is on the discussion

9
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,440
is that breaches in today's day and age

10
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,840
are really unavoidable,

11
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,620
but there's a lot of
things that companies do

12
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:31,810
to make their problems worse,

13
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:33,150
which are avoidable

14
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:35,400
with a little bit of thought and planning.

15
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,910
And so we will be talking through issues

16
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:43,050
like undisciplined communications,

17
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,610
failure to anticipate
evidentiary privilege issues

18
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:49,910
with production of reports,

19
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:52,419
concealing the truth from
federal investigators,

20
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,640
and more all designed to help you.

21
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,290
When you go back to your
day jobs, think about things

22
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:02,760
where you can help your own
companies avoid these problems

23
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,450
and make their own problems for themselves

24
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:07,033
worse than they were before.

25
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:13,370
So I'm joined by two really
distinguished colleagues

26
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:16,530
and knowledgeable people on this topic.

27
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:18,250
First is Ann Marie Mortimer.

28
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,733
And would you like to introduce yourself?

29
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,570
- I'm Ann Marie Mortimer.

30
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:25,110
I'm a partner with Hunton Andrews Kurth.

31
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:28,100
I co lead the commercial
litigation practice there

32
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:31,729
where my practice focuses
on consumer risk litigation

33
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:33,993
including data breach class actions.

34
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,613
- Excellent, and a couple
of things you left out

35
00:01:37,613 --> 00:01:39,980
is that you were named a top cyber lawyer

36
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:44,510
in California in The Daily
Journal just last year.

37
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:47,710
And you were named MVP in
cybersecurity and privacy

38
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:50,770
by Law360 just last year as well.

39
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:53,039
So quite quite the list of accolades.

40
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,700
So I'm great to have you here.

41
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:55,950
Thank you for joining us.

42
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:00,050
Brian, do you want to introduce yourself?

43
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:00,883
- Sure.

44
00:02:00,883 --> 00:02:02,210
My name is Brian Levine.

45
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:05,479
Pleasure to be with you
all to join you today.

46
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,169
I'm Managing Director of EY's Transactions

47
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:10,979
Cybersecurity and Data Privacy Practice

48
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:13,109
which is a group of 30 cyber security

49
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,740
and data privacy professionals

50
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:17,270
that work on mergers and acquisitions,

51
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,100
divestitures restructuring

52
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,820
going public, going private
just about every type

53
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,290
of transaction.

54
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:25,760
And I joined EY about two years ago

55
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,989
from the US Department of Justice

56
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,720
where I was the cyber crime prosecutor

57
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,530
and national coordinator for
the other 300 cyber crime

58
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,790
prosecutors around the country.

59
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:38,179
Prior to that, I was
assistant attorney general

60
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,330
with the New York
Attorney General's office

61
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:42,600
and their internet and technology bureau.

62
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,433
And prior to that, I
spent about 10 years doing

63
00:02:43,433 --> 00:02:48,433
technology litigation with
a variety of large firms

64
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:51,260
including Morrison and
Foerster and Palo Alto

65
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:54,690
better known as MorPHo
and Paul Weiss in New York

66
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:57,760
which doesn't have a snappy abbreviation.

67
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,100
But a pleasure to join you all today.

68
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:05,275
- Okay, few things you left out
to Brian, once swing dancer.

69
00:03:05,275 --> 00:03:06,482
(Ann & Brian chuckles)

70
00:03:06,482 --> 00:03:09,383
You're here and you're
a musical comedy writer.

71
00:03:09,383 --> 00:03:10,360
- True.

72
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,570
- Yeah, everyone should know that.

73
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:13,403
You've also received

74
00:03:13,403 --> 00:03:15,420
the John Marshall Attorney General's Award

75
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:18,350
and The Executive Attorney's Office Award

76
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:19,670
for Superior Litigator Team

77
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,929
and the Assistant Attorney General's Award

78
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:24,350
for exceptional service.

79
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:27,523
So of course.

80
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,091
We have to establish our credibility

81
00:03:32,091 --> 00:03:33,600
if we want people to stay in the session.

82
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,644
And I'm John Hauser.

83
00:03:35,644 --> 00:03:37,700
I'm a principal here at the firm.

84
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,570
I lead our mergers and acquisitions

85
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:43,543
cybersecurity and data
privacy practice with Brian.

86
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,820
I'm a former FBI agent
and federal prosecutor.

87
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,346
I worked cyber crime cases

88
00:03:49,347 --> 00:03:53,120
and the second half of my
government career to include

89
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:55,500
one of the first ever indictments

90
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,390
of nation state hacking group overseas,

91
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:02,099
work with the National Security Council

92
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:03,329
on an executive order

93
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:07,720
which could be used to go
after the bad guys overseas

94
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,453
and a number of other criminal
investigations as well.

95
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:13,430
So great having you here.

96
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:18,430
So let's take one quick pause
to talk about logistics.

97
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:22,860
If you have questions, feel
free to submit those to us.

98
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,870
We're happy to feel those as we go along.

99
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,520
Don't need to wait until the end.

100
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:33,570
So again, feel free to jump
in with those on slides.

101
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:35,500
We're not planning on using the slides

102
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,350
as part of the presentation.

103
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,920
I think there is some
good content in there

104
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:43,870
including relevant case law
and some actionable suggestions

105
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:47,220
that we created, what you can
take home to your companies.

106
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,850
Those will be available in the next

107
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:51,330
couple of weeks for you
to use, but we decided

108
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:54,400
that the slides would be
a bit of a distraction.

109
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,669
And we'd rather just
focus on the conversation

110
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:57,930
since there's a lot of great content

111
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,780
for us to just talk through with you.

112
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:02,090
Okay.

113
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:05,700
Let's jump into the first
topic in the presentation

114
00:05:05,701 --> 00:05:08,600
which relates to breach communications.

115
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,050
Meaning the communications
that an internal security team

116
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:14,680
or an in-house corporate
team would be using

117
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,380
when they're talking to each other

118
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:21,070
before, during or after a breach.

119
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,680
And so Ann Marie, this is

120
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,020
I know an area where you've
seen a lot of this play out

121
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,460
as you've had to defend clients

122
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,849
who've been subject to lawsuits.

123
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:31,683
So what sort of information

124
00:05:31,683 --> 00:05:33,969
are you seeing plaintiff's attorneys

125
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:36,323
asking for from companies?

126
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:41,080
- Yeah, so really most
plaintiff's attorneys are

127
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,169
casting a very wide net
when it comes to discovery.

128
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:47,500
So they're gonna ask for a
dreaded quote, all information.

129
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,220
And what that means is
we're not just talking

130
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:53,930
about formal reports or
considered communications.

131
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:56,060
We're talking about
communications that happen

132
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,890
in the heat of the moment
of a security incident.

133
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:02,729
So remember when you're
using your slack or your text

134
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:06,290
or any other app, you're not
writing in invisible ink,

135
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:09,110
those things are actually gonna
be produced in a litigation.

136
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:12,500
And while it's hard to adopt
that mindset in the moment,

137
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,810
you need to start
disciplining yourself now

138
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,827
so that when you get to litigation

139
00:06:16,827 --> 00:06:20,120
and email you fired off
in the heat of the moment

140
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,210
doesn't come back to
haunt you in a deposition

141
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:26,500
where suddenly you find yourself
center stage being deposed

142
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,440
and ask questions about
an email that you never

143
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,193
intended to have significance
that later takes on.

144
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,120
- Yeah, absolutely.

145
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,160
I think, you know

146
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,910
people have trained
themselves to think of emails

147
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:40,760
and things like that as discoverable,

148
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,530
but not some of the other
real-time communications

149
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:45,390
that you were mentioning.

150
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:48,890
And so I'm sure that can
lead to big mistakes.

151
00:06:48,891 --> 00:06:51,770
- Well, not my clients of course, John,

152
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:53,330
'cause my clients are very careful

153
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,070
about their communications.

154
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,710
- But you heard about it.

155
00:06:56,710 --> 00:07:00,340
- But in general, these
off-channel forms of communication

156
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:05,340
can be real gold for someone
trying to reconstruct

157
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:08,890
a scenario particularly that
the company was already aware

158
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:10,490
of a security vulnerability

159
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:13,470
or didn't respond adequately
or quickly enough.

160
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:16,270
So the kinds of things you
think about when you worry

161
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:19,409
about that are sort of
the heat of the moment

162
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:22,930
gallows humor, which is very
common in security teams.

163
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:24,590
But I know you folks don't like to meet

164
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:27,039
with the lawyers and the
quickest way you find yourself

165
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,000
in front of a lawyer is firing off

166
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,030
one of those texts

167
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:32,369
or slack channels that talk about,

168
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:36,230
I dunno your security being
like Swissed cheese or ghee

169
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:39,680
this is happening again
or anything that refers

170
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,070
to either the security
posture of the company

171
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:46,130
in a way that's negative or
could be perceived as negative.

172
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:47,409
Anything that refers

173
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:51,300
to the threat as recurring or anticipated.

174
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,100
I mean, remember maybe even five words

175
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,790
end up having a consequence

176
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:57,890
that you never intended to attach to them.

177
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:02,137
So before you hit send on that
message, think to yourself,

178
00:08:02,137 --> 00:08:05,710
"How would I feel if that
was blown up into giant font

179
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:07,729
and posted in the middle of time square?

180
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:10,110
Would I be comfortable
with that communication?"

181
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,920
Because that's the standard almost

182
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,350
that you need to adopt every
time you make a communication.

183
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:18,170
And the hardest part of the
rule I'm sharing with you

184
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:21,690
is that it's not just from
the moment of breach forward.

185
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:25,820
Remember that litigation
reaches back into the history

186
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:29,190
because part of what's looking
through a filter of 2020

187
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:32,140
is what did the company know and when

188
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:35,679
and how did it generally
address its security posture.

189
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:39,099
So really even if you're
not in battle mode

190
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,240
but you're just joking
around with your colleagues

191
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,370
those things too can
come back to haunt you

192
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:47,760
in a way that believe me,
you'll not appreciate later.

193
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,533
If you find yourself in the
hot seat of a deposition.

194
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:52,980
- I've been telling management

195
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,550
about this issue for
months or years, right?

196
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:59,150
That's another good one that
can come back to haunt people.

197
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:02,885
And have you seen that play
out and in the course of-

198
00:09:02,885 --> 00:09:04,540
- Yeah.

199
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:08,360
And it's not unique by the way
to cybersecurity litigation.

200
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:12,810
I think this is just something
that litigators always fear.

201
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:15,260
You know, the dreaded email that comes out

202
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:18,760
in a stack of even millions
of pages may be produced

203
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,950
but it can all come down to a handful

204
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:24,780
of communications that while
you can try to put context

205
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:27,079
around you can't fully erase.

206
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:30,720
So again, the best we
can do is be very mindful

207
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,080
and what I call communication hygiene.

208
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,440
It is something that I think really

209
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,643
and it's not entirely fair to expect from

210
00:09:38,643 --> 00:09:42,040
a security team who typically
is not involved in litigation.

211
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,766
So I think the company
does itself a big favor

212
00:09:44,767 --> 00:09:49,090
to have these conversations
outside the heat of battle

213
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:51,320
to give some specific examples

214
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,290
of how communications can hurt

215
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:55,180
and sort of try to train people

216
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:59,193
in advance about being mindful
in their communications.

217
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:01,830
- Yeah.

218
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,260
Makes sense.

219
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,500
Brian, anything you've seen

220
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,330
on the communication side
that you want to share

221
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:08,638
from any of your experiences?

222
00:10:08,638 --> 00:10:09,820
- Yeah, so, you know

223
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:13,440
sometimes it's not the
specific words you use

224
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,083
but the tone and the tone is often toxic.

225
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,980
And, you know, people just can be nervous

226
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:25,121
in these situations and
some of the nervousness

227
00:10:25,121 --> 00:10:28,197
or whatever other emotions are
involved will just come out

228
00:10:28,197 --> 00:10:30,790
and their texts and their emails.

229
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:35,579
And, you know, I've seen numerous
instances where, you know

230
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,380
a case was going nowhere.

231
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:40,170
It was going to be dismissed
at the motion to dismiss stage

232
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:43,260
or was dismissed at the
motion to dismiss stage.

233
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:46,100
And then for whatever reason,
emails became exposed,

234
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,450
maybe there was a government
investigation going on

235
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:51,240
subsequently, you know,
on a parallel track.

236
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,160
And they released some emails
where they issued a report

237
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,680
that had some emails

238
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,140
or for whatever reason emails come out.

239
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:02,560
And the civil litigation ends
up doing a, you know, 180.

240
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,798
And you know, now
everything is looking bad,

241
00:11:04,798 --> 00:11:06,340
and now it's going to
head towards settlement

242
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:11,340
because even though there's
only smoke, it's not fire.

243
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,800
The smoke is enough

244
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,133
that the company doesn't
really want to take the risk

245
00:11:15,134 --> 00:11:18,460
of going to trial and
giving it further publicity.

246
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,890
So it does matter.

247
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:21,173
And you know,

248
00:11:21,173 --> 00:11:24,280
another reason it matters is
not just for the litigation.

249
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,880
What's a little bit unusual

250
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,674
about the breach context
or the security context

251
00:11:28,674 --> 00:11:33,449
is if you've had a breach
or other security incident,

252
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:36,080
it's possible that the
criminal is listening,

253
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:41,040
is monitoring your communications
via email or via, you know

254
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,500
anything that's over the computer text.

255
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,800
If it's a company issued mobile device,

256
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,280
theoretically the mobile device as well.

257
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,699
And that may interfere with your ability

258
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,960
to negotiate effectively
with the criminal.

259
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:58,143
So yes, a hypothetical, if
it's a ransomware situation,

260
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:02,700
the bigger a deal, it
seems like to the criminal

261
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:07,396
based on your reaction to it,
the higher the price may go.

262
00:12:07,396 --> 00:12:12,347
And so maybe it will help your incident

263
00:12:12,347 --> 00:12:14,810
your people in house

264
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:17,239
and people involved in incident response,

265
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:20,460
the IT people whoever's
involved in the discussions

266
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:23,010
to understand that their communications

267
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:25,450
maybe being monitored
real-time by the criminal.

268
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:27,320
And they may think that's not happening

269
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,810
because they say, oh, it's all contained

270
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:32,160
to this one little piece,
but it happens many times.

271
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,810
That's what we think initially.

272
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:35,880
And then we realized it expands out,

273
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,850
the breach is much larger
than they anticipated.

274
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:39,683
- Yeah, I agree.

275
00:12:39,683 --> 00:12:40,680
Absolutely Brian,

276
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:43,550
and so that's an important
thought to have in mind too

277
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:46,439
which is you should treat
your communications.

278
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,140
Not only like they might
be published eventually

279
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,840
but they might be being monitored

280
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,620
particularly as it affects your ability

281
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,023
to remediate whatever
the security incident is.

282
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,850
- Yeah, absolutely.

283
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:01,180
I saw, we did have a question
come in about communications

284
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:05,933
to affected customers or
outside the organization.

285
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,980
And are there any best practices

286
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:11,540
around that or horror stories around that?

287
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,920
- Well, they're probably both,

288
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,229
but I think here it's attention

289
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:18,570
and there's no one easy answer, right?

290
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:21,830
Because the competing tension
is you want to communicate

291
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:23,750
in a timely fashion

292
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:26,250
with the stakeholders and
that's all your stakeholders.

293
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:29,290
That's your potentially
impacted business partners.

294
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:30,250
It's your consumers.

295
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:33,200
If you have a consumer
base, it's the regulator.

296
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,710
So you have to consider all
these competing stakeholders

297
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:39,390
and the clock starts running, right?

298
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:41,380
from the moment you
become aware of a breach

299
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,460
and everyone's gonna look

300
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:45,430
and by the way there's
litigation consequences

301
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:49,900
to whether or not you
delayed notification.

302
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,810
So on the one hand you're under pressure

303
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:54,459
to deliver a message in a timely way

304
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,820
but the competing or
counterbalance pressures

305
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,190
you want to be accurate in
those communications, right?

306
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:01,550
Because you lose credibility

307
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:04,540
and sometimes you overstate
or understate the incident

308
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,880
if you're working on limited information.

309
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,370
So it's a good question.

310
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:10,390
And it's one though that can't be answered

311
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:12,560
with a one-size-fits-all answer.

312
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,109
I think at the end of
the day, it's a balance.

313
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:19,240
And I would put strike the balance

314
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,210
and yes be mindful of the time clock.

315
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:26,080
And don't delay in too
long before responding

316
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:29,130
but try to get some
information to make sure

317
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:30,720
you feel relatively certain.

318
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,620
And then in the
communication, be transparent

319
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:36,880
about the fact that the facts
are continuing to evolve.

320
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,890
So leave yourself some room

321
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:43,189
if different facts develop,
but timeliness, accuracy

322
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:46,490
and transparency are key
rules when communicating

323
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:48,305
with your stakeholders.

324
00:14:48,305 --> 00:14:49,137
- Yeah.

325
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:51,640
And we'll touch a little
bit on this, another example

326
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:55,220
of a communications
outside of the enterprise.

327
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:58,640
We'll touch on the Uber
indictments a little bit later on

328
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,913
where there was some communications

329
00:14:59,913 --> 00:15:02,580
from the internal security
team to actually...

330
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:06,690
To the bad guys, which is
hard to rely on the bad guys

331
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:10,393
to keep that sort of thing
secret if it comes down to it.

332
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:13,140
Okay, great.

333
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,010
Let's jump to the next topic

334
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:17,720
which is incident response reports.

335
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,850
The reports that are
inevitably prepared in the wake

336
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:25,970
of an incident when a
response team would come in

337
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:29,133
and typically would describe
how the attack happened,

338
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,540
what security flaws led to the attack,

339
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:36,150
and then what companies
need to be doing about that.

340
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:37,730
And there's been a lot of litigation

341
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:42,357
around whether or not those
reports are privileged

342
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,170
or whether they are discoverable
by plaintiff's attorneys.

343
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:49,510
So Brian, can you lay out
for us what the concerns are

344
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:51,530
within certain response reports?

345
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:53,390
- Yeah. That's a great question.

346
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:55,710
You know, Rowlf the Dog

347
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:59,490
in the original "Muppet"
movie saying a song called,

348
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:02,509
You can't live with them,
you can't live without them.

349
00:16:02,509 --> 00:16:03,482
(John chuckles)

350
00:16:03,482 --> 00:16:04,660
And I think that that's all

351
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:07,660
it was probably about
incident response reports.

352
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:10,060
I haven't watched the
movie in a long time,

353
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:12,810
but that's I think that's probably right.

354
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:16,890
And the problem with
incident response reports

355
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:20,150
there are many, but I
think the short answer is

356
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:23,300
no they're not always carefully written.

357
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,490
They may be preliminary and they instead,

358
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:27,320
they might not be completely accurate

359
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,690
as Anne Marie suggested
about initial impressions.

360
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:33,390
They may tend to suggest blame, you know

361
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:36,060
blame for the incident,
which is really unhelpful.

362
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,280
They may identify a bunch of things

363
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:41,953
that the company should
have done, but didn't do.

364
00:16:41,953 --> 00:16:45,959
And they may go beyond
where they need to go.

365
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:49,670
So as a result, plaintiffs
in a data breach suit

366
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:52,860
are almost always going to request a copy

367
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:56,600
of any incident response
reports in discovery.

368
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,900
And that can be a problem.

369
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,030
- Okay.

370
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:03,990
And are the plaintiffs successful

371
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:04,823
in getting those

372
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:07,657
infrastructure incident
response reports turned over?

373
00:17:07,657 --> 00:17:12,657
- Yes, so the problem is generally
yes, they are successful.

374
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:16,740
The company will frequently
assert work product protection

375
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:20,130
and or attorney-client privilege.

376
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:22,069
I sometimes there are
other arguments as well

377
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:24,270
but these arguments have generally failed.

378
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:27,778
It's generally an octal
battle to protect these.

379
00:17:27,778 --> 00:17:29,023
- And why is that?

380
00:17:29,023 --> 00:17:30,969
I mean, obviously, you know

381
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:34,140
we know that these incident
response reports are prepared

382
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,910
in anticipation of a
lawsuit coming, right?

383
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:39,130
There's typically at the
direction of council.

384
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:42,420
So what is the issue with, you know

385
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:45,050
extending the privilege
to these types of reports?

386
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:46,649
- Well, you said it right there.

387
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:49,820
So as to establish work product privilege,

388
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,689
courts generally require

389
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:55,950
that the report be prepared
in anticipation of litigation.

390
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:58,640
And while you might have that opinion

391
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,670
that it was prepared in
anticipation of litigation.

392
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:04,110
In my experience, courts generally find

393
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:05,679
that these reports were not prepared

394
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,670
in anticipation of litigation.

395
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,083
And that's because they seem to find

396
00:18:09,083 --> 00:18:12,990
that these reports would
have been prepared anyway.

397
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:16,410
In other words, but for
any anticipated litigation

398
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:19,000
they still would have been prepared.

399
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,880
And there's some logic
to that because you know

400
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,700
for business reasons, you
often do need these reports.

401
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,610
You need to figure out what happened

402
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:32,300
and you need to take appropriate
steps to remediate it

403
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,500
and move forward.

404
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,680
And that might be true regardless

405
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,150
of whether there was any litigation

406
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:40,010
but the courts tend to focus on

407
00:18:41,667 --> 00:18:44,209
a couple of questions to try and decide

408
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:47,510
whether it was prepared in
anticipation of litigation.

409
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:49,800
First who requested the report?

410
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,850
And under what circumstances?

411
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:55,590
You know the further away
the litigation counsel is

412
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:58,830
for requesting the report
and the further away it is

413
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:03,750
from any actual litigation,
that factor tends to move

414
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:07,210
against finding the
privilege or the protection.

415
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:09,880
Second question is what
does the report cover?

416
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:13,230
If the report reads as
though it was prepared

417
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:16,740
and would have been prepared
in the exact same form

418
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,250
whether there was any litigation or not

419
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:22,890
that doesn't help the case
for work product protection.

420
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:25,610
And then who is the report provided to?

421
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:28,550
Is it provided just to counsel

422
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:31,530
and management perhaps
inside, outside counsel

423
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:34,810
or is it, you know, provided
to a bunch of third parties?

424
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:38,190
And the IT organization,
which court seemed to

425
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:42,980
use to suggest that wouldn't
support the protection as well.

426
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:45,723
So in general, these
arguments have failed.

427
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,179
- Okay.

428
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:50,380
And then in anticipation of
litigation points interesting

429
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:53,000
because as I think you
already said, you know,

430
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,100
even if it is prepared in
anticipation of litigation

431
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:59,209
if there's another reason
why the report is prepared

432
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:02,680
then that argument, it
sounds like will fail.

433
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,690
Maybe it needs to be prepared if there's

434
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:07,390
a because aspect to this, right?

435
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:10,840
Where the report needs to
be because of litigation

436
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:15,169
and not for another business,
ordinary business purpose.

437
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:16,980
Which is where companies
are running a foul

438
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,970
of trying to protect
their defense attorneys

439
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:20,280
are trying to...

440
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,230
Are running a foul of trying
to protect these reports

441
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:23,730
from the privilege-

442
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:25,980
- I don't want to be quite so bleak.

443
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,160
There are times in which

444
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,220
you can mount a successful
privilege defense

445
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:33,630
but I think Brian's exactly
right that, you know

446
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:36,550
there are landmines and you
have to navigate it properly.

447
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:39,340
And when it comes to the actual facts

448
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:41,189
underlying the incident

449
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:43,130
those facts are not going to be privileged

450
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:47,570
and understandably so
because the defendant

451
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:49,649
or the company will have in its possession

452
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:51,970
facts that are only available to them

453
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:53,630
that the plaintiffs need to know

454
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:55,300
in order to understand what happened.

455
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,950
And they are entitled
to ask for those facts.

456
00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:00,000
And I also understand John, your point

457
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,710
about litigation kind of
follows a breach as surely

458
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:04,440
as night follows day.

459
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,320
So should it be an
anticipation of litigation?

460
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,610
Yes, I think there are arguments there

461
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:13,300
but I think it also depends
on who's requested it,

462
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:16,010
whether you're using, for
instance, the same security farm

463
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:18,710
you have on standby retainer anyways

464
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,920
or if there are different
steps you're taking

465
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,790
that make it clear that this
is a different kind of report.

466
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:27,710
And in thinking about the
content of the report too

467
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:29,520
and understanding that
you are gonna have to

468
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,870
disclose the facts, you
know, my preference and John

469
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:35,300
you'll appreciate what I'm saying here

470
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:38,010
is it's a drag net approach,
just the facts ma'am,

471
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:42,550
you know, understanding that
you will be producing something

472
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:46,389
in your data breach litigation,
it's good to have available

473
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:49,740
to you a report that is just the facts.

474
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:50,573
In other words

475
00:21:50,573 --> 00:21:54,740
it doesn't have things like
extraneous assessments.

476
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:57,400
It doesn't have what
council's asked you to do.

477
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,380
It doesn't have recommendations
that aren't core

478
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:03,210
to the actual underlying
facts of the breach.

479
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:06,130
So I think there are two issues here

480
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:07,660
and you're going to hear me say a lot.

481
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,820
There are competing concerns.

482
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,210
There always are.

483
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:13,240
There's an operational need
to understand what's happened

484
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,830
and to deal with what's happened

485
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:18,260
and to have those facts at
the ready, understood that

486
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:22,440
but separating out the
operational piece of it

487
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:26,870
including that part about
remediation and self-reflection

488
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:31,250
from the underlying facts
is a good hygiene practice

489
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,670
because you don't want to face

490
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:35,170
some of these battles that
Brian's talking about,

491
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:36,980
which and I agree overall,

492
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:41,560
the scorecard is not positive
for maintaining privilege.

493
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,210
So those are things you should
have in mind when considering

494
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:47,410
what's the scope and
purpose of this security.

495
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:49,940
- Yeah, so I also have
a couple of approaches

496
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:52,200
that I think can improve your chances

497
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:55,520
of having a protected report

498
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,040
or having most of it
protected in this situation.

499
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:03,040
So the first option is to
don't get a written report

500
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:08,210
and you know, while that might
seem impractical, you know

501
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:10,390
I've assessed about 150 companies

502
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:12,700
in the last year in
terms of their security.

503
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,910
And I've been, many of
them have had incidents

504
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:17,060
and most of them don't
get a written report.

505
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,250
So you don't always need a written report.

506
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:21,940
You can have the incident
respond or do a Zoom session

507
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:24,770
just like this, go over their findings.

508
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:29,430
You or your attorney can
take notes on the key points.

509
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:32,920
And so you don't actually
need a formal written report

510
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,400
in every situation.

511
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,080
Now, if you do get an
incident incident report

512
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,720
here's a couple of ideas.

513
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,790
One consider having the incident responder

514
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:47,980
retained and directed very
closely by the law firm,

515
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:50,730
based on the factors the court look at

516
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:54,150
that seems to help in getting

517
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:57,260
a work product privilege report.

518
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:02,200
Second consider framing
the substance of the report

519
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,587
on the affirmative or
defensive litigation.

520
00:24:05,587 --> 00:24:07,500
And I don't want to explain what I mean

521
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:10,140
by affirmative defensive litigation

522
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,570
defensive litigation is
what we're usually thinking

523
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:14,300
of when we're thinking of breaches.

524
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,310
Like you have a breach

525
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:17,169
or your client has a breach,
you're gonna be sued.

526
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:19,330
Yes, that's probably inevitable.

527
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:21,070
But if you write the report around that

528
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:23,450
the whole report is gonna sound defensive.

529
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:25,370
Instead, why not assume

530
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:29,959
that your clients may want
to Sue the hacker instead of

531
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:34,290
or the insider, instead of
taking a defensive position

532
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:38,020
and more and more clients
are going after the hacker

533
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:41,000
or the insider or whatever

534
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,240
and a variety of reasons to do that.

535
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:47,790
One is that it kind of shifts
the optics of the situation

536
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:52,050
from this being your fault to
this being a criminal action.

537
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:55,200
And you're going to take
steps against the attacker.

538
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,390
The other reason they do it

539
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:59,230
is if you bring litigate
affirmative litigation

540
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:02,610
you can potentially take steps to identify

541
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:06,000
who the hacker is, which can
help any criminal prosecution

542
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,480
or potentially help
you ultimately recover.

543
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,880
So those are the reasons to
bring affirmative litigation.

544
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,780
And if you frame the report in terms of

545
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:17,010
a possible affirmative
litigation, you can make it clear

546
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:20,900
to the judge that this isn't
an anticipation of litigation.

547
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,560
And so the sections of that report

548
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,520
might be a description of the interview.

549
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:27,010
Very neutral as Ann Marie suggested

550
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:29,000
the physical locations involved

551
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,830
which would be relevant
to jurisdiction or venue,

552
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:34,260
the evidence, where is it located?

553
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,370
Has it been preserved?

554
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:37,320
What needs to happen to preserve it?

555
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,889
Who are the witnesses?

556
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:41,640
What information do we
have about attribution?

557
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,493
In other words, is this
IP address implicated?

558
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:48,210
And then what are the
potential discovery requests?

559
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:51,080
So if the IP address goes back to Verizon

560
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,620
the first potential discovery
request would be a subpoena

561
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:55,719
to Verizon to get more information

562
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,130
about the subscriber of that IP address.

563
00:25:58,130 --> 00:25:59,880
So kind of framing the whole thing

564
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,000
in terms of affirmative litigation.

565
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,600
I think will make it
very clear to the judge

566
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:08,820
that this report was prepared
in anticipation of litigation.

567
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:11,450
The other thing I would
suggest is consider

568
00:26:12,501 --> 00:26:16,927
separating out the remediations
into a separate report.

569
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,730
And what I would really suggest is just

570
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:22,880
don't worry about the
remediations in that report

571
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,550
in the initial report, you know

572
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:26,870
I ask what you need to
do to stop the bleeding

573
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:28,459
but instead just wait

574
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:31,240
and get a complete
cybersecurity assessment

575
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,090
which you should be doing anyway.

576
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:36,080
And when you get that complete
cybersecurity assessment,

577
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,020
don't have them address
the incident, just say

578
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:40,020
what is going, you know,
what are you doing right.

579
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:42,410
And what additional
protections you can have.

580
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:44,610
Now that subsequent report,

581
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:47,209
which would just be a security assessments

582
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:50,470
may be protected under
Federal Rule of Evidence 407

583
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:52,720
for subsequent remedial measures.

584
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,430
It may not be admissible at trial

585
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:57,590
or maybe not even on
summary judgment motion.

586
00:26:57,590 --> 00:27:00,230
It will be discoverable most likely

587
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:04,050
but it probably won't come in at trial

588
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:05,500
under successful remedial measures

589
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,020
or at least you'll have the argument.

590
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:09,010
So that's another thing you could do.

591
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:10,600
And the final thing, I would say,

592
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,620
no matter which approach you take,

593
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:14,969
consider having the report

594
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:18,210
a draft of the report
reviewed very closely

595
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:22,710
by an attorney to ensure it
doesn't include any unnecessary

596
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:25,443
or unhelpful content
before it's finalized.

597
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,353
- Yeah.

598
00:27:29,353 --> 00:27:31,190
All really good suggestions.

599
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:35,520
And Brian about how to sort
of uncloud what the purpose

600
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,860
of the report is, and how it's framed,

601
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:42,330
and who it's shared with to
better protect that privilege.

602
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:44,931
You know, we have a couple of
cases in the slides that will

603
00:27:44,931 --> 00:27:46,960
when you're able to download those

604
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,230
that I think will be
instructive on this point.

605
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:52,910
It's, you know, the immediate reaction

606
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:55,010
is from these rulings is it seems like

607
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:56,330
companies are being punished

608
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:57,470
for doing the right thing, right?

609
00:27:57,470 --> 00:27:59,880
Where they're getting an
incident response reports

610
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:02,250
and then they're subjecting themselves

611
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:06,570
to litigation risk by doing that.

612
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:08,580
But I think this has been
a very good discussion

613
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,919
where you can sort of walk that line

614
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:13,700
about getting the information you need

615
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:16,790
but also not making it
easier than you need to

616
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:19,330
for the other side, to
get that information.

617
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:21,862
So really good discussion.

618
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:24,439
Okay.

619
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:27,023
Let's take a break from
bungling for a second.

620
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:31,880
Let's talk about some
things that companies

621
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:34,170
are doing right.

622
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:36,590
And as you know, as
we've already discussed,

623
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:38,550
you do a lot of this type of litigation.

624
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:42,870
So what are companies doing
well to protect themselves

625
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:47,513
from the night follows day
lawsuit that you mentioned?

626
00:28:47,513 --> 00:28:50,080
- I think the first thing companies can do

627
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,230
is to prepare themselves
because for most companies

628
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:56,890
it's not a question of if
you're going to get breached,

629
00:28:56,890 --> 00:28:59,800
it's when, and that
doesn't indicate, you know

630
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:02,159
I think that there's a huge fallacy

631
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:05,320
built into the data breach litigation

632
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:08,720
which is somehow your
security was inadequate

633
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,520
or not robust simply
because of there's a breach.

634
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,160
I think that underestimates
the sophistication

635
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:17,240
and tenaciousness of
the hackers, you know,

636
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,690
and the fact that they hackers,

637
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:22,020
the defenders have to be right 24/7

638
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:24,170
where the hackers can
get it right just once.

639
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:25,520
So the fact of a breach

640
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,030
doesn't indicate inadequate security.

641
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:31,399
It doesn't indicate a
lack of focus on security

642
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,360
and at the end of the day

643
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,300
security is this group will understand

644
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,560
it's not a destination,

645
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:38,149
it's a process with ever evolving threats.

646
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:40,660
So I think understanding thematically

647
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:43,770
not being defensive from
that is the starting point

648
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:46,850
but understanding it doesn't
mean you should prepare for it.

649
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:48,919
It means just the opposite
you should prepare.

650
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,600
Here's where the, you know

651
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,409
boy scout motto has it
right about being prepared.

652
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:55,390
Companies need to build
in a certain amount

653
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:58,650
of muscle memory so that they're prepared

654
00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:01,770
if and when it happens to
them, what do I mean by that?

655
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:04,600
I mean, that first, you need
to make sure you have a focused

656
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,830
on your data management.

657
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:07,980
So you know what's out there.

658
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,840
What can't be compromised.

659
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,730
I think you have to have

660
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:12,720
an appropriate governance structure,

661
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,710
so you can have the
communication chain ready.

662
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:18,910
The security team obviously
needs to know what to do

663
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:22,320
and have a response
plan in place to follow.

664
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,080
And that plan though, you know

665
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,169
should be sufficiently flexible to scale

666
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:27,420
to the size of an event.

667
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:30,470
One thing you see for instance in breaches

668
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:33,110
is that the plaintiff's
counsel will take out

669
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:34,840
your incident response plan,

670
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,480
put it in front of the
security team and say,

671
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,930
starting from top to
bottom, did you do this?

672
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:40,763
Did you do this?

673
00:30:40,763 --> 00:30:41,596
Did you do this?

674
00:30:41,596 --> 00:30:43,230
And there may be very good reasons

675
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:46,920
in a particular incidents where
you deviated from your plan

676
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,740
but the plan should have
flexibility to allow for that

677
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:54,320
because sort of it becomes
a unnecessary gotcha moment

678
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,720
in litigation.

679
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:59,350
So I think a lot of successful preparation

680
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:03,010
for litigation is really being prepared

681
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:06,990
in advance and not panicking
and responding appropriately.

682
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,910
And then there's also a whole set.

683
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:12,050
We could talk about what's
in the legal arsenal.

684
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:14,470
Once you have to bring in lawyers

685
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:16,750
and they're starting to
structure the defense

686
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:19,130
the thematically it will
focus on this notion

687
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:21,540
that yes, there was good, robust security

688
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:23,730
but that doesn't mean perfect security

689
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:26,860
that there's risk inherent is
sort of choosing to be part

690
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:28,429
of the digital world.

691
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:30,070
You know, the only way to really be safe

692
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:32,520
is to unplug everything and
not put anything out there

693
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,129
but nobody wants to live
their lives that way.

694
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:38,410
And then the legal set
of defenses that go along

695
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:40,930
with that, that focus,
I think, appropriately

696
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:42,890
on not whether or not
there's perfect security

697
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:45,640
but whether there was reasonable security

698
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:49,620
- I would just add the
incident response plan

699
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:50,726
is very important

700
00:31:50,727 --> 00:31:53,590
but you don't really have
an incident response plan

701
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:55,629
until you've had it tested

702
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:58,340
with a third party tabletop exercise.

703
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:02,889
So you want to do a tabletop
exercise, at least annually.

704
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:04,590
You want to test specific scenarios

705
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:07,510
that the colonies lively to
phase, whether it's ransomware

706
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:11,390
or data breach or a
insider theft situation.

707
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:14,950
And when you go through it each year

708
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:17,250
this is an opportunity
to see what's working

709
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:19,410
and what's not working with
the plan and to update it.

710
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:21,700
Don't just kind of shelf, you know

711
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,533
shelf that exercise book.

712
00:32:22,533 --> 00:32:25,399
All right, we did well,
or we didn't do so well.

713
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,910
Make sure it's worked into the plan.

714
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:30,870
And by the way, as long
as we're talking about

715
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:34,459
response plans, make
sure you have a hard copy

716
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:36,120
of the incident response plan,

717
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,419
because if all your systems are encrypted

718
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:41,500
because of ransomware,
your incident response plan

719
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:45,150
will also be encrypted and
not particularly helpful.

720
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:46,260
- Yeah. Good, good point.

721
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,700
And make sure you update it.

722
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,980
It doesn't help you as
Brian says, if you're locked

723
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:52,530
out from it or you've never
take it out and use it.

724
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:55,933
So it's important that you use it also.

725
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,970
So those are awesome.

726
00:32:57,970 --> 00:33:01,170
I agree, Brian, some important
tips to have, and you know

727
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:02,440
it's a double-edged sword.

728
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,520
I agree, absolutely

729
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:07,320
that you have to have tabletop
exercises also, you know

730
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,439
the types of things you'll
be asked in litigation,

731
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,420
if and when you face it is,

732
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:13,410
do you have a bug bounty program?

733
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:14,630
Do you have a red team

734
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:18,720
or an alpha offensive team
that regularly, you know

735
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,090
does these kinds of drills?

736
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:22,360
Do you use third parties to do it?

737
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,840
And the answer

738
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,090
typically depending on
the size of your company,

739
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:27,169
should be yes.

740
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:29,670
However, the flip of that is

741
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:33,670
for every time the red team
successfully executes an attack

742
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:37,650
for every time that a tabletop
exercise goes sideways.

743
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:40,440
You have to show that you're
incorporating, as Brian said

744
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,460
the learnings from those exercises

745
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:45,510
otherwise what you're left
with is the worst of all worlds

746
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:48,870
which is you got the signal
and you did nothing about it.

747
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:49,804
- Right.

748
00:33:49,805 --> 00:33:51,830
- And I would just say
on that particular point

749
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:54,298
I've dealt with that
point in front of juries

750
00:33:54,298 --> 00:33:56,243
the day you do this, did you do that?

751
00:33:56,243 --> 00:33:57,453
Did you do this?

752
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,480
Successfully defended that

753
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,300
with the basic answer is
there's always more you can do

754
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,950
in terms of cybersecurity.

755
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:07,530
The test is what you did do?

756
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:09,250
What measures you did have in place?

757
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:11,280
Not what measures you didn't have in place

758
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,280
because you could go on forever on that.

759
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,360
- Yeah. All great points.

760
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:20,330
And just having done diligence myself

761
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:22,850
of about 500 companies now,

762
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:26,159
it's still amazing how many companies

763
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:29,096
don't do the basics on the
IR plan and the tabletops.

764
00:34:29,097 --> 00:34:31,500
And so I know these are
sort of fundamental concepts

765
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:34,020
but it's just something that, you know,

766
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,290
we don't see all that often.

767
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:37,100
So just putting it on the calendar,

768
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:40,210
taking the time to walk through the plan

769
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:43,804
and take lessons learned, you
know, critically important.

770
00:34:43,804 --> 00:34:44,960
- I mean, the teams are to be fair.

771
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,679
These security teams are burdened

772
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:49,049
with real life challenges
every single day.

773
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:53,130
So sometimes that next step
of prophylactic measures

774
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:54,929
and test measures are hard to work in.

775
00:34:54,929 --> 00:34:56,359
And that's why I agree with you, John,

776
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,500
it needs to be something
that's intentional and built

777
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:02,290
into the calendar in order
to make sure it happens.

778
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:04,740
- Yeah. Okay.

779
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:07,370
And can you take us through
maybe some legal defenses

780
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:10,640
that are working for companies?

781
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,473
- Yeah.

782
00:35:11,473 --> 00:35:13,040
And, you know, I will confess in advance.

783
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,910
I have a deep and wide low geek street,

784
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:19,870
so I'll try to put it at the
practical level for everyone.

785
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:23,350
So here's the thing when it
comes to data breach litigation,

786
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:26,160
usually the facts regarding the breach

787
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:30,910
are sort of not as much dispute
we can characterize them

788
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:31,743
like, does that show an absence

789
00:35:31,743 --> 00:35:34,197
of reasonable security or not?

790
00:35:34,197 --> 00:35:36,640
But the facts are the facts, right?

791
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:40,529
So where we get into the
legal arguments is okay,

792
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:41,680
a breach happened.

793
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,770
Sure.

794
00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:44,020
But what does it mean?

795
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:46,770
You know, and so the real battleground,

796
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:49,380
the legal battleground
for many of these cases

797
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,830
is proving damages.

798
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:52,710
And that's an area that's evolving

799
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:55,760
and getting a lot of focus by courts

800
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,030
and sort of their mixed results here.

801
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:01,800
So damages can come up
at the very beginning

802
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:05,430
of a case and often do in a
concept that's called standing.

803
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:06,750
And what standing means

804
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:08,580
is have you met the minimum threshold

805
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:09,790
to show that there's a case

806
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:12,509
or controversy in federal
court, for instance

807
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:14,750
the standard requires three things.

808
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:16,830
Number one, you have to show

809
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:21,830
that there was conduct
that resulted in damage.

810
00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:25,549
That damage has to be fairly
traceable to the event.

811
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:28,310
And then it has to, as I
said, result in damage.

812
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:32,520
So showing those two components
that it's fairly traceable

813
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:36,400
and resulting in damage has
been a really center stage

814
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,730
for a lot of the data
breach litigation early on.

815
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:42,520
I think courts were more hesitant to find

816
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,700
that there wasn't damage.

817
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,740
So they thought the very fact

818
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:49,819
that a bad actor got in and
took information that shows

819
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,880
that something bad's gonna happen.

820
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,800
But when given the more, you know

821
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,410
proliferation of breaches.

822
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:58,799
I think courts are now taking
a more exacting approach

823
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,440
to standing and asking, "All
right, yes, there is a breach

824
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:06,130
but do we know that there is
going to be resulting damage

825
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:08,240
or is it simply hypothetical?"

826
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,689
And when you look at the spectrum
of possibility of damages,

827
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:14,140
I think now where the
cases are shaking out

828
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:16,940
is you look at the type of
data that's been exposed.

829
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:19,190
So if it's what I would
call, home book data

830
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:22,050
in other words, things that
are published, you know

831
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:25,050
freely and frequently, and
doesn't really seem to be core

832
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:28,470
to the heart of privacy,
things like your name

833
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:31,390
or even your birthday, but
there's no financial information.

834
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:35,279
There's no social security
number or any of those things.

835
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,950
I think the court is more skeptical

836
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:39,410
to claims of potential damage.

837
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:42,990
Now, even The Ninth
Circuit, which is, I think

838
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:46,479
sort of notoriously pro
plaintiff just last month

839
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,420
had a decision

840
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:51,320
and a name that I will no doubt
get wrong, but it's vsneaky.

841
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,980
And in that case, the court said, you know

842
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:57,120
it was a case where there were allegations

843
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:00,240
of this type of telephone
book data being exposed.

844
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,279
And the court said, "You know,
I understand it concerns you

845
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,810
and you may have even
spent time or enrolled

846
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:09,110
in monitoring programs that
you voluntarily enrolled in

847
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:11,230
but that doesn't qualify as damages.

848
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:15,295
Increase in spam, increase
in annoyance phone calls,

849
00:38:15,295 --> 00:38:19,930
the pure claim that your PII
has somehow been diminished

850
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:21,620
because it's been exposed."

851
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:23,620
The courts are increasingly skeptical

852
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:26,230
of those kinds of claims and they fall

853
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:29,890
under the defense of either
standing or lack of damages.

854
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:33,240
So layer on top of that, another concept

855
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:36,069
which is if you can prove damages,

856
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:39,180
what about where there's
financial data exposed?

857
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:41,129
Well, there too, even if for instance

858
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:43,830
credit card information has been exposed

859
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:46,350
if you say in your complaint, for instance

860
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:49,990
that the charges were
reimbursed by the company

861
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:52,600
that you canceled your credit card

862
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:57,600
or that for instance, the
CCV number is not included.

863
00:38:57,890 --> 00:39:00,160
All those things sort of cut off

864
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,680
the possibility of future harm, right?

865
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:05,210
Because now you're not
using that credit card,

866
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:07,680
your numbers change, you've
changed your password

867
00:39:08,933 --> 00:39:11,210
or not everything has been
exposed that would allow

868
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:13,880
a bad actor to use that information.

869
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:17,070
There are two courts are
increasingly scrutinizing that.

870
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:18,280
So the real focus

871
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,710
and where defendants
have received traction,

872
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:24,670
I think in many of these
cases is early on very clearly

873
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:26,470
focusing on the data elements

874
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:28,560
and whether those data elements

875
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,350
can be used to cause the type

876
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:32,712
of harm that the law
considers compensable.

877
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:34,467
- Yeah.

878
00:39:34,467 --> 00:39:35,360
And I would just add there

879
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:40,360
that in April of this year,
April 26, to be specific,

880
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:44,770
the second circuit sort
of joined all the circuits

881
00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:48,200
who have opined on the standing question

882
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:51,830
in a case that's slightly
easier to pronounce

883
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:56,830
Devon De Chorus versus Carlos
Lopez and Associates, LLC.

884
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:03,290
And basically what the second
circuit decided was consistent

885
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:05,529
with what Anne Marie said,
the ninth circuit design

886
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:07,820
and other circuits decide,
but significantly, they said,

887
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,910
there's no real dispute
amongst the circuits

888
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:12,140
on how the standing argument plays out.

889
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:14,359
That there's general agreement.

890
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,393
So that is a good defense

891
00:40:16,393 --> 00:40:19,910
for companies to keep in their
back pocket and to take out

892
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:21,850
as soon as they need it.

893
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:23,680
- And it's not only a good legal defense

894
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,779
it makes practical sense, right?

895
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:28,210
Because what we've been trying to navigate

896
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:32,080
as the track record over data
breach litigation matures

897
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:35,520
is now we've gotten past the
point where the mere fact

898
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,940
of a breach should
expose you to liability.

899
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:40,650
And now we're taking, as
I think the law requires

900
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:45,650
a closer look at, can you
causally connect the causal dots

901
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:49,070
and show that there was
actual damage that resulted

902
00:40:49,070 --> 00:40:53,010
from that data breach as opposed
to other potential breaches

903
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:55,840
and or was the information exposed to

904
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:59,033
type of information that can
be used to actually do harm?

905
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,520
- More than just a generalized worry about

906
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:05,250
how it could come back
on somebody someday.

907
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:06,360
- Right. I mean, and again

908
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:08,620
I think the pendulum has swung somewhat

909
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:11,520
and what started as more
a circuit split is now

910
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,350
we see the circuits more aligned

911
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:14,913
and taking that closer look.

912
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,643
- Yeah, great.

913
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,610
And we have a case citation

914
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:22,150
in the materials we'll receive two,

915
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:24,550
which talks about that a
little bit, another case where

916
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:26,810
there was a standing defense
that I think illustrates

917
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:29,413
all the points that
Anne was making earlier.

918
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,429
Okay.

919
00:41:31,429 --> 00:41:34,970
Enough of that, let's
go back in the bungling.

920
00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:38,060
Brian, is there a way
that a breach response

921
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,600
could be bungled in such a manner

922
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,259
that somebody in the company goes to jail

923
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:44,633
rather than the hacker
who caused the breach?

924
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:48,263
- Well, you'd have to
really bungle it pretty bad,

925
00:41:49,322 --> 00:41:50,920
so, in order for the result to be

926
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:55,810
that you go to jail and not the criminal.

927
00:41:55,810 --> 00:41:56,883
So-

928
00:41:56,883 --> 00:41:57,716
- Hypothetical.

929
00:41:57,716 --> 00:41:59,577
Is not a hypothetical discussion.

930
00:41:59,577 --> 00:42:03,190
- But there are a couple of
circumstances that I can think

931
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:05,410
of that it's theoretically possible.

932
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:06,870
It's not that common.

933
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:10,450
I don't want anyone stay up
at night worrying about it

934
00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:13,439
but the three examples I can think of.

935
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,250
One, is the Uber example.

936
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:19,307
There's a recent indictment
against the former CSO Uber.

937
00:42:19,307 --> 00:42:20,792
And we can talk about that.

938
00:42:20,793 --> 00:42:22,530
It's very fact specific.

939
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:24,880
I don't think it has to
concern people too much

940
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,210
but it could be a
reoccurring fact pattern.

941
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:29,660
So we should make sure we
know what that's about.

942
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:35,630
Second one is the OFAC
guidance regarding ransomware.

943
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:40,379
OFAC specifically indicated

944
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:43,560
that there are certain payments.

945
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:44,840
You can make ransomware payments

946
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:47,220
to certain ransomware groups.

947
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:48,980
And while that's probably
not going to result

948
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:51,550
in criminal prosecution,

949
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:54,310
it could result in civil enforcement.

950
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:56,890
So that would be a bungle too.

951
00:42:56,890 --> 00:42:58,366
And then the third example

952
00:42:58,366 --> 00:43:00,660
and this one could result
in criminal enforcement.

953
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:01,493
Yeah.

954
00:43:01,493 --> 00:43:02,326
- Just to clarify, OFAC

955
00:43:02,326 --> 00:43:04,000
for anybody who doesn't
know is an extension

956
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,140
of the Treasury Department

957
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:08,180
which is the enforcement
arm that goes after

958
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:09,540
some of the bad guys

959
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:11,460
with treasury treasury-related sanctions.

960
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:12,770
Just to give a little bit of context

961
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:13,780
to what you were saying.

962
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:14,613
- Yeah

963
00:43:14,613 --> 00:43:15,850
Absolutely, thank you, John.

964
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:17,620
No, no, no problem.

965
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:21,009
And then the third one that
I can think of is hat back.

966
00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:25,420
You know, if you respond
to a hack by hacking back

967
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:29,130
then you're also potentially
breaking federal criminal law

968
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:30,040
and civil law

969
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:33,663
and theoretically, that could
also result in prosecution.

970
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:35,543
- All right.

971
00:43:35,543 --> 00:43:38,830
So I know there was a bit of a stir

972
00:43:38,830 --> 00:43:41,200
about the Uber indictments.

973
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,100
So do we want to go
through the facts of that?

974
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:46,130
And as you mentioned, Brian,
it is very fact-specific

975
00:43:47,070 --> 00:43:48,920
and what the implications
of that case are.

976
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:49,753
I think it helps

977
00:43:49,753 --> 00:43:52,960
for the audience to understand
what exactly happened there.

978
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:53,793
- Yeah.

979
00:43:53,793 --> 00:43:55,520
Sure, so we'll go over a little high level

980
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:58,110
'cause we only have so
much time, but essentially

981
00:43:58,110 --> 00:44:03,110
what happened here was that
Uber was allegedly breached

982
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:06,640
by a attacker/security researcher.

983
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:09,980
They usually go by both in terms of

984
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,650
if you ask them what the profession is

985
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:15,300
and specifically their software repository

986
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:18,240
which was on a site, like
GitHub it have been GitHub

987
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:22,089
but it was on a site like
that and was configured

988
00:44:22,090 --> 00:44:25,208
in such a way that the
attacker was able to get

989
00:44:25,208 --> 00:44:30,208
in the attacker threatens
to make the code public

990
00:44:30,890 --> 00:44:32,410
and make the hack public

991
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:35,649
unless they were paid as part
of the bug bounty program.

992
00:44:35,650 --> 00:44:37,280
So as part of the bug bounty program

993
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,921
or the vulnerability disclosure program

994
00:44:39,921 --> 00:44:43,390
the CSO engineered a payment,

995
00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:45,620
something like a hundred
thousand dollars to the hacker

996
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:49,978
which was 10 times the amount
that the policy allowed them

997
00:44:49,978 --> 00:44:52,660
to pay a hacker under the policy

998
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:55,580
under the vulnerability
disclosure program policy.

999
00:44:55,580 --> 00:44:57,740
And they entered into an NDA

1000
00:44:57,740 --> 00:45:01,000
with a hacker that basically
said the hacker was agreeing

1001
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,930
not to tell anyone that
they were able to breach

1002
00:45:04,930 --> 00:45:08,810
and get Uber's code or get Uber's...

1003
00:45:08,810 --> 00:45:09,810
They were actually able to get

1004
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:14,810
Uber's driver's names,
licensed information,

1005
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:18,410
a lot of PII associated with Uber drivers.

1006
00:45:18,410 --> 00:45:22,770
So he signed this NDA,
even though Uber's policy

1007
00:45:24,010 --> 00:45:25,523
as part of the bug bounty program said

1008
00:45:25,523 --> 00:45:29,690
that the security researcher
could make it public

1009
00:45:29,690 --> 00:45:31,450
that they did whatever they did.

1010
00:45:31,450 --> 00:45:33,750
Now that doesn't necessarily seem

1011
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:36,700
like it would rise to
a criminal indictment.

1012
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:38,649
And indeed based on those facts

1013
00:45:38,650 --> 00:45:40,660
it may not have been
a criminal indictment.

1014
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:42,899
What made it a criminal indictment was

1015
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:45,550
that Uber had suffered
a breach several years

1016
00:45:45,550 --> 00:45:47,150
earlier that occurred

1017
00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:51,220
in almost the exact
same manner and the FTC,

1018
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:54,629
the Federal Trade Commission
was investigating that breach

1019
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:56,167
and Uber and it CSO.

1020
00:45:56,167 --> 00:45:57,000
And it sounds like

1021
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,040
council were making all
kinds of representations

1022
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:04,770
in order to settle that
ongoing FTC investigation

1023
00:46:04,770 --> 00:46:07,790
and the defense part of Uber's defense

1024
00:46:07,790 --> 00:46:12,790
seemed to be that we learned our lesson.

1025
00:46:12,890 --> 00:46:15,770
We'll never make that mistake again.

1026
00:46:15,770 --> 00:46:19,700
And so you guys should limit
any fine limit, you know

1027
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:21,470
whatever kind of penalty
you're going to give us

1028
00:46:21,470 --> 00:46:24,959
to something very minimal
and we should move on.

1029
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,360
So they were in the process

1030
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:27,757
of sort of making that defense,

1031
00:46:27,757 --> 00:46:30,370
"Hey we've learned our
lesson never gonna happen,"

1032
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:32,759
when the exact same thing happened again.

1033
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:35,280
And so it was the impression

1034
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:38,810
of the FBI that he chewed
this criminal complaint

1035
00:46:38,810 --> 00:46:41,779
and presumably the attorneys, the AUSA's

1036
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:44,050
or prosecutors with whom they were working

1037
00:46:44,050 --> 00:46:47,717
that that was a material omission

1038
00:46:47,717 --> 00:46:50,840
and that they did not
provide any information

1039
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:53,640
about the current hack to the FTC

1040
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:56,279
and that the statements
they did make to the FTC

1041
00:46:56,280 --> 00:47:00,210
or someone misleading in
light of what had happened.

1042
00:47:00,210 --> 00:47:05,210
Now, I will say you never want
to make a misrepresentation

1043
00:47:05,410 --> 00:47:08,029
or omission in front
of a government agency.

1044
00:47:08,030 --> 00:47:10,260
You don't wanna come close to that line.

1045
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:12,320
If you have to ask yourself,

1046
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,930
is this really a relief?

1047
00:47:14,930 --> 00:47:15,960
If you have to ask yourself

1048
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:17,760
if you have to ask your county counsel

1049
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,820
my advice is to just disclose it

1050
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:24,720
because if you have to
ask, it's going to be...

1051
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:25,910
You don't want to take the risk.

1052
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:28,075
If you had to ask a judge
might have to ask to

1053
00:47:28,075 --> 00:47:31,250
a jury might might have to invite all find

1054
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:32,540
you shouldn't disclose it.

1055
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:34,420
That being said,

1056
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:36,620
from the information that was disclosed

1057
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:38,350
in the criminal complaint.

1058
00:47:38,350 --> 00:47:40,630
This seems to be in my opinion

1059
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:43,383
to be a fairly aggressive use

1060
00:47:43,383 --> 00:47:46,549
of this prosecution authority,

1061
00:47:46,550 --> 00:47:49,713
and I'm not sure how
incidental going all the way

1062
00:47:49,713 --> 00:47:51,542
through a jury trial

1063
00:47:51,542 --> 00:47:54,029
I'm not even sure how the
jury would come out on it.

1064
00:47:54,030 --> 00:47:59,030
I'm not sure whether they'll
be convicted or acquitted.

1065
00:47:59,030 --> 00:48:01,103
I think it's a bit of an open question.

1066
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:05,930
- Yeah, but to your point
about not getting close

1067
00:48:05,930 --> 00:48:08,500
to the line or anywhere near the line

1068
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:10,160
I think that's a great rule of thumb

1069
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:14,670
similar to Ann's New York
City billboard doctrine

1070
00:48:14,670 --> 00:48:17,050
about a breach communications, right?

1071
00:48:17,050 --> 00:48:19,420
If you have to ask yourself whether or not

1072
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:21,330
it can be perceived as withholding

1073
00:48:21,330 --> 00:48:26,330
or deceptive or under under
representing, under disclosing

1074
00:48:26,830 --> 00:48:30,990
then that's probably what
you really need to know

1075
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:34,470
as a guiding principle.

1076
00:48:34,470 --> 00:48:35,303
- Agreed.

1077
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:38,670
- Okay.

1078
00:48:38,670 --> 00:48:42,370
So again, this part, and I
think there was a question

1079
00:48:42,370 --> 00:48:45,970
about the question about the deck.

1080
00:48:45,970 --> 00:48:50,230
We do have some actionable recommendations

1081
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:51,160
that you can take away

1082
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:53,252
when you're able to access the materials.

1083
00:48:54,130 --> 00:48:55,790
So we put things out

1084
00:48:55,790 --> 00:48:59,080
for you that touch on all these
topics that we talked about

1085
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:02,100
including updating incident response plans

1086
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:07,100
for OFAC guidance, how
you can protect yourself

1087
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:10,690
from a situation like Uber,
thinking about privilege,

1088
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:12,660
incorporating that into your practices

1089
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:16,149
really denser response reports.

1090
00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:17,373
And so you'll see all that

1091
00:49:17,373 --> 00:49:20,113
in the materials that we mentioned.

1092
00:49:21,930 --> 00:49:24,836
Brian and Anne what else
do we need to talk about?

1093
00:49:24,836 --> 00:49:26,167
- I think again, boy,

1094
00:49:26,167 --> 00:49:30,630
we're in very quickly sort
of in a tsunami of words

1095
00:49:30,630 --> 00:49:33,120
saying all these things you
need to do and get them right.

1096
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:35,100
Otherwise you're gonna have potentially

1097
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:37,089
a bungled breach response.

1098
00:49:37,090 --> 00:49:38,980
You know, there's never
a perfect scenario.

1099
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:41,010
When you find yourself
in a breach situation,

1100
00:49:41,010 --> 00:49:44,460
all you can do is focus
on risk containment

1101
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:45,670
and risk mitigation.

1102
00:49:45,670 --> 00:49:48,480
There's no such thing as risk elimination.

1103
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:51,190
So take that burden off your shoulders.

1104
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:52,520
Let's start there.

1105
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:54,240
But I think, as I said before

1106
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:57,819
some of this comes down to
muscle memory and being prepared.

1107
00:49:57,820 --> 00:50:00,747
So you know, the old saying goes,

1108
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:02,850
"You hope for the best, but
you prepare for the worst."

1109
00:50:02,850 --> 00:50:05,839
I think that can't be truer
than in the breech context.

1110
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:09,040
And so the first thing I
think you need to do is think

1111
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:11,070
about this in graduated steps.

1112
00:50:11,070 --> 00:50:13,910
If you find yourself
in a breach situation,

1113
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:15,890
you know think of it in graduated steps

1114
00:50:15,890 --> 00:50:18,730
like you do your incident response plan.

1115
00:50:18,730 --> 00:50:19,930
And the first thing you do

1116
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:23,560
of course is to identify
what the incident is,

1117
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:27,410
capture the information
you can related to it.

1118
00:50:27,410 --> 00:50:31,049
But remember always at
that hindsight's 2020

1119
00:50:31,050 --> 00:50:32,940
but one of the first
questions you'll be asked

1120
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:36,030
in litigation, is did you
pay attention to the signals?

1121
00:50:36,030 --> 00:50:37,280
And those include signals

1122
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:40,750
from law enforcement,
signals from, you know

1123
00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:44,610
the gray hat hacking community
or from security vendors.

1124
00:50:44,610 --> 00:50:47,610
Like you're gonna be held to the standard

1125
00:50:47,610 --> 00:50:51,490
of what information about risks
and vulnerability was aware

1126
00:50:51,490 --> 00:50:54,589
available to you and sort
of this crosses over to

1127
00:50:54,590 --> 00:50:56,910
I think the point Brian was making that

1128
00:50:56,910 --> 00:51:00,500
while I agree that Uber
situation is very fact-specific

1129
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:04,230
and it should be both
something that doesn't keep you

1130
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:07,030
up at night, but is a cautionary tale.

1131
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:09,100
It might also be a good recommendation

1132
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:11,980
to establish a relationship
with law enforcement, right?

1133
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:16,060
Because that can be a
proactively helpful thing too.

1134
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:19,410
So in addition to having
those relationships,

1135
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:22,750
paying attention to the security community

1136
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:25,610
including gray hat and white hat hackers,

1137
00:51:25,610 --> 00:51:27,940
make sure you're mobilizing
your response team

1138
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:28,860
at the first sign

1139
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:31,370
of trouble and then start thinking about,

1140
00:51:31,370 --> 00:51:33,870
okay I need to make sure
all the stakeholders

1141
00:51:33,870 --> 00:51:36,730
including your trusted
legal advisors are involved

1142
00:51:36,730 --> 00:51:38,330
because you're going to from the get-go

1143
00:51:38,330 --> 00:51:40,040
wanna make sure you don't do things

1144
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:42,330
that create downstream litigation risk

1145
00:51:42,330 --> 00:51:44,930
in addition to the fact
of the breach itself.

1146
00:51:44,930 --> 00:51:46,299
And so what do I mean by that?

1147
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:49,770
I mean that you want to consider
and protect the privilege

1148
00:51:49,770 --> 00:51:52,160
and the ways that we've
been talking about,

1149
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:55,060
you want to make sure
you have, for instance

1150
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:57,160
a legal hold, what does that mean?

1151
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:59,810
Yes, as much as we worry
about the communications,

1152
00:51:59,810 --> 00:52:02,700
the reality is once there is litigation

1153
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:04,850
you have to preserve those communications

1154
00:52:04,850 --> 00:52:06,950
or you find yourself in trouble.

1155
00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:07,870
You want to consider

1156
00:52:07,870 --> 00:52:10,440
all your possible reporting obligations.

1157
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:13,240
So that means there's an alphabet soup

1158
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:15,009
of possible regulators involved

1159
00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:17,780
and you need to make sure
you're considering all of that.

1160
00:52:17,780 --> 00:52:20,050
So at the end of the day,
a lot of this comes down

1161
00:52:20,050 --> 00:52:22,600
to communication and
appropriate escalation

1162
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:25,960
which should be built into
your incident response plan,

1163
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:27,970
to make sure as a security team,

1164
00:52:27,970 --> 00:52:29,649
you don't want to be siloed.

1165
00:52:29,650 --> 00:52:31,650
That is a very lonely place to be.

1166
00:52:31,650 --> 00:52:33,810
And it's a place that creates risk.

1167
00:52:33,810 --> 00:52:35,810
So you wanna make sure the appropriate

1168
00:52:35,810 --> 00:52:39,140
internal stakeholders
are involved early on

1169
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:41,640
and therefore you make sure the lines

1170
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:43,190
of communication are open.

1171
00:52:43,190 --> 00:52:45,130
So those are some of the
things that I think about

1172
00:52:45,130 --> 00:52:47,210
right away when trying to consider,

1173
00:52:47,210 --> 00:52:50,400
how do I make sure that a bad
situation doesn't get worse

1174
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:51,503
and get away from me?

1175
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,200
- Yep, absolutely.

1176
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:56,689
Great points.

1177
00:52:56,690 --> 00:53:00,390
And Brian, I think we can
also talk a little bit more,

1178
00:53:00,390 --> 00:53:01,650
I know you mentioned them

1179
00:53:01,650 --> 00:53:03,730
but we can talk a little
bit more about hack back

1180
00:53:03,730 --> 00:53:06,560
and OFAC and build that
out a little bit more.

1181
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:09,520
- Yeah, sure.

1182
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:13,610
So first on hack back, that's
another way you can end up

1183
00:53:13,610 --> 00:53:14,960
on the wrong side of the law.

1184
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:17,600
So I, you know, people talk about this

1185
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:19,480
as though it's a big problem

1186
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:23,750
like companies are advocating
through certain cyber lawyers,

1187
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:26,940
they really need the ability to hack back.

1188
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:29,240
First of all, that they're
envisioning a scenario

1189
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:30,609
that almost never comes up.

1190
00:53:30,610 --> 00:53:31,950
It may not have ever come up.

1191
00:53:31,950 --> 00:53:34,290
They're envisioning a scenario for example

1192
00:53:34,290 --> 00:53:36,820
where their trade secret is stolen

1193
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:39,280
and they discovered by a
hacker and they discover

1194
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:42,420
that it's sitting out there
on a server, just waiting

1195
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:46,060
for them to hack into that
server and just take it back.

1196
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:47,720
- Well it sounds appealing Brian.

1197
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:49,939
I mean, it sounds like it
would be a fun thing to do,

1198
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:51,023
so why not?

1199
00:53:52,690 --> 00:53:53,820
- It does.

1200
00:53:53,820 --> 00:53:56,357
It does sound appealing and companies say,

1201
00:53:56,357 --> 00:53:58,890
"Oh, we need the right, the
ability to do this," right?

1202
00:53:58,890 --> 00:54:02,759
So of course it's always
discouraged self-help we know,

1203
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:04,340
we know that as lawyers-

1204
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:06,760
- And I'm, by the way,
not encouraging it myself.

1205
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:09,233
I was being, I was being
a little flip there.

1206
00:54:10,486 --> 00:54:11,319
- We know that as lawyers,

1207
00:54:11,319 --> 00:54:14,445
and we know it violates a potentially

1208
00:54:14,445 --> 00:54:15,670
violates the computer fraud and abuse act.

1209
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:17,430
And while you think you
might be reaching out

1210
00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:20,009
to the criminal's computer, your criminal

1211
00:54:20,010 --> 00:54:23,630
always acts through another
infected computer or server.

1212
00:54:23,630 --> 00:54:25,550
So you're most likely reaching out.

1213
00:54:25,550 --> 00:54:27,010
You would most likely be reaching out

1214
00:54:27,010 --> 00:54:29,320
to an innocent parties, server,

1215
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:32,030
trespassing and hacking their server.

1216
00:54:32,030 --> 00:54:34,985
But as a practical matter,
there's really no need for this.

1217
00:54:34,985 --> 00:54:37,160
Ann Marie made a really
good point in terms

1218
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:40,339
of getting law enforcement,
developing relationships

1219
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:42,540
with law enforcement
in advance of a breach.

1220
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:43,580
And that's super important.

1221
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:46,279
We always recommend
developing a relationship

1222
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:48,380
with your local cyber agent.

1223
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:50,600
So you go on the FBI's website

1224
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:54,110
find the field office nearest
to you or to your client,

1225
00:54:54,110 --> 00:54:56,120
and have conversation in advance.

1226
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:58,040
Get to meet the cyber agents

1227
00:54:58,040 --> 00:55:00,830
such that you have their
personal information,

1228
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:03,210
their card with you at all times.

1229
00:55:03,210 --> 00:55:04,770
- Brian, they can be great sources

1230
00:55:04,770 --> 00:55:07,170
of information to help
you respond to breaches.

1231
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:08,110
Don't you think?

1232
00:55:08,110 --> 00:55:10,680
- Exactly they can be very helpful.

1233
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:13,710
And the thing is, what we found is

1234
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:15,660
if you have no relationship in advance,

1235
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:16,899
if you have a ransomware attack,

1236
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:19,570
you have anything and you
reach out, you may hear nothing

1237
00:55:19,570 --> 00:55:21,727
in the timeframe that you would need to be

1238
00:55:21,727 --> 00:55:23,759
for it to be helpful.

1239
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,500
Whereas if you have a
personal relationship

1240
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:28,920
in this halfback example,
you can reach out right away.

1241
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:31,810
And the office that I
was with with the DOJ,

1242
00:55:31,810 --> 00:55:33,140
the computer crime

1243
00:55:33,140 --> 00:55:35,230
and intellectual property section

1244
00:55:35,230 --> 00:55:38,250
has worked with the FBI
to develop the capability

1245
00:55:38,250 --> 00:55:40,430
to get a very fast warrant

1246
00:55:40,430 --> 00:55:43,549
or use exigent circumstances
to quickly go in

1247
00:55:43,550 --> 00:55:44,830
and do what they need to do.

1248
00:55:44,830 --> 00:55:47,730
If one of these unusual
circumstances occurred

1249
00:55:47,730 --> 00:55:50,060
if it's an exigent circumstance situation

1250
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:52,630
the FBI can just take over
your accounts and go in

1251
00:55:52,630 --> 00:55:56,820
and get the thing under exigent
circumstances potentially.

1252
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:58,750
And it would be legal
for them to do it where

1253
00:55:58,750 --> 00:56:01,820
it would be a crime for you
to do the exact same thing.

1254
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:05,310
So it usually makes
sense to let the FBI lead

1255
00:56:05,310 --> 00:56:06,210
in that effort.

1256
00:56:06,210 --> 00:56:08,960
If you have their contact
information available

1257
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:10,580
you could do that pretty easily.

1258
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:11,980
The last thing I'm just going to

1259
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:14,170
jump right into OFAC as well.

1260
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:15,235
'Cause we only have a few minutes.

1261
00:56:15,235 --> 00:56:16,630
(garbled speech)

1262
00:56:16,630 --> 00:56:18,410
Yeah, so as John mentioned,

1263
00:56:18,410 --> 00:56:21,770
that's the Office of Foreign
Asset Control with the Treasury

1264
00:56:21,770 --> 00:56:25,250
and they can sanction particular groups,

1265
00:56:25,250 --> 00:56:27,640
particular individuals,
particular countries,

1266
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:28,569
and make it illegal

1267
00:56:28,570 --> 00:56:31,064
for you to do any transactions with them.

1268
00:56:31,064 --> 00:56:33,930
Done that with respect to ransomware

1269
00:56:33,930 --> 00:56:36,850
and with respect to
specific ransomware actors.

1270
00:56:36,850 --> 00:56:40,140
And that means that if you make
the payment to those groups,

1271
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:43,970
to those actors, then you
can be strictly liable.

1272
00:56:43,970 --> 00:56:45,390
That's what the OFAC has said.

1273
00:56:45,390 --> 00:56:46,223
Strictly level.

1274
00:56:46,223 --> 00:56:50,440
Even if you didn't know that
those were sanctioned groups

1275
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:53,120
or sanctioned individuals
or sanctioned entities.

1276
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:55,299
So, and if you're strictly liable

1277
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:59,290
you'd potentially be facing
a significant penalty

1278
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:00,640
by the treasury department.

1279
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:01,890
It hasn't happened yet

1280
00:57:01,890 --> 00:57:03,759
but the treasury department
has made it clear

1281
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:05,440
that they are willing to do that

1282
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:07,010
and they are ready to do it.

1283
00:57:07,010 --> 00:57:09,047
So if you are either
considering first of all

1284
00:57:09,047 --> 00:57:12,310
if you have a ransomware
attack or any cyber attack

1285
00:57:12,310 --> 00:57:16,230
where you're considering making
a payment to the bad actor

1286
00:57:16,230 --> 00:57:17,910
you definitely want to consult

1287
00:57:17,910 --> 00:57:20,910
with outside breach
counsel who specializes

1288
00:57:20,910 --> 00:57:22,970
in this area before doing it.

1289
00:57:22,970 --> 00:57:24,450
And you want to be very careful

1290
00:57:24,450 --> 00:57:26,640
about making payments any organization

1291
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:28,303
that could be on that list.

1292
00:57:32,230 --> 00:57:33,860
- Okay. Terrific.

1293
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:38,550
Well, I know we're running up
on time, so I just want to say

1294
00:57:38,550 --> 00:57:41,430
for everybody who attended
really great to have you

1295
00:57:41,430 --> 00:57:43,720
on board for sharing the questions

1296
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:45,653
in the comments along the way.

1297
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:49,240
Brian and Ann really appreciate you

1298
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:50,830
being such great panelists

1299
00:57:50,830 --> 00:57:52,490
and leading a very stimulating discussion.

1300
00:57:52,490 --> 00:57:54,740
We covered a lot of ground,
but hopefully I think, you know

1301
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:57,870
very useful, very actionable
getting people caught up

1302
00:57:57,870 --> 00:58:00,330
on some of the legal policy

1303
00:58:00,330 --> 00:58:03,873
and other considerations
happening in cybersecurity today.

1304
00:58:04,950 --> 00:58:07,160
Brian, Ann any closing comments?

1305
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:10,373
Anything else that you'd like
our audience to understand?

1306
00:58:11,250 --> 00:58:13,700
- I mean, that was a lot of
information in a short period

1307
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:15,770
of time and they should
feel free to reach out

1308
00:58:15,770 --> 00:58:18,940
with any kind of questions if
anyone has some, but you know

1309
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:20,440
you guys have a tough job.

1310
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:22,030
I have a lot of respect for you

1311
00:58:22,030 --> 00:58:24,193
and our job is to make your job easier.

1312
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:26,770
- Last thing, that's a great point Ann.

1313
00:58:26,770 --> 00:58:28,580
I agree the last thing I'll say

1314
00:58:28,580 --> 00:58:31,740
is that consists of
what we've been saying.

1315
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:33,720
The best thing you can do today

1316
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:35,569
you can start now is prepare

1317
00:58:35,570 --> 00:58:37,100
for this sort of thing to happen.

1318
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:39,670
And there's at least two aspects to that.

1319
00:58:39,670 --> 00:58:43,870
One is for all of your clients
and for your firms as well

1320
00:58:43,870 --> 00:58:47,130
make sure you're getting a
cyber security assessment

1321
00:58:47,130 --> 00:58:49,050
a comprehensive cybersecurity assessment

1322
00:58:49,050 --> 00:58:50,810
to understand what are the strengths

1323
00:58:50,810 --> 00:58:52,390
and weaknesses of your program

1324
00:58:52,390 --> 00:58:55,560
and opportunities to improve
before something happens.

1325
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:58,570
Maybe it'll prevent a big
incident, but even if it doesn't

1326
00:58:58,570 --> 00:58:59,910
you're gonna be a much better position

1327
00:58:59,910 --> 00:59:01,420
with courts and regulators.

1328
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:03,430
If you've taken that step in advance

1329
00:59:03,430 --> 00:59:07,669
and work towards any remediation
that need to be made.

1330
00:59:07,670 --> 00:59:08,503
That's the first point.

1331
00:59:08,503 --> 00:59:10,190
And the second point is we talked about

1332
00:59:10,190 --> 00:59:11,180
in terms of preparation

1333
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:14,649
is you have an incident response plan,

1334
00:59:14,650 --> 00:59:19,650
test it regularly and be be
prepared to use it, take it out.

1335
00:59:20,130 --> 00:59:21,590
The moment something happens

1336
00:59:21,590 --> 00:59:24,040
don't start improvising
and having communication.

1337
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:28,193
- Okay. Terrific.

1338
00:59:29,350 --> 00:59:30,450
Well, thank you again.

1339
00:59:31,410 --> 00:59:32,830
I know that we could've gone on

1340
00:59:32,830 --> 00:59:35,870
for quite a bit longer on
these topics, but again

1341
00:59:35,870 --> 00:59:37,680
so like we had a great discussion

1342
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:40,580
and hope everybody is able to enjoy

1343
00:59:40,580 --> 00:59:42,450
the rest of the conference.

1344
00:59:42,450 --> 00:59:43,716
- Thanks everyone.

1345
00:59:43,717 --> 00:59:44,717
- Take care.
