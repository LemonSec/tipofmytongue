1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:03,883
- Hi, I'm Mike Rudolph,
CTO of YouMail Inc.

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,789
- Hi, I'm Josh Bercu,
vice president of policy

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:10,913
and advocacy at US Telecom,
the broadband association.

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,650
- And today we will be talking
about, taking back your brand

5
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:16,500
and new techniques to stop robocalls.

6
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:22,580
So I don't know of you,
but I get personally,

7
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:24,520
a lot of robocallers that ring my phone.

8
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:25,759
And one of the things that we do over here

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,050
at YouMail is we count
how many Americans are

10
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:30,260
receiving every month and every year.

11
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:32,880
In 2019, there were nearly 60 billion

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,370
unwanted unsafe calls
received by Americans.

13
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,120
In 2020, those numbers were down,'

14
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,760
just over 50 billion unwanted calls

15
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,879
and a big reason why
there was a drop in 2020

16
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,030
was the call centers that you
would press one or press two

17
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:49,300
to connect into, when
you receive these calls

18
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,980
had to shut down, to the pandemic.

19
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,709
We just recently published
the numbers for March,

20
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:57,650
there were over 6 billion
unwanted calls in March

21
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:02,530
which means we're probably
gonna break 60 billion in 2021.

22
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:05,040
This is bad news, not just for you

23
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,830
on the receiving end of these calls

24
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:10,039
but if you're a brand trying
to call your customers,

25
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,670
now your customers don't know,

26
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:14,770
is this actually my bank
calling or is this an imposter

27
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:16,380
pretending to be my bank calling.

28
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:19,170
So now Americans aren't
answering the phone

29
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:21,720
where they receive unknown phone calls

30
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,429
Our FTC maintain something called

31
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:27,740
the Consumer Sentinel Network

32
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:32,419
where anybody who is a victim
of identity theft or fraud

33
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,920
if they want to, they
can report it to the FTC.

34
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,660
So the FTC can count these
numbers up every year

35
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:40,220
and release them from the public.

36
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:44,280
We can actually see here,
a huge spike in 2020

37
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,210
where the FTC collected 4.7 million

38
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:49,210
of these reports in 2020,

39
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:53,119
up from about the low three
millions in the past few years.

40
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,690
When you actually dig into the data

41
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:57,631
and the FTC maintains a
spectacular website, where you can

42
00:01:57,631 --> 00:01:59,130
you can drill into the data.

43
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:00,619
You can see it by state.

44
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,840
You can see it by topic.

45
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,640
You can see it by demographic.

46
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,610
We can actually see, they
actually will ask people,

47
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:09,009
hey when you were the
victim of identity theft

48
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:10,889
or the victim of fraud,
how did they get you?

49
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:13,890
How the bad guys figure
out how to trick you

50
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:17,779
and the top method of initial contact

51
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:21,530
for victims of ID theft
and fraud is a phone call.

52
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:22,890
So you answered the wrong phone call

53
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,649
whether it was a live phone call that came

54
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:27,074
into your device or a
voicemail was left for you.

55
00:02:27,074 --> 00:02:30,892
And that voicemail was
offering you a car warranty

56
00:02:30,892 --> 00:02:35,609
or was offering or threatening
you as the IRS to, you know,

57
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:39,410
send out a warrant for your arrest.

58
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:42,070
Consumers respond to
those inbound phone calls.

59
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:44,290
Number two, text message.

60
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:46,640
You'll see, though, in that,
that, that number three call

61
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,149
out though that the total damages reported

62
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:52,280
to people engaging in SMS
message about one fifth

63
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,570
as much as engaging with
the wrong phone call.

64
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:59,250
So what we've basically
seen now is phone calls

65
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:04,250
are this huge new medium for
ID theft, fraudsters scammers

66
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:09,531
to get ahold of unsuspecting
Americans and trick them

67
00:03:09,531 --> 00:03:12,173
into parting with their
money or their identities.

68
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,760
So let's listen to a couple of these.

69
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,380
I'm gonna play the
rightmost one first here

70
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,815
which is your car warranty call.

71
00:03:20,815 --> 00:03:23,513
And I believe, I think now
every American's probably gotten

72
00:03:23,513 --> 00:03:25,444
about 50 of these.

73
00:03:25,444 --> 00:03:26,277
So let's listen

74
00:03:26,277 --> 00:03:28,989
- [Woman] We've been trying
to reach you concerning

75
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:31,190
your car's extended warranty.

76
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,440
You should have received something

77
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,480
in the mail about your
car is extended warranty.

78
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,609
Since we have not gotten a response

79
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:40,820
we are giving you a final
courtesy call before we close

80
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:44,209
out your file, press two,
to be removed and put on our

81
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:47,310
do not call list, press
one, to speak with someone

82
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:51,730
about possibly extending or
reinstating your car's warranty.

83
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:54,480
Again, press one, to
speak with a warranty...

84
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:56,820
- So I don't know about
you, but I've pressed

85
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,480
to be removed by that, for that,
from that list a few times.

86
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,019
And they don't, they don't
remove from the list.

87
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,340
In fact, when you actually press anything

88
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,410
to engage that caller,
you go onto a hit list

89
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:09,960
and you actually will get called
more so not not good news.

90
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,500
If you look on the bottom
right here, we can even

91
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:16,420
see a graph where it can see
the car warranty call has gone

92
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,519
from about 40 million a month

93
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:22,240
up to 180 million as a February, 2021.

94
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,140
So the parties behind this
college is getting more

95
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,846
and more aggressive in terms of dialing

96
00:04:27,846 --> 00:04:32,440
for leads to sell you a
really shoddy car warranty.

97
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,760
On the left, we have another
thing which is a COVID free

98
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,330
testing kit call.

99
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:40,080
So Josh and I have been working together

100
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,380
on this for a number of years here.

101
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:44,430
And we see that the bad
guys behind these calls

102
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,852
always are looking for
something opportunistic.

103
00:04:46,852 --> 00:04:48,549
You know, the winds are blowing

104
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:51,750
and they see an opportunity
to take advantage of folks.

105
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,760
For example, when there was

106
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,920
the power outages in
Texas, we'll see a surge

107
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,730
of people calling in a
person and utility companies

108
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:04,520
in Texas throwing the
turnoff consumers power

109
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,289
unless they engage with this imposter.

110
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:10,680
When there's fires, we've
seen bad guys pretend

111
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,510
to be charities raising
money for a fireman

112
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:15,580
or relief victims.

113
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:19,060
So with the pandemic hitting America

114
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,010
you can bet there's a ton of folks

115
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:23,030
who were seizing the
opportunity to call folks

116
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:26,299
and either offer them, you
know, paid vaccines, you know,

117
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,940
before the vaccines were
widely, publicly available

118
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,340
offering them testing kits

119
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:34,619
offering them access to
stimulus programs, press one

120
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:37,030
or you won't get your stimulus check.

121
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:39,852
So let's listen to a
one of those bad guys.

122
00:05:40,697 --> 00:05:43,580
- [Woman] The Corona
virus has caused the US

123
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:46,120
to declare a national emergency.

124
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,310
And families, first Corona
Virus response act has made

125
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:53,360
Corona Virus testing more
accessible immediately.

126
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,160
If you want to receive a free testing kit

127
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,107
delivered overnight year homes, Press one.

128
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,890
- So maybe the Corona
Virus testing kit was free

129
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:06,240
but she had to pay a
hundred dollars in shipping.

130
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,190
So not necessarily
something that you wanna do

131
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,410
or something you're wanna engage in.

132
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,800
And some of those,

133
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,900
some of those bad actors
behind a whole bunch

134
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,590
of those Corona Virus
calls are actually just

135
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:17,440
seeking to get you to part
with your personal information.

136
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,120
So how do we know about these metrics?

137
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,390
You know, how do we know that

138
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:25,200
there were nearly 200
million car warranty calls

139
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,360
in February, 2021?

140
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,840
Well, YouMail, if you've heard of YouMail

141
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:32,570
or not is effectively
America's answering service.

142
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:34,219
So over the last decade

143
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,530
YouMail has had 10
million Americans sign up

144
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:38,349
for our answering service.

145
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:42,310
And instead of having
Verizon or AT&T or Sprint

146
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,460
or T-Mobile answer your unanswered calls,

147
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:47,120
our customers send those
calls to our call platform.

148
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,210
And our call platform
over the last few years

149
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:51,650
has become this giant sensor network where

150
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:56,650
we can catch these bad calls
when they call on consumers.

151
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:59,700
And these are real calls
to real mobile numbers.

152
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:02,140
So a lot of the bad guys
have gotten really clever

153
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:04,200
before they place an outbound call.

154
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,870
They might make sure that, hey,
am I calling a sprint user?

155
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:09,180
Am I calling an AT&T user?

156
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:12,160
So they'll try to avoid
calling any systems where

157
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,690
they think they might get caught

158
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:17,230
and really only call,
you know, juicy leads.

159
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:19,700
In fact, a lot of these scammers

160
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,620
will actually exchange lists.

161
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:24,950
So if one scammer finds
a victim, they'll say,

162
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,760
hey this guy is a great person to call

163
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,460
and they'll pass that data around.

164
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,380
And that person will actually be besieged

165
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,890
by even more calls.

166
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:35,789
Whereas if they call you
and you'd never answer

167
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:38,870
or they get disconnected, cut
tones, calling your number

168
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:40,400
they'll take you off those lists.

169
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,409
So that was one feature that

170
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:45,060
we leveraged for our consumers
is we'll play the disconnect

171
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,192
it tones when scammers call

172
00:07:46,192 --> 00:07:49,900
and get those scammers to
think your phone's not actually

173
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,840
in service and stop wasting
time and money calling you.

174
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,060
We've also been lucky
enough to get integrated

175
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:57,760
into the switch or the SBC level

176
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,099
at a lot of network operators.

177
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,980
So we use all these signals

178
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,330
and we're gathering them into
this giant sensor network

179
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:05,380
and we're trying to catch these bad guys.

180
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:08,310
So one of the things that our team does

181
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:10,570
and we've got a whole data
team that looks at this data

182
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:12,409
every hour of every day,

183
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:17,090
is we actually monitor all the
calls per brand in America.

184
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:19,799
So we have all the consumer facing brands

185
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,800
and the top fortune 500.

186
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,432
So those are banks, Amazon,
and Apple obviously,

187
00:08:25,432 --> 00:08:27,110
benefits companies.

188
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:29,930
We've got cable companies, telcos.

189
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:33,950
And what you're looking at here
is a graph over time of, for

190
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:38,530
at least the sample of fortune
100 brands alphabetically

191
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:42,919
A through J, the number of
calls operating as those brands

192
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,610
which you actually can look at this graph.

193
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:47,170
You can see about March, 2019,

194
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:50,250
there might've been a big
spike in Amazon calls.

195
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:53,630
Over time we could see now,
in this red area on the graph

196
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:56,380
there's more Amazon calls
now, than ever before.

197
00:08:56,380 --> 00:09:00,130
So our team will dig into
the data and look and see,

198
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:02,210
hey is that really Amazon
making those phone calls?

199
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:03,043
Or does that look like somebody

200
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:05,750
impersonating Amazon making those calls?

201
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,850
And so by looking at the
volume of an individual brand

202
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:12,120
over time, that enables
our team to go in and see

203
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,070
are there impersonators in those calls

204
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:15,890
seeking the co-op those brands

205
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:18,253
and attack Americans and trick them.

206
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:24,010
So we're gonna drill into
one specific brand here.

207
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:27,023
So first I wanna make
everybody feel very comfortable

208
00:09:27,023 --> 00:09:28,760
that we're doing this

209
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,090
and we're we're
safeguarding their privacy.

210
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:33,890
So in the upper left here,
you can see what kinda

211
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:37,730
looks like an explosion of
dots, of different colors.

212
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:40,590
That's a scatterplot machine
learning AI algorithms

213
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:43,093
can take a sample of 10,000,

214
00:09:43,093 --> 00:09:45,990
a hundred thousand calls,
and they can plot them

215
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:47,900
on an X Y access where the depth

216
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:51,650
the distance between each dot represents

217
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,760
differences between those individual calls

218
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,340
and the machine learning
algorithms can then

219
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:01,180
kinda draw a circle around
dots that are all located

220
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:03,339
on the graph next to each other.

221
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:05,260
So you'll see in the upper left,

222
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:08,020
there's like a green cluster
with an X in the middle of it.

223
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,939
Whereas, you know, maybe
in the bottom right

224
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,760
there's a darker green cluster

225
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,210
with an X in the middle of it.

226
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:14,920
So the machine learner
could take a hundred

227
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:18,599
thousand calls offering as a
brand and then cluster them

228
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,950
without listening to them in order to say,

229
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:23,910
hey these calls all look very similar

230
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:26,780
and we should maybe
investigate those calls.

231
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,290
So we take this clustering

232
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:31,040
and then we plot it on
a time series graph.

233
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,939
And you could see down below, now

234
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:37,380
from January, 2018 to present
a bunch of different colors.

235
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:41,990
So in the case of this
specific brand, the purple area

236
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:44,040
our call is legitimately
made by that brand.

237
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,459
In this case, they are confirming a hotel

238
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,290
stay with this brand.

239
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:51,360
Anything that is not
purple is an impersonator

240
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,130
or an imposter of that brand.

241
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:58,130
So a pretty big obvious
incursion into this brand

242
00:10:58,538 --> 00:11:02,390
in early 2020, which
the team's able to catch

243
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:04,980
through the machine
learning, which is, you know,

244
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,690
respecting folk's privacy

245
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:09,100
and these independent
consumer reports we get where

246
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:12,740
their suspicion that the
brand has been co-opted.

247
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:16,550
So what we do then, is
we take all those calls

248
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:20,000
in those colored lanes
in that time series graph

249
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,560
and we could generate a
fingerprint just like you would

250
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,329
if you touched a wine glass to indicate

251
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:27,200
that you were present in the crime scene.

252
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,870
So the audio payload of this call

253
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:29,810
at the ones we just listened

254
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:33,439
to the COVID call and
the car warranty call has

255
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,850
a unique fingerprint digital fingerprint.

256
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:37,720
And we can look for that on future calls

257
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,270
to collect all these calls
and group them together.

258
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:44,210
So here's a little bit
about how fingerprinting

259
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:47,860
works to help folks who might
be concerned about privacy.

260
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:50,640
I've got a sample called A up on top,

261
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,990
this is a known fraud call.

262
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:54,010
This is a call that actually impersonating

263
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:56,860
a major US carrier saying, hey, you're not

264
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:00,260
paying your bill on time,
press one, to resolve this.

265
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,380
Otherwise your phone
service will be terminated

266
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:05,220
which is a pretty scary
call to give somebody.

267
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,521
And I suspect they get a
lot of folks pressing one

268
00:12:07,521 --> 00:12:09,063
and providing credit card information

269
00:12:09,063 --> 00:12:12,150
to this carrier imposter.

270
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:14,150
So we'll generate a
fingerprint for that call.

271
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:17,150
So call B comes in and we're
not gonna listen to call B.

272
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:19,500
We don't, we don't hear a
call between the husband

273
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,015
wife or two people dating.

274
00:12:22,015 --> 00:12:25,220
And you know, we're not invading
that phone call but call B,

275
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:28,950
we can say, hey, how
similar is call B to call A?

276
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:31,590
So one way is we kind of delete call B

277
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:34,440
from call A or we diff call B from call A

278
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,540
and that produces that blue
area that you see there

279
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,250
to the right to call B.

280
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,330
And when that area is blue, it's cold.

281
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:41,360
That means there's not a lot

282
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,467
of differences between those two calls.

283
00:12:43,467 --> 00:12:45,500
And if you look, let me take that audio

284
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,670
and even turn it into an
image like that fingerprint,

285
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:51,390
call A and call B have a
very similar fingerprint.

286
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:54,110
If you're just doing standard
fingerprint matching.

287
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:55,200
Now I have called C

288
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,230
and call C is a completely different call.

289
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:59,830
Your iPhone repair is complete,

290
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:03,803
come down by 7:00 PM and pick
up your iPhone from our store.

291
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:08,439
If I diff or I delete call C from call A

292
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,350
you can see it's red, which
means there's a lot of

293
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:12,890
differences between those two
calls, there's a lot of heat.

294
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:15,290
So we know that call
is not a positive match

295
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:19,130
to that fraud or imposter
call of that carrier.

296
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:20,260
And when we generate the fingerprint,

297
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,900
you can see it's very
different from, from call A.

298
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,770
So in this case, we
know that call's private

299
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:25,710
don't give them that call.

300
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:27,070
Don't group it in

301
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:30,103
with this illegal class
of impersonator calls.

302
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:35,010
So again, we've got, we've
covered a lot of different

303
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:36,770
things, but what we're trying to do here,

304
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:39,880
is we're trying to group
a lot of calls in volume,

305
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,900
by what they're saying and
taking what they're saying

306
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:45,350
and identifying that they're all carrying

307
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:47,110
this illegal content.

308
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:50,840
So here again, I've got our
answering service agreement,

309
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,660
phone call, hi, John's not
available, leave a message.

310
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,740
In this case, the bad guy is pretend

311
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:58,330
to be our social security administration

312
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:01,100
and begin speaking his
campaign where he's gonna say

313
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,593
press one, otherwise
you're gonna be arrested.

314
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:05,690
We can take all these calls.

315
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:07,320
We can fingerprint them.

316
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,637
And then what's spectacular about stopping

317
00:14:09,637 --> 00:14:13,989
these guys is we can take all
these calls, which can be tens

318
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:16,430
of thousands or hundreds
of thousands of calls.

319
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:18,699
And I could turn them
over to my good friend

320
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,400
Josh here at the Industry Traceback Group,

321
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:25,410
and we can figure out where
are those calls coming from?

322
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:26,520
- Thanks Mike.

323
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,790
And as Mike said, we work
very closely with YouMail

324
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:32,120
and Mike did a really great job talking

325
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,200
about the scope of the robocall problem.

326
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,760
I'm going to talk a little bit

327
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,580
about why we have this problem

328
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:42,720
and then what the
communications industry is doing

329
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,940
to solve it in particular,
focusing on Traceback.

330
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:50,210
So why do we have a robocall problem?

331
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:53,730
Like many of the other issues
that are being addressed

332
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:56,330
at this conference, it's really about

333
00:14:56,330 --> 00:15:00,270
the rise of internet
technology and in particular

334
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:04,970
voiceover internet protocol,
voice technology here, we went

335
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:09,970
from a telephone network that
was high capital business

336
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:13,820
that you had a small number
of trusted providers.

337
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:16,720
And then with the rise of voice,

338
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,910
we got many benefits, calling got cheaper,

339
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:22,230
long distance calling
cheaper, international

340
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:27,070
calling cheaper, but also
cheaper for anyone anywhere

341
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:30,620
in the world, including these
bad actors to deliver hundreds

342
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,560
and thousands, hundreds of thousands

343
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,410
and millions of calls per day to us.

344
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:38,290
And then part of it in
that trusted telephone

345
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:40,560
network is you could trust
the caller ID because

346
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,339
there were only so many
providers that could generate it.

347
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,830
And they were all providers
that you knew the name of,

348
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:46,880
you could trust them.

349
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,610
There were not protections built in

350
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:51,620
to make sure it was
only trusted providers.

351
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:55,830
So as we evolve to a ecosystem
with thousands and thousands

352
00:15:55,830 --> 00:16:00,140
of providers that trust in the
caller ID went way as well.

353
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,439
And for those callers

354
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,660
whether they're in India,
Pakistan, Dominican Republic

355
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,949
who are generating these illegal calls

356
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:10,623
they can very easily fake the caller ID.

357
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:14,310
And that's why you can
no longer trust that

358
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:16,369
it's actually your neighbor or your bank

359
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:20,170
or whoever else at the
current moment and time.

360
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:21,709
The other thing that's happened

361
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:24,840
and that makes things
a little more complex

362
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:29,730
for investigating and where
Traceback comes in is,

363
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:33,740
there's a dynamic arbitrage
market for these calls

364
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:36,920
for call traffic and providers are

365
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:41,959
competing on half a penny
to carry more traffic

366
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,030
than the next provider, fractions of penny

367
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:48,416
even less than half a penny,
a fraction of a penny, just to

368
00:16:48,417 --> 00:16:50,900
in a volume business to try
to get a little more traffic

369
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:53,610
than the next guy originated
a little more traffic

370
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:54,850
than the next guy.

371
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:56,730
And so that that's also been part

372
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:58,960
of the ecosystem that
makes it hard to figure out

373
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,143
where are these calls
actually coming from?

374
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:04,053
So what's the industry doing about it?

375
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:08,270
One thing they industry
is doing is deploying very

376
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:09,440
powerful call blocking tools

377
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,910
there's tools that the
providers deploy there's tools

378
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:16,589
like YouMail that Mike
has, that's doing a lot

379
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:18,040
of great things for consumers that

380
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:21,310
download YouMail put it on their phone.

381
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:24,000
And then that's one thing we're doing.

382
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,398
Another thing we're doing
is deploying stir shaken

383
00:17:26,398 --> 00:17:28,810
which will help help to reduce some

384
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:30,460
of the trust in that caller ID.

385
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:32,902
Make sure that when you see it, that there

386
00:17:32,902 --> 00:17:35,070
that you can actually trust it.

387
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:38,963
But what I'm focusing
on today is Traceback.

388
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:41,493
So what is Traceback?

389
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:46,700
At its core, it's a pretty simple thing.

390
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:50,530
We have a process that
we use to identify where

391
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:53,260
the illegal call is actually coming from

392
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:56,090
because the caller ID can
be is, can be spoofed.

393
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:57,720
And because these calls travel

394
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,410
through five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10

395
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:04,561
up to 12 or so providers
before they reach your phone

396
00:18:04,561 --> 00:18:07,393
it's actually not so simple in practice.

397
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,709
Before spoofing if you know the
call, if you know the number

398
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:14,480
the caller ID number is accurate,

399
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,900
you can figure out which
provider is assigned that number

400
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,280
go to that provider and say,

401
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,120
hey who's your customer
making these illegal calls?

402
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:26,159
But you can't do that if
the caller ID is inaccurate

403
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,020
it's meaningless information.

404
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,990
So that's where Traceback comes in,

405
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:33,990
it overcomes that we take,
we take that inaccurate

406
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:37,960
fake caller ID, and we can
maybe go to that first provider.

407
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:42,960
You know, so my Kansas over
some data and, and there's a

408
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,870
it's a Sprint customer who
gets that illegal robocall.

409
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:49,729
Well, now T-Mobile
customer no longer Sprint

410
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:51,490
who gets that illegal robocall.

411
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:54,925
And our system sends an
automated message to T-Mobile

412
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:57,919
and says, hey, which provider
did you get that from?

413
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,970
And that provider then
gets that same automated

414
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:02,800
message that says, where
did you get that from?

415
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,173
And we keep going until
we find the source.

416
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:10,790
We end up finding out who
the provider that actually

417
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:12,840
had the customer had
the direct relationship

418
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,320
with the customer, the illegal bad actor,

419
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,860
making the illegal call here.

420
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:20,600
We find out which
providers let their calls

421
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,100
in the United States.

422
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,350
And we have hundreds

423
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:27,300
of domestic and foreign
providers cooperating

424
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,780
and participating in
this process right now.

425
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,670
And just to give some sense

426
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,927
of what this process has meant is

427
00:19:33,927 --> 00:19:38,927
before we conducted trace back
through, through our process

428
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:41,750
through what we call the
Industry Traceback Group

429
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:45,400
it would take law enforcement
two to three months

430
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,470
to figure out this information

431
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:49,080
because what they'd have to do is go

432
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,876
to that first provider,
T-Mobile in my example,

433
00:19:51,876 --> 00:19:54,910
and give T-Mobile
subpoenas say, hey, which

434
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:56,530
where did you get this call from?

435
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:58,870
Then they have to create and sign off

436
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:01,350
and generate a next subpoena
for the next provider.

437
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:02,709
And just keep going

438
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:05,970
on one single call to find
out where that came from.

439
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:10,190
We're now doing that in 24 hours

440
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:12,950
48 hours or so 24 to 48 hours.

441
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:17,950
So huge change and in the
process and something that

442
00:20:19,956 --> 00:20:23,280
you know, working very
closely with our partners

443
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,520
in law enforcement, they
are very appreciative

444
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,933
of the efficiency that
we've been able to gain.

445
00:20:31,228 --> 00:20:34,630
So Traceback is a very important tool.

446
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:38,679
Given the current ecosystem
for law enforcement

447
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,750
it's a very important tool
to develop information

448
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,470
about who are making these calls,

449
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:45,531
who are the providers that are helping,

450
00:20:45,531 --> 00:20:50,260
enabling the calls and
help give information

451
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:52,660
that enforcers can use
to bring enforcement

452
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:56,273
against providers and the
callers making these calls.

453
00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:01,680
But it's not really a tool
of, it's not a wiretap.

454
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:04,930
It's not a tool that is surreptitious.

455
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,868
It it's a lot louder than that.

456
00:21:06,868 --> 00:21:10,300
I like to call it much closer

457
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:14,320
to showing up at your front
door, with the lights, the FBI

458
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,429
with the lights on and

459
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:19,350
with the jackets on and
saying, hey, we're here now.

460
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:24,350
And the reason that I say this
is we are sending a notice

461
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:27,770
to the provider and this
provider may be in on it,

462
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:29,790
you know, an overseas
provider that may know

463
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,110
they're taking illegal traffic

464
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:33,080
and not care because
they make money on it.

465
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:36,590
It could be a provider
that turns a blind eye

466
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:38,169
because they make money on it

467
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:40,150
or a provider that doesn't know better

468
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:43,610
and has a customer that
is abusing their network

469
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:45,820
and we're going to them and we're saying,

470
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:49,889
hey, there's illegal calls
coming through your network.

471
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:52,120
What are you doing about it?

472
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:56,647
So it's a really much more loud

473
00:21:57,930 --> 00:22:01,060
than typical forensics tool, but

474
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:04,590
we've actually seen that as a
benefit because increasingly

475
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:09,530
as our role in the ecosystem
has grown those providers,

476
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:12,610
the foreign providers that
have no regulatory obligation

477
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:15,139
or expectation to comply with us are

478
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,810
and they're coming back and reporting back

479
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:18,129
to us that they've blocked

480
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:20,283
that customer they've turned them off,

481
00:22:20,283 --> 00:22:23,080
that they are no longer
doing business with them.

482
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:26,550
So it's been very effective
as a suppression tool as well.

483
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:29,443
And that's somewhere we think
it will continue to grow.

484
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:34,553
So I've talked some
about what is Traceback

485
00:22:34,554 --> 00:22:37,850
but I have not yet talked
about what is the Industry

486
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:41,250
Traceback Group, our group
that is running tracebacks.

487
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:43,470
So the Industry Traceback
Group was started

488
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:45,510
several years ago by US Telecom,

489
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:49,660
the broadband association
I am, as I mentioned before

490
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:53,690
a Vice-President at US
Telecom, US Telecom is a

491
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:57,600
nonprofit trade association
that represents the interests

492
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,649
of the traditional
broadband wireline industry.

493
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:04,847
Think some of those
traditional wireline providers

494
00:23:04,847 --> 00:23:08,230
Verizon, AT&T, Century Link now Lumen

495
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:12,320
and many of smaller local
and regional ones as well.

496
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,590
So US Telecom stood up
this process in order

497
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:17,699
to solve this problem.

498
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,040
How do we find out where
these calls are coming from?

499
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,909
And several of our members work

500
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:24,810
we're working together on that

501
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:28,520
but the Industry Traceback
Group is actually much broader

502
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,770
than just US Telecom.

503
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:34,300
We also have several
members who are supporting

504
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,070
and sustaining our effort, who are

505
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:38,379
from the cable industry
that are wireless only

506
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,940
and several other stakeholders

507
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:42,760
throughout the whole ecosystem
major transit providers

508
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,100
that are not members of US Telecom.

509
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,639
So it's a pretty broad cross industry

510
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,030
cross communications industry effort.

511
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:53,710
And as I said before, these are just

512
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:58,710
our members who are part of
really helping our effort.

513
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,300
We get hundreds more that cooperate

514
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,043
with us on a daily basis.

515
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:06,520
The Industry Traceback Group is designated

516
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,650
by the Federal Communications Commission

517
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:12,340
as the congressionally
mandated Traceback consortium.

518
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:15,449
This came out of a pretty
significant loss in the

519
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:19,220
robocall space at the end of
2019, called the Tracestack.

520
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,950
They created a structure,

521
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:24,050
they actually have one
trace back private industry

522
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:25,560
Traceback consortium.

523
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:29,000
The Industry Traceback
Group is that consortium

524
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,417
and we partner very closely
with the FCC, the DOJ

525
00:24:33,417 --> 00:24:36,199
the FTC social security administration

526
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,353
and virtually every state
AIG on the trace backs

527
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,590
we're running on helping support

528
00:24:46,009 --> 00:24:49,715
their efforts to stop robocalls
and really developing a lot

529
00:24:49,715 --> 00:24:54,550
of information that they can
then use to bring enforcement.

530
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:57,530
The other thing that's
changed earlier this month,

531
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:00,030
on May six,

532
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:03,270
the new rule went into effect
that it's actually going to

533
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:06,560
be a legal requirement to
cooperate with Traceback.

534
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:11,560
So we, before that, we had
pretty significant cooperation

535
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,179
you know, at home and abroad

536
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:16,030
but it's actually gonna
be even more important

537
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:17,670
for providers that are subject

538
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:19,720
to the FCCS jurisdiction to cooperate

539
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:22,963
because they will have
repercussions if they don't.

540
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:27,629
So just wanna talk a little bit

541
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:31,070
about the impact of
Traceback to, and Mike played

542
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:33,840
a couple samples before
of the type of calls

543
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,909
that were tracing back on a daily basis.

544
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:39,317
So just focusing in a
little bit on COVID-19

545
00:25:39,317 --> 00:25:43,900
as Mike talked about
anytime you have a situation

546
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,450
such as a global pandemic

547
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:48,180
that a fraudster sees as an opportunity

548
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,290
they're going to try to
take advantage of it,

549
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:52,530
and sure enough, there were scores

550
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:56,833
of different types of COVID-19
illegal robocall campaigns.

551
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:02,110
We, in the early part of
the pandemic, we jumped

552
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:07,110
into action and we ended up
doing over 300 tracebacks.

553
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:09,920
So that's representative
of hundreds of thousands

554
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:14,920
to millions and millions of
calls in 35 different campaigns.

555
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:18,716
These campaigns range from pure fraud

556
00:26:18,716 --> 00:26:22,229
where such as the one
that Mike played before,

557
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:24,820
to others that may not be pure fraud

558
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:28,860
but are manipulative marketing
where they will either

559
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,480
you know, they'll sell a real product.

560
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,220
So they're actually trying
to sell something real

561
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:39,470
but they're doing so through
deceptive means, using COVID-19

562
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:44,470
as an excuse to sell some sort
of not great student loans

563
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:48,140
induction financial product,
or even trading on a

564
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:53,083
brand's name in permissively
to sell their own products.

565
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:56,070
The information we were able to generate

566
00:26:56,070 --> 00:27:01,070
in those tracebacks, supported
FCC and FTC warning letters

567
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,370
to five voice gateway providers.

568
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:06,689
The gateway providers
are the first provider

569
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:09,430
that lets that call into the United States

570
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:11,810
and warn those that they
had to shut off the flow

571
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:16,139
of that illegal traffic or
risks that all of their traffic,

572
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:20,400
legal and illegal will be
blocked, basically telling them

573
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,780
that the FCC will give a
green light to get them

574
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:25,623
out of the market, put out
of the US market entirely.

575
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:29,830
It all the FCC and FTC
also sent a warning letter

576
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:32,129
to one of the void providers
that had been originally

577
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:34,423
in that traffic with the similar warning.

578
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:38,440
And this had built on
FTC efforts on before

579
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,743
sending warnings to
another seven providers.

580
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:45,290
So that approach, that sort of

581
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:47,470
cease and desist approach
is something that the

582
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:52,180
current FCC is very focused
on and very actively done.

583
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:55,590
They've sent out several in recent weeks

584
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:58,100
and I anticipate that they'll
continue to send those

585
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:00,570
out so that I think that
will continue to be an active

586
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:04,200
area where enforcers will be warning

587
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,650
some of the providers to do more,

588
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:08,600
to stop the illegal traffic

589
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,485
or a risk that all
their traffic is blocked

590
00:28:11,485 --> 00:28:14,197
by their downstream partners.

591
00:28:14,198 --> 00:28:16,950
The other campaign I wanted to touch on

592
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:21,110
is what we call the stay
safe, stay home campaign.

593
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:23,320
Some of you might've received this call

594
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:26,518
or heard about in the news, it

595
00:28:26,518 --> 00:28:30,650
the content of the call
was this is a test call.

596
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:33,351
It's time to stay safe, stay home.

597
00:28:33,351 --> 00:28:36,970
It was very active around the election,

598
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:39,010
so that's where it generated a lot of buzz

599
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:40,570
because I think there was an assumption,

600
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:42,159
it was voter suppression,

601
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:46,964
it did continue pretty
actively after the election,

602
00:28:46,964 --> 00:28:51,919
but we ended up running
170 over 170 tracebacks

603
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:56,160
from October to February on this campaign

604
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:00,370
identifying over 50 providers
that either originated

605
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:03,250
or we believe originated
because they cooperate with us.

606
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:07,230
And we knew they were a
new provider to us as well

607
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:11,916
as 24 companies and
individuals often alias, but,

608
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:14,060
you know, getting information about them

609
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:17,280
including an email address,
often the IP address

610
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:20,600
they're using other information about

611
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:23,270
the actors making these calls.

612
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:25,220
And we did notice some trends where some

613
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:27,470
of that information overlapped with

614
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:31,949
some of the same contact
information we had

615
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:35,690
about individuals making
other pure fraudulent calls.

616
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,630
So that was interesting
that there does seem to

617
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:41,530
be some connection
between those responsible

618
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:44,080
for the stay safe stay home campaign

619
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,750
for which there was no clear
and obvious purpose to some

620
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:52,540
of the more pure fraud, pure
fraud campaigns that we traced.

621
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:55,399
So that that's been
somewhere that, you know,

622
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,290
got a lot of interest.

623
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:57,909
And we did what we can

624
00:29:57,910 --> 00:30:01,705
and that campaign has since trickled down.

625
00:30:01,705 --> 00:30:06,000
The other area where we're
looking very closely at now

626
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,220
and I think will increasingly do

627
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:12,230
is working directly with
companies and others

628
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:16,400
about tracing the cause
that they're experiencing.

629
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,060
Both as Mike mentioned that, you know,

630
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:23,159
a lot of calls in the
brand's name and those calls

631
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:27,450
if on a beta can lead to
calls into customer centers

632
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:29,930
complaining about on
threats of litigation,

633
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:31,700
customers being defrauded.

634
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:34,190
So we've been working increasingly

635
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:36,090
with companies on those calls.

636
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:37,860
We've also been working increasingly

637
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:42,860
with companies on the social
engineering calls, where

638
00:30:43,753 --> 00:30:46,270
they aren't high volume robocall campaigns

639
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:49,810
they're more targeted,
but they are seeking

640
00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:53,644
to defraud customers
seeking to get into systems.

641
00:30:53,644 --> 00:30:56,410
That's somewhere we think we're
gonna keep growing and have

642
00:30:56,410 --> 00:31:00,457
found that Traceback is a
very useful tool to figure out

643
00:31:00,457 --> 00:31:01,970
where these are coming from

644
00:31:04,396 --> 00:31:05,649
both to develop information

645
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:09,510
for private litigation or
public, you know, referrals

646
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:12,129
to enforcement agencies
to bring enforcement,

647
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:17,130
but also to to try to stop
them, because as we've evolved

648
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:21,258
as we've become more
known in the ecosystem,

649
00:31:21,258 --> 00:31:24,840
we have moved from an area
where a lot of providers would

650
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:28,080
either ignore us or say,
we blocked the number

651
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,419
to where they're really
coming back in response

652
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:34,090
to the traceback and saying,
we blocked that customer,

653
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:36,360
we're not doing business
with them anymore.

654
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:39,929
And, you know, yes, that bad
actor caller can then jump

655
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:43,250
onto another provider and
start making their calls again.

656
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:45,370
But we're sending
signals, we're onto them.

657
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:46,879
We're staying on to them.

658
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,840
And that we're effectively making the cost

659
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,260
of doing business, doing their
illegal fraud much higher

660
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:54,760
and decreasing their ROI

661
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,560
because they have to
keep shifting providers.

662
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,659
So that's somewhere we're
really excited about.

663
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:59,830
We think we're gonna keep growing.

664
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:02,413
We think are impacting,
continue to keep growing.

665
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:05,240
- So now what?

666
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:10,150
So Josh did a great job outlining
how a traceback is kinda

667
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:13,240
like a flashlight that you shine
in the dark in the backyard

668
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:16,370
and all of the mice start
skirting because you've arrived.

669
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:20,719
And what you're doing is
visible and being known.

670
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:25,133
So if you've got the
wherewithal in an organization,

671
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:28,990
what would be helpful is, you know,

672
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:31,120
Josh and I are both overwhelmed

673
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,129
with the thousands and thousands

674
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:37,560
of bad actors out there
placing bulk calls.

675
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:41,320
You know, whether it's
impersonating the IRS, the SSA,

676
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,840
your local utility company.

677
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,800
What we don't do is we don't
typically go down to the weeds

678
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:50,950
and verify that every brand
that the impersonators

679
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:54,687
you know, behaving at them or going away.

680
00:32:54,687 --> 00:32:56,760
So what can be done is

681
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:00,470
if you're working at a fortune
500 consumer facing company,

682
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:02,430
you probably already
have some intelligence on

683
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:05,840
if your company's brand
has calls out there

684
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,970
you'll get a call
inbound, your call center.

685
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:10,730
The customer will
complain about, you know,

686
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:14,580
being bulk spammed for
weeks, the capability exists.

687
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:15,787
We can take a lot of those calls,

688
00:33:15,787 --> 00:33:17,330
we can take tens of thousands

689
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:18,470
of those that have been sampled

690
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:21,500
by human sensor network
and trace hundreds of those

691
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,274
and figure out all the
origination points where

692
00:33:23,274 --> 00:33:25,370
those calls are coming from.

693
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:28,580
So it's a good takeaway to
take a look at your brand,

694
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,899
and now that you know, this is possible

695
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:33,670
if you do have evidence of
this happening in your brand,

696
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:36,713
work to mitigate those calls.

697
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:41,090
What we recommend is in
the next three months

698
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:45,220
these calls exist because
they're super successful, right?

699
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:47,280
They're like typical marketing calls.

700
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,310
They've got like a 1% hit rate

701
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:50,889
every hundred people they call

702
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:53,180
they got a live lead that
will engage with them

703
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:56,010
possibly buy whatever's being offered

704
00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:58,320
some shady non-existent product.

705
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,820
They'll part with enough information

706
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:01,710
that their identity gets
stolen or their credit card

707
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:03,980
or banking account
information gets stolen.

708
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:07,020
So, because these calls
are growing in volume,

709
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:09,820
it's a testament to their success.

710
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:12,047
So if you know somebody who
you think in fact, everybody

711
00:34:12,047 --> 00:34:14,696
and there's a lot of
free solutions out there

712
00:34:14,696 --> 00:34:17,920
to install a device
level protection that can

713
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,850
recognize these calls
and prevent, you know,

714
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:24,900
those typically elderly people,
most at risk of engaging

715
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:27,010
with the social engineering
practices and, you know,

716
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:30,505
email is a free solution and
there's several out there

717
00:34:30,505 --> 00:34:32,433
if you just do an internet search.

718
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:37,800
Also for the three months,
I mentioned this earlier,

719
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,760
you know, see if the
illegal calls are being made

720
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,800
in your brand's name,
you know, YouMail we meet

721
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,330
in a website called directory.YouMail.com,

722
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:46,163
you can go to it,

723
00:34:46,163 --> 00:34:47,550
you can just search for your brand's name,

724
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:49,230
and if we have reports

725
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:51,429
of calls where consumers
believe those are fraud

726
00:34:51,429 --> 00:34:54,339
you can find those on that website.

727
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:57,380
And then the goal would be in six months,

728
00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:00,470
there's a plan in place
to monitor those calls.

729
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:02,993
So what we've Josh and I have found,

730
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:05,680
it's when you ignore these calls

731
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,279
that the bad guys will
kind of start turning

732
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:11,000
up the water and placing more of those.

733
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,600
So they'll have an idea, hey,
let's impersonate Acme Inc,

734
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,799
and start calling
Americans and telling them,

735
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,680
hey unless you engage with us, you know,

736
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,593
Acme Inc will cancel your service.

737
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:22,740
They're usually very timid, right?

738
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,609
They'll start making a
thousand calls a day,

739
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:28,120
5,000 calls a day, and
they'll find success.

740
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,210
And then will start stuffing
up people, human beings

741
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:31,870
for you to connect to at their call center

742
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:36,870
in Pakistan or India,
or the Ukraine, Mexico.

743
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:38,690
So they'll start turning up the volume

744
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:41,940
and they'll go from 5,000
to 10,000 to 50,000.

745
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:45,120
They'll decide that in
order to help protect

746
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:47,529
their thriving business,
they'll need two or three

747
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:49,380
entry points into America for these calls.

748
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,790
That way, if they get caught on one

749
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:52,670
they've got the other two to fall back on

750
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:53,860
'cause now they've got 20 guys

751
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,360
in the call center on payroll.

752
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:59,420
So as they get more comfortable
living in your backyard

753
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:01,580
in the dark, they're
gonna keep multiplying

754
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:02,690
and getting worse and worse.

755
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:05,410
And we've seen this in
many different brands

756
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:07,040
and many different campaigns over time

757
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,313
whether it's a commercial brand
or it's a government agency.

758
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,330
So your best bet is to
be on top of it, right?

759
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:16,410
When they start to emerge,
you know, a thousand, 5000

760
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:20,190
10,000 calls a day, don't
let them get comfortable.

761
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:23,193
Don't let them warm up to 50,000, 500,000

762
00:36:23,193 --> 00:36:25,890
a million calls per day, get on them.

763
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:28,480
And the best way to get on
them is to take that data

764
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,320
trace those calls that carry that content.

765
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:34,300
And like Josh said, they
arrived like the FBI

766
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,900
with the lights on and any carriers

767
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:38,410
who were enabling it
cooperate pretty quickly

768
00:36:38,410 --> 00:36:40,859
whether that was optional
or now mandated by law.

769
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,113
That's it.
