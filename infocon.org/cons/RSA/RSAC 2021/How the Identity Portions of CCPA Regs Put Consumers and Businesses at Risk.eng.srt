1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:02,210
- Well, hello everybody

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:04,233
and welcome to this next
RSA Conference session

3
00:00:04,233 --> 00:00:06,160
on how the identity portions

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,807
of California CCPA regulations

5
00:00:07,807 --> 00:00:10,300
put consumers and businesses at risk.

6
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,040
Also known as "You are
probably not Rob Base"

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,349
for reasons that shall become
apparent in just a moment.

8
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,183
My name is Jeremy Grant.

9
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:18,740
I'm part of the cyber security

10
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:20,474
and privacy practice at Venable.

11
00:00:20,475 --> 00:00:22,750
We're a law firm based
out of Washington, DC

12
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,700
though I'm not a lawyer,
that's a story or another day.

13
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,700
But I do want to talk about a new law,

14
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,368
the California Consumer Privacy Act,

15
00:00:29,368 --> 00:00:31,840
and some of the impacts it's gonna have

16
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,810
on the security of
consumers and businesses.

17
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:38,024
For years there's been a
great cybersecurity meme

18
00:00:38,024 --> 00:00:39,360
that's been floating around the internet

19
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,664
basically mocking the way we
do remote identity verification

20
00:00:42,664 --> 00:00:44,920
focused on the first
four lines of this song.

21
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,770
Do you wanna walk right now?

22
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:47,603
Yes, I do.

23
00:00:47,603 --> 00:00:49,570
Did you come to get down?

24
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:50,403
I always do.

25
00:00:50,403 --> 00:00:52,339
Are you internationally known?

26
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:53,358
Trick question, no.

27
00:00:53,358 --> 00:00:55,650
Are you known to rock a microphone?

28
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:56,740
Yes.

29
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:57,590
If you answer all four

30
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:00,830
of those questions, well it
proves you must Rob Base.

31
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:04,160
Now, is this a great way to do
remote identity verification

32
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,143
in 2021?

33
00:01:05,143 --> 00:01:06,710
It's a great meme to make fun

34
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:07,970
of the way we have been doing it.

35
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:11,770
Well, the state of
California seems to think so.

36
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:14,683
We'll be talking about
how that is and why today.

37
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,740
So let's start with the CCPA.

38
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:20,339
It's the California Consumer Privacy Act.

39
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,730
Was passed basically
written in a week or so

40
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:25,710
back in 2018 more or less

41
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,000
to head off a ballot initiative

42
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,693
that was heading for
the ballot in November

43
00:01:28,693 --> 00:01:31,860
and the California state
legislature basically made a deal

44
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,891
with the person driving
the ballot initiative.

45
00:01:33,891 --> 00:01:35,640
If they could pass a law

46
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,300
then the ballot initiative
would be pulled back.

47
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,240
And what the law does

48
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,070
is establishes a baseline
of new privacy rights

49
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:43,800
for California consumers.

50
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,149
But the enacting regulations

51
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,907
are left to the California
attorney general to craft.

52
00:01:46,907 --> 00:01:50,642
And you can see a link here
to some of the provisions

53
00:01:50,642 --> 00:01:53,250
that I'm actually discussing today.

54
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,200
Now there is more.

55
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,347
So the CCPA and now there's also the CPRA,

56
00:01:58,347 --> 00:02:01,640
the California Privacy Rights Act or CPRA

57
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,680
passed by a ballot
initiative last November

58
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,759
'cause it turned out the guy

59
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:06,920
who put the ballot initiative on

60
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,410
and then they pulled it
back when CCPA was passed

61
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:10,243
and decided no,

62
00:02:10,243 --> 00:02:12,320
we ought to have a ballot
initiative after all.

63
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,942
So that actually passed last November

64
00:02:13,943 --> 00:02:16,415
and it substantially amends the CCPA

65
00:02:16,415 --> 00:02:17,829
but it's not yet in effect.

66
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:20,120
Not till January, 2023.

67
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,600
So what we're gonna be talking about today

68
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,430
is how both of these laws

69
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,960
essentially create a bunch
of new rights for consumers,

70
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,225
but also might create some problems

71
00:02:27,225 --> 00:02:30,150
in terms of the way when the
regulations are implemented.

72
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,260
So some core new rights.

73
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,093
Let's talk about it.

74
00:02:32,093 --> 00:02:33,429
First, the CCPA says

75
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:35,101
that you've had the
right to access or know

76
00:02:35,101 --> 00:02:38,120
what personal information
is collected or used

77
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,620
or shared or sold by a company

78
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:42,420
who might've come in contact
with you or your data

79
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,221
for some reason.

80
00:02:44,222 --> 00:02:46,190
Second you have the right to ask

81
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:49,146
that these businesses delete
your personal information

82
00:02:49,146 --> 00:02:51,769
as well as any of their service providers.

83
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:53,770
So by and large, these are good things.

84
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:54,603
I'll say as somebody

85
00:02:54,603 --> 00:02:56,920
who's been a privacy
advocate for a long time,

86
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,989
who worries about where my data is going

87
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:00,580
and who can get access to it

88
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,074
and the lack of control I have,

89
00:03:02,074 --> 00:03:03,818
this idea to give consumers

90
00:03:03,818 --> 00:03:05,850
frankly more control over their data

91
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:08,329
and how they can actually decide

92
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:11,090
who gets to do what with
it is a really good thing.

93
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:12,300
But to deliver it securely

94
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,040
you also I need to know
who's making the request.

95
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,299
And that requires robust
identity proofing capabilities

96
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,290
as well as authentication.

97
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:23,049
And the issue is if you don't
have good identity tools

98
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:24,800
well, you're opening up an attack vector

99
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,680
for cyber criminals

100
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,019
who might look to take advantage
of these new provisions

101
00:03:29,019 --> 00:03:31,726
in order to steal your
personal information.

102
00:03:31,726 --> 00:03:34,700
So we've already seen the impact of this

103
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,289
thanks to a 2019 BlackHat paper

104
00:03:37,289 --> 00:03:38,821
that was published by two researchers,

105
00:03:38,821 --> 00:03:43,660
James Pavur and Casey Knerr
called GDPArrrrrrrrghh!

106
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:44,493
Which was been basically looking

107
00:03:44,493 --> 00:03:47,680
at what happened in Europe or
what you could do in Europe

108
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,500
after Europe's privacy
law, GDPR was passed.

109
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,405
So in this case, James,

110
00:03:52,405 --> 00:03:54,450
who at least at the time was dating Casey,

111
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:55,609
I don't know if they're still together,

112
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,610
though I hope they are
and they're very happy.

113
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:59,460
James posed as his girlfriend

114
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:03,080
and submitted 150 different
requests for her information

115
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,610
to companies across Europe

116
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:07,420
basically saying, I'm
Casey, but he wasn't,

117
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,880
he was pretending to be her,
with her consent, of course,

118
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,950
please give me my data

119
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,190
as you're expected to do under GDPR.

120
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:15,140
And the results were pretty amazing

121
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:18,200
which was that 40% of European companies

122
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,500
either were happy to give
her information to him

123
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,922
without any identity
verification whatsoever

124
00:04:24,922 --> 00:04:27,680
or did such a weak form
of identity verification

125
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,060
as to basically be trivial,

126
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,429
anybody would have cut through it.

127
00:04:31,429 --> 00:04:33,679
This sort of exposed that

128
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,710
in looking to do something
to help consumers

129
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:36,779
give them the ability to request

130
00:04:36,779 --> 00:04:38,780
that their information be shared with them

131
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,359
even request it be deleted,

132
00:04:40,359 --> 00:04:42,460
if the companies that are implementing it

133
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:45,099
aren't doing any meaningful
identity verification,

134
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:48,530
it's opening up a new
attack vector for attackers

135
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:51,119
who might look to leverage
this to steal this data.

136
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,380
So armed with the study

137
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,100
'cause it came out as California's AG

138
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,425
was actually working on
crafting its regulations

139
00:04:57,425 --> 00:04:59,440
for the CCPA,

140
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,120
what did California do?

141
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,742
Well, they said for passwords,

142
00:05:02,742 --> 00:05:05,600
look, if you got a password
in place, that's good.

143
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,686
If a business maintains a
password protected account

144
00:05:07,686 --> 00:05:08,519
with the consumer

145
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:11,123
or the business may simply
verify the consumer's identity

146
00:05:11,123 --> 00:05:13,760
through the existing
authentication practices.

147
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,697
If you've got the password
to prove you're you

148
00:05:15,697 --> 00:05:17,696
those that are not
that's another question,

149
00:05:17,696 --> 00:05:19,100
but that's all you need to do.

150
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:22,070
And if you don't have a
password with somebody,

151
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:24,770
well then you got to do something else

152
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:26,729
to try and figure out who they really are.

153
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:30,120
And here is where the argue
Rob Base test really comes in.

154
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,802
So as we'll talk about today,

155
00:05:31,802 --> 00:05:36,470
this test is actually
more robust in strength

156
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,350
than what California's put in place

157
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:40,620
in that this has four questions,

158
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:41,540
whereas California

159
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:44,120
only requires you to
validate three pieces of data

160
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,040
in order to figure out

161
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,430
whether somebody is the Rob Base

162
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,240
who they claimed to be or not.

163
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,980
So let's dive into this a little bit more.

164
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,970
First, I wanna dig into the
password side of things.

165
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:54,890
So section 999.324,

166
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:56,640
for those of you who wanna track sections

167
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,550
and are following along

168
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:00,470
with your copy of the CCPA regs at home,

169
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:03,140
verification for password
protected accounts.

170
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,030
Pretty straightforward.

171
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,880
If a business maintains a
password protected account

172
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,480
with the consumer,

173
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,490
the business might verify,

174
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:10,776
may verify the consumer's identity

175
00:06:10,776 --> 00:06:13,200
through their existing
authentication practices,

176
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,033
provided the business

177
00:06:14,033 --> 00:06:16,180
follows the requirements
in another section

178
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,490
that isn't that important
for this purpose.

179
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:19,323
But it also says

180
00:06:19,323 --> 00:06:21,049
that if you wanna delete
or disclose the data

181
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:22,954
they have to enter their
name password again.

182
00:06:22,954 --> 00:06:25,040
So passwords, right?

183
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,210
This is the RSA conference.

184
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:27,414
I think most people in this audience

185
00:06:27,415 --> 00:06:28,496
know a thing or two

186
00:06:28,496 --> 00:06:30,880
about how secure passwords are these days

187
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,801
and can track the billions and billions

188
00:06:32,801 --> 00:06:34,890
of compromised passwords

189
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:37,120
that have been documented by sites

190
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,353
like Have I Been Pwned.

191
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,810
If we're using passwords
here as the threshold,

192
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:43,140
as the gate you have to clear

193
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,736
in order to request your
personal information,

194
00:06:45,737 --> 00:06:48,470
what could possibly go wrong?

195
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:50,340
Well, the implications of this language

196
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,659
are actually pretty interesting

197
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:54,160
in that what it does is it
says a compromised password

198
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,530
is now more valuable.

199
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:58,280
Because today if I had got the passwords

200
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,172
for one of your accounts

201
00:06:59,173 --> 00:07:02,040
I can get access to the account itself.

202
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,490
But I can't necessarily get access

203
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:04,880
to all of the core data about you

204
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,380
that's tied to the account.

205
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,570
And that's a big difference

206
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:09,250
in that the things that a consumer can do

207
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,387
through account access

208
00:07:10,387 --> 00:07:13,190
versus the data that might sit behind it

209
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:14,770
might be two different things.

210
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:16,240
Well, thanks to the CCPA regs

211
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,420
a password now gets you
not only account access

212
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:20,767
but also all of the
underlying data underneath.

213
00:07:20,767 --> 00:07:23,040
Now, of course, a lot of
this could be mitigated

214
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,474
if there was some guidance in there

215
00:07:24,474 --> 00:07:26,032
to not just use passwords

216
00:07:26,032 --> 00:07:29,159
but somehow use
multi-factor authentication.

217
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,342
But a reference to MFA in this

218
00:07:30,342 --> 00:07:34,330
is unfortunately nowhere to be found.

219
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:36,025
Now to California's credit,

220
00:07:36,025 --> 00:07:40,219
what they did do in
the regulations is say,

221
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,550
look, you're a business.

222
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:42,950
You might think something's fishy.

223
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,330
So if you're suspecting

224
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,443
that there is fraudulent
or malicious activity

225
00:07:46,444 --> 00:07:48,820
on or from the password protected account,

226
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,260
well the business shall not comply

227
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,694
with the consumers' requests.

228
00:07:51,694 --> 00:07:53,487
And I was excited to see this

229
00:07:53,487 --> 00:07:56,360
and that one of the best
tools we're seeing these days

230
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,110
in the space to try and block attacks

231
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:01,450
that are trying to leverage
compromised passwords,

232
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:03,760
be it credential stuffing,
password spray attacks,

233
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,990
phishing attacks

234
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:06,850
is if you smell something's wrong,

235
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:09,810
if you're looking at a
bunch of data that suggests

236
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:12,450
maybe this person isn't
what they claim to be,

237
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,283
you can block it.

238
00:08:13,283 --> 00:08:14,116
And there's a whole bunch

239
00:08:14,116 --> 00:08:16,130
of different security
behavior analytics tools

240
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:17,332
that are out there today

241
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:21,100
that a lot of companies and
others are using for this.

242
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,267
But what do these security
analytics tools require?

243
00:08:23,267 --> 00:08:24,683
Well, data?

244
00:08:24,683 --> 00:08:27,820
So this is where things
get a little kooky.

245
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:31,690
So CCPA lets you request that
company's delete your data.

246
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:32,650
They were modeling this

247
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:35,789
after language that was
in the European law, GDPR.

248
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:38,880
But GDPR says you can't delete all data.

249
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,610
It has a specific exception
in recitals 47 and 49

250
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:43,830
for preventing fraud

251
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:46,650
and ensuring networking
and information security.

252
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:51,600
Now CCPA and CPRA tried
to do something like this

253
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,400
in section 198.105

254
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,459
but they left things a little
open in another section,

255
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:02,460
17.98.120, which discusses
a consumer's right

256
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:04,530
to opt out of the sale or sharing

257
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:06,044
of their personal information.

258
00:09:06,044 --> 00:09:08,829
But that opt out doesn't
create any exception

259
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:10,830
for security and fraud prevention.

260
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,990
Well, what's the practical impact of that?

261
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,980
A lot of different
behavioral analytics tools

262
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,440
and security analytics
tools that are out there

263
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,200
are going to look at not
just how you're acting

264
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,510
at a single site,

265
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:24,960
but rather aggregating information

266
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,793
about say how,

267
00:09:25,793 --> 00:09:28,620
let's say I'm logging
in with my smartphone,

268
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,920
how's this device being used

269
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,439
to conduct commerce at
dozens of different sites?

270
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,750
And if there's signals that show

271
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,570
that suddenly it's fallen out of my hands

272
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:37,823
and it might be being used for fraud

273
00:09:37,823 --> 00:09:40,590
you're able to essentially
provide some data

274
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:42,491
to anybody who's leveraging that service.

275
00:09:42,491 --> 00:09:43,355
Maybe though, you wanna apply

276
00:09:43,355 --> 00:09:45,430
some additional security controls

277
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:47,835
if somebody is trying to log
in from one of those devices.

278
00:09:47,836 --> 00:09:50,770
Microsoft has famously
talked at other conferences

279
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:51,634
about how they're blocking,

280
00:09:51,634 --> 00:09:54,960
I think roughly 300
million attacks each day

281
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,760
that are focused on compromising passwords

282
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,340
by leveraging new
security analytics tools.

283
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:02,130
So because there's no provision

284
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:05,130
that says that you can't
essentially tell somebody no

285
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:06,770
if they don't want their data to be shared

286
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:08,640
even if for security purposes,

287
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,972
what we're now seeing is
some companies and attorneys

288
00:10:10,972 --> 00:10:12,057
believe that consumers

289
00:10:12,057 --> 00:10:14,020
or for that the matter a fraudster

290
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,930
who might be posing as a consumer

291
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:18,020
could actually come to a company and say,

292
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:20,230
I don't want my data to be used

293
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:22,090
for security and fraud prevention,

294
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:23,688
which creates a bit of a pickle

295
00:10:23,688 --> 00:10:25,710
for companies that are using these tools.

296
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:27,320
What's the impact to your organization

297
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,289
if one in every 50 California consumers

298
00:10:29,289 --> 00:10:31,069
comes to you with a request saying,

299
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:33,990
I basically want you to stop
using security analytics tools

300
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:35,544
to protect logins transactions.

301
00:10:35,544 --> 00:10:39,160
So looking at authentication in summary.

302
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:42,040
Anyone with a password alone
can get access to your data.

303
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,449
Compromised passwords
are now more valuable

304
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:45,850
because they give you access

305
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:46,710
not just to the account,

306
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:48,930
but to the data that's in the account.

307
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:52,189
No requirement of or even mention of MFA.

308
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:54,370
And they say you should use
security analytics tools

309
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:55,832
to sniff out fraudulent logins.

310
00:10:55,832 --> 00:10:58,930
But a consumer or a
fraudster posing as them,

311
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:00,670
say by stealing their password

312
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,949
might be able to demand
your stop using them.

313
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:04,840
So I'll say while the bear
on the California flag

314
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,500
looks very fierce

315
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,362
and I don't know if I'd
wanna mess with him,

316
00:11:08,362 --> 00:11:10,270
if I was a Californian

317
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,390
I might be feeling a little bit more

318
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:12,410
like this bear instead,

319
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:13,242
looking at this

320
00:11:13,243 --> 00:11:15,780
and wondering about the
security of my data.

321
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:18,140
And mind you, this is
just about authentication.

322
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,310
We haven't even gotten yet

323
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:21,520
to the identity verification provisions.

324
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,810
So let's dive into that a little bit next.

325
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:27,329
So section 999.325.

326
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:29,620
Verification for non account holders.

327
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:30,510
Basically says, look,

328
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:32,710
if you don't have a
password protected account

329
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:33,543
with the business,

330
00:11:33,543 --> 00:11:35,437
well the business still needs
to figure out who you are

331
00:11:35,437 --> 00:11:37,606
because it's important that
they give you your data.

332
00:11:37,606 --> 00:11:40,990
So they say, well, if you're
just trying to get categories

333
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:42,678
of personal information about you

334
00:11:42,678 --> 00:11:44,500
we just wanna validate who you are

335
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,420
to a reasonable degree of certainty,

336
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,740
which they say will include matching

337
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:51,060
at least two data points

338
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,260
provided by the consumer

339
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,450
to match data provided by the business.

340
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:55,960
But California then said,

341
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,863
hey, we know some of these requests

342
00:11:57,863 --> 00:11:59,357
really might involve

343
00:11:59,357 --> 00:12:02,098
specific pieces of personal information

344
00:12:02,099 --> 00:12:05,370
and there we're gonna put
a higher bar in place.

345
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:07,730
We're gonna say, a reasonably
high degree of certainty

346
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:09,609
might include matching at least not two

347
00:12:09,609 --> 00:12:12,380
but three pieces of personal information

348
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:15,000
with information that's
unfiled with the business.

349
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,990
Which basically means

350
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:19,410
that that is still one factor less secure

351
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:21,660
than the are you Rob Base example

352
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,540
which has four questions

353
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,990
and well, at least still
doesn't offer much security

354
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:26,823
based on what we're seeing

355
00:12:26,823 --> 00:12:29,130
with knowledge based systems these days.

356
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:30,640
So as you might imagine

357
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,770
hackers and cyber criminals
are looking at all of this

358
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:34,900
and thinking, this is pretty interesting.

359
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,521
This might be worth dancing about.

360
00:12:36,521 --> 00:12:39,910
But wait there's more
because they then go on

361
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:42,671
to talk about illustrative
examples in the regulations

362
00:12:42,672 --> 00:12:44,910
to try and give businesses
a little bit more guidance

363
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:46,480
in terms of how they might implement this.

364
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,830
So they say, for example,

365
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:51,220
if somebody doesn't
have a password with you

366
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,460
but a business maintains
personal information

367
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:54,401
about your account,

368
00:12:54,401 --> 00:12:56,910
let's say a retailer has
a record of purchases

369
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,350
made by a consumer.

370
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:59,554
If you can just ask the consumer,

371
00:12:59,554 --> 00:13:03,030
hey, what are three items you
recently purchased from me?

372
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:05,833
Well, then that would be
considered identity verification.

373
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:07,980
Which as some of you might've figured out,

374
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,587
'cause this is the RSA
Conference after all,

375
00:13:09,587 --> 00:13:12,130
and some of you know a
thing or two about security,

376
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:14,480
this basically means if I hack your email

377
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,400
I can then go look at
what you ordered online

378
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,480
'cause the retailer sent me an email

379
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,530
and then I can go to the retailer
and tell you what I bought

380
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:23,384
and then get your data.

381
00:13:23,384 --> 00:13:27,210
Now look, maybe this isn't
gonna be a total disaster.

382
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:29,090
There might be ways this
could be implemented

383
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:29,960
by some companies

384
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,090
that might not lead to every Californian

385
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:34,680
having their data just pillaged.

386
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,969
But it does beg the question

387
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:38,170
which is why is the
California attorney general

388
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:40,300
getting into the business
of setting standards

389
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,949
for authentication and
identity verification?

390
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:44,240
Is this an area where the AG

391
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,910
has some special expertise?

392
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:48,410
Is identity like auto emissions

393
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,520
where California wanted to set a high bar

394
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,640
compared to the rest of
the country years ago

395
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,680
for authentication and ID verification

396
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,680
and everybody else would follow?

397
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,760
And one of the challenges

398
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,280
is that all of these regulations

399
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,675
will basically be codified into law,

400
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:04,255
and they're not really easily updated

401
00:14:04,255 --> 00:14:08,030
even as attack vectors continue to change

402
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:11,290
and the technology we use
to protect accounts changes.

403
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:13,563
Now, if only the government
somehow had a resource,

404
00:14:13,563 --> 00:14:14,970
perhaps at the federal level

405
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:16,810
that was tasked with creating

406
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:18,619
and regularly updating standards

407
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,550
for digital identity and authentication

408
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:23,490
that the States could just
reference these experts

409
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:25,760
instead of creating their own standards.

410
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,322
Oh, wait, NIST does that.

411
00:14:27,322 --> 00:14:30,802
But this is not what's been done here.

412
00:14:30,802 --> 00:14:34,567
So I want to just give
a couple more points on,

413
00:14:34,567 --> 00:14:37,230
I talked before, told you once about CCPA

414
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:38,360
and then how it was amended

415
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,130
by the California Privacy Rights Act

416
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,140
and it'll be in effect in 2023.

417
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,400
There's a couple items of note

418
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,577
in terms of how it changes the CCPA.

419
00:14:46,577 --> 00:14:49,203
So first they're trying.

420
00:14:49,203 --> 00:14:53,470
They basically redid section 1798.105,

421
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:55,760
coming up with a security exception

422
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,140
of consumer's right to
delete personal information

423
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,080
that said any data you've got

424
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,500
to help ensure security and integrity

425
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,550
to the extent the use of the
consumer's personal information

426
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:08,520
is reasonably necessary and
proportionate for those purposes

427
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,909
well, you don't have to delete it.

428
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,540
Now setting aside, I
mentioned, I'm not a lawyer

429
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,730
but I work in a law firm.

430
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:15,760
Getting an attorney to
agree on what's necessary

431
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,090
and proportionate and the
ambiguity that puts in place.

432
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:19,923
Setting that aside

433
00:15:19,923 --> 00:15:22,110
even with this modified language

434
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:23,666
it doesn't address the
issues I talked about

435
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:27,621
a few slides back in section 1798.120

436
00:15:27,621 --> 00:15:28,788
that would allow a consumer

437
00:15:28,788 --> 00:15:31,208
to ask that their data not be shared,

438
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:32,870
even if it's only being used

439
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:34,700
for ensuring security and integrity.

440
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,480
So this is the whole opt-out issue before

441
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,150
with regards to the use of
security analytics tools.

442
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,913
This is an issue that isn't fixed.

443
00:15:40,913 --> 00:15:43,110
Now, the new law also comes up

444
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,340
with the concept of what they call

445
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:46,220
verifiable consumer requests.

446
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:48,350
Essentially, these requests are coming in

447
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:49,814
to see your data, to delete it.

448
00:15:49,814 --> 00:15:51,939
How do you determine that it triggers

449
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:54,290
what's considered a
verifiable consumer request?

450
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:55,122
And they say,

451
00:15:55,123 --> 00:15:56,774
well, that'll be pursuant to regulations

452
00:15:56,774 --> 00:15:58,570
adopted by the attorney general

453
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:00,550
pursuant to paragraph
seven of subdivision A

454
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:04,000
of section 1798.185.

455
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,340
So what does that actually say?

456
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,300
Well, if you go to it,

457
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,099
it basically is new direction
to the attorney general

458
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,340
to do what the attorney
general just finished,

459
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,910
which is to come up with regulations

460
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:15,146
to try and figure out how
a business could determine

461
00:16:15,146 --> 00:16:16,997
for requests for information

462
00:16:16,997 --> 00:16:19,880
from somebody who has a
verifiable consumer request,

463
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,640
including password protected accounts,

464
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,890
as well as what to do if
you don't have a password.

465
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:26,730
So basically what the AG just finalized.

466
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:28,246
Now in theory

467
00:16:28,246 --> 00:16:30,189
is this a chance for a do-over?

468
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,500
My read of it is

469
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,870
given that it basically points
to what's been done already,

470
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:35,780
I don't know that that's going to happen.

471
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:37,110
But I think if there's one takeaway

472
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:39,420
that I'd like everybody
to come away with today,

473
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,560
in addition to understanding

474
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,068
some of the risks that CCPA

475
00:16:42,068 --> 00:16:44,380
while well-meaning is now introducing

476
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:48,160
into the way companies are gonna
have to handle information,

477
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,730
is that there might be
a chance for a do-over

478
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:51,130
between now and 2023.

479
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:54,570
And it'd be good to let core
stakeholders in California

480
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:55,430
understand the need

481
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:57,313
to tighten some of these
things up a little bit

482
00:16:57,313 --> 00:16:59,380
to better protect information.

483
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:02,187
So with that, I'm happy to take questions.
