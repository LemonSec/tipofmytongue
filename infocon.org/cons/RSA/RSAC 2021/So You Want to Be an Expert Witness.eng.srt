1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,640
- Hello everyone, I'm Hoyt Kesterson.

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:07,170
I'm here today talking about
being an expert witness

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:10,600
and joining me is my co
speaker Lauren Topelsohn,

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:11,883
who's a real lawyer.

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,690
So let's get into this, I'm
not a lawyer, obviously.

6
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:18,960
So, I'm a technical folk.

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,900
People who have seen me at
this conference for a long time

8
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,540
know that I'm not a lawyer.

9
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:25,689
So what's this bit
about an expert witness?

10
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:29,090
I have a very favorite movie,
it's called "My Cousin Vinny."

11
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:31,730
And I like it so much
because it shows exactly

12
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:33,650
what an expert witness does.

13
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:37,000
And I'm not the only
person who thinks that,

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,250
because this film is actually
shown by college professors

15
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,710
at real law schools,
real good law schools,

16
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,290
as an excellent example of
how an expert witness is used

17
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:50,120
and brought into a court case.

18
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,780
So if you've never seen "My Cousin Vinny,"

19
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:55,737
it's also a very great movie,
the lady sitting to your left

20
00:00:55,737 --> 00:00:57,880
won an academy award for it and-

21
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,886
- Not me. (chuckles)

22
00:00:59,886 --> 00:01:00,719
- To the left,

23
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,510
left of the picture.
(Lauren chuckles)

24
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,820
Anyway, so what happened?

25
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:10,542
Well in March, 2019, Arizona signed a law

26
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:14,880
called the Dealer Management System law,

27
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,339
which basically mandated that
a particular sector, industry,

28
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:22,410
an industry that actually
services automobile dealers,

29
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:24,470
had to give access to their product

30
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:27,913
by offering an open API, okay.

31
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,940
Many people have argued
that these companies,

32
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:33,220
there are only really two big ones,

33
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,950
they buy everybody else,
have almost monopoly on it.

34
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:37,730
And the car dealers are never very happy

35
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,370
because even though
they put their data in,

36
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:41,730
they really can't get to
it the way they wanted to.

37
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:44,320
And so several states
have been considering

38
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,149
all kinds of different actions

39
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,770
but Arizona took this different approach,

40
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:50,770
said, "Let's mandate an open API."

41
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:53,610
Well, those two companies took umbrage

42
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:57,429
and they actually said, "We're suing you.

43
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:59,280
We're suing the State of Arizona."

44
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,937
And interestingly enough,
I became an expert witness.

45
00:02:01,937 --> 00:02:05,360
And so on June 3rd in 2020,

46
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,210
I had the unusual experience
of being in a witness stand.

47
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:09,810
I've been in one of those before,

48
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:11,930
but it's the first time I've
ever been on a witness stand

49
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:15,030
wearing a mask, so that
was pretty interesting.

50
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:18,190
Now I've done this four or five times,

51
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:20,070
six times throughout my career,

52
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:22,380
this is not things I go looking for,

53
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,577
but a lot of people ask me, okay,

54
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:27,040
"Well, how did you get this gig?"

55
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,093
And in reality it started
with a phone call.

56
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:33,890
A long time ago, I was sitting at my desk

57
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:37,630
and out of the blue this
phone rang, I answered it

58
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:40,656
and it was this attorney and he said,

59
00:02:40,657 --> 00:02:44,760
"What do you think about a
patent on a directory service

60
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,649
to store X.509 public key certificates?"

61
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:50,850
And I went, well, that's interesting.

62
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:53,810
I led a group that published
the international standard

63
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:56,620
about that, of course is why he called me.

64
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:01,620
And he basically said, "I
hoped that you would say that,

65
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,959
would you be willing
to tell a court that?"

66
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,140
And so that was the very first time

67
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:08,540
I ever got into this entire issue

68
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:11,410
of preparing to be an expert witness.

69
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:14,400
Now interestingly enough, I did

70
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,020
a lot of the first stages of it

71
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:20,730
worked on writing a
document so forth that said,

72
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:23,489
this is why this should never be a patent.

73
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:25,490
And in fact, that's what finally happened,

74
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:28,860
the people withdrew the patent,

75
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,980
but I didn't really get to court,

76
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,000
and you'll find that out
as an expert witness.

77
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,310
So a lot of times you do things
and lawyers rather settle.

78
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,940
They don't wanna go to court, right?

79
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:43,109
And so if you've write a
compelling enough story

80
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:44,530
or do a compelling enough story,

81
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:48,120
or are add enough compelling
facts to an argument,

82
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,350
you may find that you're
not gonna go to court.

83
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:53,260
But I have actually been
to court several times too.

84
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:56,370
Typically when the bucks are big, okay?

85
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:00,550
So, what exactly is the
different kinds of witnesses?

86
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:02,910
And I'm gonna tell you from my level,

87
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,799
which is not a lawyer, right?

88
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,990
So the fact witness, hey,
it's an obvious name.

89
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:10,630
They basically testify to facts

90
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:13,799
that are based on their
direct observation of events.

91
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,329
In other words, they
were involved with them.

92
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:20,229
They did them, they saw, or
they were standing right there

93
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:21,723
and they heard something, right?

94
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,800
It can't be second degree,

95
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,100
it can't say, "Bill
told me this happened,"

96
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,800
because you've heard this term
that's called hearsay, right?

97
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,810
So fact witnesses are exactly,
they're serving the fact,

98
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:35,220
that's why they're easy to remember.

99
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,020
Sometimes in legal documents

100
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,919
you were referred to as lay,

101
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:44,290
lay witness, L-A-Y, but that's it.

102
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:48,730
An expert witness is not
involved in the case events.

103
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:52,340
This is an important point, not
involved in the case events,

104
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:55,979
because you can be an expert
and be a fact witness.

105
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:59,340
In fact, the mock that's coming
up at the end of the day,

106
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:03,549
the person who would
normally be an expert witness

107
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:07,260
is actually testifying about
the assessment they did.

108
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:11,950
And so, hey, it's not
opinion, it's not explaining,

109
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,990
they're actually explaining
facts about the case.

110
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:16,840
So even though the person is an expert,

111
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,250
they are in fact a fact witness
and that's allowed, okay.

112
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,700
One of the important things about it

113
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,039
is if you're a fact witness

114
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,040
you're not supposed to
be getting paid for it,

115
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,053
so along that line.

116
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,130
The purpose of an expert witness

117
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:33,659
especially as things got more technical,

118
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,450
is they're supposed to be able
to explain technical details

119
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:40,750
to attorneys, the judge and the jury.

120
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,020
That's their major thing,

121
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,080
explaining what in the world is going on.

122
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,710
Well, okay, now that sounds
all very straightforward,

123
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:49,020
how could this get messed up?

124
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,960
Well, it gets messed up over the question

125
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,099
that you might ask yourself,
well, what makes you an expert?

126
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,370
How come you're an expert? (chuckles)

127
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:00,780
And that happened a lot,
particularly in the '70s and '80s,

128
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:03,049
because people would
be dragging experts out

129
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:08,050
from the strangest places,
often under the strangest drugs.

130
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,320
And so effectively, there's
this thing called Daubert,

131
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,513
which I'm not gonna talk about
because I'm not an attorney,

132
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:17,483
Ms. Topelsohn is.

133
00:06:18,914 --> 00:06:20,914
- Hi everyone, thank you for joining us.

134
00:06:22,805 --> 00:06:24,770
So yes, I am an attorney.

135
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:27,650
I don't have an opinion
about that at the moment.

136
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:29,613
I do wanna talk about experts though.

137
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:33,230
I would like to just back up a little bit

138
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:35,410
about what Hoyt said in
terms of what the role

139
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:39,060
of the expert is, because
an expert can be engaged

140
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,750
in a number of different roles.

141
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:42,640
As Hoyt pointed out,

142
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:46,010
a lot of them do not go
to court and testify.

143
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:48,880
So you can, an attorney
may engage an expert

144
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,173
to further educate
themselves on something.

145
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:56,440
But in terms of offering an opinion,

146
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:00,100
which is a matter of why they
would go testify in court

147
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,813
or in a hearing of some sort.

148
00:07:02,838 --> 00:07:06,250
You know the old adage about
everybody has an opinion,

149
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:09,250
sort of like shoulder blades.

150
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:12,440
Well, not everybody can
offer an opinion in court.

151
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:17,440
So the expert's opinion, the
question is, are you an expert?

152
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:18,750
And then the question is,

153
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,100
is the opinion something
that can come into court?

154
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:24,320
And the judge acts as the gatekeeper.

155
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:27,540
So there's jury trials and bench trials.

156
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:30,330
And a bench trial means that the judge,

157
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:33,099
typically in a jury trial,
let's start with the jury trial.

158
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:36,670
Typically the judge will
make conclusions of law

159
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:39,310
and will decide those issues of law.

160
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:42,570
And it's the jury who will
determine issues of fact.

161
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:46,513
And that's the typical
division of labor, so to speak.

162
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:49,980
If you have a bench
trial, there is no jury.

163
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,900
So the judge will do both.

164
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,690
He'll make determinations
on the issues of law

165
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:56,756
and on the issues of fact.

166
00:07:56,756 --> 00:07:58,270
And I mentioned this because the judge

167
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,520
is always the gatekeeper

168
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,940
in terms of what opinions can come in

169
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:06,520
and whether somebody is
qualified as an expert.

170
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,609
So the first thing is,
is someone qualified?

171
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:10,580
And the main question is,

172
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:13,620
and we're really relying on
the federal rules of evidence,

173
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,870
because State law has its
own evidentiary rules.

174
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:19,000
And the federal rules are the ones

175
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,890
that both federal courts apply.

176
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:25,659
Under the federal rules which is Rule 702,

177
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,593
an expert can,

178
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:33,419
an expert opinion is
admissible if the expert

179
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:38,419
has a certain scientific
or specialized knowledge

180
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:42,950
that would assist the trier of fact,

181
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:47,820
which could be the jury or a
judge if it's a bench trial,

182
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,623
to determine an issue of fact.

183
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,370
They're not really supposed
to go to the final conclusion,

184
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:58,320
they're certainly not supposed
to offer an opinion on,

185
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,330
a legal conclusion or the
ultimate determination.

186
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:04,970
And this is where things
get, courts, I'm sorry,

187
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:07,340
parties start to tend to
fight a little bit in court,

188
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:10,070
about whether the expert
opinion is testifying

189
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:12,530
or offering an opinion and
tends to offer an opinion

190
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:14,810
to the ultimate conclusion

191
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:17,209
that the jury is supposed to determine,

192
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:20,300
'cause you don't wanna invade
the province of the jury

193
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,313
or the fact-finder, and that's
where a lot of showdowns go.

194
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,850
And there are these things
called motions in limine,

195
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:29,580
to preclude an expert from testifying.

196
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,870
So that's what we'll get the expert in.

197
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:35,340
The next question is what about
the nature of the opinion?

198
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:38,290
And Hoyt mentioned the Daubert factors

199
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:42,099
and that's based on a
US Supreme court case,

200
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:45,900
called Daubert vs Merrell Dow.

201
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:50,900
And it sets up five main factors
that a court would balance

202
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,719
to determine whether an
opinion should come in.

203
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:00,720
And those factors include
whether the nature of the opinion

204
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:05,300
is something that's scientifically
generally acceptable

205
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,213
in the community.

206
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,780
The next is, is it something
that can be tested?

207
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:13,459
Are you offering an opinion
on a matter that can be tested

208
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,670
and proven over and again, and if so,

209
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:18,270
what's the known error rate,
is there an error rate?

210
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,330
Is it something that's been subject

211
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:22,930
to peer review, publication?

212
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:27,130
Is it repeatable, are
there control standards?

213
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:29,010
So those are the five Daubert factors.

214
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:32,180
And based on that and the
qualifications of the witness,

215
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,670
the judge will determine whether or not

216
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:35,069
the opinion will be allowed.

217
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,340
- Well, it's interesting that
you said that scientific,

218
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:43,890
because is it not true that over the years

219
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:46,240
it's been broadened to be
more than just scientific-

220
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,320
- Yes.
- Business or technical.

221
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,570
So for example, I understood
that you could, for instance,

222
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:57,100
be an expert on real
estate values, for example.

223
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:00,080
- Absolutely, any kind of technical,

224
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,270
sort of a unique knowledge

225
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:05,579
and real estate valuations
are really good one.

226
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:08,260
If somebody is very
familiar with real estate

227
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:11,740
in a certain area, and
whether it's commercial

228
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:14,230
or residential and has been in that area,

229
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:16,150
it's not something that they can study,

230
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:18,120
perhaps it is something they could study

231
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:22,930
immediately for that matter,
but it is something that it,

232
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:26,989
they have a history and
education and they've written,

233
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:29,377
and they have some kind
of higher degree in.

234
00:11:29,377 --> 00:11:31,380
Not always, a higher
degree is not necessary,

235
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,393
but some credentials.

236
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:36,609
- Some credential is nice.

237
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:39,980
The search for a lawyer is interesting.

238
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:42,840
I met Lauren a Long time ago.

239
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:46,390
I met her because I
became her expert witness.

240
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:51,240
I was heading to Florida
Keys for vacation,

241
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,250
and I spent an incredible amount of time.

242
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:57,010
Now, I must admit that
I was sitting in the sun

243
00:11:57,010 --> 00:12:01,113
outside of the little bar that
was used to film Key logo,

244
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:05,860
talking on the phone to Lauren
who was sweating in an office

245
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:08,610
in New Jersey, that for some
reason had no air conditioning.

246
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:11,070
So it was a little bit more enjoyable,

247
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:16,070
but this case is probably
a good-bad case about,

248
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:20,410
hey, how to get an expert really quickly

249
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:24,300
and we're not doing anything
at the normal measured pace

250
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:27,439
that you find in terms of
preparation for a trial.

251
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,470
So, Lauren, so a search for an expert

252
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:34,763
in the case of The Rhino
With No Clothes, head out.

253
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:39,390
- This was an unusual case that,

254
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:42,069
my main, my biggest
mistake was accepting it

255
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:45,353
as the third attorney
who'd been on this case.

256
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:51,310
And I was told that a hard drive had been,

257
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:53,239
they use the term mirror image,

258
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,110
a mirror imaging had been
made of this hard drive.

259
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:59,130
And as it turned out, it hadn't
been, it wasn't a mirror,

260
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:03,230
it wasn't a forensically sound
image of this hard drive.

261
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:07,800
And the case involved a
software product liability issue

262
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,490
with competitors and a potential backdoor

263
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:12,720
that allowed competitors
to get the information,

264
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,190
it's accounting software for,

265
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:17,633
specifically for the pornography industry.

266
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,053
So that's why The Rhino Had No Clothes.

267
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,950
And it wasn't easy to find an expert.

268
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:26,210
First, I had to find one
in very short notice,

269
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:29,003
because once we had engaged in some,

270
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,060
I had come to some
agreement with my adversary

271
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:36,650
about a protocol to
look at this hard drive.

272
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:39,880
The initial step was open
it up and see what's on it,

273
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,930
since nobody had any idea what was on it.

274
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:48,240
He found out that it wasn't
what it was purported

275
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:53,240
to have contained, so they
yelled spoliation, that I hadn't,

276
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:56,840
or my clients hadn't preserved
relevant data or documents

277
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,140
or information that's,
I won't get into that,

278
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,593
'cause that was really
the punchline of the case.

279
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:07,120
And the judge said, when the
attorneys were both arguing

280
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,380
about what had been asked for
and what had been preserved

281
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:11,720
and what are the efforts had been made,

282
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,240
the judge literally said, it sounds like

283
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,370
a bunch of attorneys
talking about technology

284
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:18,440
that they know nothing about.

285
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,430
I want you and your experts
in my courtroom in 10 days

286
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:24,900
to testify to what this is.

287
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,579
Well, so my experts, I
didn't have an expert,

288
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,460
I didn't make that image,

289
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:33,780
I hadn't retained the party
who had made the image.

290
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:37,699
I had inherited this hot
potato and I needed somebody.

291
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:41,740
And the first expert I found
who had very good credentials

292
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:46,740
when he found out it was,
he had another job working,

293
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:49,160
he had a part-time job working for a,

294
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,900
as it turned out, the archdiocese,

295
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,640
and when he heard the nature of the case,

296
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,510
he felt like he couldn't take it.

297
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:59,760
So yes Hoyt came on second
on my, as the second person,

298
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,710
but he wasn't my second choice,

299
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:04,350
he just happened to be the
second person. (chuckles)

300
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:06,600
- Yeah, and when I was asked if I was,

301
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,210
what did I think of it being porno?

302
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:10,520
I said, well, personally,
if it weren't for porno

303
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,020
I didn't think we'd have VCR.

304
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,730
So I didn't really have a problem with it.

305
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:17,950
And besides which, the case, as you said,

306
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:20,210
was an accounting case,
a programming case,

307
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,790
it really didn't matter
what industry it was in.

308
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:25,069
Although we did meet some
pretty unusual people

309
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:26,460
associated with it.

310
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:29,690
- You should see some of the
exhibits. (laughs loudly)

311
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:32,120
- So that was kind of fun.

312
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:35,993
So, that's what happens
like when you're in a panic,

313
00:15:35,993 --> 00:15:38,510
but if you're not in a panic, Lauren,

314
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:42,110
what do you want in an expert witness?

315
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:44,883
- Well, this is not all about your resume,

316
00:15:44,883 --> 00:15:47,430
a good resume alone isn't going to do it.

317
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:49,924
You really want somebody who is,

318
00:15:49,924 --> 00:15:51,069
you like want somebody who's likable.

319
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:53,160
You want somebody who the
jury is going to like,

320
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,240
the judge is going to like,

321
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,470
somebody you're gonna have confidence in,

322
00:15:56,470 --> 00:16:00,390
somebody who inspires trust,
you want somebody who,

323
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:07,520
basically, again the resume
is helpful and necessary

324
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,490
to qualify the expert, but that
alone is not going to do it.

325
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:16,160
You want somebody that you
probably wanna spend time with.

326
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,010
And it's unusual about
what you don't want.

327
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:22,680
It's almost easier to figure
out what you don't want.

328
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,500
- What don't you want? (chuckles)

329
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,050
- Well, you don't want somebody

330
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:29,609
who's going to condescend to anyone.

331
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:31,920
You don't want somebody who's verbose.

332
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,469
You don't want somebody who's unclear,

333
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:40,633
who can't get across a
thought in a clear way.

334
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:45,220
Lawyers in law school who
wanna become trial lawyers,

335
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,830
tend to take trial classes,
I know I took several.

336
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:50,270
And one of the things that we learned was,

337
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:52,510
you never know what the
jury is going to pick up on

338
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:54,130
when somebody is testifying.

339
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:56,470
And that's particularly true of an expert,

340
00:16:56,470 --> 00:17:01,070
you hold somebody up and want
the jury to accept this person

341
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:04,003
as an expert, now what is
the jury going to focus on?

342
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:09,389
Is it because, is it
the expert's fancy pen?

343
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:11,500
Is it some big ring the expert's wearing?

344
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,300
This is something that
you really want to avoid.

345
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,409
So you want somebody that
the jury is going to like.

346
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:19,630
And no chewing gum, not somebody
who's gonna sit up there

347
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:21,367
and pick their nose,
not something like that.

348
00:17:21,367 --> 00:17:23,550
You really want somebody
who's professional,

349
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:24,849
and comes across that way.

350
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:29,819
- And of course, once you've picked this,

351
00:17:29,819 --> 00:17:31,020
(Lauren laughing loudly)

352
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:34,570
I always remember going back
to the very first attorney

353
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:38,580
that I worked with, and we
worked in his office off and on

354
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:41,210
for awhile, and like I
said, I never got to court,

355
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:43,170
but he said, "You know
what I like about you

356
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:44,790
as an expert witness?"

357
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:46,409
(chuckles) And I said, no, what?

358
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:50,460
He says, "You answer
only the question asked."

359
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:55,460
He talked about sometimes you
get an academic and (chuckles)

360
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:57,890
and the academic's really knowledgeable,

361
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:00,100
and the academic is so used to teaching,

362
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,969
and so used to explaining

363
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:06,970
that when the opposing
counsel would ask a question,

364
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:08,627
the academic might say,

365
00:18:08,627 --> 00:18:10,659
"Well, you're not really
asking the right question,

366
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,850
you really need to ask." (chuckles)

367
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:15,719
In other words, this is not
what you want your expert doing

368
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:20,290
for an opposing counsel,
so it's interesting.

369
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:22,170
Even though you may know a lot of stuff,

370
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:24,253
even though you might truly be an expert,

371
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,950
you're really in two realms,

372
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:29,360
you might have someone who
presents themselves really well,

373
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,419
but don't know the topic
that well, that can happen.

374
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,370
But the other is just as likely,

375
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:36,169
I know the topic really well

376
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:38,400
but I don't stand a
chance of explaining it,

377
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,010
or if I do, people hate me
when I'm done, so. (chuckles)

378
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:45,858
- Hoyt, even in our case,
you caught a mistake

379
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:48,960
on the part of the other
expert, which was important,

380
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,190
and something that we
could use on cross, and,

381
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:54,140
I'm sorry, why don't you speak to that.

382
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:58,290
- It's just that this
was a classic example

383
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:01,700
of a very young man who was hired

384
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,590
to essentially do all the data extraction,

385
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:05,889
work for the data extraction
so forth and so on,

386
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:08,760
but he didn't really have
a detailed understanding

387
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,970
of the operating system,
and in this particular case,

388
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:14,170
that operating system was Linux, right?

389
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:16,657
And so this was kind of a Windows guy.

390
00:19:16,657 --> 00:19:19,629
And as a result, when
you get into arguments

391
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:22,140
about what should or should not be,

392
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:25,010
or what is or is not
in an operating system,

393
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:27,990
your breadth of knowledge
should be somewhat more than,

394
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:29,730
hey, I've been running on Windows

395
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:31,040
for the five years of the life

396
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,310
I've been working in the industry.

397
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:34,602
So it's that kind of thing.

398
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:39,370
We'll talk about that
when we get to the end.

399
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:41,760
But to me, it's really important that,

400
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,400
you can be really good at your job,

401
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,460
you know a way of doing it.

402
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,920
But in reality, if you're
an expert in your job,

403
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,240
you know pretty much
all the ways of doing it

404
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,930
and when you should do one or the other

405
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:53,600
and that's kind of the big difference.

406
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,473
So there are some legal terms, right,

407
00:19:56,473 --> 00:19:59,490
that I learned, okay? (chuckles)

408
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:02,830
Because I had no idea,
even watching "Perry Mason"

409
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:05,210
I don't think I ever
heard one of these terms.

410
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:07,890
And I know the first time
a lawyer ever said to me,

411
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:10,240
spoliation, I said, "Don't
you mean spoliation?"

412
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,081
And he's, "No, it's spoliation."

413
00:20:12,081 --> 00:20:15,053
And so, this was a
learning exercise for me,

414
00:20:15,053 --> 00:20:17,910
that I believe that particularly

415
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:20,170
if you're a technical person, like I am,

416
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:23,210
these are three very
important legal concepts

417
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:24,680
you need to understand.

418
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,893
And Lauren is gonna graciously
explain them to you.

419
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:34,520
- Well, discovery is the
process in a litigation

420
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:39,100
whereby by both sides, sort of
have to exchange information

421
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:42,810
regarding their positions whether
it's an offensive position

422
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:44,500
or a defense and you get to,

423
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,350
there's some mandatory
disclosures that have to be made,

424
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,879
according to the federal rules,

425
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,710
and then there's other
disclosures that you can ask.

426
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:54,370
You can ask interrogatories,
those are questions.

427
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:57,620
You can ask for documents or in this,

428
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:59,449
people refer to documents
sort of generally,

429
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:03,640
but it's documents or data or
an inspection on something.

430
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:06,200
So you'd want to see
what the other side has.

431
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,790
Maybe documents will support their case,

432
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:13,790
but if they have an item
you wanna inspect it,

433
00:21:14,214 --> 00:21:17,810
but we are trying to stick to
technology-based information.

434
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:20,899
So software, you might wanna
have a copy of the software

435
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,853
to try it out, actually.

436
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:31,639
Discovery is intended to
avoid surprise at the end.

437
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,970
So trial is not supposed to be,

438
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:36,627
no I got you kind of experience,

439
00:21:36,627 --> 00:21:38,810
you're supposed to know what the other,

440
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:42,149
little bit about what the
other side's cards are

441
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:43,240
and what your card,

442
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,610
and they're supposed to
know what cards you have.

443
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:50,070
And by the time you get to
trial, it's a battle of the facts

444
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:53,610
and the issues, not matter of surprise.

445
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:56,725
So that's the discovery process

446
00:21:56,725 --> 00:21:58,629
and it involves also depositions

447
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:00,367
which can involve a
deposition of your expert.

448
00:22:00,367 --> 00:22:03,103
You have to disclose that
you've hired an expert.

449
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:07,710
If there's an opinion, if your
expert has, issues an opinion

450
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:09,870
you need to share it with the other side,

451
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:13,310
they get an opportunity
to hire a rebuttal expert.

452
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:15,919
Not that they need to, but it's typical.

453
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:20,440
I actually received an expert
opinion from my adversary,

454
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,930
which I thought was so favorable to me

455
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:25,430
that was the opinion I was gonna rely on,

456
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:27,080
I had no intention of hiring an expert,

457
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,230
I was gonna use theirs.

458
00:22:29,764 --> 00:22:32,020
so it's interesting how an expert opinion

459
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,330
can work out for you that way,

460
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:35,553
but it doesn't happen too often.

461
00:22:37,461 --> 00:22:39,033
So that, sorry, go ahead.

462
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:43,600
- So in discovery, not everything
can be discovered, right?

463
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,770
I mean, because there are
certain communication,

464
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:48,023
certain things which can't be discovered.

465
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,260
- Well, everybody's
supposed to be familiar

466
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:52,030
with the attorney-client privilege.

467
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:54,634
- Well not everyone, that's
why we're talking about it.

468
00:22:54,634 --> 00:22:55,900
(Lauren and Hoyt laughing)

469
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,010
- Most people who've
watched any kind of TV,

470
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:01,000
law and order type show,
probably knows that one.

471
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,670
And that privilege can
extend to the expert

472
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:07,580
if the expert is acting as
an agent of the attorney.

473
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:12,050
So in other words the expert
falls within the same umbrella.

474
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:14,130
It doesn't happen always

475
00:23:14,131 --> 00:23:16,568
and that can be a battleground area.

476
00:23:16,568 --> 00:23:20,600
More regularly, what does
happen is work product privilege

477
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,909
when it relates to an expert

478
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:26,250
because the expert can
present some kind of analysis,

479
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:29,650
perform some kind of study, and as I said,

480
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:33,310
rendered an ultimate opinion
on what the conclusion is,

481
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:37,480
regarding the issues that he
or she has been reviewing,

482
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:40,110
the matter, that he or
she has been reviewing.

483
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:45,110
And it's another
battleground area, whether,

484
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,070
yes, the expert opinion is
something that's discoverable.

485
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:52,760
What about drafts, what about
communications with counsel?

486
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:57,760
What about, that can get very thorny.

487
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:05,270
There are fights about
that, it's not as clear cut.

488
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:08,260
And so you really want your expert

489
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,990
to refrain from putting
anything in writing

490
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:14,160
until you finally have a good sense

491
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,430
of what it's going to say.

492
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:18,650
- Well, it's not exactly as it used to be,

493
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:21,060
because I remember that,

494
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:23,592
I mean, they changed the
federal laws on this one,

495
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:26,720
but not necessarily all the
State laws were kept up.

496
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,100
But I remember when I
first started doing this,

497
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:32,689
that if you had multiple
drafts of your expert's report,

498
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:35,090
those drafts were discoverable.

499
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:38,750
And so we would go to
a great effort where,

500
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:41,950
and this considering back when
I was doing this good stuff,

501
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:44,050
this was sometimes hard to do.

502
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:45,889
I would have exactly one copy,

503
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:47,750
I would not even do backups of it,

504
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,690
which was always a
frightening thing to me,

505
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:51,620
because God help you
if you lost it, right.

506
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:54,449
But if you had a backup,
that's another copy.

507
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:59,290
And the point here is, if
you have multiple copies

508
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:00,567
and they see a difference,
they're gonna say,

509
00:25:00,567 --> 00:25:03,090
"Why did you change
your mind here, right?"

510
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:06,620
And so we'd go to great effort
to have exactly one copy.

511
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:08,429
I would sit there and write a draft

512
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:10,890
and I wouldn't send them the
draft or anything like that,

513
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:12,240
because that would be a copy.

514
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,820
We would somehow get together,
either be a shared screen

515
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,280
or sitting in the same room,

516
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,050
and they would read over my shoulder

517
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:20,610
and make recommendations
and I would make changes.

518
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:23,520
And the law actually changed that

519
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,889
and made that work product privilege.

520
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:28,920
which made life, I mean made
that work product protected,

521
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,690
which has made life easier.

522
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:33,010
But if you guys hang
around in the law track,

523
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:35,560
you're gonna find the mock
trial at the end of this,

524
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,100
at the end of the day,

525
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:40,610
is actually talking about
a big legal (indistinct),

526
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:44,370
over whether or not a forensic
examination by an expert

527
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:46,600
is really a privileged document or not.

528
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,669
And there've been some really
big cases on this lately.

529
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:51,350
And I believe that another panel

530
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:53,090
is talking about this topic also,

531
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:55,590
so it can be really important.

532
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:58,659
Let's go down to the one that
I always used to mispronounce.

533
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:01,363
Let's talk about spoliation,
what is spoliation?

534
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,760
- Well, that is a term that
has really grown in popularity

535
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:11,573
over, I'm trying to remember
the first Zubulake case.

536
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:15,150
I'm referring to a case out
of the Southern district

537
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:16,863
by judge Shira Scheindlin,

538
00:26:19,033 --> 00:26:23,370
and she's sometimes considered
the mother of e-discovery

539
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:26,060
in some sense, or at least
in terms of standards

540
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,820
for spoliation, she was the first one

541
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:31,663
who probably articulated best that,

542
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:37,169
well, spoliation is failure
to preserve evidence

543
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:40,640
that potentially could
be relevant to your case

544
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,923
or the other side's case.

545
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,592
And when does that duty to preserve arise?

546
00:26:47,831 --> 00:26:50,300
And she was the one who
articulated it in terms of,

547
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:54,340
when you have a reasonable
expectation of litigation

548
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,699
that's when the duty kicks in.

549
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,730
So it's not the day that
you get served with summons

550
00:26:57,730 --> 00:27:00,940
and complaint, it's not the
day that the process servers,

551
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,370
ringing your doorbell.

552
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:04,790
It's not the day that
you get a demand letter.

553
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,610
It tends to start before that.

554
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:10,043
If you have a reasonable
expectation, if somebody,

555
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:15,520
if an employee throws up,
if you terminate an employee

556
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,877
and the employee turns
around and says to you,

557
00:27:16,877 --> 00:27:18,557
"I'm going to sue you for
everything you've got,"

558
00:27:18,557 --> 00:27:22,210
that's a reasonable
expectation of litigation,

559
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:24,780
need to start preserving information

560
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:27,180
relating to that employee's
employment with you.

561
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:31,233
So spoliation is the failure to do that.

562
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:35,710
- It could be both either
accidental or purposeful, right?

563
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:39,610
- Yes, the federal rules have been amended

564
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:43,622
to deal with electronic information,

565
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:50,690
but spoliation can also apply
to any kind of evidence.

566
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:55,470
So, I had a case where
it was a biking accident,

567
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:58,960
and the woman who's widowed

568
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,370
was going to have the police
throw out the bicycle,

569
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:04,870
which would have been not
helpful for her case as well

570
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:06,203
if she wanted to prove

571
00:28:06,203 --> 00:28:10,030
that her husband hadn't
had a heart attack,

572
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:13,920
but had been hit by the car.

573
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,440
He had a heart attack
ultimately but she wanted,

574
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,930
her position was it was
caused by the accident,

575
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:21,990
not proceeded the accident.

576
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:24,827
Anyway, so point is that it
can apply to any evidence.

577
00:28:24,827 --> 00:28:27,157
And the federal rules have evidence,

578
00:28:27,157 --> 00:28:30,669
sorry, have rules that govern what happens

579
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:33,660
if you have failed to preserve evidence,

580
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:37,860
particularly digital evidence
or electronic evidence.

581
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:42,860
And if it's not intentional,
but it's prejudicial,

582
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:48,800
the judges empowered to meet out a remedy

583
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,810
that is commensurate with the prejudice

584
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:54,220
to the party who would
have wanted to present

585
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:58,630
that information, well,
it's really the other side.

586
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:00,570
So if I've destroyed my own evidence,

587
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:02,870
I can't now go ahead and say,

588
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:04,600
this is what it would have said,

589
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:08,879
the benefit is to the other
side in that equation,

590
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,530
always in this equation.

591
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:11,649
If it's intentional,

592
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:14,980
if a party is found to have
intentionally destroyed evidence

593
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:16,820
or failed to preserve evidence

594
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:19,375
in an effort to deprive the
other side of that benefit

595
00:29:19,375 --> 00:29:23,660
of that evidence, then
there's a number of sanctions

596
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:26,820
that the courts have
recognized in Common Law

597
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:31,669
and which are now also stated expressly

598
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:33,290
in the federal rules.

599
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:35,220
And those include anything from,

600
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:40,220
the court can instruct the
jury that they should assume

601
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:45,350
that the evidence would
have been beneficial

602
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:50,082
to the other side and
that they should take it.

603
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,139
They should adopt what's
an adverse inference

604
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:58,140
that the evidence that's been
spoliated would have been,

605
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,290
in order to their benefit.

606
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:04,170
It can even go as far as having
a default judgment against,

607
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:06,340
entered against the spoliator

608
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:09,090
or they have a case dismissed
against the spoliator.

609
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:12,203
So those are real extreme
examples, but they do happen.

610
00:30:14,883 --> 00:30:17,200
But you need to be able to
show prejudice no matter what,

611
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,610
that by being deprived
of this information,

612
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:22,639
you've suffered prejudice.

613
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,950
- There are two interesting
technical things here

614
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:26,820
that I think people should consider.

615
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:30,090
A lot of people at this
conference, for example

616
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:33,760
would be responsible for
someone's a data retention,

617
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:38,129
data destruction policy
and as Lauren has said,

618
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:41,500
if you think that you're
going to be hit with a lawsuit

619
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,720
or something along this line,

620
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,330
you need to actually stop this.

621
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:47,840
You need to stop your regularly
scheduled data destruction.

622
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:51,040
And the other interesting
issue is, again, is encryption.

623
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:54,000
So I actually had a case where data

624
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,780
that the plaintiffs wanted to see had been

625
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,139
as part of the regular process,

626
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:01,900
encrypted a long time
ago, when it happened,

627
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:04,270
and guess what they had lost the keys

628
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:06,840
and their key escrow
system had kinda messed up,

629
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,919
was all accidental,

630
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,310
but that's kind of like
what I had to prove.

631
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:12,429
So what do experts do?

632
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:14,200
Let's go to Lauren's first thing,

633
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,250
well, first case she talked about,

634
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:18,400
where the data production
was all messed up.

635
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,660
That was a classic example

636
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:22,350
of someone who thought it was a good idea

637
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:27,199
to take a Linux data dump and
convert it to windows, okay,

638
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,310
to help the lawyers,

639
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:30,260
which of course destroyed
all the metadata.

640
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:33,110
It was an innocent, helpful kind of thing,

641
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:36,459
but it's exactly why
experts should be involved

642
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:38,930
when you're doing data production.

643
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:42,490
They will examine physical
things like bicycles,

644
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:44,973
like bloods and stuff,
everything you see on CSI,

645
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:49,763
you can even find people who
will tear a disk drive down

646
00:31:49,763 --> 00:31:52,689
and use an electron
microscope, monitor on it,

647
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:55,910
recover something, so
they do physical things.

648
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:59,150
They do interesting things
that are very specific

649
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:03,110
to our software industry,
like examine code.

650
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:07,250
It is so easy to move code
from say some program you saw

651
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:08,830
and just put it in your program.

652
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:11,030
Well, sometimes that's not exactly legal

653
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:13,280
because of copyright so forth.

654
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,760
What if you're clever, what
if you change the tags?

655
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,970
What if you do this?

656
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:20,420
Well, then very clever people
like this longtime colleague

657
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:23,220
and friend of mine, they
actually look at patterns

658
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:25,060
and look at stuff and say, okay, well,

659
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:27,560
yeah, but isn't this an interesting way.

660
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:30,060
And programmers are funny, I mean,

661
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:33,240
it's almost like a signature,
sometimes you look at code

662
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,030
and you can actually say who wrote that

663
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:36,460
because of the style of writing,

664
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:39,110
then that becomes very
useful in that case.

665
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:42,469
Then there's the thing I
mentioned, forensic investigation.

666
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:45,320
That's becoming more and
more important nowadays,

667
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:48,530
because we're seeing a lot of things

668
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:50,260
that are happening because villains

669
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,077
are breaking into your system

670
00:32:52,077 --> 00:32:54,510
and it's just not your system crashing

671
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:56,470
because you've written bad code.

672
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:59,120
No, it's because you've written
bad code and that let a guy

673
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,146
into the door and he took everything

674
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:05,210
and made a mess while he left,
and so he'd (indistinct).

675
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:06,540
The interesting thing about computers,

676
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:08,960
well, here's where the body
is, but where was it shot?

677
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,960
Okay, so you have to go back

678
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,330
and actually find a trail
of blood to do that.

679
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:15,050
And that's what forensic investigators do.

680
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:18,450
And as you can imagine, lawyers
are very interested in that

681
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:21,090
because if they find that
you didn't do a good job

682
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:23,010
of securing your system, that's negligence

683
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:25,220
and that really helps in a law case.

684
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,350
And then we get down the really weird ones

685
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:29,610
which is opine on concepts.

686
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:31,500
And the thing that I did
for the state of Arizona

687
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:34,720
was exactly that because
it's all pretty much about,

688
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,450
well, what is an API anyway?

689
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:39,670
And an argument was being
made on the other side

690
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:42,850
that an open API has no
security, which of course it does

691
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:44,540
but that was just kind of the argument.

692
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:48,540
So you end up arguing on concepts.

693
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:50,320
And these are kinds of things

694
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,639
that you might find
yourself doing as an expert.

695
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,073
So you can find a niche
and do what you need to do.

696
00:33:56,970 --> 00:34:00,510
So there'll come a point
where you meet the attorney,

697
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:04,053
you go and you meet Lauren,
okay, Lauren, what happens then?

698
00:34:05,624 --> 00:34:09,380
- Well, we interview, and
as I said, we wanna know,

699
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,840
this is somebody who
the jury is gonna like,

700
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,960
somebody you can spend time with,

701
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:17,592
somebody who knows their
stuff and that's for,

702
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:21,350
and that's in the context of
whether you're hiring an expert

703
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:26,350
to examine something or to
provide an ultimate opinion

704
00:34:26,389 --> 00:34:31,389
of something, and I
think one of the things

705
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:34,489
that Hoyt had actually
asked me to speak on about

706
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:36,402
was nondisclosure agreements.

707
00:34:38,157 --> 00:34:39,980
So the expert opinion, as I said,

708
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:42,380
is something that gets produced,
but there's information

709
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,639
that you're going to provide the expert,

710
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:49,109
that they are going to rely
on informing that opinion.

711
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:50,739
And it doesn't just even have to be

712
00:34:50,739 --> 00:34:52,459
in the context of their opinion.

713
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:57,460
I provided a hard drive to
a forensic analyst recently,

714
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:02,000
because the timekeeping
program that my client used

715
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:07,000
for his employees had corrupted,
that's the short story.

716
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:10,910
We were trying to obtain
whatever we could get off

717
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:15,832
of the hard drive, we
weren't able to go back,

718
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,660
there were six years at issue,

719
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,399
we were able to collect four of them,

720
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,510
which was better than
having no bullets at all,

721
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:26,010
'cause that's what I felt
like I was going to a gunfight

722
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:27,533
with no ammunition.

723
00:35:29,766 --> 00:35:33,080
So the point is that
the hard drive obviously

724
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,390
includes a lot of other information

725
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:39,900
that may not be related the
case and or personal information

726
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:40,960
regarding those employees.

727
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:45,900
So you ask the expert to limit the scope

728
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,210
of what they're reviewing

729
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:49,760
and not to share the
information with anybody else.

730
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,110
Also, you don't want them to
share their negative conclusion

731
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:53,013
if they have one.

732
00:35:54,806 --> 00:35:59,806
So, there was another incident
where I was going to hire

733
00:35:59,806 --> 00:36:04,806
a handwriting expert and I
provided him with multiple copies

734
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:09,440
of examples of this person's signature,

735
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,180
question was whether or
not this person had signed

736
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:16,129
the agreement, which my
client said, had been signed.

737
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:19,090
And my expert did not put
his opinion in writing.

738
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:23,373
He was smart expert, and he
called me up and he said to me,

739
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,420
he didn't say to me, this is important,

740
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:29,770
he didn't say to me that
this is not the signature.

741
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:32,000
He said to me instead,

742
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,773
that I cannot testify that
this is the signature,

743
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:37,970
which means that I could then,

744
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:42,319
I was free to go find another
expert who could testify

745
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,523
that it was a signature.

746
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:48,180
And his opinion was helpful,
frankly the case was settled,

747
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:49,772
in large part because of that.

748
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:55,924
So Hoyt was talking about
non-disclosure agreements.

749
00:36:55,925 --> 00:37:00,925
Those commitments to keep
information confidential

750
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:03,023
continue after your retention.

751
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:07,120
So they often include
requirements that in the event

752
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:11,370
somebody tries to obtain
the expert's opinions

753
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:14,290
or the data that they may have
been provided and still have

754
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:16,960
or their impressions that the expert

755
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,210
will notify the attorney who retained them

756
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:21,600
in advance of disclosing
any of that information,

757
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,250
so that the attorney who did retain them

758
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:25,690
can get involved if necessary

759
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:27,703
to seek some sort of protection.

760
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:33,920
- Okay, now then there's compensation.

761
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,250
I found the interesting thing
about compensation to be,

762
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:40,510
hey, you know how normally
salaries are secret,

763
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:41,710
when you're an expert witness,

764
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:43,680
your compensation is not secret.

765
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,940
And so there are really two
interesting things about it

766
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:48,560
that I learned, number
one, it's not secret.

767
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:52,450
When Lauren talked about how
she had to tell the other party

768
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:55,109
that an expert witness had been obtained,

769
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:58,280
she has to tell them how
much they're paying them.

770
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:01,820
But also when you write a
report, it basically says,

771
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:03,260
hey I'm being charged X,

772
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:05,970
I'm being paid at X dollars an hour,

773
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:08,740
or maybe a fixed amount or something.

774
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:10,609
And the second thing is,

775
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:13,780
your compensation cannot
be based on result.

776
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:14,827
In other words, they can't say,

777
00:38:14,827 --> 00:38:17,170
"Well, you'll get more
money if we win this case,"

778
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:19,190
because that's kinda like saying,

779
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:22,130
well in that particular case,
maybe I can shade it a bit

780
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:23,460
because I'd like to make more money.

781
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:25,590
So, you're not allowed to do that.

782
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:28,740
And of course, Lauren just
covered nondisclosure agreements.

783
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:31,020
So it's very, very important,

784
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:34,190
because you're gonna see all
the sensitive stuff. (chuckles)

785
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:38,520
And then you might, as
the expert, you'll get it,

786
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,810
and you have to protect it too,

787
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:43,090
because we've seen several cases

788
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:45,820
where people have been
attacked by ransomware people,

789
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:48,540
ransomware guys and the
information they found

790
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:49,890
is the sensitive information

791
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:53,103
that belongs to these people's
clients, this is not good.

792
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:56,118
And finally, you end up,

793
00:38:56,118 --> 00:39:00,360
and of course you're retained,
this contract is done.

794
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,250
So what do you do?

795
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:04,240
You're retained, where are you gonna study

796
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,000
all of these documents
that she talked about

797
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,610
coming in discovery.

798
00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:10,470
There's this thing burry 'em in discovery.

799
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:13,120
Sometimes they used to try to do that.

800
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,319
That was a lot easier
to do when it was paper,

801
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,143
a little more difficult
in electronic documents,

802
00:39:17,143 --> 00:39:19,580
because you could use tools to do it.

803
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:23,740
If you're an expert, Wikipedia
and Google are your friend,

804
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:26,439
but I always love that
line start with Wikipedia

805
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:29,003
but never stopped there
and that's important.

806
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:31,940
Okay, because that
shouldn't be your thing.

807
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:34,710
I recommend that
Wikipedia is really great,

808
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:36,720
but not for the article itself,

809
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,120
but most people don't even notice

810
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:40,240
that pretty much at the
end of every Wikipedia

811
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,299
is this bibliography, the documents

812
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:44,770
that the people who wrote
the bibliography referred to.

813
00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:48,070
And that's a good source
to go looking for things.

814
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:50,970
Then you're gonna write an
expert report or declaration.

815
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:53,160
And I was always confused
about this for a long time,

816
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,859
what the difference is.

817
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:57,020
In a declaration, you're
actually putting an opinion,

818
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:59,650
in an expert report, you're
just explaining things,

819
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:02,350
and you never really actually
say what all this leads to.

820
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:06,250
As Lauren says, you're leaving
it to the trier of fact

821
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:07,760
to make a determination.

822
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,860
But sometimes you're asked to
opine then it's a declaration.

823
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:12,920
The other interesting
thing you end up doing

824
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:15,710
is that the opposing expert
will have been deposed

825
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:17,730
or written documents and so forth.

826
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:22,040
And so you're basically, I
always think the word rebut,

827
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:25,200
yes, it's because yes, buts
kind of what you're saying.

828
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:29,073
You basically help the
lawyer come up with arguments

829
00:40:29,073 --> 00:40:32,190
against what the opposing
expert is saying.

830
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:36,280
And deposition, what can
I say about deposition?

831
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:40,560
Deposition is very exciting
because you the expert

832
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,110
are setting there and you
are the target of more eyes

833
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:44,140
than you've ever been used to,

834
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:46,147
you haven't lived until you're
in a room with 12 lawyers

835
00:40:46,147 --> 00:40:49,170
and a video camera and a
court stenographer, right?

836
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:50,780
And they're all looking at you.

837
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:53,890
And the important thing
about deposition is that,

838
00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:56,270
it's all gonna be recorded,
it's all gonna be examined

839
00:40:56,270 --> 00:40:58,160
and whatever you say,
they're gonna turn around

840
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,629
and give it to you in court.

841
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:03,040
So you have to be very
careful when depositions,

842
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,301
what you say in deposition.

843
00:41:05,301 --> 00:41:07,560
And, well the other interesting
things they'll ask you,

844
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:10,299
they will read your report
and they will actually say,

845
00:41:10,299 --> 00:41:13,160
"Have you changed your
mind about your report?

846
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,509
Have you gotten any other information?"

847
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:15,700
And you should make that point now

848
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:18,419
because you don't wanna
actually say something

849
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:21,687
later in court, in testimony, then say,

850
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:23,890
"Well, in deposition you said
something totally different."

851
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:25,990
That's embarrassing for everyone.

852
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:30,479
And of course, it may
actually go to court,

853
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,970
in which case you're gonna testify direct.

854
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:34,720
Direct should never be a surprise

855
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:38,600
because that's your
attorney, okay? (chuckles)

856
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,299
Remember that practice,
practice, practice,

857
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,680
we're gonna talk about it again.

858
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,120
You've done this you know what
you're supposed to be saying.

859
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:48,370
Cross, well this other attorney
is going to actually try

860
00:41:48,370 --> 00:41:51,740
to weaken your arguments and
that's gonna be difficult,

861
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:53,140
that's the entire goal.

862
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:54,930
And sometimes that they
can do this to be helpful.

863
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:57,100
The thing I remember most is I said,

864
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:59,250
I went in for this encryption case,

865
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:00,870
I went and talked to the person

866
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:03,150
who was the systems person at the time.

867
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:04,537
And then the lawyer hopped in and said,

868
00:42:04,537 --> 00:42:06,609
"And he told you what went wrong?"

869
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:08,580
And I said, no, he actually confirmed

870
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:09,970
what I already thought was wrong.

871
00:42:09,970 --> 00:42:12,319
So I had to be very careful
when an opposing counsel

872
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,660
tries to be helpful for
you and give you words.

873
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:19,660
And then also sometimes, you
wanna say yes but on a question

874
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:21,690
when they cross you, but don't.

875
00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:23,760
If it's important your lawyer will note it

876
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,370
and they will redirect, and
they'll ask you the questions

877
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:28,830
that let you answer the right way.

878
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:31,210
And of course, practice,
practice, practice,

879
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:32,993
You tend to do this all the time.

880
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:37,920
So when we come down to what
does an expert really do?

881
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:41,460
Okay, well, Lauren said
it when she talked about,

882
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:44,870
whenever you hire an expert witness,

883
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:47,583
an expert witness has
to be able to explain.

884
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:52,440
If they use terminology,
if they use jargon,

885
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,610
that's great in a
conversation amongst experts

886
00:42:54,610 --> 00:42:56,030
but it's not in a good a conversation

887
00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:57,410
to the jury or the judge.

888
00:42:57,410 --> 00:43:00,580
The judge is gonna be very
educated but not in your area,

889
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:04,090
so you go, and of course
the most important thing

890
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:06,520
which I mentioned, is you tell the truth

891
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:08,150
but you only answer the question.

892
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:10,210
You don't give them more
truth than they've asked for.

893
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:12,240
Right, you let them
work that out themselves

894
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,990
because that's what they got to do.

895
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:18,970
So when you come down to what you must do,

896
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:20,859
this is why I talk about teaching.

897
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:23,860
You must be able to teach
when you write and you speak.

898
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:27,300
Well, how do you do that,
how do you get to that point?

899
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:29,390
You get there because
you just write often,

900
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:31,520
I don't care what you write
or anything else on the line.

901
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:34,520
And then you speak often, you
give as many talks as you can.

902
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:37,920
To get noticed you volunteer.

903
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,040
So for instance, talk at this conference,

904
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:43,529
work at this conferences,
local conferences, right?

905
00:43:43,530 --> 00:43:46,013
And it's good to go
where attorneys go, okay?

906
00:43:46,013 --> 00:43:48,380
- Find us at the bar. (chuckles)

907
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:50,640
- Yes, that can be the bar
after the conference too,

908
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,600
that's really the great thing.

909
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:55,250
And so what do you do?

910
00:43:55,250 --> 00:43:56,700
Well, you join organizations.

911
00:43:56,700 --> 00:44:00,339
I happen to be in the ABA
Information Security Committee,

912
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:02,210
which is really bizarre, I
happen to be co-chair of it,

913
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:03,680
which is even bizarre.

914
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:06,640
And then there's InfraGard,
I've spoken to InfraGard,

915
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,740
it's the only audience I've ever spoken to

916
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:11,009
where half of them were packing weapons

917
00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:12,470
but still you meet a lot of lawyers,

918
00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:15,060
you meet a lot of prosecutors,
you meet a lot lawmen,

919
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:16,690
goes along the line.

920
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:19,310
So as Lauren mentioned,
credentials are good.

921
00:44:19,310 --> 00:44:22,009
It's good to have, okay,
it's great to have a PhD

922
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:23,070
or whatever else on this line,

923
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:25,510
but if you can't talk about
it, if you can't teach it,

924
00:44:25,510 --> 00:44:29,250
so, work on writing and speaking.

925
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:31,000
I work with a lot of technical people,

926
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,010
I see their stuff all the
time and they're smart

927
00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:36,250
but they sure can't write about it.

928
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:37,720
So write a blog, an article

929
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:39,660
or if you're really
adventuresome and I'm not,

930
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:42,990
I'd rather watch "Buffy"
write a book, okay.

931
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:44,609
And then like for this conference,

932
00:44:44,610 --> 00:44:47,110
but it can be local
conference, so start out small,

933
00:44:47,110 --> 00:44:49,220
submit speaking proposals to conferences,

934
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:52,629
volunteer to speak at user meetings, okay.

935
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:54,470
And then here's the most important thing

936
00:44:54,470 --> 00:44:56,350
if you're gonna be good at this,

937
00:44:56,350 --> 00:44:59,420
equanimity, a word I really
like, an adversarial situation,

938
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:01,420
sounds very complicated term,

939
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:05,710
but the opposing counsel
will try to get you nervous,

940
00:45:05,710 --> 00:45:08,100
will try to get you to say the wrong thing

941
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:10,549
and heaven help you if
you get upset or angry,

942
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:14,090
you can't let that happen,
because as they like to say

943
00:45:14,090 --> 00:45:15,970
it's not personal, it's just business.

944
00:45:15,970 --> 00:45:18,439
So where's the best place to learn that?

945
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:22,340
Well, arguments over the
Thanksgiving table with your uncle

946
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:24,110
might work along this line,

947
00:45:24,110 --> 00:45:25,980
but probably the best way to do it,

948
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:28,720
is to find yourself on a panel or a talk,

949
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,529
where not everyone on the panel agrees.

950
00:45:30,530 --> 00:45:32,910
And the second thing is
to take a debate class

951
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:34,850
where you learn to do this kind of stuff.

952
00:45:34,850 --> 00:45:36,890
Okay, so along the line.

953
00:45:36,890 --> 00:45:39,663
- Wait, something just popped
up about joining InfoSec.

954
00:45:40,610 --> 00:45:43,440
You can do that by
going to the ABA website

955
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,943
and for the information security group.

956
00:45:46,890 --> 00:45:51,569
And it'll tell you where the,
there's a slight fee to join,

957
00:45:51,570 --> 00:45:54,250
but it'll have all the information
when they have meetings

958
00:45:54,250 --> 00:45:57,180
and what advantages there
are to joining the group.

959
00:45:57,180 --> 00:45:59,480
It's a great group, it really is.

960
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:01,030
- And the important
thing to remember here,

961
00:46:01,030 --> 00:46:02,850
I mean, I worked with him for a long time,

962
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:03,990
without even realizing,

963
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:06,129
I thought you had to be
a lawyer to join the ABA.

964
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:08,690
I mean, that makes sense,
American Bar Association.

965
00:46:08,690 --> 00:46:10,270
But in reality, they have something

966
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:12,530
called the Associate Membership.

967
00:46:12,530 --> 00:46:14,210
And so the Associate Membership

968
00:46:14,210 --> 00:46:17,930
is in fact for technical people
who for some bizarre reason,

969
00:46:17,930 --> 00:46:20,238
wanna hang around with lawyers, and so.

970
00:46:20,238 --> 00:46:22,676
(Lauren and Hoyt laughing)

971
00:46:22,676 --> 00:46:24,520
- It's the reverse, the
lawyers wanna hang out

972
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:26,558
with the tech people.
- Whatever reason it might be.

973
00:46:26,558 --> 00:46:30,850
And for instance the section that I'm in,

974
00:46:30,850 --> 00:46:33,682
and Lauren's also in, is called,

975
00:46:33,682 --> 00:46:36,569
Lauren you may also be in
trial lawyers, I don't know,

976
00:46:36,570 --> 00:46:37,960
because you do litigation.

977
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:40,880
But there's a section called
Science and Technology.

978
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:44,283
And under Science and Technology,
there's a privacy group.

979
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:46,960
I think Steve Wu is in the audience.

980
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:50,020
There's artificial
intelligence and robotics.

981
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:51,310
There's information security

982
00:46:51,310 --> 00:46:52,940
which is the group in which I'm in

983
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:55,770
where we talk a lot about
just information security

984
00:46:55,770 --> 00:46:57,550
and all the laws that have to do with it.

985
00:46:57,550 --> 00:46:58,890
You got a lot of things
you can join there,

986
00:46:58,890 --> 00:47:01,433
but join as an associate
if you're not a lawyer.

987
00:47:03,323 --> 00:47:05,299
- Somebody asked a question about,

988
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:08,420
somebody who looks like they've testified

989
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:12,060
as an expert witness before
in depositions at least

990
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:15,303
and wants to know how to avoid,
I can't see the whole thing.

991
00:47:16,610 --> 00:47:17,670
How do you manage this?

992
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:19,700
How do you manage your
character assassination

993
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:23,363
that can be used by opposing
counsel to discredit you?

994
00:47:24,554 --> 00:47:26,700
(Lauren and Hoyt laughing)

995
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:29,140
Well, character, if it's
character assassination

996
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:30,160
it shouldn't be going on,

997
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,710
because it's not supposed to be personal.

998
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:34,330
So that shouldn't happen at all,

999
00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:36,529
and the attorney who's defending you

1000
00:47:36,530 --> 00:47:38,810
should make sure that that gets shut down.

1001
00:47:38,810 --> 00:47:42,279
But if you're talking about
times where you may have opined

1002
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:46,070
in a different way, or
in a way that's contrary

1003
00:47:46,070 --> 00:47:48,800
to what you're offering
now, your position is,

1004
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:52,260
I would suggest that this
makes me a well-rounded expert,

1005
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:55,560
because I'm not committed to
one position or the other.

1006
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:58,779
I can see it from both sides,
and therefore, in this case

1007
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:03,780
my opinion that it went left
is particularly credible

1008
00:48:03,890 --> 00:48:06,160
because I can see that
it goes in both ways.

1009
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:10,424
I have testified to going
right in other instances,

1010
00:48:10,424 --> 00:48:11,257
I hope that helps

1011
00:48:11,257 --> 00:48:13,420
- But it makes it tough for you.

1012
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:18,380
I was actually in a case, as
the web and Google got better,

1013
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:22,660
I was actually in a case
where the opposing expert,

1014
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:26,180
the attorneys I was working
for, found an opinion

1015
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:29,480
that was diametrically opposite
what he was saying before,

1016
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:32,210
and that's a lot easier to do
now that everything's online,

1017
00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:33,980
you can find all this good stuff.

1018
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:35,970
And he was kind of really shook up by that

1019
00:48:35,970 --> 00:48:37,495
and he really didn't,

1020
00:48:37,496 --> 00:48:39,680
and no one had really practiced for that,

1021
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:43,524
but it can really hurt your reputation.

1022
00:48:43,525 --> 00:48:48,525
As far as character assassination
goes, I mean, it's the,

1023
00:48:49,650 --> 00:48:51,940
as Lauren said, it's the
responsibility of your attorney

1024
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:54,280
to not let that happen,
it's what's called objection

1025
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:55,500
and all this other good stuff.

1026
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:58,280
But sometimes they do the
weirdest things in the world.

1027
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:03,280
I did a case that had to do
with open pit mining, okay.

1028
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:05,090
I know nothing about mining

1029
00:49:05,090 --> 00:49:07,460
other than the fact that
the holes are awfully big,

1030
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:10,104
but the whole point was
about mining equipment,

1031
00:49:10,104 --> 00:49:13,169
these things whose tires
are 10 times your height,

1032
00:49:13,170 --> 00:49:14,800
so forth along this line.

1033
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,950
And all of these things
are interconnected.

1034
00:49:18,574 --> 00:49:21,560
The computer knows how much
dirt is in this shovel,

1035
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:24,520
and whether some loader can
actually carry it or something.

1036
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:26,840
And so everything's all scheduled,

1037
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:28,230
it's all happening electronically.

1038
00:49:28,230 --> 00:49:30,310
It's very, very fascinating stuff.

1039
00:49:30,310 --> 00:49:32,299
And I was an expert witness

1040
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:34,810
having to do with this technology.

1041
00:49:34,810 --> 00:49:39,810
But opposing counsel just
kept objected to my thing,

1042
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:43,480
my presence, because
he's not a mining expert,

1043
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,150
even though I'm not a miner.

1044
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:47,030
Well, I didn't get bothered by that.

1045
00:49:47,030 --> 00:49:49,097
I mean, it might be, you don't say yes,

1046
00:49:49,097 --> 00:49:52,790
but my council handle that argument,

1047
00:49:52,790 --> 00:49:57,050
but still at the very end, I
still remember he was so funny.

1048
00:49:57,050 --> 00:49:59,930
This guy was an amazing piece of work.

1049
00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:03,839
First thing is that during
deposition, I'll tell the story

1050
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:05,480
'cause of how a deposition works.

1051
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:09,427
During deposition, they made
a terrible mistake and said,

1052
00:50:09,427 --> 00:50:11,240
"Please tell us about your career."

1053
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:13,379
And I said everything
and they said, "Yes."

1054
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:16,190
And two hours later, they
said, "Let's stop now."

1055
00:50:16,190 --> 00:50:18,710
And so, 'cause I've been
doing this for a long time.

1056
00:50:18,710 --> 00:50:20,430
But one of the things they noted

1057
00:50:20,430 --> 00:50:22,520
was when I had actually
stopped programming,

1058
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:24,370
'cause I haven't programmed
for awhile, and he said,

1059
00:50:24,370 --> 00:50:26,710
well, they asked me,

1060
00:50:26,710 --> 00:50:29,217
I could see the other
expert whisper in his ear.

1061
00:50:29,217 --> 00:50:32,160
"Do you write C code?"
and I said, well, no.

1062
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,629
I said, by the time I stopped programming,

1063
00:50:34,630 --> 00:50:36,660
C was just becoming popular.

1064
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:40,062
But let me explain that I chair
an international committee,

1065
00:50:41,203 --> 00:50:42,670
the standard X-509

1066
00:50:42,670 --> 00:50:44,570
that everybody in the
world is implementing.

1067
00:50:44,570 --> 00:50:46,790
And we can get a lot of
questions from people

1068
00:50:46,790 --> 00:50:48,870
about how to do something on the standard.

1069
00:50:48,870 --> 00:50:51,710
And a lot of times these
questions are phrased as code.

1070
00:50:51,710 --> 00:50:56,090
Okay, which is C-code, and I said,

1071
00:50:56,090 --> 00:50:58,530
therefore I can read it even
though I cannot program it.

1072
00:50:58,530 --> 00:51:01,710
So (chuckles) anyway, but I
didn't think too much of it.

1073
00:51:01,710 --> 00:51:06,440
And so at the very end
of the examination of me,

1074
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:09,180
he started writing, he
wrote on a piece of paper,

1075
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:12,480
a C statement, and I remember
I met it under my breath,

1076
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:15,640
oh, a programming test,
and the judge giggled,

1077
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:17,509
you never want the judge

1078
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:19,240
and supporting your expert like that.

1079
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:21,879
And they wrote on a piece
of paper, the C statement.

1080
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:24,040
And then they asked me to explain it.

1081
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:27,550
Well, unfortunately from him,
is that I really did know C.

1082
00:51:27,550 --> 00:51:29,160
And so I really could explain it

1083
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:31,600
and they'd even cheated a little
bit in terms of information

1084
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:35,313
but I kind of guess what it
was and when it was all done,

1085
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:38,787
the people I was working for said,

1086
00:51:38,787 --> 00:51:41,029
"Well, we don't use that C statement.

1087
00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:42,640
We don't use that
particular piece of code."

1088
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:43,879
And I said, well, no.

1089
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:48,880
I said, I assume that they
expected you to coach me

1090
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:52,350
on everything that you
use in terms of their API

1091
00:51:52,350 --> 00:51:54,569
and their calls and so forth.

1092
00:51:54,570 --> 00:51:57,100
You didn't, you haven't, we've
not had that conversation,

1093
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:59,589
but they expected it, so
that's why they did it.

1094
00:51:59,590 --> 00:52:02,560
So, but the whole thing
was, here's a test,

1095
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:04,563
here's a test that's doing that.

1096
00:52:04,563 --> 00:52:09,040
And, his entire purpose, his entire intent

1097
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:11,150
was at the very end of all my testimony

1098
00:52:11,150 --> 00:52:12,660
where I had been really arguing,

1099
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:14,460
that you can look at statements,

1100
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:17,920
you can look at APIs and
figure out what they're doing.

1101
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:19,830
You don't have to know the
(indistinct) behind it.

1102
00:52:19,830 --> 00:52:21,759
The whole point of API is
you don't know the code,

1103
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:23,350
but you know what it's
supposed to be doing,

1104
00:52:23,350 --> 00:52:26,670
that you could actually figure
out what calls were doing.

1105
00:52:26,670 --> 00:52:28,327
And he wanted to destroy that

1106
00:52:28,327 --> 00:52:30,780
and that's how I chose to do it.

1107
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:33,270
And that's what I mean
about the fact that,

1108
00:52:33,270 --> 00:52:38,270
well, see now I don't call
that dirty fighting. (chuckles)

1109
00:52:38,590 --> 00:52:40,870
He didn't say I was lying
or anything like that,

1110
00:52:40,870 --> 00:52:43,660
but he put me to a test
and he put me to a test,

1111
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:45,060
a really, really clever test

1112
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:48,490
which I passed with flying
colors, unfortunately for them.

1113
00:52:48,490 --> 00:52:51,439
But it's just the way attorneys are.

1114
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:56,440
You have to realize the other
side is being paid to win.

1115
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:59,780
Okay, and if winning is to effectively

1116
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:02,210
discredit your testimony,

1117
00:53:02,210 --> 00:53:04,700
it's your testimony they wanna discredit,

1118
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:08,649
not necessarily you, and so
you can't take that personally.

1119
00:53:08,650 --> 00:53:11,070
You just really do the best job you can

1120
00:53:11,070 --> 00:53:14,750
to make sure that what you
say is really the truth,

1121
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:17,877
and therefore really kind
of hard to discredit.

1122
00:53:17,877 --> 00:53:21,223
- I think what you said
Hoyt is worth underscoring,

1123
00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:24,610
because it gives you,

1124
00:53:24,610 --> 00:53:26,730
to the extent that you ended
up working with lawyers

1125
00:53:26,730 --> 00:53:28,600
and the clients directly,

1126
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:30,680
you need to have a sense of this pressure

1127
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:35,470
that they're under, and
litigation is literally war.

1128
00:53:35,470 --> 00:53:39,040
Somebody is going to win and
somebody is going to lose,

1129
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:42,020
and nobody ever wants
to be the one who loses.

1130
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:43,830
It's just a terrible thing.

1131
00:53:43,830 --> 00:53:46,950
So it's bad in a lot of different ways.

1132
00:53:46,950 --> 00:53:50,120
So the expert is, can be really critical

1133
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:52,569
and you need to keep that in mind

1134
00:53:52,570 --> 00:53:53,970
when you deal with the attorney

1135
00:53:53,970 --> 00:53:55,720
and when you deal with the client,

1136
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:58,109
that these people are under
a great deal of stress,

1137
00:53:58,110 --> 00:54:00,330
that it's very nice for
you to show up and help.

1138
00:54:00,330 --> 00:54:04,400
And yes, maybe you're the batter

1139
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,150
that's gonna come in and win the day.

1140
00:54:06,150 --> 00:54:08,673
But they've been living
at this for a long time.

1141
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:12,630
- Yeah, it's like you said, I remember.

1142
00:54:12,630 --> 00:54:14,160
And you talk about spoliation.

1143
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:16,730
The interesting thing
about spoliation of course,

1144
00:54:16,730 --> 00:54:21,160
is that the lawyer themselves
can actually be hit

1145
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:23,540
with penalties by the
judge for spoliation.

1146
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:28,140
So lawyers tend to take
spoliation cases very seriously.

1147
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:32,196
And when I showed up, you
were the opposite of relaxed,

1148
00:54:32,197 --> 00:54:33,800
(Lauren and Hoyt laughing loudly)

1149
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:38,800
because as you said, you were
the third person on this case,

1150
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:41,590
you had nothing to do with
the preparation of evidence.

1151
00:54:41,590 --> 00:54:45,330
And yet, if there's any problem
with evidence production

1152
00:54:45,330 --> 00:54:46,970
and any spoliation thing,

1153
00:54:46,970 --> 00:54:51,520
would have fallen on you and
there's a lot of pressure.

1154
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:52,810
So when you're an expert

1155
00:54:52,810 --> 00:54:56,009
you kind of really have to
recognize this pressure.

1156
00:54:56,010 --> 00:54:58,670
And that's why I keep
using this word equanimity.

1157
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:03,670
If anyone knows me, as met
me, I am quite passionate.

1158
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:06,000
I'm yelling at Lauren all the time,

1159
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,030
over the strangest things, okay.

1160
00:55:08,030 --> 00:55:08,990
But that's just-

1161
00:55:08,990 --> 00:55:10,884
- Exploding (indistinct)

1162
00:55:10,885 --> 00:55:11,820
(Lauren chuckles)
- Exactly,

1163
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:13,040
that's just the way I am,

1164
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:16,509
but I go in an absolute
total different mode

1165
00:55:16,510 --> 00:55:19,670
when I'm in the witness box
or when I'm being deposed.

1166
00:55:19,670 --> 00:55:23,240
My hands don't fidget, I rest my hands,

1167
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:26,279
and I do everything very considerately.

1168
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:29,110
I just make sure I
answer things correctly.

1169
00:55:29,110 --> 00:55:30,600
And the other thing, I wanna,

1170
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,380
I'll tell you one thing I am very bad at,

1171
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:33,850
the lawyer's yell at me,

1172
00:55:33,850 --> 00:55:37,170
is that lawyers would
like to be able to object,

1173
00:55:37,170 --> 00:55:40,990
and sometimes I answer a
question too fast. (chuckles)

1174
00:55:40,990 --> 00:55:42,950
And so they keep telling me

1175
00:55:42,950 --> 00:55:44,520
and you should remember to do the same,

1176
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:46,890
if they asked you a question take a beat,

1177
00:55:46,890 --> 00:55:48,950
beat, beat than answer,

1178
00:55:48,950 --> 00:55:52,620
give your lawyer time
to say, I object, okay?

1179
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:55,400
Don't just do it like me. (chuckles)

1180
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:58,170
I get into this dialogue
with the opposing counsel

1181
00:55:58,170 --> 00:56:00,270
and I'm not worried about it,

1182
00:56:00,270 --> 00:56:03,130
but still the attorney
that I'm working for,

1183
00:56:03,130 --> 00:56:05,310
would really like to get
their objections on record

1184
00:56:05,310 --> 00:56:06,913
and I'm not helping.

1185
00:56:06,913 --> 00:56:07,840
- Well, lemme interject now,

1186
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:10,010
there's a couple more
questions if you don't mind.

1187
00:56:10,010 --> 00:56:10,843
- Yeah.

1188
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:15,710
- For instance, lately, what
areas of technical expertise

1189
00:56:15,710 --> 00:56:18,530
and security are you finding
coming up in your cases,

1190
00:56:18,530 --> 00:56:21,483
such as data security,
networking security, et cetera?

1191
00:56:22,430 --> 00:56:26,319
- It's bizarre for me, because
I do more than just security

1192
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:28,820
'cause obviously I had
a big battle about APIs.

1193
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:30,360
I mean, I actually started in security

1194
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:32,900
because I was interested
in distributed processing,

1195
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:34,528
you have to secure it.

1196
00:56:34,528 --> 00:56:38,060
The two things that I've
gotten involved too with

1197
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:40,590
that really had to do with
security and cryptography,

1198
00:56:40,590 --> 00:56:42,770
one of them I've mentioned, okay,

1199
00:56:42,770 --> 00:56:45,500
which was this entire key escrow thing.

1200
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:47,610
If you're gonna encrypt, you
better be doing key escrow,

1201
00:56:47,610 --> 00:56:49,210
you better be doing it right.

1202
00:56:49,210 --> 00:56:51,470
And another one was a Markman,

1203
00:56:51,470 --> 00:56:53,339
having to do with a patent case.

1204
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:55,870
And it was all on time
stamping and hash chains

1205
00:56:55,870 --> 00:56:58,603
and so forth along those
lines and so done that.

1206
00:57:00,230 --> 00:57:03,967
But other things have just
been based on my knowledge,

1207
00:57:03,967 --> 00:57:06,370
the fact, that I've
actually been in quote,

1208
00:57:06,370 --> 00:57:09,370
information processing
and distributed systems.

1209
00:57:09,370 --> 00:57:12,339
And in fact, even though I did X-509,

1210
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:14,250
I really was an OSI person,

1211
00:57:14,250 --> 00:57:17,930
and so that seven layers
you guys complain about,

1212
00:57:17,930 --> 00:57:21,220
I led the effort on layer
number six, presentation layer.

1213
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:24,259
You can blame ASN.1 on me and,

1214
00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:26,454
we'll actually on an English man,

1215
00:57:26,454 --> 00:57:29,750
- You take one more question?
- One more question, yeah.

1216
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:31,510
- How do you get yourself
visible to attorneys

1217
00:57:31,510 --> 00:57:34,270
as potential expert witnesses
to start the journey?

1218
00:57:34,270 --> 00:57:37,170
I'll start the answer 'cause
Hoyt will probably finish it.

1219
00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:40,470
Frankly, Google is a friend for me.

1220
00:57:40,470 --> 00:57:43,779
I have found expert
witnesses starting that way,

1221
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:45,590
because some of the areas
that I'm looking for

1222
00:57:45,590 --> 00:57:50,590
are really unique, so it may
not be something that they,

1223
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,220
it may be something that,

1224
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:54,279
a position that they formerly held.

1225
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:55,633
I remember looking for,

1226
00:57:56,710 --> 00:58:00,700
or it may be something
that they've published.

1227
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:05,529
Publishing, I'm tending to
stay away from that more

1228
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:09,110
depending on the nature of
the expert I'm looking for.

1229
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:11,380
I'm looking for somebody
with more hands-on

1230
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:12,780
practical experience.

1231
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:16,540
So the nature of the positions
they have held are helpful.

1232
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:18,300
I see Hoyt has a point. (chuckles)

1233
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:20,490
- Well, actually, I'm gonna
tell you we're out of time.

1234
00:58:20,490 --> 00:58:23,759
But anyway, hang with lawyers,
that's the major point,

1235
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:25,160
wherever they are, hang with them,

1236
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:26,879
go to panels, that's the way it works.

1237
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:29,390
And by my clock, we are out of time.

1238
00:58:29,390 --> 00:58:33,569
So let me tell you, I got
the Arizona testimony case,

1239
00:58:33,570 --> 00:58:37,000
not because of me, but
because a guy in my company,

1240
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:41,500
in Phoenix, Arizona,
went to a local session,

1241
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:42,980
local presentation,

1242
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:46,490
I don't even know what they
were talking about, okay.

1243
00:58:46,490 --> 00:58:49,689
But one of the people on the
panel with him was a lawyer.

1244
00:58:49,690 --> 00:58:52,950
And when that lawyer was
hired by the state of Arizona

1245
00:58:52,950 --> 00:58:56,819
to handle this case, he called this guy,

1246
00:58:56,820 --> 00:58:59,100
we've worked together and
said, "Who do you know

1247
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:01,279
who might be an expert
witness in this area?"

1248
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:03,630
And this person actually happens

1249
00:59:03,630 --> 00:59:05,080
to be my (indistinct) leader.

1250
00:59:06,050 --> 00:59:10,050
Jack says, "Well, actually I
know someone close to hand."

1251
00:59:10,050 --> 00:59:14,320
And so I was introduced,
so just that kind of thing,

1252
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:16,620
it can be your friends
going out and doing it.

1253
00:59:21,790 --> 00:59:24,730
- I'm sorry, I just wanna,
so Hoyt I think you froze.

1254
00:59:24,730 --> 00:59:25,910
- No, I haven't.

1255
00:59:25,910 --> 00:59:30,370
- Okay, I just wanna be
clear to restate my answer.

1256
00:59:30,370 --> 00:59:33,810
Google will bring up
LinkedIn connections as well.

1257
00:59:33,810 --> 00:59:35,190
So when I say Google something

1258
00:59:35,190 --> 00:59:38,360
is because LinkedIn is subsumed in it.

1259
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:39,810
So I just wanna be clear about that.

1260
00:59:39,810 --> 00:59:41,730
- Oh yeah, so you're not
advertising Google, yes.

1261
00:59:41,730 --> 00:59:44,149
- And I'm not advertising LinkedIn.

1262
00:59:44,149 --> 00:59:49,149
- It's like a Kleenex,
(chuckles) or Coca-Cola.

1263
00:59:49,350 --> 00:59:51,860
I do not sell Coke products, okay.

1264
00:59:51,860 --> 00:59:53,300
Trademarks.

1265
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:54,860
- Well, thank you everyone.

1266
00:59:54,860 --> 00:59:56,220
- Yeah, right, it's been swell,

1267
00:59:56,220 --> 00:59:58,069
at least I hope you think it's swell.
