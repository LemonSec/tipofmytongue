1
00:00:00,099 --> 00:00:03,599
(bright orchestral music)

2
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:39,339
- I have a secret I'm
gonna share with you.

3
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:42,040
I studied manipulation
campaigns because, well,

4
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,410
I have something to admit.

5
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:47,400
I'm what many would consider
a conspiracy theorist.

6
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,266
Growing up, my sweet gram
would often say to me,

7
00:00:50,267 --> 00:00:53,220
"I haven't voted since
they killed the Kennedy's."

8
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,527
I once asked her respectfully
but in exasperation,

9
00:00:56,527 --> 00:00:58,800
"Just who are they?"

10
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,736
She nodded and said,

11
00:01:00,737 --> 00:01:04,327
"You're too young to understand
now, kiddo, but you will.

12
00:01:04,327 --> 00:01:06,036
"Pay attention, always question,

13
00:01:06,037 --> 00:01:09,037
"never believe what they tell you.

14
00:01:09,037 --> 00:01:10,117
"You'll be okay.

15
00:01:10,117 --> 00:01:12,387
"Read lots of different sources

16
00:01:12,387 --> 00:01:15,410
"and don't let them tell
you how to think, ever."

17
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:17,490
May my sweet Gram rest in peace,

18
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:21,979
the wisdom she imparted
shapes how I do my job today.

19
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,210
It's not that I don't
believe what people tell me,

20
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,839
I believe they believe it's true.

21
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,850
I am skeptical of everything now,

22
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:32,449
and I study the manipulators of social,

23
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:36,000
economic, and political
issues on your behalf.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,010
Welcome to what keeps me awake at night

25
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:40,450
besides my two rescue dogs.

26
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:43,420
I recognize that many of my
findings and recommendations

27
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,970
are most likely not directed at you.

28
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:49,000
Chances are it's for
you to help someone else

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,920
know how to spot the manipulators

30
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,950
conducting their trade craft.

31
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:57,710
However, we all fall prey to
our own confirmation biases,

32
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:00,179
so maybe there's a nugget
or two that I'll share today

33
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,410
that could be helpful for you.

34
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:04,460
Manipulators promote misinformation

35
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:08,430
to encourage populations
to doubt what they believe.

36
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:11,730
Big tech firms have made
progress and inroads,

37
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:14,160
but they admit they have more to do.

38
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,680
International law struggles
to keep up as well.

39
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,150
NATO regularly publishes
the Tallinn Manual,

40
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:24,820
a guide on how to handle
international cyber attacks,

41
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:28,489
yet it is not clear to me
that something as significant

42
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:30,736
as people peddling in disinformation

43
00:02:30,736 --> 00:02:33,130
during all global elections,

44
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:35,090
as well as the dox and dump

45
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:37,080
that happened to the Clinton campaign

46
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,730
during the 2016 U.S presidential cycle

47
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:43,910
would actually result in
jail time for those involved.

48
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:46,930
Much less, have any coverage

49
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:50,040
by international courts and laws.

50
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,959
As someone who has personally
vowed to protect our nation

51
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,270
and our allies, businesses
and global citizens

52
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:00,820
from cyber manipulation
and digital break-ins

53
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:05,113
I find this lack of legal
recourse, highly objectionable.

54
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,457
Now Warren Buffett says that,

55
00:03:09,457 --> 00:03:12,677
"Cyber warfare is the
greatest threat to mankind

56
00:03:12,677 --> 00:03:15,049
"even more so than nuclear weapons."

57
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:18,130
I agree, but I suggest that as threatening

58
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:21,070
as those cyber attacks, the hacking of

59
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:24,540
information and systems is to imagine

60
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:28,280
perhaps the hacking of
our minds, maybe worse.

61
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,570
Manipulators are already
targeting many areas of our lives,

62
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:34,620
the stock market,
cryptocurrency valuations

63
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,260
the outcome of our elections, and yes,

64
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,019
the COVID-19 vaccine rollout.

65
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,400
Their actions are shaking
the foundations of

66
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,780
the world's most resilient societies.

67
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,490
Although political and social
espionage is centuries old,

68
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:53,691
and yes, well-documented
technology gives it a new twist

69
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:56,660
and the manipulators have
been honing their trade craft

70
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:58,380
for over a decade.

71
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:01,060
As a matter of fact, in 2013,

72
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:04,720
the world economic forum
posted its top 10 trends

73
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,070
on its watch list, guess
what was on that list?

74
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:11,617
Online misinformation,
that was back in 2013

75
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:18,560
according to many reports,
nearly 80% of the time,

76
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:22,980
Russian cyber operatives are
behind manipulation campaigns,

77
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,970
meddling in just about every

78
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:28,100
social economic issue around the globe.

79
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,283
For the record, Russia denies it.

80
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:34,378
Other cyber operatives
sometimes have manipulation

81
00:04:34,378 --> 00:04:38,080
campaigns such as China,
North Korea, Iran.

82
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,710
For the record they also deny it.

83
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,650
Also playing in this realm now,

84
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:47,349
are local and social
political activist campaigns.

85
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:51,290
Who needs rogue NationStates
when your own citizens

86
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:53,940
have picked up the manipulators playbook?

87
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:58,930
You may ask, why do cyber
operatives manipulate?

88
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:01,110
Well, the end game is to make you doubt

89
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:02,830
everything you believe,

90
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:05,919
which leaves you open
to believing anything.

91
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,920
Research shows that a
false story reaches people

92
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:13,860
six times faster than does
the actual news or the truth.

93
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,930
I learned another disturbing fact

94
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:20,930
while I was studying the
various manipulator ecosystems

95
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:24,050
in the research for writing
my book "Manipulated."

96
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:28,130
And it's this, it's incredibly lucrative.

97
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:29,580
I thought it was about picking winners

98
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,460
and losers when I started the book.

99
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:36,030
But actually when we click,
read, repost and share,

100
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:38,510
the best in the manipulator business,

101
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:41,120
make money, loads of it.

102
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,460
The reason I am honored to
have this time with you today

103
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:48,359
is I need your help
because as hard as it is

104
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,570
for a career technologists
like me to admit,

105
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:55,173
we cannot technology our
way out of this issue.

106
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,159
Now I know this is a really smart audience

107
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,440
so I know you know, what
a manipulation campaign is

108
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,670
but chances are, you
may need to describe it

109
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:07,790
to your favorite auntie
uncle, colleague, or friend.

110
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:09,480
So I'm gonna give you a couple definitions

111
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,890
you can use with them.

112
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:12,830
It's often truth amplified.

113
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:15,590
It can be truth mixed with disinformation

114
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:18,599
and it can be complete disinformation.

115
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,100
It's placed in such a
way that gets you to act

116
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,410
or in some cases not act.

117
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:25,950
Think about people thinking
that their vote doesn't matter,

118
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,570
so they don't vote.

119
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:30,820
Now, disinformation is a little
nuance for misinformation

120
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,040
because it's deliberate.

121
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:35,140
Misinformation sometimes,
the person passing it along,

122
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:38,800
there's no intent, it just
fits their confirmation bias.

123
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,600
The other thing you need to know is that

124
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,540
a manipulation campaign
is the highest form

125
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:46,500
of organized and strategic placement

126
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,540
of misinformation and disinformation.

127
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:52,749
Here are just a few
examples of disinformation

128
00:06:52,749 --> 00:06:55,980
and yes, they snuck right past algorithms

129
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,780
and governance bodies until

130
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,809
humans intervened and flagged them.

131
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:02,380
The first one I wanna talk to you about

132
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,370
was in August of 2020, that tragic day,

133
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:08,620
when the explosion went off in Beirut,

134
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:13,320
hundreds of people died and
hundreds more were injured.

135
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:17,460
Within hours, fake and fabricated
videos were distributed

136
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:21,870
claiming that Israeli war
missiles caused that explosion.

137
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:24,980
During the early 2020
presidential campaign,

138
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,800
disinformation means claimed

139
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,260
that then candidate Kamala
Harris was disqualified to run

140
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,469
because she was not a U.S citizen.

141
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:35,970
They were playing off of the fact

142
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:39,350
that her parents are Jamaican
and Indian immigrants.

143
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:44,350
It got enough traction that
anchor Chris Cuomo on CNN

144
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:47,950
said Harris needed to
prove her U.S citizenship.

145
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:52,950
He later apologized, but him
mentioning it on the news,

146
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:55,630
gave that fake story life.

147
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:57,550
No issue is off limits.

148
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:59,870
As a matter of fact, the Koch Family Farms

149
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:04,510
no relation to the politically
active Koch Brothers,

150
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:08,020
was hit with a disinformation
campaign by a Russian troll.

151
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:12,520
The Russian troll accused this
family farm in Pennsylvania

152
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:16,400
of poisoning people with turkeys,
yes, you heard me, right.

153
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,780
We are now weaponizing turkeys.

154
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:21,549
Now because we are in a global pandemic,

155
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:24,600
I wanna talk to you about
manipulation campaigns

156
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,940
and the topic of health.

157
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,840
One rough estimate shows
that misinformation

158
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,839
on public health alone generated
billions that's with a B

159
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:39,059
of social media views in only one year.

160
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:41,949
there's a poll in the
UK that found that 8%

161
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:46,700
of UK residents believe that 5G technology

162
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,130
actually spreads the Corona virus.

163
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:52,969
In the United States, 27%
of Americans are hesitant

164
00:08:52,969 --> 00:08:56,810
to get the COVID 19 vaccine much in part

165
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:59,449
due to manipulation campaigns.

166
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:03,260
These theories are just a small
part of a global infodemic

167
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:07,830
that is running largely unchecked
on social media platforms.

168
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:10,280
It doesn't have to be this way.

169
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:14,000
I am optimistic that democracy
will be more resilient,

170
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,790
but we have to collectively work together.

171
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:19,490
We have to work this issue across nations

172
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:24,490
big tech, academia, news
media, and yes, you and me,

173
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:30,800
we can and we'll win this
war against the manipulators.

174
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,970
Now who are behind these
manipulation campaigns?

175
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:36,460
It varies, but it's everything from

176
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,800
unscrupulous business competitors

177
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,729
to unscrupulous political operatives

178
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:44,050
as well as cyber criminals,

179
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:47,747
and you guessed it,
unscrupulous NationStates.

180
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:50,630
How were they doing it?

181
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:55,630
Well for starters, the
perpetrators are using a variety

182
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,080
of different techniques, but right now,

183
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,993
social media is their
distribution platform of choice.

184
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:05,250
As I interviewed experts and hackers

185
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:08,240
conducting manipulation
campaigns for my book,

186
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,830
I grew increasingly concerned
about the ability to create

187
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:15,620
deep fake of everything
both now and in the future.

188
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:19,997
New cottage industry services,
such as mrdeepfakes.com

189
00:10:19,997 --> 00:10:22,969
#ThisIsNotSuitableForWork,

190
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:25,820
will only require a decent graphics card,

191
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:28,490
some patients and 10 steps.

192
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:32,040
Only in this case, it
only required an hour

193
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,199
and you were able to remove Putin's face

194
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,860
and replace it with Kevin Spacey's.

195
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:41,760
A few years ago, this would
have required technical know-how

196
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,404
and or thousands of dollars to pull off.

197
00:10:44,404 --> 00:10:48,790
Now you have a how-to guide,
a gooey and guess what?

198
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:52,180
You don't even need to know
Python to pull this off.

199
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:54,099
While doing my research for "Manipulated"

200
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:58,450
I came across the case of
female investigative journalist

201
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:02,500
Rana Ayyub, after an
eight-year-old Kashmiri girl

202
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,820
was brutally raped.

203
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:08,650
Ayyub was openly speaking
about the fact that she felt

204
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:11,500
there was a coverup that
involved an influential man

205
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:15,140
and perhaps senior government officials.

206
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:17,660
Internet trolls began to attack her.

207
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:20,620
They started forging
tweets from Ayyub's account

208
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:24,237
saying things such as "I love
child rapists, and if they are

209
00:11:24,237 --> 00:11:28,130
"doing it in the name of
Islam, I support them."

210
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:30,330
This was horrible enough on its own.

211
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:33,340
But then her likeness was edited

212
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:37,580
into a pornographic video
that was released online.

213
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:40,420
The threats against her life escalated

214
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,530
and the United Nations had to step in

215
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:45,199
and ask India to protect her.

216
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,713
One victim of this type of
attack is one victim too many.

217
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:54,270
So after unmasking
various peddlers of scams

218
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:56,240
I've seen recurring themes and patterns

219
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,490
and I wanna show you they
use to commit their fraud.

220
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:02,190
It's typically three overarching steps.

221
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:06,400
First you create whatever
your new story is going to be.

222
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,010
And you post it on state-sponsored news

223
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:11,170
as well as independent news sites

224
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:13,810
that look like they
originate from a country.

225
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:17,920
You then use innocuous
but popular hashtags

226
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,199
and a combination of people,
fake personas and bots

227
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,850
to spread it alternately
throughout these different sites

228
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:28,360
creating almost like an
information laundering.

229
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,890
And then you just repeat
this over and over again

230
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:32,880
until it takes a foothold.

231
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,560
So how can you help your
loved ones, your colleagues?

232
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,400
Know how to spot these,
a couple of red flags

233
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,490
that I want you to look for and
to tell them to look out for

234
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:44,530
are sensational headlines.

235
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:47,310
Perhaps a topic that is not being reported

236
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:51,079
on traditional news media outlets
could be another red flag.

237
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,330
They typically have to source and vet

238
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:56,190
before they publish and post.

239
00:12:56,190 --> 00:13:01,190
Also memes are the hardest
to spot and a favorite tool

240
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:04,110
that is used by NationStates
that wanna target

241
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:07,453
the demographic of 25
years of age and under.

242
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:11,300
Here's some samples of
memes that have made it

243
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:14,469
past social media flags
for disinformation,

244
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:16,480
so they circulate freely.

245
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,500
I'm gonna move quickly.

246
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,864
I just wanna show you how
memes can be amateurish

247
00:13:20,864 --> 00:13:23,840
but then quickly lead
to more sophisticated

248
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:27,750
messaging and memes by
using very subtle kernels

249
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,860
of truth and mistruth.

250
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:33,710
You'll see it compared
to DNA, to flu shots,

251
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:37,030
to populations of people
who for religious reasons

252
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:41,036
don't typically seek out
medical attention or vaccines.

253
00:13:41,036 --> 00:13:44,670
I decided for our time together
to unmask a manipulation

254
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:48,719
campaign related to the
COVID-19 vaccine rollout.

255
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,260
Ideally your opinion on whether or not

256
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,860
to get the COVID 19 vaccine should come

257
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:57,420
from medical advice from your
family, medical professional.

258
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,479
Perhaps then taking it

259
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,560
and relating it to your
own personal situation.

260
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,890
Whether or not you decide to get a vaccine

261
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:08,299
or not get a vaccine, I'm
not here to judge you.

262
00:14:08,299 --> 00:14:09,699
I just wanna make sure

263
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:13,700
that you are not manipulated
by disinformation schemes.

264
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,630
Prior to the pandemic, there was actually

265
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:20,410
a collaborative study on Americans
and vaccines of children.

266
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:23,740
The study was conducted by
George Washington University

267
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:27,200
the University of Maryland
and Johns Hopkins University.

268
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,810
What did they find? That Americans for

269
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:32,530
and against child vaccines
were joined by covert

270
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:36,470
Russian operatives posting
both for and against vaccines.

271
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:38,190
As a matter of fact their favorite

272
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:41,470
hashtag was vaccinate U.S.

273
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:45,670
Why would Russian hackers care
if U.S kids are vaccinated?

274
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:48,349
They don't, that's the point.

275
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:51,180
Russia has almost 100% vaccination rate

276
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,420
of their own children.

277
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,949
What you have to remember
is the ultimate goal

278
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:57,760
of most manipulators,
including these trolls

279
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,340
is to rile up a country citizens,

280
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:03,640
foster unease about any particular issue

281
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,220
and make us distrust medical experts

282
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:10,240
and government authorities
and their work opened the door

283
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,620
to the manipulation
campaigns unfolding today,

284
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:17,180
as it relates to COVID-19 vaccine rollout.

285
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,520
In looking specifically

286
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:21,829
for COVID-19 vaccine
manipulation campaigns,

287
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:25,590
I worked alongside one of our
senior experts at Fortalice.

288
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:28,360
His name is Landon Stewart,
and we work together

289
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,290
and I'm gonna unmask some
of this research for you.

290
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:33,870
I want you to know this is the first time

291
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:36,576
I am publicly revealing our findings.

292
00:15:36,576 --> 00:15:41,500
I pulled only a small sample
of highlights to show you

293
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,010
and I wanted to show you our methodology

294
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:46,170
so you could implement it tomorrow

295
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:48,969
back at your workplace
and in your personal life.

296
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:52,440
Our methodology was to use
free and open source tools

297
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,440
so that you could use these right away.

298
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,700
The tools we used for this
experiment and this research

299
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:01,650
and analysis were a
gaming computer, Node XL,

300
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:04,023
CrowdTangle and Botometer.

301
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,800
First we installed Node XL
onto the gaming computer.

302
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:13,800
We fed the tool two search
terms, COVID vaccine and hoax.

303
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:15,969
Finally, we allowed the tool to run

304
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:20,160
on the standalone machine
for 48 hours and voila!

305
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,660
Guess what we had? We had the
beginning of a misinformation

306
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:27,219
and disinformation
investigation, and guess what?

307
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,870
We found lots of it.

308
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:33,340
My lawyer won't allow me
to say the overall activity

309
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:36,830
is fraudulent because that
calls for a legal determination

310
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,830
but I will allow you to
come to your own conclusion.

311
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:42,250
We redacted some of the
findings for this presentation.

312
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,480
I will cover why, in just a few moments.

313
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,900
These images you see
right here were created

314
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:51,760
with a super cool tool, Node XL.

315
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,510
It's a plugin that creates link analysis

316
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:57,480
of what you find on Twitter,
social media networks

317
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,940
based on any search terms you feed to it.

318
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:02,970
In this case, again, it
was COVID vaccine and hoax.

319
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:04,589
This chart is busy on purpose.

320
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:06,490
I wanted you to see the raw results

321
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:10,240
without my confirmation
bias on the results.

322
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,589
So what are you looking at here?

323
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:13,459
The larger nodes mean

324
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:16,180
that they posted something that had a lot

325
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:20,410
of retweets and reposts
and likes in 48 hours.

326
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:23,400
What did we find? The
manipulators I'm highlighting

327
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,500
for you here on the surface
of their personal accounts,

328
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,720
they seem like small accounts.

329
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,830
They don't seem like big influencers.

330
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:33,570
They seem small and focused
on what? Vaccine safety.

331
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:36,223
And who wouldn't be for vaccine safety?

332
00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:39,349
This group hides its
true influence by linking

333
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:44,349
their accounts to larger
affinity groups on social media.

334
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:46,550
These groups included things such as

335
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:51,169
arts, cooking, fashion, music,
sports, culture, and more.

336
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:55,130
They then took truths, mixed
in with misinformation,

337
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:59,570
and created a ongoing
rabbit hole for the reader.

338
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:01,240
And looking at the largest
group in the middle,

339
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:05,970
that's G1, the search result
correlates a now debunk story

340
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:08,920
of a Tennessee nurse who supposedly died

341
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,010
during a taped vaccination.

342
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:12,530
In groups, two, three and four,

343
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:14,379
which are on the right of the slide,

344
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:17,150
you will see another story
related to the vaccination

345
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:20,830
and subsequent miscarriage
of a Michigan-based doctor,

346
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:25,129
also unproven, so what's
the overall point here?

347
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:29,120
Misinformation leads the
reader to more misinformation.

348
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,409
Although our research does
support recent reports

349
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:35,010
that NationStates and others are promoting

350
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:38,035
disinformation campaigns
around COVID-19 origins

351
00:18:38,035 --> 00:18:41,960
and the vaccine rollout, we
excluded those data points

352
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,320
from the analysis I'm showing you today

353
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,980
because it's already well covered

354
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:49,200
in news media and industry reports.

355
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,650
We redacted the operators
behind these examples

356
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:55,690
because they point back
to everyday people,

357
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:59,640
in this case Americans and an Australian.

358
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,270
Behind these nodes are a tiny group

359
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:05,240
of roughly 30 people
with time on their hands,

360
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:09,429
yet they found a way by our
calculations to reach a minimum

361
00:19:09,429 --> 00:19:13,560
of 94,000 people in 48 hours,

362
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,629
unsuspecting members of affinity groups.

363
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:18,630
Although I've redacted their names,

364
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:20,570
I'll tell you a little bit about them.

365
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:23,550
The number one influencer
is a male that lives

366
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:25,960
in the Midwest, in the USA.

367
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:29,406
Newsy stories were circulating
from these larger nodes.

368
00:19:29,406 --> 00:19:32,520
They belong to a blog which
promotes misinformation

369
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,480
and disinformation on COVID-19 vaccines.

370
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:40,140
That blog it's run by an off
the strip lawyer in Vegas,

371
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:42,020
who's in his 70s.

372
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:44,150
Another man from central Massachusetts

373
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:47,190
labels his occupation as truth finder.

374
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:50,810
And finally, one is a
white male from Australia.

375
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:54,429
He promotes the reason
why his opinions are true

376
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:58,010
is because he has a PhD, in economics

377
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:01,700
and he has been debunked
by sites, such as Vaxopedia

378
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,136
for continuing to push the link

379
00:20:03,136 --> 00:20:05,913
between vaccines and
ongoing health issues.

380
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,870
The data you see here is
displayed in the tool Botometer

381
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:13,639
from the University of Indiana's
Observatory on social media

382
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,220
uses a machine learning
algorithm to tell you

383
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:20,110
zero, most likely human,
to five, possibly a bot.

384
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:22,963
I'm just gonna show you
quickly how these nodes looked.

385
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:27,280
Bot-like behavior could
include lots of fake followers

386
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,149
and repeat postings at specific times.

387
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:32,430
Now the fourth node while
conducting our research

388
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:34,740
was actually suspended.

389
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:37,210
While reviewing the nodes,
we also observed that

390
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:40,830
connection from the nodes to this blog.

391
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,870
For the purposes of today's conversation

392
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:46,050
I'm just gonna refer to
the blog as Acme blog.

393
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:48,490
The blog promotes many vaccine stories

394
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:52,240
most of which are made to
give you an emotional reaction

395
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,720
to tell you that vaccines are unsafe.

396
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,810
By using the tool, CrowdTangle
a tool created by Facebook,

397
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:02,149
Landon found that the nodes,
those individual accounts,

398
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:04,870
expanded their reach
through posting and sharing

399
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:06,770
on various affinity groups.

400
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:08,840
Here, I'm showing you just a little sample

401
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,600
of those affinity groups.

402
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:15,449
For example, one of those
nodes linked to a California,

403
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:17,230
small business owners group

404
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:20,610
with how many members? 68,000.

405
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:22,979
Well, why link to affinity groups?

406
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:26,090
That seems like a very innocuous way

407
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:27,600
to get your point across.

408
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,840
Well, if you target everyone
and you get just one believer

409
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:35,129
from each unique micro
segmented affinity group,

410
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:38,120
you can work with that
individual to gain a foothold

411
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,939
among its many members.

412
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:42,260
We found most of the blog
posts were actually written

413
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,540
in such a way to appeal to readers

414
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:49,540
in the U.S, the EU, Canada, and Australia.

415
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:52,600
Now, if you glance
quickly at the Acme blog

416
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,500
you may see that it sort of
looks like a news aggregator

417
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,750
with some stories about individuals.

418
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,190
Upon closer look, you will
notice that the stories

419
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:04,330
promote the theory that the
COVID 19 vaccine is untrue.

420
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:06,669
As a matter of fact, some of
these stories are heartbreaking

421
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:09,550
talking about deaths and miscarriages.

422
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:12,230
A pretty rudimentary
fact check will tell you

423
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:13,900
this stories are false.

424
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,180
A click on the About Us button

425
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:18,470
shows you there's a call to action.

426
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:22,320
Acme is asking its readers to
help continue their hard work

427
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,290
by posting sharing and supporting them,

428
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:30,230
not just on social media, by
sharing, but also financially.

429
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:32,573
They do ask you to donate money.

430
00:22:32,573 --> 00:22:35,860
Now to the discerning
eye, like this audience,

431
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,250
you've already seen the red flags

432
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:39,290
as I've been going through the research,

433
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:40,940
but there are enough
people in your circle,

434
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:43,760
people that you care about,
people that you work with,

435
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,250
who may end up donating to this campaign

436
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:48,400
and falling for this information

437
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:53,040
at a time where lives
and health is at risk.

438
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,810
Digging a little deeper, a
little more research from Landon

439
00:22:55,810 --> 00:23:00,169
finds that Acme's blog is
tied to a parent organization.

440
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:03,810
Both were started right
around the same time.

441
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:08,010
Now we have redacted the address
and other information here

442
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:10,500
but something I want you to rest assured,

443
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,920
we've provided all of this research

444
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,963
to the proper authorities
for processing and handling.

445
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:19,379
Also, what I want you to know is this,

446
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:22,540
no matter how you feel
about any hot button issues

447
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:24,760
such as COVID-19 and vaccines,

448
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,810
who wins or loses an election,

449
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:28,783
how decisions get made by your government,

450
00:23:28,783 --> 00:23:32,560
or any of today's modern
issues, the point is this,

451
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:35,940
the manipulators, they
don't care how you feel.

452
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:38,450
They just wanna manipulate you.

453
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,800
So what can you do about this?

454
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,990
Chances are your professional
training didn't include

455
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:46,340
how to spot NationStates or bots,

456
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:48,899
but with tools like Botometer now you can.

457
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,840
You can even see who picks
up a story and runs with it

458
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,149
by using a tool like CrowdTangle.

459
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:57,050
The steps that I am
suggesting here are typically

460
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:59,720
for everyone, but I've
got a couple special ones

461
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:04,540
for people and corporations
and any of world leaders

462
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:06,629
and people that said policy.

463
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:07,840
So where can we start?

464
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,110
Well today or this week,
I would like everyone

465
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:13,780
to think about always having
three trusted sources.

466
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:16,180
It doesn't matter, but
think about having something

467
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:19,413
local, national and
international, where you know

468
00:24:19,413 --> 00:24:22,810
the journalists do their
research, do their homework,

469
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:24,669
they do investigative journalism,

470
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:27,130
they trust and vet their sources.

471
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:29,630
Check those news organization's website

472
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:31,380
directly for yourself.

473
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:34,690
In your daily routine, leverage
tools such as Botometer,

474
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:38,450
CrowdTangle and even The
Disinformation Index.

475
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:41,270
I love the idea of
having a contest at work

476
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:45,180
which we've done at my
office also at home to see

477
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:48,700
who can spot the most egregious
manipulation campaigns.

478
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:51,850
Just a parenting note,
I'm raising three Gen Z's.

479
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:55,159
Having these contests at
home are especially helpful,

480
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,430
especially with internet memes and videos.

481
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:00,050
Leverage fact checkers as part

482
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:01,970
of your standard operating routines.

483
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:03,320
And if you're watching a video

484
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,659
and you're wondering am
I'm looking at a deep fake?

485
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,790
One of my favorite tools I like to go to,

486
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:10,423
is the Microsoft Video Authenticator tool.

487
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:13,020
So what are some things you can do

488
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,920
in the coming weeks or months?

489
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,440
Well, at a company,
consider building a playbook

490
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,160
around the manipulation
campaigns that I just spoke of.

491
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,690
Think about having an
incident response playbook

492
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:27,660
where either your
industry, your executives,

493
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:30,590
or your actual company,
fall prey to some type of

494
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:33,149
misinformation or disinformation campaign.

495
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:35,600
Go on offense now and create

496
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,459
predebunking and preemptive measures.

497
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,430
For example, what's the worst thing

498
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:42,550
somebody might make up about you?

499
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:45,270
Get those talking points together now.

500
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:47,550
Set up a company operating
routine where you are

501
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:49,879
automatically scanning for misinformation

502
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,830
about your industry,
company or executives.

503
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:55,909
Train all of your staff,
that when in doubt,

504
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:58,773
to contact your security
operations center.

505
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:02,950
Now, what are some larger
things that we can do?

506
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:05,736
For world leaders, please,
if you are listening,

507
00:26:05,736 --> 00:26:09,360
work together, we need
policy and governance

508
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,659
that fights back against
cyber manipulation,

509
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,830
and yes, cybercrime.

510
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:16,689
Assign a delegate from each nation,

511
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:18,610
to meet and work with other nations

512
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:22,179
on some type of an international
framework and accord.

513
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:25,600
For those of you that can
influence policy and governance,

514
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,000
please encourage your leaders
to meet with other nations.

515
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,040
Also ensure that news media,
public relations firms,

516
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:37,070
marketing firms, and more
follow the Helsinki Declaration.

517
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:40,780
What I love about that
Declaration just to sum it up,

518
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:43,980
is they advise practitioners
to respect the truth,

519
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:47,293
to never knowingly circulate false news.

520
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:50,440
And for everyone as the saying goes,

521
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,890
if you see something, say something.

522
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:54,760
We all have a role to play.

523
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:58,270
Yes, social media platforms
and big tech are trying to do

524
00:26:58,270 --> 00:27:00,770
the right thing but they are outnumbered.

525
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:02,963
Report, report, report.

526
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:07,220
And if you get a chance read
or listen to "Manipulated."

527
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,700
I don't know if you know this,

528
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:11,790
but it is the number one
guidebook on the subject,

529
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:14,570
that is according to my mother.

530
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:15,530
And you know what?

531
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:18,330
You should listen to my mother,
forgive the shameless plug

532
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:21,425
but I wrote "Manipulated"
to drive a positive outcome

533
00:27:21,425 --> 00:27:26,253
after the 2020 elections
and looking forward to 2024.

534
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:30,320
This is the crisis of our time.

535
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,730
Manipulation campaigns
are still in their infancy

536
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:37,410
but tactics and technology
will get only more advanced,

537
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:40,450
accelerated and imperceptible.

538
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:42,660
It's gonna be really tough.

539
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:45,670
It's not gonna be easy to stop them.

540
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:47,460
Many organizations, as I mentioned,

541
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:51,000
big tech, nonprofits, think
tanks, and government agencies

542
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,290
are working around the clock
right now, trying to stop them,

543
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:56,300
but they need our help.

544
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:59,830
The only fix is for
all of us to be enraged

545
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:01,860
by what the manipulators are doing.

546
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:05,310
It is time for this digital
generation to rise up

547
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:08,399
against those who are
trying to hijack our minds

548
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,200
and manipulate what we know to be true.

549
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,570
If we act now, our future
will take a positive course.

550
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:17,707
One that can detect, protect, and defend

551
00:28:17,708 --> 00:28:20,380
against manipulation campaigns.

552
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:23,810
Thank you to the RSA
Conference for allowing me to

553
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:25,868
have this time together with you.

554
00:28:25,868 --> 00:28:27,200
Thank you, Landon.

555
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,720
And thank you to each
of you for listening in.

556
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,870
Please join me in fighting the good fight.

557
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:35,110
Now my favorite part of any talk,

558
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:38,080
especially ones with such
an enlightened audience,

559
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:42,240
like the RSA Conference audience,
I know you have questions.

560
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:46,647
So fire away by tagging
the RSA Conference and me

561
00:28:46,647 --> 00:28:48,840
@TrackerPayton on Twitter.

562
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,919
Thank you again for your
time, thank you for listening.

563
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:55,673
And please don't allow anybody
to tell you how to think.

564
00:28:57,619 --> 00:29:01,119
(bright orchestral music)
