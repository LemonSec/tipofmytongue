1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:02,193
- Hi, I'm Dave Grady,

2
00:00:02,193 --> 00:00:04,460
chief security evangelist
at Verizon Business Group.

3
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:06,600
And I wanna thank you for
joining me for the session

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,750
where we're gonna look at
the security implications

5
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:13,350
and the security considerations
of 5G, 5G conductivity.

6
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:16,180
When any new technology
comes into the forefront

7
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:19,370
and gets in the spotlight,
captures the public imagination,

8
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:22,330
that technology tends
to aspire certain people

9
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:24,912
in certain roles to ask certain questions.

10
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:29,930
If you are a consumer and
you see some new technology

11
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:32,960
you're very likely to say,
what can it do for me?

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,070
How can this technology
make my life better?

13
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,400
How can it make me more
effective, more efficient,

14
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,930
more productive, safer, richer, whatever

15
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:43,000
but more informed, what's in it for me.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,400
But on the business side,
when new technology comes

17
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,920
into the spotlight and
promises great new things,

18
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,440
the business people, the
business line managers,

19
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,379
the product managers, they ask themselves

20
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:56,790
what can this technology do for us?

21
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,530
So what can I do for our
organization, our company?

22
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:00,450
And that question really means

23
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:02,100
how can we use that technology

24
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,269
to improve the way we
operate, to cut costs

25
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:08,979
to innovate more effectively,
to capture more customers,

26
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,120
to delight our customers?

27
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,830
How can we use this technology
to increase our revenue

28
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:15,120
and our market share
and conquer the world?

29
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,080
Those are the kinds of questions,

30
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,600
what can it do for us that
the business looks at.

31
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,699
But when new technologies emerge

32
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,950
and capture people's imaginations

33
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,673
and promise a revolution, technology,

34
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,480
folks who work in security and risk,

35
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,827
they tend to ask a different question.

36
00:01:30,827 --> 00:01:35,280
The question they ask is what
can this technology do to us?

37
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,960
And they're not being paranoid,
they're doing their job.

38
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,229
They're asking the question

39
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:40,430
how would the adoption
of the implementation

40
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:42,640
of this new technology that
everybody's talking about,

41
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,230
shiny and new, how can
the adoption of this

42
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:48,170
in our organization
potentially bring in more risks

43
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:52,420
and potentially cause damage
short-term or lasting damage.

44
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:55,510
And those questions are the
right questions to be asking.

45
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:57,320
All throughout history
we've seen this happen

46
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,779
when new technologies come onto the scene.

47
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,030
Do a quick history lesson here

48
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:03,180
with the industrial revolutions.

49
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,030
Back in the late 1700s

50
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,360
with the first industrial revolution

51
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:11,360
we saw water and steam power
suddenly turned early factories

52
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:14,660
into much more efficient
ways to make textiles.

53
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:17,060
And the first mechanical loom was created

54
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,270
and consumers were looking
at that and they were asking

55
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:20,738
what can I do for me?

56
00:02:20,738 --> 00:02:21,860
And the consumers were getting the answer.

57
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,850
Well, it can make my clothes for me faster

58
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,790
and make blankets and like,
takes me out of the business

59
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:29,079
of having to do that hard work myself.

60
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,480
The business people who are
running these small looms

61
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,399
and factories were saying,
what can this do for us?

62
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,540
What can this do for my business?

63
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:40,160
Well, it can make my business
less reliant on humans

64
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,920
whose backs get hurt, who
can't lift heavy things.

65
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,839
I can operate more
effectively, more efficiently.

66
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,370
That's what this technology does for us.

67
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,300
Now back then, there
weren't a lot of security

68
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,270
or risk people asking the questions about

69
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:58,380
what could it do to us, there
wasn't a lot of oversight

70
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,280
or risk management back in the day.

71
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,370
If you lost your hand
in the mechanical loom,

72
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:03,980
that was on you.

73
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:07,060
In fact we didn't even
have OSHA until 1970

74
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,830
but the second industrial
revolution sort of brought

75
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:11,340
the same questions to
the same type of people.

76
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:16,180
The transference of physical
work through electrical energy

77
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:19,520
to mass production of their
belts in the late 1800s

78
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,850
meant that consumers were
saying what's in it for me.

79
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:24,760
Well, more choice, more access to goods

80
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,510
and probably prices being driven down

81
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:28,410
because there's more of
that stuff being made

82
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:29,590
more efficiently.

83
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,500
And the folks in business,
the titans of industry

84
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,530
they were looking at the
second industrial revolution

85
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:36,970
and electrical technology and
saying, what's in it for us?

86
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:38,960
What will this do for us?

87
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,260
Well, it's gonna speed production,

88
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,720
it's gonna make us be able
to get into new markets.

89
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,230
It's gonna help us establish a brand.

90
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:46,750
And again, there were not a lot

91
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,540
of people asking the questions
around security and risk

92
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:52,250
because the regulatory
environment wasn't really there

93
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,830
wasn't until 1913, that actually industry

94
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:56,130
in the United States got together

95
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:57,609
and voluntarily created something called

96
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:00,980
the Worker Safety Council
which was a forerunner

97
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:04,420
to more safety and risk
management at work.

98
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,760
But it wasn't really until the
third industrial revolution

99
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,649
where we talk about computing power

100
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:13,440
and the digital electronic age
that came in the late 1960s

101
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,220
and throughout the 1970s

102
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,240
where we started to see the transference

103
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:20,610
of not just the mechanical
labor, but also the mental labor

104
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:24,360
to machines and to technology
and away from people.

105
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,960
So consumers were asking that question,

106
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,280
what could it do for me?

107
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,700
Well, it can help digitize my life.

108
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,370
I can organize my life in a device.

109
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:33,760
I can watch television on demand.

110
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,370
I can download a book instead of going to

111
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:36,600
the bookstore to buy one.

112
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,920
Consumers wanted to know
what it could do for them.

113
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,360
And on the business side, again,

114
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,570
in the third industrial
revolution, business leaders,

115
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:45,330
product managers, C-level
people were saying

116
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:46,680
how can we capitalize,

117
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,130
how can we exploit this
new technology, computers,

118
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:55,130
the internet, e-commerce,
handheld devices,

119
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:58,110
mobile devices, smartphones,
how can we leverage all

120
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:01,390
of those things to help our business?

121
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,914
What's in it for us?

122
00:05:02,914 --> 00:05:03,750
What can it do for us?

123
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,440
Well, we can innovate more effectively,

124
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,604
we can use this technology
to compete more effectively,

125
00:05:09,604 --> 00:05:14,080
to drive down costs, to
innovate in our products,

126
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,770
to disrupt an entire industries,
to conquer the world.

127
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:19,567
And now this is really
where you started to see

128
00:05:19,567 --> 00:05:21,220
the introduction of risking security folks

129
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,290
who are also asking the question,

130
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:24,090
what could this do to us?

131
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:27,409
You're now seeing the more
mature regulatory environment.

132
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:30,210
You're seeing more
understanding of the risks

133
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:33,310
with data and digitization of the world.

134
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:36,330
So our profession risk
and particularly security

135
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:38,940
and cybersecurity began
to grow and earnest.

136
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,450
And again those questions in
the third industrial revolution

137
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:44,099
that you and I and risk
folks were asking is

138
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,790
what can this technology
possibly do to our organization

139
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:49,890
that we need to manage, what
risks we need to mitigate.

140
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:51,289
So now here we are at the start

141
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:53,250
of another industrial revolution.

142
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,630
5G is going to usher in,
is already ushering in

143
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,870
what we call the fourth
industrial revolution.

144
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:00,540
Again, it's the transference
of more mechanical work

145
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:03,170
to machines and more
metal work to machines.

146
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:05,220
Only this time, it's gonna be fueled by

147
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:08,730
a really powerful combination
of 5G connectivity,

148
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:11,060
artificial intelligence,
and machine learning.

149
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:15,010
It's an incredibly brave new world

150
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:17,360
that we're moving into quickly here.

151
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,500
And to belabor it, yes, on purpose

152
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,520
these questions have to be asked again.

153
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,250
Consumers are asking what is in it for me?

154
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,100
What is this technology?

155
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,450
When is 5G gonna do for me?

156
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:29,430
And this is key to businesses asking

157
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:32,900
what can 5G do for us?

158
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:33,739
How will it benefit?

159
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:36,400
What rewards will it
bring to the organization

160
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,299
and you as a security
person or a risk person

161
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,010
you should be asking
the question, how can,

162
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:44,772
I mean, what can this technology
do to our organization?

163
00:06:44,773 --> 00:06:47,540
Will 5G bring new risks?

164
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,550
Will it imperil the current
security operations?

165
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:52,920
Will it introduce new risks
that I haven't even thought of?

166
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,950
So that's sort of the framework
for what we wanna talk about

167
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:55,979
in the next half hour or so,

168
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,810
is that the questions
that you as a security

169
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:00,990
and risk person should be asking yourself

170
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:03,450
as you're evaluating and thinking about

171
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:06,640
implementing 5G technology
into your operations.

172
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,340
What can this do to us?

173
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,780
But you also, as a security
and risk person have to ask

174
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:13,580
the question, what can this do for us?

175
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:16,469
And that means you have to
sort of step into the shoes

176
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:19,700
or look from the perspective
of the business people

177
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:23,610
who are ultimately driving and championing

178
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:27,420
the adoption of new technologies like 5G.

179
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:31,410
They want to realize the rewards

180
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:33,170
and you need to mitigate the risks

181
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:35,450
so they can realize those rewards

182
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:38,051
but you have to understand
what's motivating them

183
00:07:38,052 --> 00:07:42,630
to advocate for all these new
technologies, new process,

184
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:46,340
business process, design, all
these sort of innovative use

185
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:51,340
of VR and AR and other technologies
to change the business.

186
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:52,870
You need to understand what's driving them

187
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:55,850
so you can anticipate the
possible risks that could come

188
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,160
with the use cases that you're asking for.

189
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,680
So of course, we have to
do a couple of minutes

190
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,450
to talk about what 5G is,

191
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:03,765
if you're not too familiar with it.

192
00:08:03,765 --> 00:08:05,659
5G is not an upgrade to 4G.

193
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:09,240
It is a fundamentally new
technology, networking technology.

194
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,060
It's about a new sort
of antenna technology

195
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:16,800
that brings dramatic
improvements and changes

196
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,000
to the transmission data.

197
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,990
The latency is incredibly slow.

198
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:27,230
It can be all the way
down to five milliseconds

199
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:29,470
from point A to point B.

200
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:31,700
Right now in like the 4G land,

201
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:34,280
it's about 50 or 60 sometimes.

202
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,539
So to have that speed is
one of the huge benefits

203
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:40,579
that is going to inspire people
in the business line to say,

204
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,610
what can I do with that speed?

205
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:45,840
Throughput, 10 gigs per second.

206
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,170
My gosh, what can I do with that?

207
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:51,140
How can that change the way
that I offered gaming services

208
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:53,330
or downloading media?

209
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:56,650
How can I accelerate my e-commerce,

210
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:59,607
what does 10 gigs per second
mean to me as a business

211
00:08:59,607 --> 00:09:01,890
and the opportunities that that creates.

212
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:05,430
Data volume, 5G supports not just speed,

213
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:08,500
but also the amount of data that

214
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,270
can go out to a number of devices.

215
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:14,870
You can now send out 10
terabytes per square kilometer

216
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:17,840
which means that you can
have so many IoT devices

217
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,100
or so many other devices within

218
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,540
a certain set geographic area

219
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:24,099
that the signal is not degraded.

220
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,750
It doesn't slow down.

221
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,040
It's not like the old days

222
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,380
when you had 10, 20, 30
devices at your home,

223
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,300
and all your kids had five devices each

224
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,420
and they're sucking up the Wi-Fi, right?

225
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:39,420
With 5G you can support this
massive delivery of data

226
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:42,989
to a wide set of devices quickly

227
00:09:44,436 --> 00:09:47,890
and a lot of it at the same time.

228
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:49,540
What's interesting too with 5G is

229
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,540
it's a way that focuses the beam

230
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,800
of the network connectivity.

231
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,560
And it can actually keep
up with mobile devices

232
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,160
going 500 kilometers an hour.

233
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,339
That's like 300 miles an hour.

234
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:06,150
That's great for being able
to do real-time tracking

235
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:08,550
for assets that are in
the air or on the ground.

236
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:11,839
And that sometimes some of
that stuff is mission critical.

237
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,877
And when we get a little
bit into edge computing

238
00:10:14,877 --> 00:10:17,490
so the 5G has a real potential

239
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:22,490
to drive some energy efficiency
that devices will be,

240
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:24,790
the handheld devices that people use

241
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,610
will be using less computing power

242
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:28,420
and therefore their
batteries will last longer

243
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,020
because more of the computing power

244
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:35,000
with 5G and edge computing
moves to the edge,

245
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,530
closer to the device, but off the device.

246
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:39,020
So you look at these things and you say,

247
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:41,516
well, these are the promises
and the capabilities of 5G.

248
00:10:41,517 --> 00:10:44,160
And if I look at this through
the lens of a business person,

249
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,170
I'm gonna say, what can I do with this?

250
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:48,510
And that's great.

251
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:50,020
But again, for a security person

252
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:50,890
you have to say to yourself,

253
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:53,300
what can this possibly do to us?

254
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,349
So the first thing to understand

255
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:57,940
is some of the applications,
some of the business use cases

256
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:02,010
that are being championed
and developed right now.

257
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:03,630
We see it in some industries.

258
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:06,020
I mean, certainly all
industries are looking at

259
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:08,280
and if your organization
isn't evaluating 5G right now

260
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,310
you probably shouldn't
be, or you will be soon

261
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:12,270
but these are just some samples,

262
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:15,220
not just relegated to
just these industries,

263
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,740
but retail, manufacturing,
healthcare in particular

264
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,560
have been spending a lot of time working

265
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,453
with Verizon to evaluate 5G.

266
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,940
And we've always said this,
as a security or risk person,

267
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:26,960
you don't keep your head down.

268
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,150
You understand the business.

269
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:30,480
You make an effort to
understand the customers

270
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,530
and not just the technology or the risk.

271
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:34,189
You have to understand
the business context.

272
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:35,470
And if you're not doing that,

273
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:36,770
you're gonna have to do that more and more

274
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:40,160
because of digital
transformation driven by 5G

275
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,520
it's gonna change the things
that you're protecting.

276
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,890
So you have to understand what's driving

277
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:46,340
and motivating your internal customer

278
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:49,090
those business lines that are
pushing for this technology.

279
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:50,630
So in retail, you can see what some

280
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:52,580
of the market countless are.

281
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:55,140
The pressure to have supply
chain simplification.

282
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:58,783
The whole disruption to
e-commerce is over the last year,

283
00:11:59,805 --> 00:12:04,800
you got to pick up curbside
delivery or same day delivery

284
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,060
or go into a store that
doesn't have any employees

285
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,310
and you can check out with your phone.

286
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:11,069
Some of the use cases in retail

287
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:14,540
have to do with sensor-based
inventory management.

288
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:15,730
And what I'm getting at is that

289
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:18,310
5G will enable these use cases.

290
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:22,349
And they'll use new technologies
like massive sensors,

291
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:25,210
not big sensors, but
massive numbers of sensors

292
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:28,980
to gather data that can help
change the shopping experience

293
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:32,350
or change the warehouse
experience, video analytics, again

294
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:35,250
to help make better decisions
on the back end of business.

295
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:40,550
Robotics and automation will
be really supercharged by 5G.

296
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:42,520
And that's gonna fundamentally change

297
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,133
the manufacturing processes.

298
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:47,130
Artificial intelligence
and machine learning

299
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:50,350
is going to really help
with business intelligence

300
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:52,720
and accelerate certain
processes including security

301
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,440
which we'll get to and AR and VR,

302
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,580
that's augmented reality
and virtual reality.

303
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:00,900
You have both entertainment applications

304
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,819
as well as healthcare applications

305
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,430
and even manufacturing applications

306
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:07,569
where you can look at a
cat drawing and look at it

307
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:11,010
with augmented reality and
look at reality reality and see

308
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:14,183
whether or not the building
was built to the actual spec.

309
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,720
It makes a lot of stuff possible

310
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,590
that we haven't even thought about yet.

311
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:19,790
And the foundational technologies

312
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:22,849
underneath all of this
change and transformation is,

313
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:25,770
software defined
networking, IoT, said video,

314
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:29,430
intelligent video, telematics
and then what we do, security.

315
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:33,709
So knowing that the
change is gonna be driven

316
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:36,980
in the business line through
use cases helps security

317
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:39,380
and risk folks start to get their head

318
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:43,400
around potential upside
and downside of 5G.

319
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:47,640
And probably the simplest
use case to illustrate this

320
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,140
is the one that you
probably hear about a lot

321
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,507
but I think it is the most industrial.

322
00:13:51,507 --> 00:13:54,170
It has to do with autonomous cars.

323
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:57,069
So let's say that the
business that you're in

324
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,870
the C-level executives decide

325
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:01,868
that they're gonna disrupt
the transportation industry

326
00:14:01,868 --> 00:14:03,350
and they're gonna put a
million self-driving cars

327
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:06,360
on the road, and they want
customers in the backseat.

328
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:10,300
And that's being driven by AI
and 5G is enabling that car

329
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,030
to go down the highway 60 miles an hour

330
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,613
And you're sitting in a way that.

331
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,900
That for the business has a
tremendous amount of upside.

332
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,449
The rewards could be endless

333
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:21,550
but for you as a security person

334
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:25,920
you have to think about how
that use case could bring risk

335
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:29,160
and exposure to the organization.

336
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,579
So it's not about being cynical

337
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,380
or paranoid of the worst case scenario

338
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:35,300
but it is about thinking
about the worst case scenario.

339
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,709
It is about thinking about

340
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,570
what's the worst thing that could happen

341
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:40,220
and going backwards from that.

342
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:45,007
So with an autonomous car,
that's literally driven by 5G

343
00:14:45,007 --> 00:14:47,069
and the AI that's attached to it

344
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:49,150
and all the other stuff that goes into it.

345
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:52,300
If that system were to be compromised,

346
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,770
what would the ramifications be?

347
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:57,240
Well, it could literally
be the loss of human life.

348
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,990
You can have a car that
is virtually carjacked

349
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:03,550
and rolls over on the highway
or causes a major accident

350
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:06,709
or plows into a daycare
center, God forbid.

351
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:10,370
So, you've got to go backwards
from that worst case scenario

352
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:12,500
and that's an easy one to use

353
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,270
but if you extrapolate
that kind of thinking

354
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:17,890
out into other use cases
in your organization

355
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,310
and think about the worst
cases to go backwards.

356
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:23,900
It makes sense because it's gonna give you

357
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,660
a better perspective on what
might happen down the road,

358
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,719
smart cities, right?

359
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,480
The interconnectedness of water plants

360
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,890
and water treatment systems.

361
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:33,330
And if those do those get hacked,

362
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:38,330
if they become super charged
as it were, and really complex

363
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:42,000
and critical infrastructure,
because 5G makes that possible

364
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:46,860
then the security really
needs to be amped up

365
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:50,080
to make sure that that
worst case doesn't happen.

366
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,800
So what I wanna do though

367
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,530
is let's talk a little bit
more about 5G's background

368
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:58,470
before we really get to the
title of this topic, which was,

369
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:02,310
why 5G requires a new
approach to security.

370
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:04,329
But really quickly, edge
computing you've probably heard

371
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,130
a little bit about or
probably heard a lot about

372
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:09,720
but edge computing sort of
is one of the key components

373
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,310
of certainly Verizon's designed for 5G.

374
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:17,599
It is a technology that
provides the opportunity

375
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,160
to bring computing power
closer to the edge.

376
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,510
It takes the computing
power off the device.

377
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,740
So like, let's talk about
gaming for a minute.

378
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:28,140
You don't need a $10,000 super computer

379
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:32,689
to render incredible graphics
if that computing power

380
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:35,220
is done on the edge.

381
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:39,290
If that computing power
was done in the cloud,

382
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,780
you might have some
really cool graphics there

383
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:46,449
be it to have a latency
delivering those image back

384
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:49,440
to the machine what you're gaming on

385
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,500
so you kind of have a
buffering experience.

386
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:55,710
With 5G and MEC, again,
in the gaming context,

387
00:16:55,710 --> 00:17:00,710
you've taken the computing
tasks and burden off the device

388
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,137
and you've taken it from the core cloud

389
00:17:02,137 --> 00:17:04,319
and you moved it closer to the edge

390
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,619
through what we call
multi-access edge computing

391
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:10,280
which is a part of the
infrastructure of 5G.

392
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,170
And that is also going to
spur a tremendous amount

393
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:15,760
of innovation and imagination
in the business line.

394
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,593
So we don't really know.

395
00:17:16,593 --> 00:17:17,780
We're at the beginning of this right now.

396
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,060
We don't really know what use cases

397
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:22,300
are gonna come out of
this, which I think is,

398
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,109
one of the first approaches
that you need to change

399
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:28,679
in security is to improve
that collaboration

400
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,690
and improve that consultation
with the business lines

401
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:34,170
who are thinking about the future

402
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:37,690
to not run your security
program in isolation,

403
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:42,280
or as an oversight after
the fact kind of a function,

404
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:46,200
but that during the ideation,
during the planning phase,

405
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,120
during the evaluation of
new technology like 5G

406
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:54,689
and new applications
like the use of AR or VR

407
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:56,460
or autonomous cars or whatever

408
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,820
while the business is doing that.

409
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:01,220
Security should have a
seat at the table early

410
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:04,030
so they can understand the
potential security ramifications.

411
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:07,460
Now, if you're in a security
role, one of the first things

412
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,990
when a new technology comes
along with, you ask yourself

413
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:12,959
is this thing gonna be secure inherently?

414
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,060
Does it cause problems out of the box

415
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,320
or does it solve problems out of the box?

416
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,200
And what I wanna talk a little bit about

417
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,850
is just what comes with that.

418
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:25,653
So 5G was built with a lot
of security built into it.

419
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:31,206
It doesn't solve problems per
se, but it does solve a few,

420
00:18:31,207 --> 00:18:33,010
and it doesn't really create
them, it just is what it is,

421
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:37,379
but we've put sort of the DNA of 5G

422
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,440
a couple of different capabilities.

423
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,590
One of it is network slicing.

424
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:45,199
And this is sort of like a bigger version

425
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,550
of software defined network

426
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:50,740
where certain types of business processes,

427
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:53,470
certain types of data,
certain types of batches

428
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:58,580
of information are gonna
move across the 5G network

429
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:02,159
with different priorities, with
different security controls

430
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:07,160
around them to make sure that
critical services get priority

431
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:10,253
over things that could have lower latency.

432
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:12,360
Again, if you know anything

433
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,320
about software defined networking

434
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,870
it's just kind of that writ large.

435
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:20,510
And so network slicing is
something that can help you

436
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:22,610
not worry if you're a security person

437
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:26,360
about maybe the availability
of, or the quality of service

438
00:19:27,508 --> 00:19:30,277
of key applications that
are running on the network.

439
00:19:30,277 --> 00:19:31,150
I know that's not your primary concern

440
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:33,240
but availability is one of your concerns.

441
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,930
So knowing that network
splicing is built in

442
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:37,600
is one thing that you can like

443
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,233
not worry about outside the box.

444
00:19:42,137 --> 00:19:45,820
We're talking about this
security for 5G with four layers.

445
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:46,760
There's a physical layer.

446
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,960
There's the devices
themselves, the conductivity,

447
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,960
the routers and such that have
to have physical protection.

448
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:56,770
Typically, the carrier provides those

449
00:19:56,770 --> 00:20:01,770
but you can also consume
5G in a private context.

450
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:04,580
You can do private 5G on a factory floor

451
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,939
or on a company campus.

452
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,730
So the organization you, the security team

453
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:12,500
has to maybe expand your remit

454
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,970
or work more closely with
the physical security team

455
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:17,830
or inspection services
or whatever to make sure

456
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:20,540
that the physical attributes
of your 5G network

457
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,700
and particularly your private
5G network are secure.

458
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,200
They're not being tampered with.

459
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,550
Another layer is the transport layer.

460
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:30,070
5G is built out something
called the 3GPP standard.

461
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:31,850
It really basically just it's built

462
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:35,540
on the idea of Zero Trust and it demands

463
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:38,680
sort of continuous
authentication and authorization

464
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:42,630
where every component
within the network transport

465
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:45,050
with 5G that interacts with each other.

466
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:49,760
So it's just constant validation
that you are who you are

467
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,063
and you're doing what
you're supposed to be doing.

468
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,909
Security platform as a service at the edge

469
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:58,500
is another sort of layer of
security that 5G enables.

470
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,370
I'm gonna look at an example
of that in a few minutes.

471
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:03,250
And then just the
infrastructure itself like

472
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,960
with the cloud provider,

473
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,210
we call that infrastructure as code.

474
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:10,530
That's another layer of
security that comes with

475
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:12,910
is there is that cloud
component and the cloud security

476
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:15,950
that comes with the cloud
service is another thing that

477
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:19,190
you don't have to worry about
per se outside of the box.

478
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:22,270
This is a bit of an eye chart
and it's got a lot of acronyms

479
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:24,080
which we love in this industry,

480
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,960
but this is an example of how
you can use building blocks

481
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,030
to sort of transform your security program

482
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:32,940
as the business is transforming itself

483
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,640
because the network is
being transformed by 5G.

484
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,690
So that's an example.

485
00:21:38,767 --> 00:21:39,600
You can see on the circle up here,

486
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,860
these are some of the
security risks or concerns

487
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:47,379
that 5G can really eliminate
to a very large degree

488
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,310
because of the way it's built.

489
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:51,370
Man in the middle and
then signal storms and

490
00:21:51,371 --> 00:21:56,371
other types of texts there,
those really go way, way down

491
00:21:56,471 --> 00:21:59,370
in likelihood because of the mechanics

492
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:00,909
of the way 5G is built.

493
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:03,200
But on the backend, you're looking at

494
00:22:04,491 --> 00:22:05,520
using advanced threat detection

495
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,580
and manage detection and response tools

496
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:12,100
to do the sort of security
that you're doing today.

497
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,520
And then on the other
end, at the end point,

498
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,300
you've got your end point security

499
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:19,080
and you get your end point
detection and response security

500
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,240
but you can see in this chart

501
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,870
that it sort of pulls together
down at the bottom there

502
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:27,419
under reverse umbrella of
software defined perimeter

503
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:32,040
with QKD which is actually
quantum key distribution

504
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,840
and then MSI another acronym,

505
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,230
which is machine state integrity.

506
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:38,200
That's a combination of
some pretty powerful stuff.

507
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:41,370
Basically machine saying
integrity is like blockchain

508
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:46,010
that takes an image of the last
known good state of a device

509
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:50,480
and queries it next time
it's connected to make sure

510
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,693
that that device is,

511
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,530
the integrity of it is it's still intact.

512
00:22:55,530 --> 00:23:00,399
When you look at the 3GPP
standard and Zero Trust

513
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,240
that brings more security
in that transport layer

514
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,700
and the edge security that
you see in the middle there

515
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:11,810
gives you an opportunity to reevaluate

516
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:13,760
the deployment of some of your technology.

517
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,720
So over on the right here you see,

518
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,990
you've got end point
protections Zero Trust, SDP

519
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:22,490
VR, all those arrows and your quiver.

520
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:24,090
Some of those require

521
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:28,250
a more dedicated backend
infrastructure to support them

522
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:30,890
but some of those tools
can be deployed at the edge

523
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:34,183
to accelerate their
usefulness and their efficacy.

524
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:38,010
So again, I just want you to be aware that

525
00:23:39,953 --> 00:23:40,930
is not necessarily a downside

526
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:43,680
but with 5G as a security person

527
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,420
now you have an opportunity
to maybe take a look at

528
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:51,460
how your security
architecture is put together

529
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:54,640
and the relationships that
you have with the IT team,

530
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,450
the network team and the
business team as well

531
00:23:57,450 --> 00:23:59,840
in fusing together the operations

532
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,760
and the visibility into the threats

533
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,440
through the deployment of the
right places in the backend.

534
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,190
It is if the edge at the end point.

535
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:11,570
So, real quickly 5G transport security.

536
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:13,183
People worry, is it secure?

537
00:24:13,183 --> 00:24:16,270
When it comes to Zero Trust,
it's got TLS built in.

538
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:18,290
Again, we talked about network slicing.

539
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,360
Why is this important?

540
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,530
We know from our research
at Verizon, hopefully

541
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:24,870
you know the data breach
investigation report.

542
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:26,790
The DBIR, data breach
investigation reports

543
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:28,870
has been published for about 14 years now.

544
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:33,209
And the DBIR a year or two
ago gave us this data point

545
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:36,203
which is really interesting
and really kind of frightening.

546
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,939
We looked at the number of steps it takes

547
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:43,500
for criminals, bad guys to
cause either security incident

548
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,650
or security breach, a data breach.

549
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:48,100
And what we saw is that
most of the incidents

550
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,540
that were successful,
there were very few steps.

551
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:52,620
There were like two or three
steps leading one thing

552
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:53,820
and another thing, boom.

553
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:55,540
And the reason that was successful is

554
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,370
because the fewer steps that the bad guys

555
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:59,750
have to take once they
break into the network,

556
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:01,350
the less alarms are gonna trip

557
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:02,629
or the less likely they are going

558
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:05,293
to be discovered, detected.

559
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:08,020
We also know from the data
breach investigation report

560
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:10,170
over years and years, is that the time

561
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:14,760
between detection and response
is sometimes been months

562
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,800
sometimes weeks, sometimes days,

563
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,210
and you need to accelerate
and close that gap.

564
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:21,363
Now go back to the self-driving car.

565
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:24,870
If you're in a self-driving
car that gets hijacked

566
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:27,340
you don't want it to take 11 months

567
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:28,870
for the security team to realize

568
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:29,810
that the car has been hijacked

569
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:31,730
or already rolled over 10 times.

570
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:34,850
You want that to be really
pretty much near time,

571
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:36,340
near real-time excuse me.

572
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:40,470
So, what you can do with 5G is you can,

573
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:43,460
knowing that the bad guys work quickly

574
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:46,770
and that they're successful
in just a few steps,

575
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:51,210
you can use security platform
as a service at the edge

576
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:54,150
using 5G and using the MEC technology

577
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:57,270
to sort of deploy your resources,

578
00:25:57,270 --> 00:26:00,103
or your SIM on your network
detection and response tools

579
00:26:00,103 --> 00:26:05,103
you can use your behavior analysis tools

580
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:07,260
and the orchestration tools that you have

581
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:12,260
to more quickly deliver the
mitigation that you need

582
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:16,820
through automation
using the edge computing

583
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,270
which is getting you closer

584
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:20,540
to where the bad things are happening.

585
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,240
So there's a lot here,
but my point is that

586
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,330
if you are in the role and
you are evaluating security

587
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:30,070
know that 5G doesn't
create problems so much

588
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:31,600
as it creates some opportunities,

589
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,800
again for you to the architect

590
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:37,300
and redeploy the tools that you have

591
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:41,159
to more effectively achieve your outcome,

592
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:44,453
which is quicker detection
and quicker remediation.

593
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:48,060
So in summary, what I
really want you to take away

594
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:50,720
is that in essence security
in a 5G world is really

595
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,150
about accelerating efforts in four areas.

596
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:54,150
So we talk about,

597
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:57,470
designing and building
systems in new ways.

598
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:59,680
Embracing Zero Trust,
getting your head around

599
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:03,943
real network segmentation
on the 5G itself,

600
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:08,459
taking advantage of automation,
understanding the context

601
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,620
in which things are
happening, the context being

602
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:15,620
that risk based valuation of
a use case that could lead

603
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:19,543
to the deployment of
security controls or not.

604
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:23,889
The automation, first
of all is the ability

605
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:28,350
to speed up the detection and response

606
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:33,350
and the delivery of mitigating
controls to knock down a risk

607
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:37,200
or a threat or data
breach that's underway.

608
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,180
Contextual enrichment is understanding

609
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,640
as I said, the business lines,

610
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,770
understanding the use
cases and the criticality

611
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:46,670
of those applications that are running,

612
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:48,440
or the criticality of
the business processes

613
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:51,060
that are running and
whether or not they need

614
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:56,450
every security control
place or if they're low risk

615
00:27:56,450 --> 00:28:01,450
they could actually need less scrutiny.

616
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:03,930
You need to think about hygiene.

617
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:06,540
And this goes right
back to security basics.

618
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,570
5G doesn't take that away.

619
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:10,710
You have to think about your
assets, the asset registry

620
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:11,543
and that's a big thing.

621
00:28:11,543 --> 00:28:13,929
With 5G, you're gonna see an explosion

622
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:15,663
in assets, particularly IoT.

623
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,010
It's gonna be massive enablement

624
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:21,020
of devices connected to the network.

625
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:23,070
And if you don't have
a good asset registry

626
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:24,310
and if you don't have good visibility

627
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:26,690
into the firmware being updated

628
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:29,580
or the vulnerabilities on these assets

629
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:32,649
then you're not gonna have
a program that's secure

630
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:35,200
and you're gonna have a lot
of holes and vulnerabilities.

631
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,790
And again, you have to look at

632
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:40,840
if your asset state has
grown by leaps and bounds

633
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:43,510
and you have to look at them
for a risk based approach.

634
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:47,280
Some of those assets are
less risky than others,

635
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,530
and some are much more risky than others.

636
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:51,320
And finally, we have to look

637
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,270
at cybersecurity training and awareness

638
00:28:55,778 --> 00:28:56,611
in sort of in a hypertensive way.

639
00:28:56,611 --> 00:28:59,600
I guess you could say that 5G amplifies

640
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,629
the opportunity in the business.

641
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:05,960
5G also amplifies the
weaknesses that are inherent

642
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:06,890
in your program right now

643
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:09,770
or maybe the deficiencies
is a better word.

644
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:14,770
So the idea of corporate
culture where the collaboration

645
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:17,460
and the governance is there again,

646
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:20,120
to make sure that you as a security leader

647
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,550
are working with the business folks,

648
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:22,879
working with the network teams,

649
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,950
working with the IT infrastructure teams

650
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:28,673
in a collaborative way that
changes the entire organization.

651
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,080
So I just wanna wrap up
here by talking about

652
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,040
what I want you to do over
the next few weeks now

653
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,770
that you've heard some of this.

654
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:40,600
Next week I want you to
identify 5G stakeholders

655
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,350
and champions in your organization.

656
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:44,650
I want you to begin to
gauge their understanding

657
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:47,523
and perception of the role
of security in 5G adoption.

658
00:29:47,523 --> 00:29:49,770
What that means is who are the champions,

659
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:52,120
who are the executives
who are being hit up

660
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,629
from the outside to look at 5G,

661
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:56,510
are you as a security person included

662
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:58,847
in that 5G conversation,

663
00:29:58,847 --> 00:30:03,428
are the business lines so
enamored by the promise of 5G

664
00:30:03,428 --> 00:30:06,140
and 5G driven applications,
the shininess of it all

665
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:08,290
that they're gonna rush to innovate

666
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:12,340
and they're gonna outpace your
ability to secure that stuff

667
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:14,110
or at least vet it.

668
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:18,659
Make sure that you have that
population in your sites.

669
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,220
In the first three months
following this presentation

670
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,710
I also want you to begin to collaborate

671
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:24,410
with business leaders to
understand the use cases

672
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:26,130
and to do that worst
case scenario with them.

673
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:27,710
Again, not fear and certainly doubt

674
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:29,510
you don't wanna leave the department know

675
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:30,740
but you do want them to understand

676
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:34,220
that the logical words
conclusion is probably

677
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:36,460
the best place to start in
terms of building the risk

678
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,770
and then the security needed to guarantee

679
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:41,754
the successful deployment
of that technology.

680
00:30:41,754 --> 00:30:42,699
I also want you to leverage or establish

681
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:43,970
a governance framework to ensure

682
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:47,690
that security assessments take
place before and not after.

683
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:49,440
And then finally, within six months

684
00:30:50,528 --> 00:30:53,520
you should assess your
organization's ability to scale

685
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:57,750
it's a visibility of the attack
surface because there's more

686
00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:00,660
and more 5G devices
come on to the network.

687
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:02,820
If you're already
struggling with your ability

688
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:07,002
to get visibility into the
assets that you have out there

689
00:31:07,002 --> 00:31:08,940
that's gonna be amplified
more and more and more.

690
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:11,620
Can you integrate the
data from IoT devices

691
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:16,120
and from other devices that
are inspired and fueled by 5G?

692
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,620
Can you integrate those
into what you consider

693
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:22,139
your legacy security visibility effort.

694
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,730
The SIM, can you take in that data?

695
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:25,450
Can you contextualize it and put it

696
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:27,910
into the one big picture of security?

697
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:29,620
So there's a lot to think about.

698
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:32,979
Hopefully you're evaluating
slowly and deliberately

699
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:35,393
as the 5G infrastructure builds out,

700
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:39,700
but again, it does have an
impact and the word impact

701
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:42,610
is not inherently negative or positive.

702
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:44,600
It's just something that
needs to be understood,

703
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,500
to be managed.

704
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,677
And that way you can manage the risks

705
00:31:47,677 --> 00:31:50,060
but you can also realize rewards.

706
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:51,270
So I wanna thank you again.

707
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:53,150
Also, hopefully you can
ask me some questions

708
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:54,810
which we're gonna get to at the end here

709
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:57,213
but thank you very much
for joining me today.
