1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:02,900
- Hello everyone, and welcome to

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:05,560
our session on Zero Trust Security.

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:06,670
My name is Shawn Bass.

4
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:09,280
I'm the CTO for End-User
Computing at VMware.

5
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,920
And I'm joined here with my colleague Pere

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,300
from the Networking and Security
Business Unit at VMware.

7
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,190
This session is gonna be all about

8
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:18,870
Zero Trust Best Practices.

9
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:21,190
We're not gonna be talking
about products necessarily,

10
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:23,050
we're talking about the principles

11
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:25,360
behind enabling Zero Trust Security

12
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,550
that you can apply in your organization.

13
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:28,980
And moreover, how you should be thinking

14
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,790
about Zero Trust Security, not
in a silo or a piece parts,

15
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:35,089
but how all the connected
tissue comes together

16
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:38,440
to achieve Zero Trust in the enterprise.

17
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,559
So with that, I wanna talk a little bit

18
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,550
about how things have
changed in the history

19
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:47,000
of application architectures
and cloud computing

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,660
and networks and all
these types of things.

21
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,300
So I think it's really important

22
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,089
for us to first identify
what's been changing

23
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:55,410
with how technology works in order for us

24
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:56,793
to understand how we need to be thinking

25
00:00:56,793 --> 00:00:59,600
about defense in a slightly different way.

26
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,060
So the first thing I'd like to say is,

27
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,923
in a traditional three tier
application architecture,

28
00:01:04,923 --> 00:01:08,565
we used to protect these with
typical North South firewalls

29
00:01:08,565 --> 00:01:10,487
and we'd applied security
and the workload.

30
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:13,339
And we think about it in
a pretty simplistic way,

31
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:16,190
but over time, application architectures

32
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:17,600
have changed dramatically.

33
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,179
We've gone from simple three
tier application architecture

34
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,420
that are contained
inside singular servers,

35
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:24,090
we've moved into microservices,

36
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,630
multi VM architectures containers.

37
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:29,630
And this has created
a lot more opportunity

38
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:32,030
for there to be security vulnerabilities

39
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:32,877
in all the different piece parts

40
00:01:32,877 --> 00:01:35,759
of the application architecture.

41
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:39,000
In addition, when we think
about the data center itself,

42
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
we used to just have a
single data center to worry

43
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,330
about protecting the four
walls of the data center.

44
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:45,740
And over time, of course,
that has now exploded out

45
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:48,640
into multiple different public clouds,

46
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,180
enabling hybrid cloud connectivity.

47
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,290
And this is of course
resulted in more opportunity

48
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:58,374
for application infrastructure
and data to be exposed

49
00:01:58,374 --> 00:02:01,205
and exploited in multiple
different places.

50
00:02:01,206 --> 00:02:04,540
In addition, when we think
about how people connect in

51
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,860
to our data center and cloud applications,

52
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:10,020
the architecture of the
traditional branch office

53
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,930
has changed quite dramatically.

54
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:14,680
We've moved from a
traditional corporate office

55
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,700
and branch office scenario to really this

56
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:20,399
distributed workforce where we
have multimodal work styles,

57
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,480
we've got people working
on corporate devices,

58
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,600
personal devices, there's
this whole new market

59
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,489
of the gig economy where
people might be working

60
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:29,250
for multiple different companies

61
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,830
on different types of assets.

62
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:33,440
And that's really created
a new set of challenges

63
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,690
around how we secure our
applications and data

64
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:39,560
in these different modes of work styles.

65
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,580
And so really where there
was possibly a perimeter

66
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,310
in the past that we can worry
about defending the four walls

67
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:48,020
and that perimeter is
completely dissolved.

68
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,830
We really have to be thinking about

69
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:52,400
this new modern shape of digital business

70
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,850
and applying security everywhere

71
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:57,710
that our applications and data reside.

72
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,650
So when we think about
that, what we've really done

73
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:03,690
with all of these changes to
the application architecture

74
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:06,440
and data center and branch
offices, is that we've

75
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:10,170
really introduced this
attack surface explosion.

76
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:12,780
There are opportunities to exploit

77
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,119
end users and their identity

78
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,640
through phishing attacks
and credential theft,

79
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,950
we've got opportunities
to attack the end points

80
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,179
both at the edge the end user is using

81
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:25,140
as well as in the cloud
and in the data center.

82
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,250
And of course, there's misconfigurations

83
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,660
in cloud applications.

84
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,665
You read in the news all
the time about companies

85
00:03:30,665 --> 00:03:33,609
who have misconfigured
permissions on their data storage,

86
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:37,518
that then data gets stolen
from those misconfigurations.

87
00:03:37,518 --> 00:03:41,260
So there are lots of
opportunities to increase security

88
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,340
but equally increased number

89
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,930
of opportunities for attackers to exploit.

90
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,440
And I'd like to touch on as well.

91
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,560
Since COVID-19, we've
seen all this workforce

92
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,660
move from being in the office
to now working from home

93
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:56,090
and that's resulted in
a significant amount

94
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:59,130
of increases of attacks on
remote access infrastructure,

95
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:02,890
like classic VPNs, as well
as attackers that are trying

96
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:06,670
to attack the whole worker's
devices and then using those

97
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,769
as pivot points into
the corporate network.

98
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:10,960
So it's really given
us a lot to think about

99
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,825
how we need a new approach to security.

100
00:04:13,825 --> 00:04:16,510
And that new approach is
really how could think

101
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:19,820
about utilizing the concepts of Zero Trust

102
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:22,450
to secure this distributed enterprise.

103
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:25,560
And Zero Trust is really a
way for us to think about

104
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,830
all those different attack points,

105
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:31,880
what can I do to drive a
better level of security

106
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,490
in order to understand,
rather than assuming I have

107
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:36,710
implicit trust of an endpoint device,

108
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,380
an implicit trust of a corporate network.

109
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:42,540
I need ways to be able to
validate is this device

110
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:45,780
actually as trustworthy as I think it is.

111
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,900
Is the user who they say they are,

112
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:51,679
can they prove their identity
to my infrastructure?

113
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,220
What level of access should
I grant to my end users?

114
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,570
How do I protect my data?

115
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:59,330
How do I get granular restricted access

116
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:02,233
to my applications and data
in my data center or cloud?

117
00:05:02,233 --> 00:05:05,800
And how do I prevent lateral
movement of an attacker

118
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,973
if they do happen to compromise
one of these attack points.

119
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:13,480
And so we really need to start thinking

120
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,340
about this picture
holistically and recognize

121
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,739
that there are opportunities

122
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:20,560
to apply levels of
security controls at each

123
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,350
and every one of these
pieces of the infrastructure.

124
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:27,510
And while I can view each
one of these attack vectors

125
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:32,510
as an individual island of
security, when I start thinking

126
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:35,659
about how the context
of all of these points

127
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:38,810
adds up as an attack
unfolds, that gives me a much

128
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:42,520
greater ability to pinpoint
an attack as it unfolds.

129
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,530
So having the ability to
look at the data contextually

130
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:47,135
from one point to the next,

131
00:05:47,136 --> 00:05:49,130
how was the end user device being used?

132
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:51,300
What identity are they
authenticating with?

133
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,230
What network transport
are they going across?

134
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:55,030
And what security can I apply there?

135
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:58,059
And then what application
backend are they talking to?

136
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,720
And how can I apply security controls

137
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,970
at every level to give
me a more holistic view

138
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:04,800
of the end user as they progress

139
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,900
through the data center and
cloud application architecture.

140
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:11,130
So we need to be thinking about
this in a distributed sense

141
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:11,963
and we need to be thinking

142
00:06:11,963 --> 00:06:14,110
about how we can correlate activities

143
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:15,710
at each one of these control points

144
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:18,640
to improve the overall security posture.

145
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:22,130
And while we're not gonna talk
about products specifically,

146
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:25,570
I do wanna talk about areas
of focus for Zero Trust

147
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:27,360
that we need to be thinking about.

148
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,890
Zero Trust is all about End-to-End
visibility and analytics

149
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:34,469
and most importantly,
the ability to automate

150
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:38,450
and orchestrate response across
these different dimensions.

151
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:41,630
And a lot of times when you
think about Zero Trust Security,

152
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:43,360
people tend to take a very

153
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,740
user identity centric point of view,

154
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:48,850
that it's all about
identity conditional access

155
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:50,250
and endpoint device posture.

156
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:53,387
But I think if we only
focused on the end user device

157
00:06:53,387 --> 00:06:57,090
and the end user identity,
we miss an entire portion

158
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:59,280
of the Zero Trust puzzle, where we think

159
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,969
about the network transport
that connects the user

160
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:04,707
to the applications in
the data center or cloud.

161
00:07:04,707 --> 00:07:06,527
And then what happens
within the data center

162
00:07:06,527 --> 00:07:10,669
and cloud to further enhance
and secure the principles

163
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:13,090
in the application architecture itself.

164
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:16,500
And having the ability to
tie the end user identity

165
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,660
is a common thread all the way

166
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,160
through these four different
stacks really gives us

167
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,680
a lot of capability to link activities

168
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,490
of the user into the
data center and cloud,

169
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:28,660
that gives us much better visibility.

170
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,650
And it gives us more context

171
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:33,000
about the type of
behaviors that are normal

172
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,600
and the type of behaviors
that are abnormal.

173
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,670
And that allows us to then further secure

174
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:39,290
and protect these resources.

175
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:42,330
So I'd like to take a
brief moment to talk about

176
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:45,469
what an End-to-End Zero Trust
Architecture looks like,

177
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:48,450
in terms of all of the
piece parts that make it up.

178
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:51,390
And to do so, I wanna bring
my colleague Pere to talk

179
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:52,960
about a Zero Trust Architecture

180
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,729
from an End-to-End point of view

181
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:56,670
and all the piece parts
that come into that.

182
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,530
Pere please join me.

183
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:00,342
- Thanks Shawn, and as you can see,

184
00:08:00,343 --> 00:08:02,450
based on what Shawn is explaining,

185
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:04,490
there's a lot from abide from Zero Trust.

186
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,320
When we are talking
about how do we transform

187
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,960
the security models
going from an endpoint,

188
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,890
to an application, to
how the network reacts.

189
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:14,900
So there's multiple layers
that we have to uncover.

190
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,830
As Shawn was mentioning,
everything starts by identity.

191
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,349
And if you think right
now, we have a model

192
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:22,170
of what identity is
understood in two dimensions.

193
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:25,290
One on the user side, what
we understand the identity

194
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:28,310
of the user and the attributes
associated to the user,

195
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,750
the other, we are going to discuss

196
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,880
about the identity of applications

197
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:35,250
and how applications from
IP addresses to labels,

198
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,000
to certificates, to names,

199
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,919
how identity is a fundamental concept

200
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:41,110
of this endpoint strategy.

201
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:44,450
Now, as we focus on
provisioning those applications

202
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:46,140
of those users in the network,

203
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,819
then there's the multiple
layers of enforcement.

204
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:52,090
And as Shawn was mentioning
in this End-to-End approach,

205
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:54,240
basically the parameters
have completely disappeared

206
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,690
and now we are living in this notion

207
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:59,540
of decentralize and fully
scale out enforcement.

208
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,368
This is what essentially
the Zero Trust Architecture

209
00:09:01,369 --> 00:09:04,719
has to know what are they user
is, what the application is.

210
00:09:04,719 --> 00:09:06,359
And as you can see the picture of starting

211
00:09:06,359 --> 00:09:08,919
from the bottom layers
of how do we connect

212
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:12,247
and when from an internet
connectivity point of view,

213
00:09:12,248 --> 00:09:15,969
or how do we go up the
stack from a encryption

214
00:09:15,969 --> 00:09:18,787
or authentication
authorization at the API level,

215
00:09:18,787 --> 00:09:20,610
The perimeter centerlink
has been decomposed

216
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:22,759
into this end point model that has

217
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:24,540
to run essentially anywhere,

218
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:28,230
anywhere meaning from on
the left side, any device,

219
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:32,010
any home, any office, any
place where an application

220
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:33,790
when a user may want to connect.

221
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,599
And on the right side
essentially any cloud,

222
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,860
private or public, what
applications may leave

223
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,600
in any form factor.

224
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,440
Now that's all good, but in some cases

225
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,070
it's not completely possible.

226
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:44,870
And this is where, for example,

227
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:49,200
in cases of IOT or in devices
or in your own device,

228
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,340
certain capabilities may not be possible

229
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,030
because of power consumption
or CPUs and so on.

230
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:56,220
And this is what then the
reason to stop is your

231
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,180
what do you put this
distributed enforcement point?

232
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,930
And there's always a
strategy to put it based

233
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:04,819
on the end points or in points
of presence in the network.

234
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,690
And this is what we have seen is

235
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,470
from a Zero Trust point of view,

236
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:11,570
a proliferation of this bi-modal wall

237
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:13,340
where we have this unfortunate points

238
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,950
at the end points of the application,

239
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:17,550
as well as in the in the
bottom of the network.

240
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,670
But going to what Shawn was mentioning,

241
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,060
the architecture is not complete

242
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,569
by not understanding
the End-to-End posture

243
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:26,560
of devices, users,
applications on how they behave

244
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,469
and how they essentially
move from understanding

245
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:31,570
the policy aspect to a more

246
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:34,620
subtle understanding of risk management.

247
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:37,270
And this is why we go
towards the analytics plane.

248
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:40,810
So it's not enough to understand
identity and enforcement.

249
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:42,689
And now we have to focus on understanding

250
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:45,490
how all the analytics
essentially that we had collected

251
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:47,800
in a holistic way to
understand what sort overall

252
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,829
this posture of this
endpoint architecture.

253
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:52,690
And as you can see, this is
a space that traditionally

254
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:56,430
has been done by multiple
solutions, components,

255
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:58,729
spokes, and so on and openness

256
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:00,620
and a third-party integration framework

257
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:02,340
is very important to essentially deliver

258
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,010
this implant architectures.

259
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:05,210
Okay Shawn, back to you.

260
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:08,047
- Thank you, Pere.

261
00:11:08,047 --> 00:11:09,650
So Pere talked about what

262
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:11,530
an End-to-End solution might look like.

263
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:13,360
And there's a lot of technologies

264
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,810
and products that make that up.

265
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:17,540
And I wanna maybe spend a
little bit of time deep diving

266
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:20,310
into the end user space where my business

267
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:22,869
spends most of our time and talk about,

268
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:24,990
what are the constructs of user identity

269
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:27,800
and device security that are utilized

270
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,530
as inputs into a Zero Trust Architecture?

271
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:32,670
So we talk user identity of course,

272
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,540
we're talking about
things like authentication

273
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:37,319
and authorization and user behavior

274
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,330
and a multi-factor authentication,

275
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:42,170
single sign on, all of
those types of concepts.

276
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:44,310
And then from a device
security point of view,

277
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:45,709
we've got to think about,

278
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:47,630
how do we ensure that
this device is secure?

279
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:50,360
How can it be determined if it's trusted

280
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,510
and whether it's compliant with
corporate security policies?

281
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:56,100
So what I'd like to do is dig a little bit

282
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:00,130
into what the goal is
around end user device

283
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:03,361
and end user identity
at a station or trust.

284
00:12:03,361 --> 00:12:06,319
At the end of the day,
our goal is to make sure

285
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,190
that all of our users can
access the critical applications

286
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:12,720
and data that they need to do their job

287
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,920
from any device they happen
to have in their possession.

288
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,530
It shouldn't matter if
it's a Windows device,

289
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,449
a Mac device, an Android device,

290
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:22,780
the device they use should be irrelevant.

291
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,209
What we really need to do is make sure

292
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:26,790
that we can trust that level of access

293
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:29,360
by doing some form of device compliance

294
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,560
or device posture at a station,

295
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,239
and then through a
layered defense approach,

296
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,970
how can we ensure that this
device and user combination

297
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:41,540
is secure for the right
level of application access?

298
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:44,069
So we think about device compliance,

299
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:46,850
this is things that a
lot of different products

300
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:47,693
do this in different ways,

301
00:12:47,693 --> 00:12:50,730
but the end goal is to make sure

302
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:53,360
that this device seems trustworthy.

303
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,490
Now, every company will
have different levels

304
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:58,570
of compliance rules, what they
deemed trustworthy or not,

305
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:01,840
but some of the common things
we see people look for is,

306
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,150
what operating system
is this device running?

307
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,020
Is it an operating system
that's been produced

308
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:09,179
by the vendor within
the last six, 12 months?

309
00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:11,209
Because if the device
is two years out of date

310
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:13,970
and operates system standards,
maybe that's a criteria

311
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:16,070
for us to say, I'm
sorry, your device is not

312
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:19,960
acceptable to access our
applications and data.

313
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,780
Likewise, you might use other
things like the patch status,

314
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:25,819
is this thing missing critical
security vulnerabilities

315
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:28,030
that are being actively
exploited in the wild.

316
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:29,300
And I might wanna consider

317
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,569
this device not trustworthy enough.

318
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:35,140
It may be things like is the
device have a firewall enabled,

319
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,120
is it have disc encryption?

320
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,860
And all of these things
will enter into the policy

321
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,290
that your company needs to set to define,

322
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:45,560
what do you deem as a trustworthy device?

323
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,800
So outside the device
compliance, we also have to think

324
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,229
about things like identity
and access management.

325
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:54,030
This is typically where things
like conditional access,

326
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:56,589
single sign-on, identity federation,

327
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:58,940
multifactor authentication come into play.

328
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:03,130
So this is me proving that the
user is who they say they are

329
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:05,610
and I've not had a credential theft

330
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:08,890
or somebody impersonating my
user, that I have mechanisms

331
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,242
to prove that they are in
fact who they say they are.

332
00:14:11,243 --> 00:14:13,510
This can also come through in some cases

333
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:16,410
not just traditional
multi-factor authentication

334
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:19,300
with a token mechanism,
but it may be utilizing

335
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,819
hardware security keys to enforce

336
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,610
that this is in fact user in
possession of those devices.

337
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:29,120
And then the identity and access
policy may also vary based

338
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,640
on the criticality of the
application I'm exposing.

339
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,970
For instance, I may not care that much

340
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:36,680
if somebody signs into my time card system

341
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:40,199
and enters in their hours
if their endpoint devices

342
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,090
deemed a little bit risky.

343
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,800
I may care dearly if
they're trying to access

344
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,040
an HR system or a financial system.

345
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,390
So the level of
criticality, the application

346
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:52,930
and data should enter into
your Zero Trust criteria.

347
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:55,959
Now, how they get to applications

348
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:59,050
particularly those that are
located in your private cloud

349
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:00,709
or in a public cloud resource,

350
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:02,450
we need to be thinking about how we ensure

351
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:04,640
that transport of that data.

352
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,390
And what a lot of organizations are doing

353
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:08,770
as part of their Zero
Trust journey is saying,

354
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:13,370
can I move away from
device based VPN solutions

355
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,370
that transmit all the network traffic

356
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:16,670
to my end user devices

357
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:19,140
to my data center or cloud resources.

358
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:21,720
And can I move to more of
a granular per app tunnel

359
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,090
or one of the micro segment
of one to reduce the risk

360
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:28,070
that if one of these devices
does become compromised,

361
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:31,590
I'm not risking the integrity
of my corporate data center

362
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:34,640
or my cloud applications and resources.

363
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,860
I wanna speak a bit about
risk analytics as well.

364
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:40,680
We can enforce a certain
level of device compliance,

365
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:44,180
but we always wanna be on the
lookout for behavioral changes

366
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:46,699
with the device or with the user identity

367
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:49,420
to reflect the potential
thing, we might have to change

368
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,569
our level of response based on it.

369
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:54,560
So one example of this
could be a user's identity

370
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,660
starts getting group forced,
a log in attempts against it.

371
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,089
I might wanna raise the risk level

372
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:01,160
for that user and treat them differently.

373
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,490
Maybe provide some additional
challenge responses

374
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:05,500
to prove they are who they say they are,

375
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,330
or if a particular
endpoint device looks risky

376
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:10,290
because of the presence of some software

377
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:12,959
whether it's malware or
remote access Trojan,

378
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:16,050
I might want to disqualify
that device from having access

379
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:18,140
to different applications
in my environment

380
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:20,819
until that device can be
brought into remediation.

381
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,250
Now, while we're speaking
about remediation,

382
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,400
it's really important that we have ways

383
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,360
of responding to risk
conditions on devices.

384
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,730
Those responses can be something

385
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:31,880
as simple as notifying the user

386
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,610
you can't use this device
to access the resources,

387
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:37,100
or it may be a notification
to user that says,

388
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,840
in order to access these resources,

389
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,800
you have to take this action
if it's a BYOB device,

390
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,300
you need to turn your firewall on.

391
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:47,050
You need to update your
security patches or your OS.

392
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:49,469
Or if it's a solution
or an end point device

393
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:51,940
the company manages, you may just go take

394
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:55,330
those remediations automatically
by updating the software,

395
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:57,750
applying the patches,
enabling the firewall,

396
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,060
things of that nature.

397
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,209
And then the last thing
I'd like to say is,

398
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:05,960
Zero Trust cannot be done
by one entity or one vendor.

399
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:09,460
It's really a team sport
that needs to be done

400
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:11,490
through multiple different
layers of technology

401
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:13,579
that may come from
multiple different vendors.

402
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:15,530
So we always gotta be thinking about

403
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:18,339
the interoperability of
the security ecosystem.

404
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:20,500
How can we get threat
data from our endpoint

405
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,750
protection vendor or our
cloud access security broker

406
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,550
or a mobile threat defense vendor

407
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:27,180
and just that threat data

408
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:30,930
and then use that to drive
automated remediations

409
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:33,670
or automated notifications
to different teams

410
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:37,250
to then respond to those
security events accordingly.

411
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:40,040
And then I think the last
thing I wanna talk about is

412
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:43,190
what do we need to be
thinking about when we think

413
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:46,840
about device compliance and
conditional access to resources.

414
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,669
And this is just a smattering
of different examples

415
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:52,500
that you might use in your qualifications

416
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,540
of how you define your
Zero Trust access policies.

417
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,770
And I'll just pick on a
couple here to talk about.

418
00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:00,600
If I think about users,

419
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,240
what group memberships are they part of?

420
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,210
What things do they have access to?

421
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:06,730
Should I treat every user the same way

422
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:09,740
whether it's the CEO of a
company or a software developer.

423
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,770
It had different granular policies

424
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:13,840
based on the role and responsibility

425
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,449
of that user or what
groups they're a member of.

426
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:19,710
I may look at things like
risk factors on devices.

427
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:23,040
If a device is a bring
your own device situation,

428
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,570
maybe I wanna give her a restricted set

429
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:27,300
of access to a virtual
application instance

430
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,490
or only browser-based applications

431
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:32,670
and not give them access to
native application experiences

432
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:35,060
if I don't have a good way of controlling

433
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:37,580
the DLP or security
controls around the data

434
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:40,100
that resides on that device.

435
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,669
You also might wanna think
about things like location,

436
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:45,180
whether somebody is on a corporate Wi-Fi

437
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,520
or off of a corporate Wi-Fi.

438
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,889
We see a lot of examples in retail

439
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:52,220
or healthcare where certain
applications may be permitted

440
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:55,290
when you're on that secure
wireless environment,

441
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:56,982
the minute you move off of it,

442
00:18:56,982 --> 00:18:58,860
there might be a
requirement to remove access

443
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:01,649
to those applications or
remove a subset of data

444
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:04,290
or apps from a device
because it's deemed risky.

445
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:06,820
Or people traveling to certain regions,

446
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:09,010
you might wanna lock
out certain applications

447
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:10,660
when they're in certain countries

448
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,690
or regions that you don't trust

449
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:15,560
that those devices are not
potentially being compromised.

450
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,669
So all of these criteria
around both device posture

451
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:21,510
or device at a station
and conditional access

452
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:23,750
are all factors you
should be thinking about

453
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:26,410
when you draft your Zero Trust policies

454
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:29,360
and be conscious of the
opportunities that it provides you

455
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,679
to have an additional
set of security controls

456
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,300
that you can apply to a user and a device

457
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:37,419
as they enter your Zero
Trust Architecture.

458
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:39,460
Now, I'd like to do is turn
it over to my colleague Pere

459
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,950
to spend a little bit more time talking

460
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:43,627
about the network transport
and the data center

461
00:19:43,627 --> 00:19:46,760
and cloud network controls,
and what we can do from an app

462
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,990
and workload security level and
how all that comes together.

463
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:51,780
So Pere over to you.

464
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:52,613
- So thanks Shawn.

465
00:19:52,613 --> 00:19:55,050
As Shawn was mentioning,
now we are going to switch

466
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:57,936
at the network aspect of Zero Trust.

467
00:19:57,936 --> 00:19:59,949
And this is going to be the
element of what we can do

468
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,670
a lot of enforcement capabilities,

469
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:04,270
and we'll cover how the
network and the endpoint

470
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:06,800
are part of this architecture.

471
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,370
So first let's summarize why

472
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:10,929
the core network status is not working.

473
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:13,180
And if you think in terms of
the traditional techniques

474
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:15,870
in terms of how to connect
from a device to the network,

475
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:19,530
a lot of times we tend
to use VPN technologies.

476
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:21,840
Now, apart from VPNs, we have firewalls

477
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,679
and we have like ideas devices

478
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,060
and now we have cloud and multicloud.

479
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:28,050
And what became obvious
was that essentially

480
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:31,520
this heterogeneity of environments
and products that we had

481
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,710
within our networks
created a lots of silos

482
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:37,490
a lot of operational points
and lack of visibility.

483
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:40,180
Now, if we factor that the
fact that we are trying

484
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:42,460
to accelerate innovation
in our enterprises,

485
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,870
bring agility, bring
application modernization

486
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:47,219
with CSED pipelines and get ops.

487
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,910
Centrally transforming
the way we deliver value,

488
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:52,750
those technologies are no longer feasible.

489
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,870
We cannot anymore set up a VPN

490
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:56,260
to connect two clouds together.

491
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,660
Different developers can deploy

492
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:00,170
an automated pipeline
and things like that.

493
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:01,970
So now when we start thinking in terms of

494
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:06,020
how the network has to change
to provide security models,

495
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:08,280
we have to figure out
not only the controls

496
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,360
and policy enforcement
point and capabilities

497
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:13,090
that we traditionally
have thought that we need,

498
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:15,050
but we have to think in
terms of how that value

499
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:16,580
gets delivered in terms of management,

500
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:20,020
in terms of operations, in
terms of endpoint visibility.

501
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,480
And if we go back to the core model

502
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:25,420
of fragmentation, multiple
products, multiple controls,

503
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:27,810
all these things are getting into our way

504
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:30,360
of automation realization and security.

505
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,310
So it's explore what we
can do, or what we see

506
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:36,580
in terms of Zero Trust
Architecture implemental steps.

507
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:39,320
Now, from a connectivity point of view,

508
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,030
or from a networking point of view,

509
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:43,110
there's always two sides of the equation.

510
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:45,879
The first one is going to
be what are they users are?

511
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,120
And the second is going to
be work application lives,

512
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,260
and how we bring the two together.

513
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,073
So let's focus first
on what the users are.

514
00:21:53,413 --> 00:21:54,380
And as Shawn was mentioning,

515
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:56,635
there's a lot combined the users.

516
00:21:56,635 --> 00:21:58,760
There's a lot of the
aspects of user behavior,

517
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,780
user identity, device
management, device posture.

518
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,720
But the first thing from
a networking point of view

519
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,930
that comes to well is,

520
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:08,190
how do I provide a consistent experience

521
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:11,180
between users anywhere they are?

522
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:13,430
And by users, we mean, for example,

523
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:16,610
you have a branch office,
you have an industrial floor,

524
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:19,100
you have a person working from home

525
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:23,560
or somebody working from a
device in a remote location.

526
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,179
So the first thing that we have to bring

527
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:27,220
into this network connectivity

528
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,220
or consistent network connectivity

529
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:34,140
is this notion of the
Zero Trust network access.

530
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:37,690
And how do we bring
homogeneity between what we see

531
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:41,180
in the brand and qualms
with what is in the devices.

532
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:43,350
And this is what we achieve
with this type of technologies

533
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:48,280
of we want secure access and
how do we bring consistency

534
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:52,420
in the form of PoPs in the
network point of present.

535
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:54,330
Now, the good thing about
introducing these points

536
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:57,210
of present is that essentially
allows us to normalize

537
00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:00,050
the access that you get
from all those devices,

538
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:03,680
regardless on what flavor and
what location they come from.

539
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,210
Now that we have to normalize that,

540
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:07,000
we can actually start thinking in terms

541
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,210
of how to be security
capabilities into our stops.

542
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:12,930
Now if you think it's not just

543
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:16,090
bringing security capabilities
because we are used to that,

544
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:18,899
is because now as the traffic
flows with this network,

545
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,860
we want to avoid (indistinct).

546
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:23,139
Secondly, we want to
avoid latency problems,

547
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:26,510
networking problems, so bringing
all the solution together

548
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:29,643
in this Zero Trust Architecture
allows us essentially

549
00:23:29,643 --> 00:23:31,990
to provide the most efficient

550
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:36,090
and easy to bike security
and connectivity solution.

551
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:37,290
Now, as we discussed,

552
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:39,050
it's not just about the enforcement point,

553
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:40,120
it's about the visibility.

554
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,330
It's about the aspects of troubleshooting

555
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:43,480
when a system doesn't work.

556
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,753
It's understanding user behavior,

557
00:23:44,753 --> 00:23:47,040
it's understanding traffic flows

558
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,320
and changes into our patterns.

559
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,550
And this is what we achieve essentially

560
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:52,060
by putting a monitoring solution

561
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:54,990
that comes together in all these elements.

562
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:58,000
Now, the third aspect is this notion

563
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
of how do we manage that?

564
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,260
Do we offer it as a service,
a collection of products

565
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:05,540
and the moment we go towards
Zero Trust Architectures,

566
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:08,100
we tend to see that the
manageability aspect certainly

567
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,800
is an aspect of this
solution is primordial

568
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,909
to provide the proper HR environment.

569
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:16,880
So this is where we see the security

570
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,060
and connectivity converts
into these environments.

571
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:23,120
Now at the same time, the
spots are not just useful

572
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,219
to bring consistency into
the users, but we see a lot

573
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,810
of new innovations and a
lot of interesting things

574
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:31,290
happening into the
multicloud connectivity.

575
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:34,040
Now, multicloud connectivity
again, has two components

576
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,853
the networking and the security.

577
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:40,200
The security becomes this
notion of how to normalize

578
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,450
the onboarding or boarding
of all these clouds.

579
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:46,540
And this is another area
that a lot of opportunities

580
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:49,790
on these Zero Trust
SASE PoP architectures.

581
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:51,440
Now, if we try to bring it together,

582
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,950
essentially what we are seeing is that

583
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:56,140
we have to provide this
End-to-End thinking

584
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:58,270
that Shawn was talking about before.

585
00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:01,300
We have to bring this
aspect of a secure solution

586
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:04,840
that regardless of where the
devices and applications are,

587
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:08,889
we provide End-to-End across
any location security.

588
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:11,200
Now, the partner precise goal is that

589
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,360
we cannot provide security
without the entity.

590
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,699
And now as we get into
these identity systems,

591
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:20,800
now we bring the fact that when
boundaries have disappeared,

592
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,960
we have to start thinking how

593
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,020
the network sends changes from let's say,

594
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:27,131
End-to-End encryption when
I'm doing inspections one.

595
00:25:27,131 --> 00:25:29,020
So this is where identity is going to be

596
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:32,502
one of the pillars of this
Zero Trust transformation.

597
00:25:32,502 --> 00:25:34,720
And it has lots of
implications on how we design

598
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,472
and how we factor the
network into this solution.

599
00:25:38,472 --> 00:25:40,960
The second aspect is policy.

600
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,630
As Shawn was mentioning
there's many forms of policy.

601
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:45,040
We could start thinking
of now with all the things

602
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,270
that we can gather from the
network from the end points,

603
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:49,330
from the devices, we can start thinking

604
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:52,330
in terms of forms of attribute
based access control.

605
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:55,080
Essentially provide very
fine granular control points

606
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,820
in an important fashion.

607
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:59,100
But as we discuss, we
have to start thinking

608
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,523
in terms of risk and risk management.

609
00:26:01,523 --> 00:26:04,010
The network is becoming
so broad and so extended

610
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:06,210
across let's say the whole geography

611
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:07,640
where applications are used, I believe.

612
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,900
And now we have to start
thinking how policy

613
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,430
and risk management
start to play together,

614
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:14,162
And how the networks enforcement point

615
00:26:14,162 --> 00:26:16,860
essentially can start
operating not only based

616
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:20,409
on the clarity from
formally defined policies,

617
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:22,990
that have essentially a
black-and-white behavior.

618
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:25,810
Now we start thinking in terms
of more what's the impact

619
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:28,654
if this security incident that happened

620
00:26:28,654 --> 00:26:30,880
in broad environments and how do we start

621
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,760
in these risk controls and
the endpoint understanding

622
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,890
into how the network centrally helps

623
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:37,590
prevent all the tech form of that.

624
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:40,210
And as we start shifting
towards the right,

625
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:42,330
we arrive to the multicloud
and this takes us

626
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:46,300
to the second part of the Zero
Trust networking discussion

627
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:49,030
which is when we start
seeing how the applications

628
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:51,180
that live in these
multicloud environments,

629
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:53,910
they have to start thinking
in terms of how heterogenous

630
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:56,480
of the system of clouds
that we are creating,

631
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,780
how do we bring some
sort of security controls

632
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:01,889
that homogenize the
understanding, the monitoring,

633
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:04,537
the security capabilities.

634
00:27:04,537 --> 00:27:07,040
And (indistinct) essentially
as we narrow click

635
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,790
into the application side

636
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:11,763
is that the notion of
perimeters is not sufficient.

637
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:14,160
Traditionally, we thought security

638
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,270
from a networking point of view

639
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:18,710
by putting boundaries
perimeters on primals and Swan,

640
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:21,073
but as we go to Zero Trust
models and multicloud models,

641
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,409
there's no perimeters anymore.

642
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:24,766
And now we have to take the perimeter

643
00:27:24,766 --> 00:27:27,470
all the way close to the application.

644
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:29,250
This is what we start thinking in terms

645
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:32,380
of East-West Traffic, and
Zero Trust Security models

646
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:35,220
with East-West traffic to
prevent lateral movements

647
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,780
and attacks that may happen once

648
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,160
part of our applications is compromised.

649
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,010
Now you think like that the whole strategy

650
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:44,740
does by proper segmentation
East-West capability,

651
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:46,850
that allows us essentially
to compartmentalize

652
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:50,520
how the application see each other.

653
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:53,330
Now there's no trust anymore
from anybody to anybody.

654
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:56,540
Thus in an East-West
model with segmentation,

655
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:58,370
we try to understand based on the identity

656
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:01,149
and the capabilities and the
function of the applications

657
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:04,240
what needs do they have to
interact with everybody else?

658
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,433
The second as we get into this

659
00:28:06,433 --> 00:28:08,720
port application micro-segmentation,

660
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,480
we start understanding Mike's
model about the application.

661
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,810
And it's not just like the other SASE

662
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:16,649
or connectivity models from an
infrastructure point of view,

663
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:18,690
but we start understanding
what the applications are,

664
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:20,754
what application buttons are.

665
00:28:20,754 --> 00:28:23,639
So what's normal in terms
of cloud application

666
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,357
connectivity graph gets
developed and so on.

667
00:28:25,357 --> 00:28:27,580
And we provide customized
micro-segmentation

668
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:30,199
experience for those applications.

669
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,210
Now, should we go up the stack?

670
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,900
We start getting into the content

671
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,810
and understanding
essentially what's going on

672
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:39,070
on the layer seven level.

673
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:40,439
And this is what we get in terms

674
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,910
of intuition protection capabilities,

675
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:46,020
anomaly detection, web
application firewalls.

676
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:49,860
And we start providing like
inline East-West capabilities

677
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:53,276
of understanding all the
applications we have level seven.

678
00:28:53,277 --> 00:28:55,180
This allows us to do a
lot of things in terms

679
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:58,240
of preventing vulnerabilities
that have been discovered

680
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,440
and stopping them as we
see the traffic trend

681
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:03,610
and decide them, we can
essentially customize

682
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:07,340
a set of controls that we
went off from level seven

683
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:08,230
based on the function

684
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:10,837
and criticality of the
application and so on.

685
00:29:10,837 --> 00:29:13,800
And as we go one level high,
since we will start thinking

686
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:17,290
in terms of how do we detect patterns

687
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:19,320
that are not acceptable without exposing

688
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:22,100
certain amount of risk and
how we will respond to that

689
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,760
when we get into the network
reaction and response.

690
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:27,887
So all these essentially
has to work as a system,

691
00:29:27,887 --> 00:29:29,360
and that more is no longer a set

692
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,250
of layers disconnected that
we have to essentially manage

693
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:35,290
and control and configure
at each level of the stack.

694
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:37,850
But it has to kind of obey
to the Zero Trust principles

695
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:40,756
on how do we go in an
End-to-End understanding

696
00:29:40,757 --> 00:29:44,610
of how the connectivities
and behaviors are happening.

697
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:47,659
Now, as we stay in the obligation site,

698
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,120
one aspect is the network.

699
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,340
How do we essentially control and discover

700
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:53,520
and connect all the
things that are going on.

701
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,877
But since we added the end point

702
00:29:54,877 --> 00:29:57,030
that's another thing that we can consider

703
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:59,320
from a Zero Trust Architecture.

704
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,503
And this the end point element.

705
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:05,586
Now, as we have essentially
the ability to understand

706
00:30:05,586 --> 00:30:07,880
and see what happens in the end point.

707
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:10,240
Now, we go from what we could do from

708
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,330
a Zero Trust East-West
distributed network architecture

709
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:16,519
to essentially having a full understanding

710
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:18,250
of what the endpoint is doing,

711
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:19,780
what system calls are happening,

712
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,660
what kind of processes are running,

713
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:22,930
are the processes being done,

714
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:24,390
what funds are being touched.

715
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:25,260
And this is this notion

716
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:28,400
that now we can even
identify risk and understand

717
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,310
all the abilities in
the application itself,

718
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:34,129
or understand changes of behavior
in the application itself.

719
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:35,861
Now, this allows us to essentially provide

720
00:30:35,861 --> 00:30:40,861
a very the fine grain
and very understood level

721
00:30:40,864 --> 00:30:42,573
of how the application is performing.

722
00:30:42,573 --> 00:30:44,910
And we get into the
notion of understanding,

723
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:47,370
detecting and responding real-time towards

724
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:50,989
certain implicated notion and
to it the center of cloud.

725
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:53,870
And these allows the sensors
to create preventing systems

726
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:56,639
that as we pay to
behavior of the end point,

727
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,360
what we see in the end point itself,

728
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,780
with what we see in the network,

729
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:03,070
with what we see at the
user and device level,

730
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,909
now we can create not only posture

731
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:08,150
on a component by component
basis, which is important

732
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:09,710
but the full understanding of

733
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:11,887
the security capabilities End-to-End.

734
00:31:11,887 --> 00:31:13,610
And these takes back
to the race discussion

735
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:16,229
that we had just a few minutes before.

736
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:18,110
Once we understand all the elements

737
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:19,540
in a more positive way,

738
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:21,830
now we can think in terms of risk.

739
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:23,710
So if we go back to kind
of the big picture and

740
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:26,638
we try to summarize, when
we go to these end points

741
00:31:26,638 --> 00:31:30,449
the present detectors, is not
any longer about understanding

742
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:33,440
security in silos or
understanding security

743
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,340
in different status of
your environment like cloud

744
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:39,169
versus on plan versus
devices versus network.

745
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:42,450
But rather, how do we
understand in a holistic manner

746
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:45,352
that End-to-End connectivity patterns,

747
00:31:45,352 --> 00:31:47,810
what are user behaviors,
what are device postures,

748
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:49,750
what are application behaviors

749
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:51,560
and how they interpret
the thing themselves?

750
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:55,550
And this is where essentially
starting by identity

751
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:59,129
as mentioned and understanding
device and end point state,

752
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:01,940
we can essentially gather a
lot of intelligence to create

753
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:05,520
a posture of devices users applications,

754
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,520
and have this behavior that allows us

755
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,440
to think in terms of risks.

756
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,380
Now, if you take it at the
effect of the bottom part

757
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:14,810
of the picture, how do
we then try to insert

758
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:19,480
the right points of enforcement
that we can essentially

759
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,280
claim that the system is secure?

760
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:24,177
Starting by the device and
putting the right elements

761
00:32:24,177 --> 00:32:26,995
in the device that we can
understand the vulnerabilities

762
00:32:26,995 --> 00:32:28,340
that we hear and so on,

763
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:30,870
but taking it all the way to the network

764
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:33,629
and being points of presence
in the network intercept

765
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:36,300
and create a system of homogeneity

766
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:38,294
in terms of access and security,

767
00:32:38,295 --> 00:32:40,250
or going all the way to the multicloud

768
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:43,770
and understanding all the
East-West communication patterns.

769
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:46,540
So in summary, End-to-End is the kind

770
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:49,290
of fundamental aspect of
understanding Zero Trust

771
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:51,153
and understanding not only
the connectivity patterns

772
00:32:51,153 --> 00:32:53,690
for the identity and behavioral patterns,

773
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:54,883
and putting everything together

774
00:32:54,883 --> 00:32:58,840
in a much more holistical way
that we can understand risk.

775
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:01,820
Now, when we do these
transitions is never easy.

776
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:05,290
As Shawn was mentioning before,
we've gone from managing

777
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:08,807
lots of individual components
from a security point of view,

778
00:33:08,807 --> 00:33:10,520
to now look at these architectures,

779
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:13,850
we'll take a much more
comprehensive and holistic nature

780
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:15,419
but that's a path along the way.

781
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:18,310
That's why Zero Trust and
the End-To-End Architecture

782
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:22,350
is a good direction where
we are going as an industry

783
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:23,959
but at the same time,
it's going to be built

784
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:27,170
across a lots of
interactions, integrations,

785
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:29,730
standard interfaces, interoperability

786
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:31,130
because we have to build a system

787
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:33,970
and have a system that
essentially placed for us

788
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:36,680
this end direction that we are solving

789
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,590
in a more holistic way.

790
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:41,006
So with this, I just
wanted to thank all of you

791
00:33:41,007 --> 00:33:43,610
for your time on behalf of Shawn and me

792
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:48,240
and sensually ask for feedback
and participation on this

793
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,220
certainly because this
is going to be a very

794
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:52,630
interesting change in the
industry where we start thinking

795
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:54,970
in terms of security and connectivity

796
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:57,900
as a much more systematic way,

797
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:00,310
End-to-End rather than side by side.

798
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:01,937
And we are to sensibly
through this journey

799
00:34:01,937 --> 00:34:05,159
enable organizations to become
more secure on its health,

800
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:08,199
essentially be competitive
in the current landscape.

801
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:09,122
Thank you again.
