1
00:00:07,629 --> 00:00:10,212
(music)

2
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:28,730
- Hello, I'm Laura Koetzle
from Forrester Research,

3
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:30,180
and it's my very great pleasure

4
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,070
to welcome Sudhakar Ramakrishna,

5
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:35,420
who's the CEO of SolarWinds,
to RSA Conference 2021.

6
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:36,743
Welcome Sudhakar.

7
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,810
- Thank you, Laura.

8
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:41,790
Thanks for having me and
I'm delighted to be here.

9
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:42,839
- Thank you.

10
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,760
So everyone listening is mostly familiar

11
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,330
with the broad outlines
of the recent breach,

12
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,080
but for those who might want a refresher,

13
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,540
I'm going to give you a
very quick whirlwind tour

14
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:53,550
of the key events,

15
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:56,390
and then Sudhakar and I are
going to begin our conversation.

16
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:00,170
So let's go back to the
8th of December of 2020,

17
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:02,300
when FireEye announces
that it's been the victim

18
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,699
of a nation-state attack,

19
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,920
and its Red Team Toolkit has been stolen.

20
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,470
On the 9th of December, so the next day,

21
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:09,789
SolarWinds announces that Sudhakar

22
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:11,120
is going to be joining its board

23
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:15,460
and taking over as CEO on
the 4th of January of 2021.

24
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:18,399
And then on the night
of the 12th of December,

25
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,420
Sudhakar learns about the
compromise of SolarWinds Orion.

26
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,410
At this point, very few
people know anything

27
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:26,270
beyond the FireEye breach announcement.

28
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:28,420
The next day on the 13th,

29
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,550
FireEye announces that while
investigating its breach,

30
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:32,820
it found evidence that
attackers used a backdoor

31
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,160
in SolarWinds Orion,

32
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,410
which they codenamed "Sunburst."

33
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:39,960
Also that day, SolarWinds starts
notifying Orion customers,

34
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,850
and asks them to upgrade immediately

35
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,910
to address a security vulnerability.

36
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:46,520
On the 15th of December of 2020,

37
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,500
we learned that the compromise of Orion

38
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,940
occurred as early as March of 2020.

39
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,710
So it had gone undetected for months.

40
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:53,542
At this point,

41
00:01:53,543 --> 00:01:56,020
we find out that the Department
of Homeland Security,

42
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,450
the Department of Treasury,

43
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,800
the National Institutes of Health

44
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,340
and the State Department and more,

45
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:02,180
here in the US, are all affected.

46
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,180
And remember, at this point,

47
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,910
we're still in the middle here in the US

48
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:08,039
of an acrimonious transition

49
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:11,070
between the outgoing and the
incoming US administrations,

50
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:12,700
with lots of key roles vacant,

51
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,010
or with recently named acting heads.

52
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,299
On the 19th of December of 2020,

53
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,040
then Secretary of State
Pompeo says that the Russians

54
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,280
were behind the attack.

55
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,010
And that's the first time
we the public hear that.

56
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:26,760
On the 31st of December,
so Happy New Year,

57
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,370
Microsoft says some of it's
source code was compromised

58
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:30,470
by the attackers.

59
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,830
At this point, everyone's
thinking the attack

60
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:35,850
began as far back as October of 2019.

61
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:38,820
On the 4th of January of 2021, as planned,

62
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,620
Sudhakar officially took
over as CEO of SolarWinds,

63
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:44,190
and he flew to Austin from California.

64
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:47,670
On the 6th of January of 2021,

65
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:49,649
CISA issued guidance requiring agencies

66
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,350
with affected versions of Orion

67
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:53,010
to do forensic analysis,

68
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:56,530
and violent insurrectionists
overran the US Capitol.

69
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:58,870
On the 29th of January of 2021,

70
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:01,530
SolarWinds issued an
advisory for both Sunburst

71
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:03,080
and the malware SUPERNOVA.

72
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,490
And on the 26th of February of 2021,

73
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,910
Sudhakar testified at a
congressional hearing,

74
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:10,290
which is a heck of a
second month in the job.

75
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:14,299
So now here we are in May of 2021.

76
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:17,060
So let's go back to the night
of the 12th of December,

77
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,010
which you may remember

78
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:20,730
from the very beginning of
my lovely chronology here.

79
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:22,670
Sudhakar, you were sitting down

80
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:25,260
to your own birthday dinner, right?

81
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,970
And you got a call from
SolarWind's General Council,

82
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:30,060
and he told you about the backdoor,

83
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,820
and that there was malware in the offing.

84
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,640
Tell us a little bit
about that conversation.

85
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,799
How'd that go?

86
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,200
- Laura, it is indeed true

87
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,649
that December 12th is my birthday,

88
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:42,310
and I was sitting down for my dinner,

89
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,610
birthday dinner.

90
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:48,160
It may have been around
9:00 PM, 9:30 PM Pacific,

91
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,740
so about 11:30 PM Central time.

92
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:54,720
Jason Bliss, our chief legal officer,

93
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,250
and now chief administrative officer,

94
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:00,210
gave me a call to provide me an update.

95
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:03,040
Turns out that he texted me first,

96
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,130
and then I asked him, "If it's urgent,

97
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:06,780
I'll call you back right away,"

98
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,600
and he said, "No, give me a
call in half an hour or so",

99
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,453
which I did.

100
00:04:12,097 --> 00:04:15,220
He updated me of the incident,

101
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:18,240
and Jason, if you know
him, is a no drama guy,

102
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,550
he's very plain spoken,

103
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:23,090
and he said, "This is
what we found out today.

104
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:25,979
FireEye reported that there was a backdoor

105
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,270
into the Orion platform."

106
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,590
And we chatted a bit.

107
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:33,919
At that point, Jason did not
know a lot of the detail.

108
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,793
So when you talk about backdoors,

109
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:39,800
not immediately does a
supply chain backdoor

110
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,840
come to your mind,

111
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,960
because there's a lot of
different ways backdoors

112
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,222
can be installed.

113
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:47,840
And what I said to him at that point was,

114
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,030
it's quite ironic that he talks to me

115
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:52,200
about a security incident that day,

116
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,729
because just that morning,

117
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:56,530
as I was preparing for January 4th,

118
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:59,260
I was preparing a list
of things to focus on,

119
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:02,849
one of them being the security
posture of the company.

120
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:04,900
I did not realize at that time

121
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:08,419
that I would be focused
on that as my top priority

122
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,693
as I joined the company.

123
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:12,640
- Okay, so be honest,

124
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,570
at this point,

125
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:15,700
do you think about calling
the chair of the board

126
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,000
of SolarWinds and saying, "You know what?

127
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,730
Find a new CEO, I'm out of here."

128
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,910
(Sudhakar chuckles)

129
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:27,600
- Let me be honest on
that front, as you asked.

130
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,980
I did get a lot of feedback,

131
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:35,490
and a lot of feedback from
very well wishes of mine

132
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:36,950
asking me to back out,

133
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:40,890
and telling me that I
had nothing to prove,

134
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:44,409
that I am able to find the next best job,

135
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,810
and on and on and on.

136
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:50,410
You can say I'm a stubborn optimist,

137
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:53,890
but I decided to persevere
with this opportunity,

138
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:56,923
but I did have a call with
our chairman, Bill Bock.

139
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,077
The topic of that was
different than saying,

140
00:06:01,077 --> 00:06:03,420
"Go find a new CEO," to your point.

141
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:05,400
The topic instead was,

142
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,900
we are in a state of crisis,

143
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,390
because the more I learned about it

144
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:10,219
over the next three or four days,

145
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,770
once it came into the print media,

146
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:16,150
I felt that continuity and urgency

147
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:19,549
were super important in this situation.

148
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:22,310
And having a new CEO come
in and figure out the team,

149
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:26,240
figure out the procedures,
understand the issues,

150
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,920
could be time-consuming.

151
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,920
And so I had offered to
Bill if the right decision

152
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:35,820
was to continue on with the previous CEO,

153
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,210
that I would be totally fine

154
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:40,229
given the needs of the company

155
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:42,860
and given the needs of the customers.

156
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,770
But then it turned out
that I was able to come in

157
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:49,729
and I also had continuity and
support from Kevin Thompson,

158
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:50,910
the previous CEO,

159
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:54,610
and we were able to
navigate it quite quickly.

160
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:57,450
- So since you brought up customers there,

161
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,969
let's talk a little bit
about your customers.

162
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:02,660
Because when you started
notifying customers

163
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:05,310
about the breach on the 13th of December,

164
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:07,530
you internally I think at the time thought

165
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:10,159
that as many as 18,000 of your customers

166
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,550
might've been affected,

167
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:14,930
because they'd downloaded
the affected update, right?

168
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:15,880
- And so--
- Yes.

169
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,460
- What kind of plans did you have in place

170
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,969
prior to the 13th,

171
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:22,140
knowing that you're not CEO
yet at this point, right?

172
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,890
So you're sort of in a little
bit of a transitional state.

173
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:27,219
But I know you were
talking to customers then.

174
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,540
So what were customers asking?

175
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,370
What was the hardest to answer?

176
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:34,373
And what kind of plan did you
have in place at the time?

177
00:07:35,623 --> 00:07:38,680
- Similar to most mature
software companies,

178
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,500
SolarWinds also had a product security

179
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:45,510
and incident response team
under our VP of security.

180
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:48,950
So that team was used to
understanding security incidents,

181
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:51,810
communicating to customers
in a structured way,

182
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:54,080
working with our customer
success organization.

183
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,419
So that machinery, so to speak,

184
00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:00,270
was in place even prior to December 13th.

185
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:05,270
Obviously, these events had
a escalated significance

186
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:06,573
on that team,

187
00:08:06,573 --> 00:08:08,870
in terms of communicating
to our customers,

188
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:12,110
so it was quite literally
all hands on deck.

189
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:13,960
And the most important questions that

190
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:17,250
customers had at that point was,

191
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,740
what does it mean to me,

192
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,380
and what do you want us to do?

193
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:23,270
That was really kind of
more of a reactionary thing

194
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,630
at that point in time,

195
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:28,659
which the team rallied all
around and did the very best,

196
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:32,563
I would say, to touch every
single customer possible.

197
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:34,523
- Got it.

198
00:08:34,523 --> 00:08:37,230
So here we are in May at RSA Conference,

199
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:39,190
which means we're five and a bit months

200
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:41,470
into dealing with the fallout of this.

201
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:44,780
So how are you supporting
your customers now,

202
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,730
and kind of how you plan to continue

203
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:47,890
to support them in the future?

204
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:50,220
Because obviously there's
a long tail on this

205
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,000
with all the forensic investigation

206
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,980
and things that customers need to do

207
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:56,030
to change their own procedures and so on.

208
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,100
- Continue to is the operative word,

209
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,340
as you mentioned, Laura,

210
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:03,720
because a lot of our software
runs on premises as well,

211
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,920
so it is not instantaneous
that everybody updates

212
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,459
at the same point in time.

213
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,640
So it is one customer at a time,

214
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,689
essentially one day at a time.

215
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:17,690
And in many cases I have told
my team one step at a time.

216
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:21,950
So what started off as a reactive measure,

217
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:24,410
we started learning about the incident,

218
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:26,920
we started addressing issues,

219
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,969
and one of the foundations

220
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:31,740
of what we've been trying
to do is transparency

221
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:35,960
as we enhance the trust that
we have with our customers.

222
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:39,410
Specifically, we also worked
with our worldwide partners

223
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:44,410
and created a program called
the Orion Assistant Program.

224
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,150
The idea behind this

225
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:49,579
is we recognize that
not all of our customers

226
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:54,330
may have the internal
resources to upgrade or rebuild

227
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:56,610
or project into the future.

228
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:59,680
So what we decided to do
was work with our partners

229
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,050
and extend support to our customers

230
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:06,449
to essentially provide pair
of hands in some cases,

231
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:09,580
technology commitments, in other cases,

232
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:12,010
and in many cases, work
side by side with them

233
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:14,580
as they completed their upgrades.

234
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,740
This we did at our cost.

235
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:22,040
Therefore the customers
did not have to incur costs

236
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,569
to support this program.

237
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:25,830
And we felt it was our responsibility

238
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:28,360
to help the customers get to a stable

239
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,860
and secure environment.

240
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:33,270
And so that was very well
received and appreciated,

241
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:35,140
not just by our customers,

242
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,420
but also by our partners.

243
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,550
Because one of the key things

244
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:40,500
that happened through this process

245
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,320
is it brought our
partners closer together,

246
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,530
and they understood our products better,

247
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:48,569
and they understood how
they can serve our customers

248
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:49,670
better as well.

249
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,709
So this is going to be an ongoing thing

250
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:53,700
as we move into the future

251
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:57,930
and we deliver different,
better and extended solutions

252
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:59,729
to our customers.

253
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:02,160
- And thankfully this
wasn't the first time

254
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,689
that you'd been in a position of authority

255
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:06,930
during a breach,

256
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:10,089
because prior you were
the CEO of Pulse Secure,

257
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:12,420
and you had a number of vulnerabilities

258
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,339
in the products of that company,

259
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,380
that you were the CEO of at the time,

260
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,750
during your tenure,

261
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:18,870
including one that was on

262
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:21,550
the top exploited
vulnerabilities list for 2020.

263
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:25,300
So thankfully this wasn't
your first rodeo, as they say.

264
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:29,130
How did those experiences
inform what you just described

265
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:31,360
in the way of supporting customers,

266
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,920
and sort of what you decided to do

267
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,689
and to reveal to the community
as the situation unfolded?

268
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:41,480
- I wish I could use the word
thankfully in this context,

269
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,130
but to your point,

270
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:47,280
it does help to have experience here.

271
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,970
Coming from the software industry,

272
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:54,970
security vulnerabilities
unfortunately are commonplace.

273
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,930
The important thing to
recognize for all of us,

274
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:01,160
no matter how big or small we are,

275
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:05,850
is that we have to be prepared
at all points in time,

276
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:09,750
but be humble enough to accept
that security vulnerabilities

277
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:12,783
and breaches can happen to anyone,

278
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:16,740
not withstanding what resources we have

279
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:19,210
and how good and great we are.

280
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:22,810
So one thing that my Pulse
Secure experience taught me,

281
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:25,359
and even in prior companies, I would say,

282
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,110
is that at all points,
you've gotta be vigilant,

283
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:30,270
but all points you have to be humble,

284
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:32,900
because you cannot think that
this won't happen to you,

285
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:35,030
it might only happen to others.

286
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:39,120
So when you have that mindset
of always being vigilant,

287
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,880
always being humble,

288
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,800
transparency is very, very important,

289
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,699
because it's critical to
know what's happening,

290
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,330
and when something happens,

291
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:52,000
that you are able to
communicate it, project it,

292
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,140
take ownership and do something about it.

293
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:57,810
And going back to my
Pulse Secure experience,

294
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:00,650
similar vulnerabilities to what we had

295
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:04,350
occurred to many different
vendors at the same time,

296
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:08,470
whether it was Cisco, Fi,
Palo Alto Networks and others.

297
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:11,100
And in the Black Hat Conference,

298
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:14,430
many of the researchers actually gave us,

299
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:16,569
us being Pulse Secure at that time,

300
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:20,330
compliments for how we
handled those incidents.

301
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:23,630
And those were rooted
in being transparent,

302
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:25,170
being communicative

303
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:28,170
and updating everybody on progress,

304
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:32,479
even at times when you do
not have all the details

305
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,500
in place and set in stone.

306
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:38,010
So I tried to carry forward
a lot of those principles

307
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:41,760
into my experience here at SolarWinds.

308
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,840
- Got it, and I think a lot of us saw that

309
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,210
as you guys shared how
things were unfolding

310
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:48,950
as they were unfolding,

311
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:50,540
rather than waiting until
you knew everything.

312
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:53,660
Because at least in my own
observational experience here,

313
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,646
you never know everything.

314
00:13:55,647 --> 00:13:56,630
- Absolutely.
- So speaking

315
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:58,090
of never knowing everything,

316
00:13:58,090 --> 00:13:59,300
at this point,

317
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:02,170
as far as we, the community, know,

318
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:04,339
the consensus seems to be that attackers

319
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:07,850
first compromised SolarWinds
in September of 2019,

320
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:09,930
and they were there and undetected

321
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:13,829
until all of this started to
unfold in December of 2020.

322
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:15,950
So is that right?

323
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:18,923
And how were they able to
stay undetected for so long?

324
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:23,030
- Laura, as we have published,

325
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:27,550
the tradecraft that the attackers used

326
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:32,550
was extremely well done

327
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,790
and extremely sophisticated,

328
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:41,150
where they did everything
possible to hide in plain sight,

329
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,480
so to speak.

330
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,570
We were looking for all the usual clues.

331
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:46,180
When you go through an investigation,

332
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:48,859
you have a checklist, you
have a set of hypothesis,

333
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:51,110
you try to map things.

334
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:53,150
And in this particular case,

335
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:55,400
given the amount of time they spent,

336
00:14:55,400 --> 00:15:00,400
and given the deliberateness
that they had in their efforts,

337
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:03,970
they were able to cover
their fingerprints,

338
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:07,220
cover their tracks at
every step of the way.

339
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:10,090
Given the resources of a nation-state,

340
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:12,960
it was very difficult for one company

341
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,990
such as ourselves,

342
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:15,500
or as you have seen,

343
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,030
other companies that are coming out

344
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:21,439
with their own reports
of other nation-states,

345
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,530
as well as the same nation-states
breaching their assets,

346
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:28,600
it was a very difficult thing to uncover.

347
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:32,240
But as we've been looking
back into our history

348
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,980
and we have stumbled upon,

349
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:37,690
as is the case with many investigations,

350
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:40,220
some old configuration of code

351
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,040
where we were able to track down

352
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,510
what exactly the attackers did.

353
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:47,140
And this was, to give you a perspective,

354
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:52,140
we were assessing hundreds
of terabytes of data

355
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:55,490
and thousands of build systems,

356
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:57,520
virtual build systems
across the environment,

357
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,120
just to give you a perspective.

358
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,640
And what we have found more recently

359
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:05,470
is that the attackers may
have been in our environment

360
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:08,483
as early as January, 2019.

361
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,350
We published, obviously,

362
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:13,680
that it was in the
September, October timeframe,

363
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,550
but as we look back,

364
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:18,750
they were doing very
early recon activities

365
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:21,680
in January of 2019,

366
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,550
which explains, I would say,

367
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,859
what they were able to do

368
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:29,496
in September, October of 2019 as well.

369
00:16:29,496 --> 00:16:31,069
- Got it, okay, so even earlier

370
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:34,180
than we had previously
thought up till now.

371
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,130
- Absolutely.

372
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:37,270
- So switching gears to what was going on

373
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:38,610
inside of SolarWinds,

374
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:40,830
and has gone on for the moment,

375
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:42,390
you got lots of friendly advice

376
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:44,370
about what you should do
about your new CEO gig,

377
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:45,203
given the release.

378
00:16:45,203 --> 00:16:48,370
And I know that you also
got some friendly advice

379
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:51,530
about what you should do
about the head of security

380
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:54,089
who was in post at SolarWinds at the time.

381
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:57,120
So do you still have
the same CISO as before?

382
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,690
What did people tell you?

383
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:01,010
The reason I ask is because, of course,

384
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:04,089
a lot of what we in the
community worry about is,

385
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:06,050
hey, something goes wrong,

386
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:08,750
you know, the CISO is the
sacrificial lamb, as it were.

387
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,310
So tell me what happened,

388
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:11,470
and what kind of advice you got,

389
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:13,220
and what you did about it.

390
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,490
- You're spot on.

391
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:18,160
I got all of that advice
and more (Laura laughs).

392
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,760
And I'm pleased to report
that our CISO Tim Brown

393
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:26,869
was there before I joined
and is still a CISO.

394
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:31,870
This is a very important
part of how I like to lead.

395
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:35,980
I do not like to flog
failures, so to speak.

396
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:38,390
And it is not even clear that this failure

397
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,570
is one person's fault.

398
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:44,899
When a nation-state attacks you,

399
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,610
it is impossible for one person

400
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:49,110
to be able to thwart that entire attack

401
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:52,082
or take full responsibility for it.

402
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,439
I also felt, as I got to know Tim Brown,

403
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,350
that he's a highly competent

404
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:01,409
and highly committed individual.

405
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:04,910
He is a 30-year veteran
of the security industry,

406
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:06,750
was a former Dell fellow.

407
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:09,320
And if I were to go out and hire somebody,

408
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,800
I might have hired
somebody with that profile.

409
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,450
So while I acknowledge and accept

410
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:17,800
that if you want to be
an action-oriented CEO,

411
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,810
so to speak, in quotes,

412
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:22,500
that you come and fire a bunch of people.

413
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,580
And I do not think that is doing justice

414
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:28,710
to either the person or your job,

415
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:32,480
because you are really
paid to get the most

416
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,290
and the best out of the
people that you have.

417
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:37,649
And yes, accountability matters,

418
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:42,350
but just like CEOs get a lot
of credit when things go well,

419
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:45,740
and unduly so, I would say, being a CEO,

420
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:50,143
I do think that some
CISOs get undue discredit,

421
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:55,990
and I felt that I should not
be doing what is the norm

422
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:59,560
or what is stereotypical
in these situations,

423
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,332
and went about my own way.

424
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:04,840
- Well I think everybody's
probably relieved to hear that,

425
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,949
that you decided to
discard that lovely advice.

426
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:12,080
So let's talk a little bit about
other SolarWinds personnel.

427
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,750
So you had the joy of
testifying before Congress

428
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:17,430
in your second month on
the job, as I mentioned.

429
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:20,150
And there was a lot of
focus about an intern

430
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:23,020
who posted a password
that had nothing to do

431
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,639
with this particular incident.

432
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,810
But the reason I wanna ask you about this

433
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:29,850
is not to sort of shove
splinters into things,

434
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:30,882
but to say,

435
00:19:32,718 --> 00:19:35,280
thinking about the folks who
are early in their careers,

436
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,440
who are in university now,

437
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,090
who might wanna be interns at
security product companies,

438
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:41,340
they might be a little worried

439
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,020
about starting a career in SolarWinds,

440
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:45,490
because they think, "Oh
God, if I make a mistake,

441
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:48,370
I'm gonna get thrown under
the bus in front of Congress."

442
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:51,213
So how are you gonna reassure those folks

443
00:19:51,213 --> 00:19:53,230
that that talent should join your company?

444
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:55,190
Because obviously scarcity of talent

445
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:57,350
is something we all
talk about all the time.

446
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:58,480
- Absolutely.

447
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,763
Laura, first of all,

448
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,220
I have long held a belief system

449
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:07,810
and an attitude that
you never flog failures.

450
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:11,090
You want your employees,
including interns,

451
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:14,220
to make mistakes and
learn from those mistakes

452
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,920
and together we become better.

453
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,760
Obviously you don't wanna
make the same mistake

454
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,160
over and over again.

455
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,530
You want to improve.

456
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:23,960
So what happened at the
congressional hearings,

457
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:27,060
where we attributed it to an intern,

458
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,669
was not appropriate

459
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:32,710
and was not what we are about,

460
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:34,730
or is not what we are about.

461
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:38,030
And so we have learned from that,

462
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:41,010
and I want to reset it here by saying that

463
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:42,910
we are a very safe environment

464
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:46,120
and we want to attract and
retain the best talent.

465
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,300
And since you mentioned universities,

466
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:52,639
I have been a big fan
of university programs

467
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,910
and internship programs.

468
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:56,550
And you will actually
see us amplifying those.

469
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:58,950
And hopefully you will
hear more and more interns

470
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:02,630
saying how great an experience
it is to work at SolarWinds,

471
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:05,890
as opposed to one incident
that may have happened

472
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:06,900
at a hearing.

473
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:07,750
- Got it.

474
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:10,640
So I'm gonna close with this question,

475
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,100
because I know we're going
to get ourselves kicked off

476
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,870
the virtual stage very shortly,

477
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:19,870
which is looking back over
the last fiveish months,

478
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:21,899
if there were one thing
that you could go back

479
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:24,180
and do differently,

480
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:26,330
after you took over in January, obviously,

481
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:28,210
because no points for
saying your predecessor

482
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:29,230
should've done things differently,

483
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:31,020
what would it be?

484
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:34,970
- Having a stronger media response

485
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:36,920
is the way I would describe it.

486
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,983
Let me explain that.

487
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:42,770
SolarWinds historically
has kept to itself,

488
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:44,060
focusing on customers,

489
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,919
focusing on itself internally.

490
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,600
And it was never trying to grab attention.

491
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:52,500
In this particular case, the
attention was thrust upon us.

492
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,330
And if I thought about one area

493
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:56,199
where we were not fully prepared,

494
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:59,280
unlike some companies that
have armies of PR people

495
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,139
just managing the message,

496
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:03,410
and, in many cases, neutralizing it,

497
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:04,960
we were not prepared.

498
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,960
And to your question
about reflecting back,

499
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:12,940
I wish we had more resources,

500
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,640
more proactive outreach.

501
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,750
And we have learned from that,

502
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:19,240
and we continue to grow
our communications team.

503
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,460
We have an excellent communications team.

504
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:24,300
It's now a matter of giving
it a bit more support,

505
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:28,300
so we can be more prepared
for this and others,

506
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:31,090
although I do not wish something like this

507
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:34,320
to happen to anybody in the industry.

508
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,909
- Well, thank you so very
much for being so candid

509
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:39,070
with us today and sharing the new things

510
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:40,560
that you've learned in the interim.

511
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:44,139
So everyone please join
me in thanking Sudhakar

512
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:46,560
for being willing to share
so much with all of us,

513
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,850
and thank you all as well for listening,

514
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:51,533
and enjoy the rest of RSA Conference 2021.
