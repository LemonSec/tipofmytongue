00:00:02,054 --> 00:00:05,290
- Hi, welcome to the session
on How CISA Is Charting a Path

2
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:07,330
Towards Defensible Infrastructure.

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:09,300
I'm Sounil Yu, and I'm the creator

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,470
of the Cyber Defense Matrix.

5
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:12,640
And I used to be the
Chief Security Scientist

6
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,130
at Bank of America.

7
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,770
As we go through our session
today through the magic

8
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,780
of virtual conferences, we
can multitask as we're talking

9
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:21,530
and interact with you.

10
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:23,400
So if you had any questions
as we go through the session,

11
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,060
feel free to drop them into
the chat and we'll be happy

12
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:28,830
to answer some of the questions
that you might have very

13
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:32,683
interactively as we're talking
and giving our presentation.

14
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:36,790
I'm co-presenting with
my friend, Josh Corman.

15
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:39,400
So let me turn it over over
to him to introduce himself.

16
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,780
- Hi, I'm Josh Corman,
I wear a lot of hats.

17
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:44,160
One is the founder of I
am The Cavalry dot org

18
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,800
and Rugged Software dot org.

19
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:50,010
But today I'm serving
as the chief strategist

20
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:52,910
for CISA for the pandemic response

21
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:56,010
for healthcare and COVID-19
related activities.

22
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:58,870
And it is through this
one-year Cares Act post to help

23
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:01,530
with the pandemic where I
learned of Sounil's project

24
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:04,319
to help make CISA stronger for the future.

25
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,149
And of course I had to be positively,

26
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:08,450
I hope positively disruptive

27
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:10,940
by bringing to bear some of
the defensible infrastructure

28
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,860
and Rugged and Cavalry concepts.

29
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,679
To me make sure that we're
doing the right things

30
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,910
the right way to really
take a leap forward.

31
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:22,440
And hopefully take a, if
you're familiar with my work,

32
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,470
some of this will be a little
reviewed familiar with his

33
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:25,890
and some of that will be a little review,

34
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:27,610
a little bit of a review.

35
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:28,970
But on the next slide, you'll see a

36
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:32,070
we wanna take my chocolate
and Sounil's peanut butter

37
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:34,009
and have two great tastes
that taste great together

38
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:36,700
in the form of national security

39
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:40,390
and cyber defense peanut
butter cups of a sort.

40
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:43,660
So this is a bit of taking
two things that were developed

41
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:46,880
for completely different
reasons in the private sector

42
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,140
and through the crucible
of national security.

43
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,580
Whether it's the defense
of federal agencies or,

44
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:56,470
as we saw during the pandemic,
the increased brazen activity

45
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:59,740
of cyber criminals to attack
critical infrastructure

46
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,530
and undermine our national
critical functions

47
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:04,770
including the delivery of
healthcare, drinkable water

48
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,800
or power and utilities.

49
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,410
So as the world is increasingly dependent

50
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:13,140
on critical infrastructure,
it needs to be dependable.

51
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,170
So we're gonna just show
a play in three acts

52
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:18,160
of some prior work from
myself, some prior effort

53
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,293
from Sounil within the
context of CISA and how I,

54
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:25,150
we put our heads together and
turn things on their head.

55
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:27,470
Hopefully in a way that while develop

56
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,300
for CISA will be very relevant

57
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:32,480
to your day job and for
application in your environment.

58
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,420
So let's start with some
of this, the primitives

59
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,912
that became disruptive later.

60
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:40,760
Way too many years ago,

61
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,859
I was at an RSA conference
party with a few people

62
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,810
and I was railing about
how we were gonna re-invent

63
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:49,140
the application security
market to make everything

64
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,799
that the infrastructure
security market made.

65
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,270
And we pulled up the agile manifesto

66
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:54,750
and realized that there's no mention

67
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,260
of threat or adversary
or risk or security.

68
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,820
And I said, we need to path those.

69
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,320
We need some sort of
value set, the developers

70
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,269
understand the awesome
responsibility that comes

71
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:06,560
with writing digital infrastructure.

72
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,950
Because as you know the world
is increasingly depending

73
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:10,739
on that digital infrastructure.

74
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:13,360
So this very short, rugged
manifesto with lines

75
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,550
like I recognize my code will be used

76
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:19,370
in ways I cannot anticipate,
in ways it was not designed

77
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:22,180
and for longer than it was ever intended.

78
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,190
We meant that at the time

79
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:25,500
but boy does it feel
different right now when

80
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,000
we're having unsupported software possibly

81
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,260
affecting public safety, human
life or national security.

82
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:35,769
So that Rugged concept really
found its footing later.

83
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:39,300
Gene Kim and I showed this,
I think it was at RSA 2011,

84
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,410
10 years ago, to combine Rugged

85
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:45,470
with a new cultural change
within the software community.

86
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,240
'Cause we can't push security on them.

87
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,200
So we wanted them to want to be rugged

88
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,750
to want to have their,
be mean to their code

89
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,200
to have some shared value set.

90
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,500
And the rugged DevOps
movement is now matriculated

91
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,140
into DevSecOps and the like.

92
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:01,070
Some of those concepts as well, turned

93
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:04,510
into product security things
that have been pushing things

94
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:09,093
like I think one year RSA
asked me to do a PechaKucha

95
00:04:09,093 --> 00:04:12,450
or pet chatchka talk about
why zombies love PCI.

96
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:14,500
And initially as a joke,
but now it's foundational

97
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:18,089
to the CMU courses I teach
for the CISA program.

98
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:20,570
Was I made this zombie survival pyramid

99
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:23,030
of it's not security that keeps you alive

100
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,159
during the zombie apocalypse,

101
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,580
it's other things are much more important.

102
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,219
And just like a food guide pyramid,

103
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:31,100
we're ignoring the really
important things at the bottom.

104
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,220
So the concept here was,

105
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,370
if you're gonna survive
the zombie apocalypse,

106
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:35,590
it's not the security you buy

107
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:38,830
but how defensible your
IT and infrastructure is.

108
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:41,400
Do you run towards a wooden
barn that's falling apart

109
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,030
or towards a brick building
that can be defended.

110
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:45,820
It's also not security say,

111
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,510
do you keep your wits around you about you

112
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:51,200
and do your fellow survivors
act as a cohesive unit?

113
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,033
Do you know what you have,

114
00:04:52,033 --> 00:04:54,150
do you know when it changes,
do you act in a disciplined

115
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:57,390
and organized way to
operate that infrastructure?

116
00:04:57,391 --> 00:04:58,330
Are you fighting the dark,

117
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:00,010
are you fighting blindly
but dying quickly?

118
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:01,550
So we lack situational awareness

119
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,760
and we're really poorly
instrumented often.

120
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,170
So we're fighting blindly
and dying quickly.

121
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:09,220
But we keep buying all these blinky boxes

122
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:12,550
and $80 billion plus of
cybersecurity countermeasures

123
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:14,460
without really an operational context.

124
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,210
And I was really trying to push that,

125
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:18,400
we need defensible IT as well owned

126
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,010
and operated well instrumented.

127
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:22,450
And then we can bring
the right tools to bear.

128
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:23,960
And this should be the order

129
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:28,440
of operations that we
anticipate again, meant for IT.

130
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,030
But click ahead.

131
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:33,030
And it started to become
very really, years ago,

132
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:34,719
I started I am The Cavalry dot org

133
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,100
and that was in recognition
that our dependence

134
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,800
on connected technology was now coming

135
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,930
into safety, critical
national security areas.

136
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:45,130
And that software is not
nearly dependable enough.

137
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:47,100
So the Cavalry was a
volunteer movement saying

138
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,780
if the cavalry isn't
coming, what will you do?

139
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:53,270
To be part of that solution to
drive software defensibility

140
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:56,740
and safety primitives into
connected digital infrastructure

141
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:59,120
wherever bits and bytes
meet flesh and blood.

142
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,550
This could be your cars,

143
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:01,810
it could be your medical devices,

144
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:02,960
it could be your hospitals,

145
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,430
successful operations during pandemic.

146
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:07,480
The ability to trust the water supply

147
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,560
from contamination, reliable power.

148
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:16,560
So we are in a place where
we have not yet gribbin

149
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,550
in defensibility and survivability

150
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:23,550
and resilience and other
safety measures into this.

151
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,290
And this has ultimately led my journey

152
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:27,330
into CISA to try to help
during the pandemic.

153
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:30,109
So at the time we tried
to articulate what are

154
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:33,520
the qualities, the eddies of
a rugged and rugged DevOps.

155
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,159
And these early design
points are first principles

156
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,700
for software developers

157
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,719
and they include what you can read here:

158
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,360
supportability, flexibility, resilience,

159
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,010
recoverability, longevity.

160
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:45,170
And they were reflected in many

161
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:47,870
of the words and phrases that manifesto.

162
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:51,370
What got a little bit less as
Sounil scoured the internet

163
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,420
for writings on this is
I didn't write as much

164
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,630
but I spoke an awful lot
about the next principle

165
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:58,270
which was really let's
define defensibility.

166
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,210
What did I mean there?

167
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,469
And there's a number of
ways you could objectively

168
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:03,730
tried to index and measure this.

169
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:06,210
But think of it like this,
what's more defensible

170
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:09,349
that wooden barn or that
brick school building?

171
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:11,590
What's more defensible,
mandatory access control

172
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:15,219
architecture or discretionary
access control architecture?

173
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:18,850
A, an iOS or an Android OS?

174
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:21,030
What's more defensible,
something with 10 ports

175
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:23,130
and services open just in
case you might need them

176
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:24,580
or something that has the three ports

177
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,609
and services you actually need?

178
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:28,280
And without being comprehensive,

179
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,739
this is the things like reducing elective,

180
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:33,550
risk elective attack
surface, elective complexity.

181
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:34,620
Do you really need it?

182
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,060
Or do you need a general purpose device

183
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:40,170
or a fit for purpose hardened device?

184
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:41,960
These were taking shift left

185
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,859
from a slogan and into an
actual set of practices.

186
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,780
And these were security design
requirements, architecture

187
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:51,609
design reviews, threat
modeling, not after you've

188
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:53,420
already written something
that cannot be defended

189
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,820
but designing in trust boundaries.

190
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:59,760
Per concepts of least privilege,
extra instrumentation,

191
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,020
additional separation
and segregation of duties

192
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:04,280
in the code and in the architecture.

193
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,409
And then also, since all
software will have flaws

194
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:08,680
no matter how good a job you do,

195
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,670
do you have the programs and attestations

196
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:13,550
of program support to demonstrate
that you are trustworthy?

197
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:15,410
Do you have a polar software
development life cycle

198
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:16,790
and security program?

199
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:19,070
Do you have coordinated
vulnerability disclosure programs

200
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:21,170
inviting good faith
actors to report issues

201
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:23,960
to you without fear of legal reprisals?

202
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,650
Do you have SBOMs or software bill

203
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:28,159
of materials to advertise the transparency

204
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,250
of the software building
blocks that you use.

205
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,080
And that you're using only
the freshest of ingredients

206
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,090
and respond quickly with
patches when required.

207
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:38,309
And you make contractual
commitments to offer patches

208
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:41,869
for some minimum lifespan
within some reasonable duration.

209
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,059
And this is not comprehensive

210
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:45,319
but these become some of the things that

211
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,270
where one could measure
the relative defensibility

212
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,943
of A versus B versus C.

213
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,070
And sadly, we've kind of
gotten this upside down.

214
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,660
And we're a bit upside
down on our mortgage

215
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:01,260
because by skipping a
defensible infrastructure,

216
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,569
we have an inability to operate it.

217
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:04,860
If you don't know what normal is,

218
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,350
how can you know what abnormal is?

219
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:08,210
The concepts of things such as

220
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:10,450
so simple as anomaly
detection are predicated

221
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:13,110
on the assumption that you
know what normal looks like.

222
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:15,090
And too often, these
independence architectures

223
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:17,070
are chaotically owned and operated.

224
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:19,420
We tend not to instrument them
very well, or even if we did

225
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,819
we wouldn't be able to spot
the signal in the noise.

226
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:25,990
So therefore we have to
compensate with confidentiality,

227
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:28,710
integrity and availability,
countermeasures.

228
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:32,590
A strategy of the past on less
defensible infrastructure.

229
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:34,510
And it just makes me wonder sometimes

230
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:36,490
if there's any right way
to do the wrong thing.

231
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:39,670
And I continue to think
we're completely upside down

232
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:44,670
our thinking and upside our
approach in our mortgage.

233
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,310
And my hope and through other talks at RSA

234
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:51,709
have been getting outside
of your sphere of control,

235
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:52,860
where you can buy countermeasures

236
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:53,940
down your sphere of influence

237
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,960
where you can partner with
key teammates like the CIO

238
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,540
or like the vice president of engineering.

239
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,040
So that we can drive some of this down

240
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,589
into more defensible IT
choices in the first place.

241
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,010
Now ultimately in CISA parlance,

242
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:11,550
we have a current state,
whether it was ideal or not

243
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:13,550
and our job is to defend today.

244
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:16,260
But another half of that
mission is to secure tomorrow.

245
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,450
Which may mean, buying more security

246
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:20,570
and deploying more security services.

247
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:24,350
It may also mean, changing
the game and pushing harder

248
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:26,420
on making sure the IT choices we make

249
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,780
are defensible in the first place.

250
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:30,030
And that that we then
do a good job doing so.

251
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,440
Now as I said before,
the current strategies

252
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,080
for Defend today are
unfortunately upside down.

253
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,880
And as such a lot of the market

254
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,300
and even government
response may include some

255
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,910
of that historical thinking.

256
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,339
And CISA has a service
catalog initially developed

257
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:49,200
for helping to protect
our federal agencies

258
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,150
across the federal government.

259
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,689
But it's also applied to help increasingly

260
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:56,030
to help defend privately owned

261
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,680
and operated critical
infrastructure, such as hospitals,

262
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:02,516
power plants, dams pipelines and the like.

263
00:11:02,517 --> 00:11:05,900
And we, if we need a better
digital infrastructure.

264
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,310
it's gonna start with thinking

265
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:09,060
a bit bigger and a bit differently.

266
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:13,053
- So this is when I come into the picture.

267
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:18,370
I had the opportunity
last year to develop what

268
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:20,770
we call the CISA stack.

269
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:24,530
Back in April, 2020 the GSA
formally designated CISA

270
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:27,949
as the cyber quality
service management office

271
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:29,240
or a QSMO.

272
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,760
And a Cyber QSMO is supposed to

273
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,300
be this single shared office

274
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,729
for managing various
cybersecurity solutions

275
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:39,250
for the U.S. government
and potentially beyond

276
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,650
to include critical infrastructures.

277
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:43,760
The Cyber QSMO was intended to centralize,

278
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,200
standardize and offer just a wide range

279
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,240
of high quality services and capabilities

280
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,880
to CISA's customers.

281
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,320
And to provide whatever integration

282
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,020
and adoption support I might need.

283
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:55,530
The efforts to basically standardize

284
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:59,430
those and automate the activities

285
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:01,739
would hopefully reduce the operations

286
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:04,610
and maintenance costs for CISA customers.

287
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:06,470
You get some sort of maybe bulk discount

288
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:10,883
or the ability to do volume buys.

289
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,070
Now, we have the CISA Services Catalog

290
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:15,750
that Josh mentioned but

291
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:19,180
what should be offered by the QSMO, what

292
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,689
if any gaps are needing to be filled?

293
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:24,360
Well, if you look at the existing
cybersecurity marketplace,

294
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,050
you get a bunch of buzzwords.

295
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:29,089
And it's hard to figure out out

296
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:32,390
of all these buzzwords, if
there's anything that's missing.

297
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:35,470
How do you find any gaps and
opportunities for the QSMO?

298
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:37,580
So what we need is
something that will help us

299
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:40,900
systematically organize
all these capabilities

300
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,880
and understand what those gaps are.

301
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,230
So this led to the CISA stack initiative.

302
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:48,220
Which initially had the
goal to basically define

303
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,950
and execute a framework driven

304
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:52,280
that technology that enables agencies

305
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,990
to quickly understand
their current posture.

306
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:57,660
The range of available technology options

307
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:58,910
for strengthening that posture.

308
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:01,949
And then understanding what
those trade offs might be

309
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:05,053
towards moving to a more robust posture.

310
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:10,010
To facilitate and
coordinate our understanding

311
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:11,130
across multiple stakeholders.

312
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:13,980
We needed some this common
framework to be able

313
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:18,440
to understand where all these
different things fit together.

314
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:21,070
And so the cyber defense matrix was

315
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:22,470
which is something that
I created when I was

316
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:25,910
at Bank of America, served
as this common framework.

317
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:28,959
It served as this bridge
across stakeholders.

318
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,540
This framework served as a foundation

319
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:34,160
for this methodology and provided a easily

320
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,579
understandable, organizing structure.

321
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:39,130
That enabled agencies, that

322
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:40,960
would enable agencies to systematically

323
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:45,750
and methodically process all
this information and capture it

324
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:46,880
and organize it in such a way that

325
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,130
we can quickly understand
where the gaps are.

326
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:54,609
So taking all those buzzwords
that we saw previously.

327
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:57,380
I can now organize it in
accordance with the matrix.

328
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:01,270
And we can see how the
systematic structure helps us

329
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:03,170
more easily determine where the gaps

330
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:04,823
and opportunities are as well.

331
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:08,480
So my charter was to then
leverage the cyber defense matrix

332
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,150
to organize the CISA Services
Catalog into the matrix.

333
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,760
And then ultimately find potential gaps.

334
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,750
So here we have a quick depiction of some

335
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:20,600
of the capabilities that you
see within CISA's portfolio.

336
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,380
And then ultimately what
we wanna do is be able

337
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:26,070
to determine how the vendor
marketplace might be able

338
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:28,300
to satisfy some of these needs that

339
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,939
are unaddressed in this as a portfolio.

340
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,620
These commercial products would then be

341
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,520
what would be considered for the QSMO.

342
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:36,860
But we also recognize

343
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:39,450
that not all these
capabilities were suitable

344
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:41,893
or necessary for each of the agencies.

345
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:46,030
Different constituents will
have different requirements,

346
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:48,600
different needs and different constraints.

347
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,070
And so we needed a way
to systematically capture

348
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:53,660
all these other bits of data as well.

349
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:56,110
So I, we went back to the drawing board

350
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:57,630
and revised the notion.

351
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,900
I revised the notion of
what the CISA stack is

352
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,893
and I incorporated a few more layers.

353
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:07,380
So to match the profile for each agency,

354
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:10,810
I needed to capture other characteristics.

355
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:13,579
And ultimately map each of
those characteristics back

356
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,320
to the cyber defense matrix.

357
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,110
Because the cyber defense
matrix then serves as this,

358
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:22,190
this Rosetta stone, this
mapping that allows us to see

359
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:26,220
and produce this holistic
view across an agency's needs.

360
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,870
Now, these layers are a little
bit easier to understand

361
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:31,660
if I can compare it using a food analogy.

362
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:32,680
So bear with me as I go

363
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:36,479
through the explanation
of each of these layers.

364
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,580
So the first layer represents recipes.

365
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,230
These are best practices,

366
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:43,100
these are requirements that are defined

367
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,850
through reference architectures
or a compliance frameworks.

368
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:47,840
The second layer represents the pantry

369
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,770
or what you have in your current set

370
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:53,252
of existing technological capabilities.

371
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,040
As we, by the way, and as we map some of

372
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,430
these capabilities to the matrix,

373
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:59,310
we can then look longitudinally

374
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:00,959
across multiple agencies to see

375
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,850
if there's common technology capabilities

376
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:05,653
across multi organizations.

377
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:08,699
The third layer represents
the grocery store.

378
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:12,030
So this layer captures the
technological capabilities

379
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,890
that are available in
the commercial market.

380
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:16,300
And it can also include
capabilities that are

381
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:19,423
under development by academia or R and D.

382
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:22,110
The fourth layer represents allergies.

383
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:25,210
And this capture is
essentially whatever factors

384
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:27,490
may limit and the organization's ability

385
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:29,010
to implement a security control.

386
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:30,450
And these constraints may come

387
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:33,030
from a mission needs or business needs

388
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:37,069
or they may come as a result
of technological disruption.

389
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:39,210
Any number of different reasons

390
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:41,810
for these allergies or constraints.

391
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:44,349
The fifth layer represents
nutritional needs.

392
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:46,010
So this layer represents essentially

393
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:48,590
the agency's risk environment.

394
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,890
What their threat environment looks like,

395
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:52,110
what are common attack patterns,

396
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:55,320
what areas are most often under attack.

397
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,060
And what we wanna do is
map this risk environment

398
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,310
to the cyber defense matrix

399
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:01,989
to then be able to map it
across all these layers.

400
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:02,920
And so the combination

401
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:06,050
of these layers creates what
I now call the CISA stack.

402
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:09,310
And the combination of
these layers allows us

403
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:11,210
to quickly assess the profile

404
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:13,903
of again, given agency
and understand its needs.

405
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,839
And then one of the other
core goals that we had

406
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,419
in the CISA stack effort was reusability.

407
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:23,230
So several of these
layers will likely serve

408
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:24,859
as a reusable building block

409
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:26,919
that other organizations can leverage.

410
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,480
If they have similar architectures

411
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,000
or they have similar threats
or share a similar constraints.

412
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,360
And ultimately the various combination

413
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,229
of these building blocks
will help organizations

414
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:38,300
quickly understand the range

415
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,260
of options available to
secure their organization

416
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:43,210
in a way that will mitigate
whatever threats they're facing.

417
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:45,810
While still adhering
to whatever constraints

418
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:49,463
and requirements that
they have to comply with.

419
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,050
So bringing each of these
different layers together,

420
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:54,620
what we wanna do again, is map them

421
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,419
to the cyber defense matrix.

422
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,253
And in doing so,

423
00:17:57,253 --> 00:18:01,820
we can then answer three
specific questions.

424
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:04,159
First, we wanna be able to understand

425
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,630
how secure an agency is.

426
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:08,400
And so we wanna map the existing set

427
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,490
of capabilities that they
have in their pantry.

428
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:14,140
Next, we wanna understand
how secure they should be.

429
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:15,640
So this is where we take in requirements

430
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,650
but also characterize the risk environment

431
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:19,330
with whatever threats that may be facing

432
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:21,449
and capture that also in the matrix.

433
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:23,350
And then lastly, we wanna
understand what's available

434
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:26,149
in the marketplace and one

435
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:27,970
of the constraints they have to face.

436
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:29,420
And ultimately the combination

437
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,580
of these layers helps
us answer key questions

438
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:34,360
that we might have around,
where the agency is today,

439
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,429
where it needs to be and ultimately

440
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:38,530
how it needs to get, how it can get there.

441
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:42,000
The combination of these layers

442
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,570
then provides this consolidated view.

443
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:47,290
And this consolidated view
helps us understand the range

444
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:49,610
of options that are available to improve

445
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:52,030
the security posture of the agency.

446
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:55,100
Each overlapping layer
describes various risk

447
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,612
management considerations and trade-offs,

448
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:01,840
low-hanging fruit,
opportunities to innovate.

449
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,080
Anyway, and different ways
that we can think about

450
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,360
how we deal with the constraints.

451
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,949
For the areas where we
don't have constraints,

452
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:10,190
then the decision is probably very easy.

453
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,730
It might just be an opportunity to just,

454
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:13,780
just implement a certain set

455
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:16,610
of controls that already
exist in the market.

456
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:19,030
But more often than not,
we're gonna have constraints.

457
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:22,820
And where we have constraints
and an act of threat,

458
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,379
we have to make a risk
management decision.

459
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:27,570
Because, with the rights
that set of stakeholders

460
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:30,210
because whatever control we might put in

461
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,590
may cause some sort of business impact.

462
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:34,860
It may impact a business,
it may impact the mission

463
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,033
of the organization.

464
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,233
- I do not like constraints.

465
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:45,850
- Neither do I, but this is
where I think the opportunity

466
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:47,830
to bring together chocolate

467
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:50,210
and peanut butter came about.

468
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:53,680
Because we have, we've
had a series of meetings

469
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,600
throughout the summer last
year where we're going

470
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,990
through this methodology,
seeing how it might work

471
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:02,513
with potential agencies
that wanna give this a try.

472
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:07,479
And along the way the,
Josh asked very good

473
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,530
and disruptive questions

474
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:11,833
like, like the one that
we are seeing up here.

475
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:14,260
- Yeah, so I mean obviously

476
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,070
we have constraints, we always do.

477
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:18,760
But I just felt it was wildly unfair

478
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,510
and past due, like why
can't we give constraints

479
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:22,650
to our adversaries?

480
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:26,060
Again, we keep fighting in theory

481
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:28,100
with the home field advantage.

482
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,330
But we keep failing to leverage

483
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:32,199
that home field advantage.

484
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,340
And I wanted to stick
it to the adversaries,

485
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:37,540
cause them to be constrained,
force their movements

486
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:40,500
from uncontested space where
we can't fight them, maybe

487
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:44,030
toward contested space,
maybe like the Battle

488
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:46,993
of Thermopylae, the hot gates
and the battle of the 300.

489
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,272
This is CISA.

490
00:20:49,272 --> 00:20:50,803
(both laugh)

491
00:20:50,804 --> 00:20:54,850
No, I wanted to take the
fight to them and realized,

492
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:57,750
perhaps we're trying to
defend indefensible things

493
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:01,620
and maybe I should dust off
some of those old pyramids.

494
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,419
And I wanna see what Sounil thought.

495
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,409
- And sorry, as you shared that.

496
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:08,920
And by the way, I'm not
sure if you can tell on the

497
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:13,273
for the viewers, but that
there's a remarkable semblance

498
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,530
between what Josh looks like today

499
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:20,790
and what King Leonidas looked
like thousands of years ago.

500
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:24,620
Anyway, so as Josh asked this question

501
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:28,060
why can't we have constraints
for the adversary?

502
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:30,639
It dawned upon me that there
was this other framework

503
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,560
that I created call that D.I.E. Triad.

504
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:36,409
And I believe that the D.I.E. Triad

505
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:39,240
was how we can add adversary constraints.

506
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,403
So let me now explain
what the D.I.E. Triad is.

507
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:48,649
So D.I.E. stands for distributed,
immutable and ephemeral.

508
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:51,860
And each of these qualities
provides some degree

509
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:54,840
of security value that Josh
mentioned earlier, when it comes

510
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,889
to indefensible
infrastructure, we have to deal

511
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:01,900
with all these different
problems and challenges.

512
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,250
But it turns out if you
build towards D.I.E.,

513
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,640
some of those challenges
are easily addressed.

514
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:11,640
So for example, in the
context of distributed,

515
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:13,439
if you have a distributed attack, one

516
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,273
of the best ways to address it is

517
00:22:14,273 --> 00:22:16,570
through a distributed service.

518
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:18,350
Earlier, Josh also mentioned

519
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,600
it's hard to tell what's normal.

520
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:24,320
But if things are immutable,
then any change is abnormal.

521
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,520
So it's easier to find, be able

522
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:31,300
to discover intrusions
and unusual anomalies.

523
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,850
And then lastly, ephemeral.

524
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:35,929
So one of the things that
attackers often want to do

525
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:38,440
is to establish persistence,
but if things are ephemeral

526
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:42,110
then it's kinda hard to
maintain that persistence.

527
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:44,929
But what's also interesting
is that the more we design

528
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:47,620
towards the D.I.E., the less of a burden

529
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:50,409
that we have towards C.I.A.

530
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:54,390
In other words, if we can
have our assets D.I.E.

531
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:56,463
then why do we need to C.I.A. them?

532
00:22:57,390 --> 00:23:00,920
And one of the things that
helps us understand this,

533
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:04,020
to understand this construct
a little bit better,

534
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:06,340
it also helps us to approach re-examine

535
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:08,053
the risk analysis equation.

536
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:12,620
Oftentimes when we consider
how we calculate risk,

537
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:15,439
it's a product of likelihood times impact.

538
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,070
Well, what's likelihood made up of?

539
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:20,379
It's made up of two factors,
one is vulnerabilities.

540
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:22,300
And unfortunately it seems
like we have a never ending

541
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:25,260
of, never ending stream
of severe vulnerabilities.

542
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:27,310
You can have everything patched today

543
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:29,129
and guess what's gonna happen tomorrow.

544
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:31,583
You're gonna have yet another
vulnerability to patch.

545
00:23:32,737 --> 00:23:35,670
And then you have a set
of never-ending threats

546
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:40,460
and good luck trying to address
those or get rid of those.

547
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:43,070
And we have a situation
where vulnerabilities,

548
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:46,010
I will quote Josh here,
"Vulnerabilities age

549
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:48,860
like milk and threats age like wine."

550
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,409
And so the combination of the two means

551
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:53,360
that likelihood just
continues to increase.

552
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,080
What we do with the C.I.A. Triad

553
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,439
is to try to reduce likelihood.

554
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,533
But I would argue that's a losing battle.

555
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,860
The opportunity that we have
to add adversary constraints

556
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,810
or to be able to change the balance

557
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:09,072
of the equation here is to control impact.

558
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:13,003
And I believe that D.I.E.
Triad is a way to do that.

559
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:19,220
To use another analogy, one
that has been fully embraced

560
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,990
by many cloud native practitioners,

561
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:24,620
it's the notion of pets and cattle.

562
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,729
And if you're not familiar with
it, let me quickly explain.

563
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:29,030
So pets are things that you give it a name

564
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:30,090
and when it gets sick, you take it

565
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:32,070
to the vet and you like giving it hugs.

566
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:34,149
And when we think about how
we used to build systems

567
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:37,710
before the cloud, we used
to build lots of pets.

568
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:39,720
Our machines had names
that we can pronounce

569
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,780
and when it had a vulnerability
or a problem we would,

570
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,450
we take it to our cyber veterinarians

571
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:45,940
to patch it and make it better.

572
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,660
And we like hugging our machines

573
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,300
and things like our personal laptops

574
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,860
and our national ID numbers are pets.

575
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,270
Cattle on the other hand, you had brand it

576
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:55,920
with an obscure name that
you can't even pronounce.

577
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,187
And when it gets sick, well,
you just kinda shoot it

578
00:24:58,187 --> 00:24:59,919
and you move on.

579
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,650
And containers, land the functions,

580
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:05,480
credit card numbers that
continuously change.

581
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,490
These are things like cattle.

582
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:09,980
And when it comes to our
pets, we have to C.I.A. them.

583
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,550
But when it comes to cattle,

584
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:14,470
we should design them to D.I.E.

585
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:17,390
And defending indefensible
pets is hard enough.

586
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:20,410
I think this challenge is
exacerbated by the sheer number

587
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:22,660
of pets that we oftentimes
have to deal with.

588
00:25:23,526 --> 00:25:26,090
I mean if you're a pet
owner, I'm sure you know

589
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:29,480
there's a lot, it takes a lot
of work to take care of a pet.

590
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,990
Imagine if you had 10 times that number

591
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:33,810
and they started breeding
amongst themselves.

592
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:37,250
I mean, it, you literally and figuratively

593
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:38,590
have a zoo, right?

594
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:40,800
So moving to an
indefensible infrastructure

595
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,610
may also require us to change how we think

596
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:45,699
about our roles and responsibilities.

597
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,610
When we have to deal with pets,

598
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:51,469
our role is to become
a cyber veterinarian.

599
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:52,303
And we have to take care

600
00:25:52,303 --> 00:25:54,560
of all these pets with
tender, loving and care.

601
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:56,820
Going forward, we may have,

602
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:59,010
if we're gonna try to
build towards D.I.E. what

603
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:02,690
we wanna do is try to avoid
unknowingly creating new pets.

604
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:04,510
And we have to basically make sure

605
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:06,640
that anyone who wants to create
a pet, they have to sign up

606
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,560
for the responsibility
to care for that pet

607
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,250
or at least provide the
resources to make sure

608
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:12,763
that those pets are
properly taken care of.

609
00:26:14,608 --> 00:26:18,550
But when it comes to adding
adversary constraints,

610
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:22,050
D.I.E. enables us to think
about how we can use,

611
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:23,530
how we can build using components

612
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:25,960
that are distributed
immutable and ephemeral,

613
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,310
instead of components
that require a C.I.A.

614
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:33,610
Now normally, as security people,
as security practitioners,

615
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:36,449
we have a natural tendency
to encourage people

616
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:37,970
to think about security first.

617
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:41,803
I mean, that's kind of our mantra, right?

618
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:45,440
But that's actually not what we want here.

619
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,310
Having people think

620
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:49,830
about security first means
designing towards a C.I.A.

621
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:53,590
Instead, we want them to
design towards D.I.E. first.

622
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:54,760
So let's take for example

623
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:58,040
a traditional three
tiered web application.

624
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,639
What you see here are all the
different attacks surfaces

625
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,660
and things that you have to defend.

626
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,590
The things that you have to C.I.A.

627
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:09,159
In a three tiered web application.

628
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:12,700
But as we talked about earlier
with Josh's description

629
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,540
of defense infrastructure,
what we're wanting to do

630
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:17,659
is to remove elective attack surfaces.

631
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:20,260
And so instead of asking

632
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:22,500
how can we secure this application,

633
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,640
what we should be asking is

634
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:27,820
how can we make it D.I.E.
instead, do we need a network?

635
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:30,490
Can we make a D.I.E., do we need a server,

636
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:32,410
can we make that D.I.E as well?

637
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:36,580
Well great, then let's get rid

638
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:39,409
of those attack surfaces
and see what's remaining.

639
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:42,120
Can we make the application
or the data become D.I.E.?

640
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,300
No, well in that case, we need

641
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,713
to C.I.A. those particular pets.

642
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,409
And so I think this whole notion

643
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:54,420
of looking at D.I.E. is
a step function modifier

644
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:56,023
to the defensibility equation.

645
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:01,480
Narrowing paths creates
this defensibility.

646
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,970
But D.I.E. I think D.I.E. goes

647
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:05,710
a little bit even beyond that.

648
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:09,210
Because it's not the kind of, D.I.E.

649
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:12,220
doesn't just narrow the
paths that we see going,

650
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:14,543
if we were to use the
castle and moat analogy,

651
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,159
the moat provides this perimeter

652
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,710
and the drawbridge is this narrow path.

653
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:22,470
The moat creates the,
creates an opportunity

654
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:23,670
to create adversary constraints

655
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:25,540
by limiting the attack vector.

656
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:27,149
But I think D.I.E. goes further than that

657
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:30,420
because D.I.E. makes the targets behind

658
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:34,250
those attack vectors
less and less impactful

659
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:36,153
if those targets get compromised.

660
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:39,760
So D.I.E. is a different
type of constraint.

661
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,500
That one that doesn't require
in many ways, in many cases,

662
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:45,550
a perimeter at all because
what you would otherwise have

663
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:49,312
within the perimeter is already
built to and meant to D.I.E.

664
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:54,420
So let's look at the,
how we can apply some

665
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:56,650
of these toward, how we can apply

666
00:28:56,650 --> 00:29:00,035
that principle of D.I.E.
towards some recent events.

667
00:29:00,035 --> 00:29:05,035
And we'll pick out some
emergency directives

668
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:07,090
that were issued by CISA.

669
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:09,560
Now, I don't think this was intentional

670
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,500
on the partisan but

671
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:15,130
if we look very carefully
at the emergency directive,

672
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:19,610
you'll see many elements of
the D.I.E. philosophy baked in.

673
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:23,959
So first of all it says,
"Agencies that decide

674
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:27,660
to run the SolarWinds Orion platform."

675
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:29,477
So it gives you an option to say,

676
00:29:29,477 --> 00:29:31,057
"I choose not to decide."

677
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:34,600
So there's this notion that,

678
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,929
why do you need to even
run the Orion's platform?

679
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:38,190
It's because you typically

680
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:40,160
will have an on-premise environment,

681
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,960
you have network infrastructure,

682
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,110
it's a fixed network environment.

683
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:46,459
And in that fixed network environment,

684
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:47,360
you have to manage it.

685
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:51,050
And so you have SolarWinds
to help you do that.

686
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:53,080
But what if you actually move to the cloud

687
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,510
where the environment
is widely distributed.

688
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:57,980
Where there's not a fixed
network environment anymore.

689
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:00,280
Do you really need SolarWinds

690
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,100
to help you manage that environment?

691
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,240
So I think the first step
of just even deciding,

692
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,410
do you wanna go back
to pets again or do you

693
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:10,310
have an opportunity to
actually move towards cattle?

694
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:13,159
Inherent in this statement of deciding

695
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,350
is the opportunity to say, you know what?

696
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:17,820
We don't need to adopt another pet again,

697
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:20,139
let's see what we can do
to build towards cattle.

698
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,290
Next is immutability.

699
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:23,950
So the statement at the bottom talks

700
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:27,500
about following the SolarWinds security

701
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,390
configuration hardening guidelines.

702
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:33,240
So if you choose to end
up deploying SolarWinds,

703
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,150
then one thing that you can do potentially

704
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:39,147
is to create guardrails
of immutability that says,

705
00:30:39,147 --> 00:30:42,020
"Here's what this product
is supposed to do."

706
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:44,820
And if it violates those parameters,

707
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:47,700
if it violates those
behaviors and set those alarms

708
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:50,163
or fire off those alarms,
fire off those alerts.

709
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,640
Being able to, so
essentially the way I look

710
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,560
at this, immutability provides a way

711
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:58,370
to apply zero trust principles

712
00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:00,342
to our supply chain, to our vendors.

713
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:03,320
We don't trust our vendors,

714
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,550
we don't trust our supply chain

715
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:05,800
and so we're gonna create these sort

716
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,940
of guard rails around what's expected.

717
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:10,890
And anytime it violates
those, we set up alarms.

718
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:13,570
And then lastly, when it
comes to the ephemeral piece,

719
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:15,020
if you look at the requirements

720
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:18,090
or the recommendations around the hosts,

721
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:19,399
it says that you're gonna rebuilt these

722
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,040
it should rebuild these hosts.

723
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,510
Well, if you have hosts that are physical

724
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:25,610
then consider moving them to something

725
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:27,800
that's more femoral like a VM.

726
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,950
Make them more and more short-lived.

727
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:31,560
If they are already built on VMs,

728
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,750
maybe move them to containers.

729
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:34,060
If they're already built on containers,

730
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:35,720
move with them to serverless.

731
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,660
Ultimately we wanna do,
what we wanna try to do

732
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:39,810
is to make these more
and more short lived.

733
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:43,330
And then it also has
recommendations around passwords.

734
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:46,419
So multifactor
authentication that gives you

735
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:49,100
the opportunity to have
very short-lived passwords.

736
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:52,570
And then it says, "If it
doesn't, if you can't do MFA,

737
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:54,080
then you're gonna have
a long live password."

738
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,710
But at the very least, make
those long live passwords

739
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:59,963
short lived as much as possible
with a 90 day lifetime.

740
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,970
And then here's another example
in relation to exchange.

741
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:05,570
Now, you'll have to give
me some liberties here

742
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:08,780
to exercise creative license
here and they interpretation

743
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:11,580
but I can also read this
directive as follows.

744
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:14,956
So first thing it says, "If
you have on-premise exchange

745
00:32:14,957 --> 00:32:19,483
"all right, then more than
likely your pet is pretty sick.

746
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:24,330
And it's likely to get
other things infected."

747
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:28,649
Okay, other gain persistent access

748
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:30,500
to other systems in your environment.

749
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:36,340
However, if you happen to be
using cattle, then you're fine.

750
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:39,853
Okay, if you're on O365, you're good.

751
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:43,400
Now, if you have a second time pet,

752
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,750
you need to do something about it.

753
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:47,580
So hopefully you have a cyber veterinarian

754
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:50,273
on staff with the
expertise to take action.

755
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:55,500
But if you don't, then you're gonna

756
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,450
have to put that pet down.

757
00:32:57,450 --> 00:33:00,480
And ultimately, you may
not have a good day.

758
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,780
It might be a bad day
when you put your pet down

759
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:05,910
but at this point, your pet is dying.

760
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:07,050
It's sick, it's dying.

761
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:09,503
It's probably already
dead on its death bed.

762
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,520
So if you're gonna rebuild,

763
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:15,500
why don't you go ahead
and make a cattle instead.

764
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:18,140
So latent and how you can read

765
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:19,350
through some of these directives

766
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:22,110
you can see how there's this nudge

767
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:24,750
towards moving towards a D.I.E. construct

768
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:28,973
as opposed to having to
continually C.I.A. your pets.

769
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:33,660
- So I guess if we're
talking about pets and cattle

770
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:36,431
this is the great puppy massacre of 2021.

771
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:37,840
(Sounil chuckles)

772
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,929
But it is, for the adversaries
it's like kicking puppies,

773
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:42,460
there's no challenge whatsoever.

774
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:46,280
And I think what's stunning is

775
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,990
if you saw Bob Rudis do
his data science work

776
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:52,530
on the internet, and he saw
that the number one market share

777
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:55,610
for virgin for exchange for
the whole internet, especially

778
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:57,540
for designated critical
infrastructure sectors

779
00:33:57,540 --> 00:34:00,720
were running unsupported
versions of exchange

780
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:05,720
on-prem, unsupported on-prem pets.

781
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,230
And I think at some point

782
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:11,040
we talk about defend
today, secure tomorrow

783
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,250
but there's a third one,
which is build back better.

784
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:14,960
And in that kind of concept

785
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,893
of defend today and secure tomorrow,

786
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,489
there's an awesome responsibility

787
00:34:19,489 --> 00:34:21,040
that comes with having pets.

788
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:25,630
There's an even more profound
responsibility when you're

789
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,659
in supportive, designated
critical infrastructure

790
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:29,569
or public safety human lives.

791
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:32,139
And pretty soon, if not already

792
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:36,170
if we don't learn to look at
infrastructure that can D.I.E.,

793
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:38,540
we're gonna have people D.I.E.

794
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:40,630
And we're really hoping that just

795
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:42,670
like these triangles
happened to be the symbol

796
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:45,320
of change that we can embrace some

797
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:49,679
of these recent high-profile
failures as a reason to change.

798
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:52,040
So we have a current
state we'd like to get

799
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,080
to the desired state.

800
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,540
Sometimes that's through
planning and courage

801
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:58,009
and sometimes it's through a crisis

802
00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:00,480
where we can build back better.

803
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,310
And when you have a fork in the road,

804
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:04,560
we encouraging that you leverage

805
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,773
some of these concepts.

806
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:09,870
Again, there is no right
way to do the wrong thing.

807
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:11,962
Think about fighting smarter not harder.

808
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,310
- So, just to leave you with some thoughts

809
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:18,270
in terms of how you can
put this to practice

810
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:19,200
in your own organization.

811
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:23,040
So this was meant to be a
proof of concept to demonstrate

812
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:27,390
whether or not we could apply
some of these principles

813
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:29,890
and concepts towards
the problems that we saw

814
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:31,390
or some of the challenges
that we saw with CISA.

815
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:33,420
But we think it has broader applicability

816
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:36,360
outside of just CISA and
the federal agencies.

817
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:41,360
Certainly it has applicability
to critical infrastructures.

818
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:43,800
But I think we think that
it also has applicability

819
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,520
across the board to anyone who's trying

820
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:50,223
to defend an indefensible organization.

821
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:55,410
So starting off at what we
think we should try to work

822
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:58,870
on very soon as to be able
to find what your pets are,

823
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:01,147
to be able to discover that
indefensible infrastructure.

824
00:36:01,147 --> 00:36:04,299
And it may not be obvious at times

825
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,760
but oftentimes they
manifest as legacy systems

826
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,220
which are pretty obvious.

827
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,990
But if you, there are other ways

828
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:12,069
that you can potentially find pets.

829
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:16,240
And I have another talk
on the D.I.E. Triad

830
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,020
that you can also look at from last year

831
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:19,509
as well as this coming year,

832
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,520
as well as this conference this year.

833
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,180
That will help you understand
how to discover your pets.

834
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:26,250
Once you have, once you have
an understanding of your pets

835
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:27,590
you gotta make sure you
have that in your hands

836
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:28,590
to cover those pets.

837
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:31,250
As Josh mentioned, Bob Rudis found

838
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:32,910
all these exchange servers that really

839
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:35,680
had no veterinarians
taking care of those pets.

840
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:39,190
And so they were running a muck,
they were getting infected.

841
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:41,406
They were creating other issues

842
00:36:41,406 --> 00:36:44,310
that will come back to
hunt those companies

843
00:36:45,422 --> 00:36:48,083
that don't have proper
care for those pets.

844
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,720
Then within the next three months,

845
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,839
we recommend that you start
looking at ways that you

846
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,630
can promote the D.I.E. principles

847
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,880
ahead of the C.I.A. principles.

848
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,400
And what's really interesting actually

849
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,830
about the D.I.E. principles is

850
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:04,460
that they happened to be
actually very business aligned.

851
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:06,120
The business wants agility.

852
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:09,440
They don't want to be burdened
by having all these pets.

853
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:13,316
And so you'll find, as
Josh mentioned earlier,

854
00:37:13,316 --> 00:37:15,540
you'll find great
partnership with the CIO.

855
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:16,730
You'll find great partnership

856
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:18,340
with the lines of businesses

857
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:20,670
that want to remain competitive,

858
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:23,570
that want to drive a business agility.

859
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:27,760
C.I.A. actually holds
them back in many regards.

860
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:32,090
But it's a necessary component
if we can't practice D.I.E.

861
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:33,340
So what we wanna do is

862
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:36,280
have them practice D.I.E. first, okay?

863
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,870
And where we fail to D.I.E.,

864
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:40,083
then we need to C.I.A. those things.

865
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:44,189
And then within the next
three months, as I mentioned

866
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:45,820
the stack effort was a proof of concept

867
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:49,500
but we're testing this
out to see find agencies

868
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,510
that are willing to give this a try.

869
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:53,010
But I've also tried it

870
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:56,840
with other non-governmental enterprises.

871
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,080
And it's starting to show some promise

872
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:02,069
in terms of being able to
provide this composite view

873
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:04,250
to understand our opportunities

874
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:06,393
and improve the care of our pets.

875
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:12,530
And then longer term, we
wanna minimize the number

876
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:13,640
of pets that we have to deal with.

877
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:17,970
And so the indefensible
infrastructure that we keep,

878
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:19,509
we wanna minimize the creation

879
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:21,870
of new indefensible infrastructure.

880
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:26,100
And so the way I characterize
that is it's becomes more

881
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:28,130
of a pet control for function as opposed

882
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:30,260
to just trying to take care of your pets.

883
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:32,590
Minimize the number of your pets first.

884
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:34,477
As Bob Barker used to say,

885
00:38:34,477 --> 00:38:36,819
"Don't forget spade a new to your pets."

886
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:39,810
And that's essentially what
we're trying to do here too.

887
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:43,250
And if there's a pet
that happens to pass away

888
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:45,140
through natural causes,

889
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:47,420
you don't need to resuscitate that pet and

890
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:49,260
or you don't need to
reincarnate the pet again

891
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,300
to be exactly the same pet.

892
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:54,540
Find the opportunity to
instead build towards D.I.E.

893
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:59,540
Shift, try to incentivize the creation

894
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:05,040
of cattle through better IT choices

895
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:08,233
and defensible
infrastructure, as Josh said.

896
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:11,470
There's no point in doing
the wrong thing better.

897
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:13,750
What we want it to do is to help people

898
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:15,420
make the right choice the first time

899
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:18,620
and make that the easiest choice
that they can make as well.

900
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:20,970
- Yeah, and if even concurrent
with this conference

901
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:23,859
that you can see tremendous
efforts from Congress,

902
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:25,150
from the White House.

903
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:28,290
Significant pressure to
have more trustworthy

904
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:30,509
and reliable digital infrastructure.

905
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:33,370
And if you're in the
product making business,

906
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:34,799
Chris Wysopal and I are also talking

907
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,400
about the rise of the chief
product security officer

908
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,660
and how to maybe up level your product

909
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:42,470
in the application security
programs to be more aligned

910
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:44,209
with some of these D.I.E. principles

911
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:46,040
and other radical changes.

912
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:49,020
So we have an opportunity to change

913
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:51,070
and build back better, let's embrace it.

914
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:52,170
- Thank you very much.
