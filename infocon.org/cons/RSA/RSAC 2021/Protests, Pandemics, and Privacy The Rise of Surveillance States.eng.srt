1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:03,200
- Imagine a world where
there's no poaching,

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,450
no sanctions busting, no walls of borders.

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,420
- All of this made possible by
a global network of sensors,

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,140
fused with the power of
artificial intelligence.

5
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:15,090
- In that same world empowered
by the same technology,

6
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:17,450
pandemics are quickly stopped.

7
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:21,020
There is no crime and privacy is dead.

8
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,300
- Satellites for higher
cover every square meter

9
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:27,220
of the planet and can
track anyone at any time.

10
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:30,540
- Social scoring follows
you everywhere you go.

11
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:32,780
- Predictive AI acts automatically,

12
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:35,730
to stop actions objectionable
to the authorities

13
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:37,440
before they even happen.

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,930
- We stand at a crossroad
in the path where our future

15
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:43,330
is being paved by two
countries whose ideology stands

16
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:46,160
in direct opposition to one another.

17
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,739
China uses surveillance
and artificial intelligence

18
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,460
with brutal efficiency,

19
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,350
by blending business and
government to control it's people,

20
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,750
and as an economic
weapon to quietly assert

21
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,930
its influence worldwide.

22
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:00,480
In China, privacy is a
casualty of its ambition

23
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,569
for global dominance and
given little consideration

24
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:05,760
by its leaders or its citizens.

25
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,490
- In contrast, America's
relationship with privacy

26
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:10,300
is uneasy at best.

27
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,899
The United States restricts
its government's use

28
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,010
of both surveillance and AI.

29
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:17,230
While nearly the unchecked tracking

30
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:19,330
of its citizens by businesses for profit,

31
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:22,649
means the most private details
are available for purchase

32
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:25,380
and governed largely by corporate policy.

33
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,490
In the US we have traded away our privacy

34
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:30,330
for services and convenience.

35
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:33,240
As it has been said, if you're
not paying for the product,

36
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,170
you are the product.

37
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:37,530
To understand what these
very different futures

38
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,670
might look like, let's examine how China

39
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:43,120
and the United States have
responded to the chaos of protest

40
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,440
and the pandemic.

41
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,899
- There are 12 million
mostly Muslim Uyghurs

42
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:50,270
living in China's Northwest
Territory of Xinjiang.

43
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:52,750
After the communist revolution of 1949,

44
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,730
the Han majority government of Beijing

45
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:56,980
took control of the resource-rich region,

46
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:59,210
and large numbers of Han began settling

47
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:01,729
causing tension between
the two communities.

48
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:04,210
These tensions culminated
in violent protests

49
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:06,360
in the summer of 2009.

50
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,780
Protests triggered by
brutal ethnic violence

51
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:12,210
directed against the Uyghurs
and caught on camera.

52
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:15,030
China's aggressive response
to the Uyghur uprising

53
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:18,240
almost instantaneously
evolved into a particularly

54
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,930
brutal crackdown against
an ethnic minority.

55
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:23,800
According to some activists,

56
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,310
10,000 Uyghurs disappeared overnight.

57
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,640
And over the past decade,

58
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,739
it's estimated that
another million Uyghurs

59
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:32,250
have also disappeared

60
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,280
representing the biggest mass interment

61
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,720
of an ethic minority
since the third Reich.

62
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:41,050
Today, the Uyghurs represent
the most surveilled population

63
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:43,160
on earth, as China uses every tool

64
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,950
of digital authoritarianism,

65
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:47,850
to physically and
politically control them.

66
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,970
Tracking and measuring
their political appliances

67
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:53,833
with severe repercussions for
those deemed untrustworthy.

68
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:57,060
Hundreds of thousands
of surveillance cameras

69
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,550
with purposefully built-in bias.

70
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:01,670
Facial recognition software algorithms

71
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:03,660
tuned to spot the Uyghur face

72
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,230
as well as AI-powered sensors

73
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:08,100
invade every aspect of the Uyghur's life.

74
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,120
On mobile phones, the
state requires Uyghurs

75
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,540
to install a Nanny app with
algorithms tuned to spot

76
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:17,560
ideological viruses, chat
logs, referencing Quran verses,

77
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,880
Arabic script in image
files, Muslim sermons,

78
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,670
even purchases such as prayer
rugs and Islamic books.

79
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,769
Every movement of the Uyghurs is tracked,

80
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:28,890
and their phones are monitored remotely.

81
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:30,579
Every activity is logged.

82
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,800
They are stopped multiple times per day

83
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,480
at checkpoints and city perimeters,

84
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,280
so that their faces can be scanned,

85
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,700
their phones can be examined,

86
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:41,070
and even health data such
as height, voiceprint

87
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:45,380
and blood samples for DNA
can be extracted and matched.

88
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:48,799
All of this data is indexed, geotagged,

89
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,660
time-stamped, correlated and mined,

90
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:56,530
and used to actively
suppress, oppress and destroy

91
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:59,370
this ethnic and religious minority group.

92
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:01,080
Any attempt to avoid surveillance

93
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,860
by turning off or bearing their phones

94
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,690
or even freezing their data cards,

95
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:08,942
results in detention, questioning,
arrest or disappearance.

96
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:12,100
Xi Jinping has served as
the president of China

97
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,160
for over eight years.

98
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,130
And his goal of Chinese dominance extends

99
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,870
to the terrifying
intersection of surveillance

100
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,630
and artificial intelligence.

101
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:24,460
Xi's goal of deploying an
all-seeing surveillance platform

102
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:28,700
as the ultimate system of
social control using AI, NML

103
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:32,200
to identify and eliminate
dissenters in real time,

104
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,599
is closer to reality than we realize.

105
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,770
And the Uyghurs are his testing ground.

106
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:40,549
The future Beijing envisions,

107
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:43,090
is one where the Uyghurs
experiment is carried out

108
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:44,669
on a global scale.

109
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:46,380
A digital silk road with control

110
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,340
over telecommunications networks,

111
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:51,500
AI capabilities, cloud
computing platforms,

112
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,940
e-commerce and mobile payment systems,

113
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,600
all as part of the most
consequential surveillance

114
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,000
ecosystem ever conceived.

115
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,120
A society where AI enabled and networked

116
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,110
facial recognition cameras
embedded throughout cities,

117
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:07,290
and even in police gear,
correlate data in real time

118
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:11,410
from vehicles, smart homes,
smart watches, smart speakers,

119
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:14,340
phones, social media
platforms, payment systems,

120
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:19,159
instrumenting and monitoring
every aspect of our lives.

121
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,790
All of this data is analyzed
and used to generate

122
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:25,680
a social score so that the
state can determine in real time

123
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,310
who represents a threat, and
therefore must be dealt with,

124
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:33,000
and who is trustworthy
and should be rewarded.

125
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,020
In this future, our worth as individuals

126
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:38,870
is no longer the subject
of philosophical debate,

127
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:43,870
but measured simply in terms
of our utility to the state.

128
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:46,730
There is hope, surveillance technology

129
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:49,090
that's used to destroy
freedom can also be used

130
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:53,109
to report abuse and inspire
action to protect human rights.

131
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:56,690
For example, while China
continues to deny the existence

132
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:00,190
of Uyghur interment camps,
satellite imagery has confirmed

133
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:02,510
their existence as well
as the rapid expansion

134
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:05,150
to accommodate the
ever-increasing number of Uyghurs,

135
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:08,039
who continue to disappear
from their communities.

136
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,170
- China is an ideological super power

137
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:12,510
looking to restore itself
as a dominant economy

138
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:16,010
in the 21st century through
all means available to it,

139
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:19,599
sacrificing the individual to
the imperatives of the state.

140
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,000
It has a clarity of purpose
and demonstrated willpower

141
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,610
that is equal parts
inspiring and terrifying.

142
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:27,550
- Here in the US, where the
foundation of our government

143
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:30,780
is built on the sanctity
of the individual descent,

144
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,520
and the government's response to it

145
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,640
take a profoundly different shape.

146
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:38,120
- On January 6th, 2021, the 117th Congress

147
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,920
in the United States, was in session

148
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,600
to count the electoral college ballots

149
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,690
of the 2020 US presidential election

150
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:47,050
and confirm Joe Biden's
victory over Donald Trump.

151
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:49,070
Trump held a Stop the
Steal political rally

152
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:51,870
which was followed by a
march to the Capitol itself.

153
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:54,790
The match turned violent as a
group of right-wing extremists

154
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:57,910
stormed the Capitol building
to disrupt the count.

155
00:06:57,910 --> 00:06:59,530
In the wake of the Capitol siege,

156
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:01,429
you might've expected to hear loud demands

157
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,550
for greater surveillance
to prevent future incidents

158
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:04,900
of this nature.

159
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,320
There were some, but the bigger revelation

160
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,560
was the breathtaking
extent of surveillance

161
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,900
that was already available.

162
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,560
The New York Times
assembled a clear picture

163
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,240
of how the combination of
mobile phone advertiser

164
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,370
and social media data can
be used to fully reconstruct

165
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:22,400
one man's participation in the riots.

166
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,912
Starting with his trip
from home in Kentucky,

167
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,600
to his time at Trump's rally,

168
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,190
all the way to the steps of the Capitol,

169
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:32,660
a deleted Facebook posts
clearly documents him

170
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,860
at the steps of the Capitol
during the insurrection.

171
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,530
Then, available geolocation data suggests

172
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:42,859
he was inside the capital itself
which was further confirmed

173
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,383
by a ping from his phone.

174
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,290
Tracking individuals like Ronnie Vincent,

175
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:49,030
is yesterday's news.

176
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:51,500
Our ability to track
entire groups of Americans

177
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,093
is now readily available
and increasingly free.

178
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:57,430
An example of this is the
faces of the riot site

179
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:59,840
created by a college student
in the Greater DC area,

180
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,840
who use open source software
to identify 6,000 pictures

181
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,349
of people's faces at and
around the riot on January 6th.

182
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:09,510
The data was sourced from
the Parler Social Network

183
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:12,099
when hackers exploited a bug
that allowed for extraction

184
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:15,030
and analysis of over 800 videos.

185
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:17,510
In a complete role reversal from China,

186
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:20,180
US citizens use of surveillance
is being used to inform

187
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,660
the government's understanding

188
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,810
of what happened at the insurrection.

189
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:26,630
- If the Uyghur crisis in China
and the capital insurrection

190
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:29,719
in the US give us views into
how each country reacted

191
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,060
to unique events,

192
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:33,950
the pandemic provides a
historic opportunity to study

193
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:38,059
how the US and China reacted
to the same catalyzing event.

194
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:40,969
- On January 30th, 2020, the
World Health Organization

195
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:45,010
declared the COVID-19 outbreak
a global health emergency.

196
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:47,630
Each country responded with
its own values and culture

197
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,660
and the differences between their actions

198
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,219
could not be clear.

199
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:53,010
China mobilized all
tools of national power

200
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:55,120
to fight the pandemic,
control the narrative,

201
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,810
and project an image of total
control over the outbreak.

202
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:01,469
The US responded with a
patchwork of government remedies

203
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:03,010
conspiracy theories,

204
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:06,090
and businesses were left to
fill the resulting vacuum.

205
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:09,430
- China's response to the
pandemic was swift and severe.

206
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:11,939
It immediately instituted
a strict lockdown

207
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,680
in Hubei Province, tens of
thousands of checkpoints

208
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,050
were set up and public
transportation was suspended.

209
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:18,770
In cities and villages across China

210
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:22,100
declared an all-out people's
war on the coronavirus

211
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,780
using surveillance technology,
surveillance cameras,

212
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,949
facial recognition and
mobile tracking apps

213
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:28,680
as their weapon of choice.

214
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,050
Cameras were installed inside homes.

215
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:33,699
Ostensibly, to enforce quarantines.

216
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,730
Drones equipped with loudspeakers tracked

217
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:38,260
and chastised citizens
ignoring the lockdown

218
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:40,210
and GPS and temperature tracking tools

219
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:42,650
together with automated
contact tracing apps

220
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:45,750
were used to control and
contain the spread of the virus.

221
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,150
All of this was augmented

222
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:49,890
with a robust human surveillance
network that kept tabs

223
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:53,050
on citizens and enforce government rules.

224
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,000
A man with a high temperature
at a shopping center

225
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,650
slipped away on a motorbike
and was quickly tracked

226
00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:00,780
down at his home by officials
using a citywide network

227
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,890
of facial recognition cameras.

228
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:06,020
in Tianjin, over 9,000
people were quarantine

229
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:09,110
as officials used facial
recognition cameras

230
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:11,700
to identify shoppers who had
visited a department store

231
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,560
linked to a COVID outbreak.

232
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,439
That the cameras stored
footage for 90 days,

233
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,990
was critical for
effective contact tracing.

234
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:22,250
The pandemic normalize the
broad rollout of a tracking app

235
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,890
across hundreds of
cities throughout China.

236
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,900
The Alipay Health Code,

237
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,329
which correlates self-entered information

238
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:33,340
with a user's digital footprint
across the Alibaba platform.

239
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:36,460
Issuing a simple green,
yellow, red QR code,

240
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,190
which not only dictates
whether individuals

241
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:40,910
should be quarantined or
allowed into subways, malls,

242
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:44,319
and other public spaces, but
also shares that information

243
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,380
with police setting a
template for new forms

244
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,230
of automated social
control that could persist

245
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:53,250
long after the pandemic subsides.

246
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,540
Controlling its population,

247
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:57,569
was only part of China's
COVID containment strategy.

248
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:01,380
The other part involved controlling
China's COVID narrative.

249
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,020
as the US and the world struggled

250
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:06,079
with overwhelmed healthcare
systems and rising death tolls,

251
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,210
China used both censorship and propaganda

252
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:09,800
to spread a very different narrative

253
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,130
about its handling of COVID.

254
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:15,360
From suppressing early reports
on the emergence of the virus

255
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,330
to online censorship of any
content critical of Beijing,

256
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:21,250
to attempt to compromise medical research

257
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,250
into COVID-19 vaccines,

258
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:26,650
China launch an effective
global influence campaign

259
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:30,680
and worked tirelessly to
project a global model

260
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,689
for pandemic response and leadership.

261
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:36,500
Narrative that can be
challenged by technology.

262
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,333
HawkEye 360

263
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:38,920
is a new surveillance capability

264
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,290
that uses a constellation
of satellites to track

265
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:43,939
radio frequency signals around the globe.

266
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,410
In April, 2020,

267
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:48,660
as Beijing announced that the
pandemic was under control

268
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:52,870
and that 70% of the docks in
Wuhan, were back to operating.

269
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:56,720
HawkEye 360 imagery showed
something very different.

270
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,190
That the port was essentially
still shut down to traffic,

271
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:03,790
casting doubt on Beijing's
claims that life in Wuhan

272
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:07,719
was almost back to normal, there is hope.

273
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,290
Surveillance technology can serve

274
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:12,010
as a source for ground truth, when facts

275
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:13,400
are in dispute.

276
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,600
- Well, China declared an all-out war.

277
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,350
The United States from
the federal government

278
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:19,620
to state leaders, to individuals,

279
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,220
were ambivalent and often confused

280
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:24,980
about the best path forward
especially in the early days.

281
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:27,920
Contradicting narratives, wild speculation

282
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,800
and a culture of
individualism at all costs,

283
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,280
led to confusion, paralysis and action,

284
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,573
and ultimately tragedy.

285
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,310
In most jurisdictions, there
was no contact tracing,

286
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:39,479
and where it existed,

287
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,270
it was for the most
part an opt-in process.

288
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:45,060
Instead of state-instituted
digital surveillance platform

289
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:48,339
reinforced with a network of
human monitors and the police,

290
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:51,140
the US left it up to people,
companies and states,

291
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:53,730
to develop their own containment strategy.

292
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:56,190
As a result, the United
States still doesn't have

293
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:58,643
a functioning contact
tracing infrastructure.

294
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:03,070
As estates-instituted revised
and reverse pandemic protocols

295
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:05,320
on a disturbingly frequent basis,

296
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,560
Company CEOs stepped
in and became sometimes

297
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,729
the primary source of
facts and information.

298
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:12,620
They regularly communicated
with their workforce

299
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,960
about the steps that were
taking to keep them safe,

300
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,430
and jointly created a
virtual work environment

301
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:19,859
that met their employees
competing demands at home

302
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:22,500
especially during lockdowns.

303
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:26,780
Fever Camera Sales resulted
in a massive explosion

304
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:29,810
during this time purchased
largely by concerned businesses,

305
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:32,119
rather than government mandate.

306
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,650
Not surprisingly, in January, 2021,

307
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:37,550
Edelman published its trust barometer

308
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,500
which showed that for the first time

309
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,410
business replace government,

310
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:44,770
as the most trusted
institution by the US public

311
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:47,214
and it was seen as being
twice as competent.

312
00:13:47,214 --> 00:13:49,320
- Through protests and pandemics,

313
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,340
China's relationship with
privacy is very clear.

314
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,073
It has no use for it.

315
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,930
- The United States
relationship with privacy

316
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:58,992
on the other hand is deeply conflicted.

317
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:02,370
In order to understand China's position

318
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:05,300
and the US's ambivalence,
we need to first grasp

319
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,423
how each country arrived at this moment.

320
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:11,260
- Privacy is a modern
construct that has grown

321
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:13,150
out of the rise of industrialization,

322
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:15,439
urbanization and increasing wealth.

323
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,750
Throughout most of human history

324
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,740
not only was there no concept of privacy,

325
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:21,280
it wasn't even possible
given how humans lived.

326
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,620
Homes had no internal walls,

327
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:26,540
bedrooms and beds were communal,
baths were taken in public.

328
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,959
Every member of a community was a spy

329
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,900
observing the activities of
other members of the community.

330
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:34,550
Or really innovations such as
the postcard, the telephone,

331
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:37,270
the telegraph, actually decreased privacy

332
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:39,410
giving strangers the ability
to peek into the lives

333
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:41,430
of their friends and their neighbors.

334
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:42,900
During the American Civil War,

335
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:45,079
President Lincoln did not hesitate

336
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,870
to grant his Secretary
of War Edwin Stanton,

337
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:51,740
the unfettered ability to tap
telegraph lines and intercept

338
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:55,140
all communications as
part of the war effort.

339
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:59,010
The term right to privacy,
was coined in 1890

340
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:01,660
by future Supreme Court
Justice Louis Brandeis,

341
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:04,650
as a reaction to an
emerging tabloid industry

342
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:07,650
fueled by the advent of
photography and audio recordings.

343
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:10,079
Newspapers had begun
publishing embarrassing facts

344
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,660
about private lives and affairs

345
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,819
and Brandeis felt that
a line had been crossed.

346
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:15,980
It took another 80 years

347
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:18,510
in the seminal Fourth
Amendment case Katz v. US

348
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:21,080
for the concept of a right
to privacy to be recognized

349
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,840
by the US Supreme Court.

350
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,620
Since that decision, as
a society we've struggled

351
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,100
with the concept of privacy.

352
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,810
What it means, what should be protected

353
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:30,849
and how it should be protected.

354
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:33,890
Even as we debate and enact
a tapestry of privacy laws

355
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:36,550
that attempt to protect and
govern the use of our data,

356
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:40,550
we continue to instrument our
bodies, our homes, our cities,

357
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:44,790
our workplaces, increasingly
enabling ubiquitously

358
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:48,370
deployed sensors to capture
all the signals we emit.

359
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:52,790
Create a pattern of life, and
sell it to whoever will pay.

360
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:55,490
- Unlike the US, China
has an epic tradition

361
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:59,030
of using information flow
for power understanding,

362
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:01,640
the value of surveillance
and securing that power,

363
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,569
and using surveillance
to control its people

364
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:05,420
and root out dissent.

365
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,030
China has a long history

366
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:09,010
of creating prolific intelligence networks

367
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:11,140
and controlling the flow of information.

368
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:14,000
From the Song dynasty's use
of locals to monitor residents

369
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,850
with elegant walled
cities in the 11th century

370
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:19,390
to the great Khans who 200 years later

371
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:22,010
devise the most sophisticated
intelligence network

372
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:23,310
of their time.

373
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:26,060
The Khan's Yam System,
use the network of spies

374
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:28,589
throughout the merchant trade routes

375
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:30,000
to communicate information at the rate

376
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,120
of two to 300 miles per day.

377
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,100
Later, Chiang Kai-shek's use
of self-policing citizens

378
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,270
to report an anti-communist dissidents,

379
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:40,420
further demonstrates
China's effective rule

380
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,550
of its complex empire,

381
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:45,183
by collecting and controlling data flows.

382
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:49,550
Even the internet has succumb
to China's world vision.

383
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,130
China's great firewall
controls both the access

384
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:54,420
and by extension the spirit of its people

385
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,319
by banning any content that challenges

386
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,360
the singular authority of Beijing

387
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,410
in order to realize
Mao's masterline vision

388
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:04,040
emerging the consciousness
of 1.4 billion people

389
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,262
with the consciousness of the state.

390
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:10,130
Mao's vision had tragic consequences.

391
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:14,210
From 1958 to 1962 in his
desire to transition China

392
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:17,339
from an agrarian to an
industrialized communist society,

393
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:20,369
Mao's Great Leap Forward,
resulted in the deaths

394
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:23,639
of approximately 45 million people.

395
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:27,349
Most die from starvation, some
from beatings and torture,

396
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:29,669
and others from suicide.

397
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:32,150
China will drive to achieve its ambitions,

398
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:34,520
regardless of the cost.

399
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,710
Like Mao, Xi has prioritized
strengthening the party

400
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:41,210
inculcating collective
socialist values and rooting out

401
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:44,630
non-believers like the Uyghurs.

402
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:45,660
What should be terrifying

403
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:48,010
it's not just China's domestic ambitions,

404
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:51,480
but its global and the role
that technology is playing

405
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,430
as Xi competes with
authoritarian ruthlessness

406
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:57,360
to become the dominant
world economic power.

407
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,110
- Culture and history's
collision with crises

408
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:01,889
such as protests and pandemics,

409
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:04,520
is one reason we're experiencing the rise

410
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,020
of surveillance states.

411
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:08,210
The other driver of course is technology,

412
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:12,450
and the rapid pace of surveillance
technology innovation.

413
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:14,040
Regardless of culture and history,

414
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,720
independent of current
events, technology innovation

415
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,830
has put the very concept
of privacy at risk.

416
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:22,669
The past 20 years have
ripped science fiction

417
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:25,445
out of the pages, Isaac
Asimov and George Orwell

418
00:18:25,445 --> 00:18:28,629
and thrust them directly into our lives.

419
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:32,210
The boundaries between art
and science are so tenuous,

420
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:34,960
that a prescient warning
for our present reality

421
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,730
was a Hollywood movie.

422
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:39,040
- Modern surveillance is
not a single technology

423
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,649
but more akin to a tightly
connected ecosystem,

424
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:43,740
made of three parts.

425
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:47,550
Firstly, sensors that capture
images, metadata and more.

426
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:50,970
This includes everything from
CCTV cameras, mobile phones

427
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:53,580
and wearables to low
Earth orbit satellites.

428
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:57,510
Secondly, signal, the data
created by the sensors.

429
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:59,210
Surveillance signal has
evolved from a series

430
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:01,340
of time-lapse black
and white still images,

431
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:05,330
taken from a considerable
distance to high definition TV.

432
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:07,970
Fusion of physical and digital data

433
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:09,590
has emerged independent sources

434
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:14,090
into an unyielding panoptic
view of the entire planet.

435
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:16,780
Lastly, artificial intelligence
is used to make sense

436
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,920
of the signals coming from the sensors.

437
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,620
Instead of sifting
through mountains of datas

438
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,870
for a sliver of signal that matters,

439
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,439
AI such as deep learning
automatically matches

440
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,550
what is needed with
increasingly breathtaking speed

441
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:29,693
and accuracy.

442
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:33,970
While all three aspects of
surveillance necessarily

443
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:36,880
function together, each one
on its is complex enough

444
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,610
on its own to deserve its own focus.

445
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:42,342
In this spirit, we'll
begin with the sensors.

446
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:48,130
In 1998, there are already
CCTV cameras in abundance.

447
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:51,220
Drones existed, but primarily
for military purposes.

448
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,450
And the first spy satellite
had already been in space

449
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:55,460
for nearly 40 years.

450
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:58,170
The internet was in its infancy
and surveillance sensors

451
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:01,343
were limited in quantity,
capability and type.

452
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,570
Against the backdrop
of increasing tensions

453
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,810
in the Middle East and
concern over weapons

454
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:09,460
of mass destructions, Lawrence
Livermore National Labs

455
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:12,570
was actively looking for ways
to identify and track people

456
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:16,240
of interest in countries
such as Afghanistan and Iraq.

457
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,660
- A researcher from
Livermore found inspiration

458
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,600
in the movie, "Enemy of the State"

459
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:24,340
in which a fictional surveillance
system called Big Daddy,

460
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:26,944
was used by a rogue NSA cell

461
00:20:26,944 --> 00:20:28,550
to mercilessly track Will Smith.

462
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:31,250
This inspiration catalyze
Livermore's exploration

463
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:33,980
of how a real world Big
Baddy surveillance system

464
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:35,920
might be built that
could identify and track

465
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,110
foreign scientists suspected
of creating weapons

466
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:40,000
of mass destruction.

467
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,920
Following the terrorist attacks of 9/11

468
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,300
And America's subsequent invasion of Iraq,

469
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:47,060
this research became the bedrock
of the militaries response

470
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,450
to the vexing problem

471
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:51,650
of improvised explosive devices or IEDs.

472
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:54,110
The first fruits of this
effort was Constant Hawk

473
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:56,550
which allowed the army to move
from a whack-a-mole approach

474
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:59,830
to dealing with IEDs,
to proactively tracking

475
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:01,770
and rooting out the network of people

476
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:03,970
responsible for the attacks.

477
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:06,720
- In 2006 following Hurricane Katrina,

478
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,160
the FAA allowed unmanned
aerial vehicles or UAVs,

479
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,670
namely consumer drones to
fly in civilian airspace

480
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:17,170
for the very first time as
part of disaster response.

481
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:20,700
By then, the iPhone had
ushered in a new era in mobile.

482
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,770
Facebook had reached widespread adoption,

483
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:25,020
and Twitter was right around the corner.

484
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,510
As if in response to the
forthcoming data flood,

485
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:31,310
Amazon released their Simple
Storage Service or AWS-S3

486
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:34,082
as a landmark advancement
in the public cloud.

487
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,959
Innovations in surveillance technology

488
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,980
advanced in the following
years by leaps and bounds.

489
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:42,250
Consumer wearables became the norm

490
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,850
creating a steady stream
of personal health data.

491
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:48,070
Body cameras were adopted
in 2014 by police forces

492
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,929
in key locations throughout the country,

493
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:52,030
to create an indisputable record of truth

494
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:54,580
for both police and citizens.

495
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,879
Consumer-driven surveillance
in the form of ring doorbells,

496
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,170
were launched around the same time.

497
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:02,370
Fast forward to today, where
the headlines include Digidog

498
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:06,729
a Boston scientific robot
priced at $80,000 being enlisted

499
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:09,950
by the NYPD and what is simply
the next step in a trend

500
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:13,040
of robots being used for
both safety and surveillance.

501
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,470
- What happened Big Daddy?

502
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:16,780
The all-seeing eye hypothesized by enemy

503
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:18,980
of the state, we're close.

504
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:21,620
Commercial satellites have
achieved 100% coverage

505
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:22,510
of the planet.

506
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:25,610
And within five years,
revisit rates will drop

507
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:27,229
to an hour or less.

508
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:30,160
The price per square kilometer
surveilled has dropped

509
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:34,480
from over $100 per kilometer
to 18 cents or less.

510
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,480
CloudCover, the longtime
enemy of Satellite vision,

511
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:41,470
is pierced by synthetic aperture
radar to provide visibility

512
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:43,960
all the way into the soil itself.

513
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,740
Launching satellites used to
be prohibitively expensive.

514
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:50,760
SpaceX, has almost democratized
satellite launches.

515
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,830
Earlier this year in a single flight,

516
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:56,699
SpaceX launched a record 143 satellites

517
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,260
on the Falcon 9 Rocket.

518
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,290
SpaceX's low-cost frequent launches

519
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:04,100
have made commercial satellite
launches cost-effective.

520
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:07,240
You pay by the kilogram
and obtain a quote online.

521
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,180
Today, the price for launching a satellite

522
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,990
can be under $100,000
for a device built with

523
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:15,930
off-the-shelf components that
you can carry in your arms.

524
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:19,150
You can task these satellites
with apps like SpyMeSat

525
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:20,810
using your smartphone.

526
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:23,260
Prices range from the
low hundreds of dollars

527
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:26,030
to thousands of dollars for
images of varying quality.

528
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:29,260
And they're available
for purchase to anyone.

529
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:32,600
The Iranian government use
commercial satellite imagery

530
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,409
to monitor Ayn al Asad airbase in Iraq

531
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:36,580
as it prepared to launch

532
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:39,000
more than a dozen ballistic missiles at US

533
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,270
and coalition forces on January 7th, 2020.

534
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:44,129
- So what happened to Big Daddy?

535
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:48,510
The US government didn't
end up creating it, we did.

536
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:52,160
As we stand here in 2021, we
built a complex web of sensors

537
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:55,500
from the soil to the sky
through phones, drones,

538
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,670
space flights and social networks.

539
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:58,860
The view available for purchase

540
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:01,209
into the most intimate
aspects of our lives,

541
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:04,030
makes the forecasted creepiness
of enemy of the state

542
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:05,763
look quaint in comparison.

543
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:09,410
Now the progression of signal or data

544
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:12,630
has been equally staggering
over the past 20 plus years.

545
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:14,630
Given video's central role in tracking,

546
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:16,040
it will be our focus.

547
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,360
But as we showed at the
Capitol insurrection signal

548
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,860
from social media, mobile phones

549
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:23,209
and a myriad of other
sources, all form the fabric

550
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:25,480
of a modern surveillance network.

551
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:28,420
As an example, here's how
commercially available cameras

552
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,940
have progressed since 1996.

553
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:33,010
We began with sub megapixel cameras

554
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:35,440
that produce soda straw
images of small areas

555
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,350
with poor grainy pictures,

556
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,449
all the way to today's gigapixel cameras

557
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:41,223
with high definition resolution.

558
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:45,280
On the left is an
example of an image taken

559
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,520
by Project Angelfire in 2007

560
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,190
which was the marines wide
area surveillance initiative.

561
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:53,400
On the right-hand side, is an
image from one of the leading

562
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,493
commercial surveillance cameras today.

563
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:59,000
It is simply impossible
to meaningfully reason

564
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,700
about all of this data
without machine assistance.

565
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,790
This is the domain of
artificial intelligence

566
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:06,139
from machine learning to neural networks,

567
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:08,573
which complete the surveillance ecosystem.

568
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:11,270
While machine learning
and other types of AI

569
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:12,820
contribute to surveillance,

570
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:15,050
deep learning, based facial recognition

571
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:17,010
is quickly becoming the foundation,

572
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:21,129
as allows for automated
identification of humans at scale.

573
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:24,960
From its roots in Palo
Alto research in the 1960s,

574
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,620
advancements in neural
networks and deep learning,

575
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:31,129
coupled with billions of
images from social media

576
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:33,740
to train them on, have
delivered facial recognition

577
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,923
at scale and consumer quality.

578
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:40,380
The most controversial use
case for facial recognition

579
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:43,010
is Clearview AI, which
scrapes the internet

580
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:44,790
to build a service use by law enforcement

581
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:48,639
to match any picture of a person
to billions of other images

582
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,480
within seconds through a mobile app.

583
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:54,530
At its best, child exploitation
cases have been solved

584
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:57,090
using Clearview AI and horrifying abuse

585
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:59,919
has been ended by equipping
police with unprecedented

586
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,370
investigative capabilities.

587
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:05,409
At its worst, it foreshadows
the end of privacy

588
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:06,690
in public spaces.

589
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,620
Stalkers can use this kind of technology

590
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,870
to locate prey effortlessly.

591
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:13,989
In public spaces, anyone can
identify the people around them

592
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:17,510
within seconds and likely also
access personal information

593
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:21,240
such as their income, family
members and much more.

594
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,570
The difference between
responsible law enforcement

595
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:25,300
and widespread abuse,

596
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:28,960
today, it is only a startup
company's corporate usage policy

597
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,670
and business model.

598
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:33,280
- Even with all this, the
biggest issue in the future

599
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:36,450
is not likely to be
Clearview AI in the US.

600
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:38,690
But the global adoption
of Chinese technology

601
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:41,980
and their increasing supremacy
in artificial intelligence.

602
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,710
In an AI powered future,

603
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:46,070
the winner will be
whoever has the best data,

604
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,770
not only does China have the most data

605
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:50,900
on their own population, but
with their increasing dominance

606
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,430
in global deployments of
surveillance technology,

607
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:55,610
they have the best data
for facial recognition

608
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:58,300
and computer vision, period.

609
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:00,540
Consider the number of places
where Huawei's equipment

610
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:02,050
is being used across the world,

611
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:04,720
and their visibility into
communication networks.

612
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,960
Consider the number of
Chinese tourists worldwide

613
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,130
who are driving widespread
adoption of Alipay

614
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:10,610
and WeChat Pay.

615
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:12,419
China will soon not
only have the best data

616
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:15,010
for facial recognition,
but a level of visibility

617
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:18,640
into the global community
that no one can contest.

618
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,370
Harnessing the disruptive
power of mobile broadband,

619
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:25,100
China intends to link an
additional 2 billion people

620
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:28,179
to a global marketplace
configured by Chinese technology,

621
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:32,160
Chinese Industrial Organization
and Chinese finance.

622
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,990
- The path to that future is
being paid by two countries

623
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:38,240
that stand in direct
opposition to one another.

624
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,700
Today, this great power
competition is being fought

625
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,500
with technology and the
country that can leverage

626
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:45,200
its power best, collect the most signal,

627
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,850
harness the most data,

628
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:49,480
will have the long-term
strategic advantage.

629
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,610
The winner has not yet been declared,

630
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:53,840
but time is not on our side.

631
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,740
We stand at a crossroads and must decide

632
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:58,730
whether we lead our societies
to the future we want,

633
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:02,870
or follow these powers to
the future that we get.

634
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:05,219
Each one of us has a decision to make.

635
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,610
- China is leading to
an authoritarian future

636
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:10,290
powered by surveillance
technology with a global sphere

637
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:12,620
of influence that while not so entrenched,

638
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:16,330
it can't be reversed, is growing
quickly and strategically.

639
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:18,740
Xi's One Belt, One Road Initiative,

640
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,570
has grown from its original vision

641
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:23,689
of closing the gap between
China's booming coastal cities,

642
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:26,800
and it's an impoverished
interior to a project

643
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:31,283
of the century that now
encompasses 139 countries.

644
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:35,510
In this future, individual
rights, civil rights,

645
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:38,879
civil liberties and
any concept of privacy,

646
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,610
are subservient to the
ambitions of the state.

647
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:43,149
- Rather than leading to a future

648
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:45,940
that embraces technology as a
means of preserving the ideals

649
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:48,000
of a Western liberal democracy,

650
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,770
the United States seems to have
lost its strategic ambition

651
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:53,793
and its global leadership
position is slowly slipping away.

652
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:57,210
Our ossified public
institutions are embroiled

653
00:28:57,210 --> 00:28:59,070
in hyper partisan bickering

654
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,540
unable to enact enduring
policies that survive

655
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:03,480
from one administration to the next.

656
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:07,360
And our society is polarized
and being pulled apart.

657
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,240
- A healthy functioning
democracy is predicated

658
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,820
on citizens making informed
choices and this in turn rests

659
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:16,230
on the quality of the
information they receive.

660
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:19,490
The media, which historically
enjoyed a faulted position

661
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:22,130
as the trusted primary source
of news and information

662
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:25,110
has all been abdicated
that responsibility,

663
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:28,120
feverish chasing virality over veracity,

664
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:32,239
becoming increasingly politicized
and polarized as a result.

665
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,810
Our technology platforms
only exacerbate this problem

666
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:39,200
as our solidarity as a society
disintegrates into tribalism.

667
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,570
In this future, despite
our best intentions,

668
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:44,879
our crumbling global sphere of influence

669
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,560
and internal ranker, prevents
us from getting ahead

670
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,990
of commercial enterprise
to set the right policies

671
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:51,850
and regulations that protect privacy,

672
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:54,050
civil liberties and individual rights

673
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:57,070
in the face of rapid
technology innovation.

674
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:59,293
- And yet, there are glimmers of hope.

675
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:03,220
Holding onto the vestiges
of democratic principles,

676
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:06,110
We can imagine a world where
CCTV cameras are used to alert

677
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:09,159
and stop police brutality
before it turns deadly

678
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,970
as was almost the case
when a 911 dispatcher

679
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:15,580
alerted a police supervisor,
when she saw the CCTV footage

680
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:18,480
of police officers holding
down George Floyd for so long

681
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,580
that she thought for a moment,

682
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:20,929
the image must be frozen.

683
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:23,470
- We can imagine in a world
where wearable centers

684
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:26,980
and continuous biosurveillance
alert doctors and patients

685
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:29,220
to medical emergencies and save lives

686
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:31,450
with early detection as is the case today

687
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:34,000
with continuous glucose
monitoring sensors.

688
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,920
- We can imagine a world
where drones are used

689
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:38,350
to support the fight
against rampant wildfires,

690
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:40,790
as well as time-sensitive
search and rescue missions

691
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:44,000
to locate missing stranded
and injured Individuals.

692
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,940
- We can imagine a world where
our respect for human life

693
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:50,230
and human dignity defines
every choice we make,

694
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:54,130
every action we take and
every policy we enact.

695
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:57,910
This world may seem out of
reach, but it's within our grasp

696
00:30:57,910 --> 00:31:00,390
- To get there, you have to
fight for the future you want.

697
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:02,100
Every person and every business leader,

698
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:05,379
every politician, every policy
maker, every journalist,

699
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:08,500
every technologist has a role to play.

700
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,680
- Will you lead to the future you want,

701
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:14,293
or follow to the future
get, the choice is yours.
