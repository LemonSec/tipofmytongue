00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:02,570
- Hi, this is Shannon Lietz.

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:04,760
I'm super excited to be here

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:07,220
with the RSA Conference

4
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:08,603
for 2021.

5
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:13,090
My talk is called The State
of the Union of DevSecOps

6
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:17,290
and I have been a prior speaker with RSA.

7
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:20,393
I started in the industry quite a bit ago.

8
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:24,300
I've been giving talks on
DevSecOps for some time.

9
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,960
My interests are all

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,740
very centered around technology and

11
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:34,339
I have a couple of little
girls who like to do ballet.

12
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:38,130
I'm really keen on helping
the industry to transform

13
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:42,230
to deal with some of the things
in security that are needed

14
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:44,640
such as metrics and

15
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,343
having more women in tech.

16
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:48,560
Just a little bit about me.

17
00:00:49,901 --> 00:00:52,230
I work currently at Intuit and I

18
00:00:53,794 --> 00:00:57,160
prior worked at ServiceNow and Sony

19
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,293
and many other companies as well.

20
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:01,940
Today I'm gonna talk to you a little bit

21
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:04,379
about the state of the union of DevSecOps,

22
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:07,401
the good, the bad and
the ugly, if you will.

23
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:08,350
And

24
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:10,949
feel free to drop a line into chat.

25
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:14,210
I'm gonna be taking
all of the information.

26
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:15,210
And if you have questions,

27
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:17,589
feel free to put those into the chat.

28
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:21,570
As I ask questions, feel
free to answer in the chat.

29
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:23,342
And here we go.

30
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:25,260
So

31
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:28,510
when you start to think about the journey

32
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:30,950
that we've all been on for security

33
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:33,250
and technology and DevSecOps,

34
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:36,530
and this is a slide to
help us get oriented,

35
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:38,500
it's been a long journey,

36
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,160
decades, if you will.

37
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,080
Software quality

38
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,970
started the journey for what I believe

39
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:48,400
is the security transformation
that's been going on.

40
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,810
And in 1976, there was a paper written

41
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:54,020
that helped to frame up the -ilities.

42
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,420
It's a great paper.

43
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,240
And if you're interested in it,

44
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,410
chat me and I'll send you the link.

45
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:03,560
This is a big monumental cornerstone

46
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,300
of how we've gotten to
the point in security

47
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,030
where we are today.

48
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:10,310
If you look along the way,

49
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:12,430
the software quality -ilities,

50
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:14,690
essentially security was baked

51
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:16,700
into software quality,

52
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,750
but not at a primary level,

53
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:23,350
actually one level deep into
integrity in that paper.

54
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:26,350
Along the way, you can see

55
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:29,650
that we saw firewalls and
vulnerability scanners.

56
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,110
Actually there's a whole
bunch of work that was done

57
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,330
on intrusion detection systems

58
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:35,500
along the way,

59
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:39,000
and that started to
create the advancements.

60
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,400
And in 1992, there was some work done

61
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,560
around vulnerability
scanners and firewalls.

62
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,250
I think it's really critical to understand

63
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,310
that as part of this effort,

64
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,530
you can see, as an example,

65
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:55,020
OWASP started to come in 2001

66
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,110
with applications and
application security.

67
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:01,960
It was basically right
around then that we saw

68
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:05,720
that the internet was really
becoming more prevalent.

69
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,350
We saw more investment in software

70
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:11,200
and software security was
starting to become more

71
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,083
of a big issue.

72
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:17,609
Site reliability, Google
got started on that journey

73
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:20,860
and they've been on that quest ever since.

74
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:24,520
And you could see a variety of
different dimensions to this.

75
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,150
In 2012,

76
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:28,960
I was working with a bunch of different

77
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,070
folks and we realized

78
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:34,810
that DevOps was something
that was really here to stay

79
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:37,070
and that the cloud was here to stay

80
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:40,010
and that software was never
gonna be the same again

81
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:40,843
because they were really

82
00:03:40,843 --> 00:03:43,799
software-defined infrastructure
and capabilities.

83
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,570
And so that transitioned
us into things like

84
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:50,503
trying to figure out how
to make security built in.

85
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,480
DevSecOps got started around then

86
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,899
and we've been on that quest ever since,

87
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,040
and now we're in 2021.

88
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:00,560
It's not yet a 10-year journey,

89
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,710
but we're slowly creeping
up on it in 2022.

90
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:06,380
And it'll be interesting to see how that

91
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,880
transforms us over the next

92
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,970
couple of years.

93
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:11,800
And to be able to talk about it,

94
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,757
I think the question that I get is,

95
00:04:14,757 --> 00:04:17,070
"okay, great, so we're in DevSecOps

96
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:19,230
and there's a lot of
companies that are doing it,

97
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,810
maybe not doing it.

98
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:22,350
Is it a marketing term?"

99
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:23,780
So today I'm gonna talk
to you a little bit

100
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:26,979
about the success, the
failures, the epic battles,

101
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:30,380
what's next, what is
happening in the industry?

102
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,120
And I've got some data points for you

103
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,720
to help you to understand how to

104
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,670
determine where you are in the journey

105
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:40,130
as well as understand what
else is happening around you

106
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:42,293
to be able to take that into perspective.

107
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:44,710
So the successes,

108
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:46,960
everybody always wants
to know the successes.

109
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:51,160
I think one of the biggest
things that has come

110
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,620
up with the successes is that

111
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:57,230
truly DevSecOps has led to alignment,

112
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,060
better alignment of security

113
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,350
to the business, to development,

114
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:04,700
to being able to articulate
what is happening

115
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,550
from a security endeavor

116
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:09,123
and really trying to
figure those things out.

117
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:13,100
Then when you think about alignment, this

118
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,260
picture started kind of my
quest and my journey was,

119
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:19,810
DevOps was helping to frame
up how you got to build

120
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:22,630
software, and then how
it eventually became

121
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:26,550
something and how you actually

122
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:30,310
made this become a customer capability.

123
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:31,660
And then along the way

124
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,810
you kinda went through
the prototyping phase

125
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:38,090
and you checked your code into
software versioning systems.

126
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:40,940
So you can see how GitHub and GitLab

127
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:44,290
and some of those companies
have come to life perforce.

128
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:48,373
And so there's that continuous
integration, the test suites.

129
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,650
All of these things became
part of that pipeline.

130
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:53,849
It's known as the continuous
delivery pipeline.

131
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:55,320
And then along the way

132
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,180
and when we were thinking
about DevSecOps, well,

133
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:00,620
what did it take to
really look at software

134
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:03,930
and essentially build security in?

135
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:04,970
I've seen things like

136
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:07,230
the secure software
development life cycle.

137
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:08,840
Those things are definitely part

138
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,940
of what helped to influence
some of this picture.

139
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:16,130
And in aligning what we were
doing with the business,

140
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:17,969
it was basically, how do we actually help

141
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,200
the business to understand

142
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,370
when they're building trust
back into the software

143
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:25,410
and how they're doing it from
a shift-left perspective.

144
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:28,053
And this led some of
the shift-left thinking.

145
00:06:29,505 --> 00:06:33,890
So in every great story are
the stars of that story.

146
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:36,530
The way I think about
this journey is really

147
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:39,650
about trying to figure out
who the stars of a story are

148
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:43,010
and articulating the story around them.

149
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:44,969
And when you start
thinking about successes,

150
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:47,540
the secure software supply chain is really

151
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:51,733
about customers, software
enablement, and employees.

152
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,743
Essentially, these are the basic elements.

153
00:06:54,743 --> 00:06:57,670
There's a whole bunch of
complexity that's underneath these,

154
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:59,880
but at a top level, if you were to

155
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,659
take the software supply chain,

156
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:04,310
really divided into these four categories

157
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:08,060
and essentially think about
how we're doing as an industry.

158
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:11,610
We've got much more security
in our software supply chains.

159
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:12,900
It's not ideal yet,

160
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,239
but there are successes and
wins that have happened.

161
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,600
As an example,

162
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,260
being able to build security checks

163
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,280
and capabilities such as scans

164
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,419
and SAST and DAST into the pipeline

165
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:27,820
to check software before it
becomes a production capability

166
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,840
has been something that's
really been a monumental effort

167
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,080
and actually something
that's helped us to be able

168
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,870
to look at these successes in that way.

169
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,800
Employees are becoming more aware.

170
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,510
There's a lot more focus on enablement.

171
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:43,700
The cloud is an enabler.

172
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:47,349
And when I started with
this journey in 2012,

173
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:49,630
if you looked around at that
time, there wasn't a lot

174
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:52,909
of security capabilities
in the cloud at that point.

175
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:54,590
And today, that's not true.

176
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:57,200
Most of the clouds out there that we

177
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,510
take advantage of, the cloud providers,

178
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:02,620
their capabilities have a
lot of security features

179
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,930
and capabilities that
are available for anyone

180
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:08,130
to be able to create a single line of code

181
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:11,980
and add a key to a
specific type of encryption

182
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:14,120
or you might wanna have monitoring.

183
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,810
Those are something that you can turn on.

184
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:17,530
And in many cases,

185
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:20,659
the cloud providers are now
doing these things by default

186
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:23,000
and it's really exciting to see.

187
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,690
So along that thought process,

188
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:28,140
I found a bunch of different

189
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,310
inputs for us to talk about.

190
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,830
One of the ones to think
about that was really exciting

191
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:34,049
was to see that

192
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:35,669
Forrester has been studying

193
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:38,039
the application security testing market.

194
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:40,549
What's really neat is to see that SAST,

195
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:42,880
something that security professionals

196
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,439
have been well aware of,
have been learning about,

197
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,000
have taken on in terms of complexity,

198
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,250
that it's starting to to make

199
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,800
a transition and be transformed

200
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,790
such that SAST tools are now
starting to be more focused

201
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:58,839
on the developer as a customer

202
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,880
and

203
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,080
really making it so that that
tool chain is easier to use,

204
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,530
but there's actually an ability

205
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:07,280
for the findings to be ticketed,

206
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,870
that work management as part
of the development process

207
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:13,350
is really thought about
with those tool chains.

208
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:15,250
And I think that's a critical element.

209
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,310
Another critical well success
we've been able to achieve

210
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,270
if you look at the success that's going

211
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:25,260
on along the way for DevSecOps,

212
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,010
it's top-level support.

213
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:31,240
A great piece of information
that I found was from Gartner.

214
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,440
They said that we're basically seeing

215
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,360
that DevSecOps got 20 to
50% of its target audience

216
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,680
that's already been attracted and working

217
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,719
on the DevSecOps transformation
in their organization.

218
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,550
And in their hype cycle,

219
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,000
you can see that DevSecOps
is pretty far along

220
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,800
and in a maturing phase of its journey.

221
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,620
And that's really keen to see.

222
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,840
I think that that helped
us to really see that

223
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,673
not only

224
00:09:56,673 --> 00:09:58,540
are we

225
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:01,140
making this transformation
as practitioners

226
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,740
but that you're seeing buying behaviors

227
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:07,200
and you're seeing attention in this space

228
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,030
to bringing software the
security it deserves to have,

229
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,760
and that's important.

230
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,917
Another thing that was
said by Gartner was that

231
00:10:15,917 --> 00:10:18,830
"DevSecOps is in early mainstream".

232
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:23,160
That is really neat to
see after eight-ish years.

233
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,600
I would say

234
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,670
when you start to see
something going mainstream,

235
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:29,630
you see that people are
talking about it continuously,

236
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:30,990
that you're having the debates

237
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:33,320
and the banter that goes along with it,

238
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,450
those are also crucial milestones

239
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:39,610
and knowing that what we're
doing is making software safer.

240
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:41,030
As part of early mainstream

241
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:43,100
we're seeing more and more
software being published

242
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,350
with the vulnerabilities being lessened

243
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:47,700
and that companies are doing things

244
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,500
like blocking their bills

245
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,020
when a security issue comes to life

246
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,340
so that the number of defects

247
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,373
are actually reducing quite a bit.

248
00:10:57,030 --> 00:11:00,290
And so I did a little bit
of a study to go figure out,

249
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:02,730
well, where are we with the journey

250
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:05,597
from the vantage point of
tooling and capabilities?

251
00:11:05,597 --> 00:11:09,210
And I have a bunch of other
slides and former presentations

252
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,910
where I talk about some of the products

253
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:13,040
that actually lie in this space and

254
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,900
I did a little bit of investigations,

255
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,900
mathematics in the background
'cause I'm a big geek

256
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,730
and like to do the mathematics

257
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:20,760
of figuring out where things are.

258
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,680
And in assessing these
different places, you can see

259
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,250
that DevSecOps is having a profound effect

260
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:29,820
in getting security into the
right places of the pipeline,

261
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,100
that there are more and more products

262
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,490
that are getting matured,

263
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:35,060
that they're starting to make strides.

264
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,380
The green boxes here

265
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:40,270
are really the ones that are
the most heavily focused on,

266
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,300
in terms of products,

267
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:44,270
that they're being adopted readily

268
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,730
that you see practitioners
that are talking

269
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:48,960
about the concepts in these areas.

270
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,470
The yellow boxes are not quite there yet.

271
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:53,460
You are seeing things being invented.

272
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:56,340
You're seeing open
source start to show up,

273
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,660
but they have a little bit of ways to go,

274
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:01,040
and that, that is a
pretty healthy place to be

275
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,170
when you have about two to five years left

276
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:05,022
before plateau in a space.

277
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,730
I don't know if I fully agree

278
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:11,873
with DevSecOps being ready
to plateau necessarily,

279
00:12:12,892 --> 00:12:15,010
because I think there's
still so much innovation

280
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:16,480
to make this space

281
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,810
more graceful, more elegant,
that the products are,

282
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:21,869
while they're wonderful and complex,

283
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:23,470
that they could be more

284
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:24,710
easily

285
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:25,910
accessible.

286
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:28,209
And that along this pipeline

287
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:30,060
you could get to the point
where some of these start

288
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,199
to converge and you could see

289
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,860
consolidation across
some of these dimensions.

290
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,000
As an example,

291
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,920
seeing that code analysis
is starting to make its way

292
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,030
into software version control

293
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:43,857
with things like GitHub and GitLab

294
00:12:43,857 --> 00:12:45,680
and some of the places
where you might check code

295
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,670
into a version control system

296
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:49,189
is a really neat thing to see

297
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:52,460
because the products in code analysis

298
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:55,340
do help us to make sure
that software that we build,

299
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,920
not just the stuff that we integrate

300
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,650
but the stuff that we actually
build as practitioners

301
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:01,680
is being thought about at the time

302
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,469
that it's being checked in and
a pull request is being made.

303
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:05,750
It's also neat to see

304
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:09,070
big products out there
that are becoming unicorns

305
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:11,510
in this space, such as Snyk

306
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:13,910
and some of the other things like

307
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,000
Code Dx.

308
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,100
You have a lot of different
dimensions to this problem.

309
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,830
And I think it's really
neat to see that there's

310
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:23,420
a whole bunch of practitioners

311
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:26,402
and vendors that are trying to
make this space even better.

312
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,680
So another piece of the puzzle here

313
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,770
is DevSecOps product categories

314
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:34,439
are starting to really show up.

315
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,110
And I thought this was pretty neat

316
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:38,540
because basically transformational,

317
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:40,300
I mean Gartner is saying that this

318
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,680
is a transformational effort

319
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,400
that you should be investing in DevSecOps,

320
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,319
that it will really truly bring benefit

321
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,400
and value to your company
in extraordinary ways.

322
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,220
We've always believed that
in the work that I've done

323
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:54,410
with peers in the industry,

324
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:56,990
and to see it being stated at this point

325
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:59,370
in the 2020 Report was really exceptional.

326
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:01,030
I think that's a big success and win

327
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:02,880
for the people who have
started to adopt it

328
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,500
that have been really pushing on:

329
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,710
What is DevSecOps?

330
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:07,660
How do we actually make software better?

331
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,839
How do we really fully
understand our supply chains

332
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,513
and get to the next level?

333
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:14,677
The next one here is...

334
00:14:14,677 --> 00:14:15,510
And I pulled...

335
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:16,470
This was really great.

336
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:18,840
I found something that
helped us understand

337
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,660
what the CAGR is for

338
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,510
DevSecOps as a marketplace.

339
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:24,360
And whenever you see

340
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,620
whether something is
really successful or not,

341
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:29,690
you see a buying behavior
that's looking for new products,

342
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:31,320
that's looking for ease of use,

343
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,080
that's trying to really morph the space

344
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,390
in terms of the feedback

345
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:38,140
and the feature use and development.

346
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,960
And this is an exceptional growth rate

347
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,290
for 2021

348
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:43,612
to 2028

349
00:14:43,612 --> 00:14:46,550
for DevSecOps and in the DevOps market.

350
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,920
To see that security is
really being embraced,

351
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,150
that we're getting more traction,

352
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:53,640
it's I would say, as a
security practitioner,

353
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,460
it's sort of a dream come true to see

354
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:58,150
that more and more folks are starting to

355
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:00,470
understand that they need
to have their products

356
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:04,633
not just be customer-worthy,
but security-resilient as well.

357
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,449
So the other thing to note,

358
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:08,950
and this is a really great thing

359
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:11,310
is anytime you're doing something

360
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:14,500
that you believe in and
you see academic interests,

361
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,650
you've kind of arrived.

362
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:19,650
Academia showing up and being able to look

363
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:22,130
at Grey Literature to see if
they should invest their time,

364
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,570
their conclusion was

365
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:26,700
that there's increasing
attention in this space,

366
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,890
that there is an ability
to do more in innovation.

367
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:31,090
And their assessment,

368
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:33,360
which was a little different
than the marketing assessment

369
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,640
and I always kinda like
to compare the two,

370
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,260
is that DevSecOps is in its infancy.

371
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:40,610
Now, while they're looking at literature,

372
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:41,760
they're looking at at quite a bit

373
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,970
of the information that's out there,

374
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:45,050
I thought this was a really good study.

375
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:46,920
If you wanna know about it,
just ask me for the link.

376
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,990
I'll put it in the chat.

377
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:49,390
You can go and take a look at this.

378
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:51,550
I thought it was pretty incredible work.

379
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:54,729
And I found other articles
in academia as well

380
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:56,560
that are starting to study the space

381
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,969
to help us to understand where
we could see more traction.

382
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:03,530
There is opportunities
to reduce false positives

383
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:05,030
in some of the products

384
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:08,370
to make them more
developer-friendly, accessible,

385
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:09,770
that there is an opportunity

386
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:12,600
to bring more adversary
knowledge to the forefront

387
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,840
and have developers be able
to determine what their

388
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,720
traction is gonna be against
adversaries on the end

389
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:23,410
and have that ideal state of
being adversary-resilient.

390
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:26,589
Another thing to think about
too is workforce investment.

391
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:28,330
Where are we really seeing successes?

392
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:30,513
And this is a lot of jobs, by the way.

393
00:16:31,489 --> 00:16:34,290
6,400 jobs, just in the last little bit

394
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:37,959
and 8,400 jobs posted on LinkedIn.

395
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,310
If you think about these things,

396
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:42,357
just getting workforce growth in a space

397
00:16:42,357 --> 00:16:44,620
and starting to see the job show up

398
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,480
means that companies are really investing,

399
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,270
that they know that this is important,

400
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:50,390
that they're actually
making that commitment

401
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:52,439
by opening up the workforce

402
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,000
to being able to do this work

403
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,530
and to spend effort on making sure

404
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:58,420
that it's part of their business.

405
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,933
That's another counted success.

406
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:04,639
Another one to note too is

407
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,829
just how much money people are making

408
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:09,189
in DevSecOps and their salaries.

409
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:10,560
Looking for the understanding

410
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,240
of what the average salary is from talent

411
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,630
was a really cool thing to see

412
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:16,720
because now all of a sudden you can see

413
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,720
that there is an investment
that is price-positioned,

414
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,640
that there is more and more effort

415
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,810
being made to secure software,

416
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:26,419
that we're seeing that
the supply chain itself

417
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,800
is getting this investment.

418
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,899
And while academia believes
it's in its infancy,

419
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,010
that does mean too that
there's career growth

420
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,450
in this area of expertise.

421
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:37,600
You're seeing things like
DevSecOps architects.

422
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,860
You're seeing stuff like
DevSecOps engineers.

423
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:41,459
You're seeing a

424
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,020
promotion path associated with DevSecOps

425
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:46,033
and career growth overall.

426
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:48,840
Now, let's talk about the failures.

427
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,790
Everybody always wants to talk

428
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:51,610
about the failures and the epic battles.

429
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:53,129
So successes are nice to see

430
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:54,610
'cause that's actually
what helps us to know

431
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:56,209
that we're going in the right direction,

432
00:17:56,210 --> 00:18:00,090
but failures can be quite
a bit interesting too.

433
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:02,970
And one of the things to think about is

434
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:06,520
with upskilling as an
example, and career growth.

435
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,060
I just talked about the benefits

436
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:11,230
and the successes
associated with DevSecOps

437
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:12,890
from a career perspective,

438
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:15,560
but what we're also seeing,
which is the other side

439
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,800
of the coin when it comes to DevSecOps,

440
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,129
is that while there's a lot of jobs open,

441
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:22,800
upskilling and career growth right now

442
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,040
are also a challenge in this space.

443
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,700
So going back to these

444
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,320
6,400 jobs and 8,400 jobs,

445
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,110
how fast are they being filled?

446
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,620
Is there demand in this space?

447
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:34,179
And actually what you're finding

448
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:37,110
if you study it a lot, like me,

449
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:39,780
is that you find that there is a need

450
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,330
for more DevSecOps skills,

451
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:43,820
that we're seeing more DevOps come forward

452
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,460
and they have compliance skills

453
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:48,010
but they don't necessarily
have the monitoring skills yet

454
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:49,300
or the testing skills yet.

455
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:52,639
And we have to, as an industry,
start to focus on those

456
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,600
as a primary reason why we'll
have better software security.

457
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,699
If we start to invest in those areas,

458
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,930
we'll have upskilled folks.

459
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:02,500
They can actually do more.

460
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,590
They can automate more.

461
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:05,310
They're gonna be able
to build security in.

462
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:08,610
And we as an industry have
to find a way to really

463
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:12,379
create that organically
with the help of vendors,

464
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,430
with the help of academia,

465
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:17,180
with the help of making
sure that there's a way

466
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:20,060
for us to distill a career path and a role

467
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,940
that allows people to determine the skills

468
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,740
and the craft skills that they need.

469
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:27,147
Another thing to think
about that's not been

470
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:29,270
a true

471
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:30,570
failure but maybe one

472
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:33,100
that actually has been holding things back

473
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,260
is,

474
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:37,930
and I found this, it was a GitLab study,

475
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:42,160
13% of companies are
giving developers access

476
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,060
to the results of their dynamic

477
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,800
application security tests.

478
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:49,120
Only 13% was concerning
from my perspective.

479
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,760
Access is a big thing.

480
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,700
Sharing is really critical.

481
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,540
And as security practitioners, I know

482
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:57,540
that I grew up in this industry being told

483
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:00,680
that we needed to keep the
understanding of security

484
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,480
close to our chest, and
we needed to make sure

485
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,870
that only a few people knew about it.

486
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:09,300
And that may just not
have been the way forward.

487
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,820
We need to make sure that developers

488
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:13,340
own their security decisions,

489
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:16,159
that they're making product choices

490
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,260
and they're picking up
things that are actually

491
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,379
gonna make their software resilient enough

492
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:23,070
based on the adversary
profile of their software.

493
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:26,129
And so I think that you have to liberate

494
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:28,590
information about defects and bugs

495
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:30,290
from a security perspective.

496
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:32,659
It'd be interesting to
hear what you think.

497
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:35,530
So in the chat, why don't
you tell me what you think?

498
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:37,350
I think it's a place
where we should liberate

499
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:39,000
the information for our developers

500
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,930
so that they can understand
how to fix things

501
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:43,740
and how to prioritize and
to really build that up.

502
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:47,790
But everybody is entitled to
their decisions around this.

503
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:51,540
It is something that I
think will help the industry

504
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:54,070
for us to all provide more
and more of this information

505
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:56,100
and even make the tools accessible enough

506
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,822
that they can be self-service.

507
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,590
Another area that's been a failure

508
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:02,419
so far has been false positives.

509
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,010
I hear it every place I go.

510
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:07,510
Every time I talk about
DevSecOps, every discussion,

511
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:09,520
there's something about false positives.

512
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,120
I also think the false
negatives are a thing as well,

513
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,719
but false positives is really plaguing

514
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,440
the DevSecOps space.

515
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,990
And in particular,

516
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:20,090
if you look at it,

517
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:21,620
the code review

518
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:24,159
tools that are out there,
just really overwhelming

519
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,610
in terms of false positives.

520
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:27,620
Now false positive from the standpoint

521
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,260
of a developer or a business person

522
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:32,480
bringing something in is very different

523
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,220
than a false positive understanding

524
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,360
by security practitioner.

525
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,810
We'll talk a little bit
about that in epic battles

526
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:39,950
because there's sort
of a language barrier,

527
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:41,363
but I think it's really
important to understand

528
00:21:41,363 --> 00:21:43,970
that DevSecOps is truly
being held back by this

529
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:46,550
and this may be something
that we need to figure

530
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:49,360
out how to solve through
things like orchestration

531
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,800
and there needs to be a
little bit more investment

532
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,440
in trying to understand
what DevSecOps orchestration

533
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:57,840
could do to help alleviate
some of the stress and pain.

534
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:58,673
Now

535
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:03,020
somebody's false positive is
it's a debate, back and forth.

536
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,650
And I also think that the other reason

537
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:07,130
why false positives exist
is that there's really

538
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:10,010
a lack of understanding
about what the true

539
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:13,290
resiliency problem is or that
the adversary opportunity

540
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,649
is not fully understood or appreciated.

541
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:17,270
So there's still a little bit of debate

542
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:19,190
about whether it's really a false positive

543
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:20,880
or it's just being misunderstood.

544
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,500
And I think there's gotta
be some more clarity

545
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,833
in that space as well.

546
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,570
Audits, if you've been doing DevSecOps

547
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:29,100
for even a little bit of time,

548
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:32,810
I've been doing it now
for a long period of time,

549
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:35,879
audits are definitely a critical issue

550
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:39,860
and cause quite a bit of consternation.

551
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:42,899
It seems to be that most of the standards

552
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,643
and regulations out there
are written truly for

553
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,750
somebody to be able to do an audit

554
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,730
at the end of a life cycle.

555
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:53,950
And in this case, it really
does become detrimental

556
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:57,320
because if you're trying to
build security into the pipeline

557
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,760
and you're actually
being asked to do things

558
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,520
that are manual or that
you're having to spot check

559
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,040
and you're having to work
in that runtime behavior

560
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:08,370
to prove out the security of your software

561
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:10,590
or your supply chain,
what you're gonna find

562
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,610
is that that actually
will also pull you back,

563
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:15,469
that people will actually
chase what they're being asked

564
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:16,990
to be audited against

565
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:21,990
as opposed to some of the new
forward-leaning activities.

566
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:24,750
And so from a dearauditor perspective,

567
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,310
this was something that came up.

568
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:28,220
I haven't seen it get
much traction just yet.

569
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:30,280
I really have been pushing on it.

570
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,460
And you'll notice here,
it's only got 24 stars,

571
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:35,290
but if I could ask
anybody to put investment

572
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:37,690
into a place that's
really gonna have returns

573
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:40,610
it is in this space that we need to solve,

574
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:44,449
that truly, we've got to
advance our audit criteria

575
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:47,040
around the cloud, around DevSecOps,

576
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:50,310
around what we expect in
terms of control behaviors

577
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:52,639
and really make it become more

578
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,300
of a resilience mechanism
so that we understand

579
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,770
that we're making risk
decisions that are based

580
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,430
on true adversary behavior,

581
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:02,620
that we are taking risks
based on what we understand

582
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:04,570
the adversary risk are taking.

583
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:06,080
And I can't say it enough,

584
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,500
this is a true thing that we actually have

585
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:11,050
to disrupt to be able
to make a stride forward

586
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:13,889
to get to the point where it could become

587
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:16,700
or DevSecOps could become more mainstream,

588
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,410
from my perspective.

589
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:20,660
Now, onto the epic battles.

590
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,080
All right, so

591
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,270
everybody always likes to
hear about epic battles.

592
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:27,023
It's probably my favorite
place to talk about too.

593
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:33,030
We talk a lot about culture
in DevOps and in DevSecOps

594
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:36,389
and culture in primary is always an area

595
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:38,023
where everyone talks about,

596
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:39,940
it is

597
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,100
all about the culture

598
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,240
that actually creates these opportunities

599
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,670
for us to do things like DevSecOps.

600
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:48,050
And I'll tell you, the epic battles,

601
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:50,240
one of the great books
that you can go read about,

602
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,320
and if you don't have the link

603
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:54,169
send me a chat and I will
give you a link to this,

604
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:57,820
but "Epic Failures in DevSecOps"
was written a while back

605
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:00,360
and there are some great stories in there.

606
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,860
And there's some really, truly

607
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,929
interesting data points for folks

608
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:06,850
that are trying to go
through this journey.

609
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:08,080
Where are the frameworks?

610
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,360
Where are we investing

611
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,199
in terms of making it
easier and more accessible?

612
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,990
Do we wanna solve that for the industry?

613
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:16,100
Is it something that's gonna be...

614
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:20,100
Is your DevSecOps program
gonna be a one-size-fits-all?

615
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,530
Is there a place to do it right or wrong

616
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:25,120
or do you just need to use
the tools and the capabilities

617
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,423
and really form your own?

618
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:30,450
Language is another critical area.

619
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:32,060
And

620
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:33,610
an epic battle here is

621
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:36,250
whenever you see people
talking about something,

622
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:38,180
you see them have an understanding

623
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:40,230
of words from their perspective

624
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:42,800
but maybe not the full
community's perspective,

625
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,909
and language is an issue.

626
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:47,770
I had this pop-up in
the last couple of days

627
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:50,070
and I thought it was
really relevant because

628
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:52,500
the question was, if security
is everyone's responsibility,

629
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,940
then why does DevSecOps exist?

630
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:56,910
And I think it's really
crucial to understand

631
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:59,600
that everyone's responsibility is security

632
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,000
when you build something
and you have to make sure

633
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
that what you did is secure enough,

634
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,250
that you understand the
adversary opportunities

635
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:07,900
and you rationalize that.

636
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,860
It doesn't mean that
any one particular role

637
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,740
is gonna take over security

638
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:15,890
of the company or the security of

639
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:18,970
a product line that has
many, many people in it.

640
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:21,030
It means that as

641
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:23,580
practitioners, we each have to rationalize

642
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,310
the security decisions we make,

643
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,340
that we're understanding

644
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,919
how to make those security decisions

645
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,610
and that we're part of this team

646
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:32,149
that helps to make software resilient.

647
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:34,710
I think that we have to spend more effort

648
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:36,970
on not trying to have language

649
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,810
get in the way of these things,

650
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:40,730
but to help enable us.

651
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:43,540
And another area, it really is...

652
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:45,930
I saw this in the GitLab Report as well

653
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:47,110
and this was kind of interesting.

654
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:48,120
We had a whole bunch of data points

655
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,786
about who thinks they own security.

656
00:26:49,787 --> 00:26:52,870
And the truth is, is that in this space

657
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:54,912
it's really owned by everyone.

658
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:57,810
Security, the word,

659
00:26:57,810 --> 00:26:59,240
has many facets to it.

660
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,200
Operations folks are making sure

661
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,460
that in the stack that the
products are actually getting

662
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:06,610
operational security elements,

663
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:08,870
that there are things that are happening

664
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:11,010
and decisions being
made by developers like,

665
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:13,180
Hey, which encryption should I be using?

666
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:16,160
Security practitioners should
be offering up solutions

667
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,580
and things that could be
used that are gonna make

668
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:19,929
the products more resilient.

669
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:21,410
And so they may be building some

670
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:22,780
of the security capabilities.

671
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:24,280
And then, testers.

672
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,530
I love seeing when testers

673
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:29,129
believe that they're doing the
security job of the company

674
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:31,290
because truly they're making sure that

675
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:33,690
customers are getting the best products,

676
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:35,520
but it also means that
security is starting

677
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,240
to make its way into quality decisions

678
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,270
in a way that it hasn't been in the past.

679
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:41,940
And that's really, I think,

680
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,850
while an epic battle,

681
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:46,812
a serious opportunity to have another win.

682
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:51,010
So target states' also
something that I think

683
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:53,030
is really been misunderstood

684
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:56,300
and it's still something that
we're all battling about.

685
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,370
What do we mean by a target state?

686
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:01,360
I see that everybody's kind of
counting DevSecOps a success.

687
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,919
And I don't wanna disrupt that,

688
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,620
but I think it's really
crucial to understand

689
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:07,570
that the software supply
chain is so much more

690
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:09,870
than the continuous delivery pipeline

691
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:13,389
and we might be being a little bit myopic.

692
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:14,840
This is

693
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:18,209
a data point for everyone, is
to look at things like this,

694
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:20,140
where you're actually looking
at supply chain attacks

695
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:21,270
and this was mapped out.

696
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:22,430
Again, I'll provide the link

697
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:24,430
if you're looking for this paper.

698
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:27,850
When you look back at all the
materials that are out there,

699
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:29,919
MITRE's been doing a lot
of this information work

700
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,530
for quite some time to
help people to assess

701
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:35,170
and build decision frameworks around this.

702
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:37,100
And I think it's a critical importance

703
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,669
that you can see in that bottom

704
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:42,330
right-hand corner, that
primary production software,

705
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:44,050
that is the continuous delivery pipeline

706
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:46,070
but you can see that
there's attack opportunity

707
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:47,520
across the supply chain

708
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,010
in so much more than just that one box

709
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:52,240
and we have to take
that into consideration.

710
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,550
So the battle for target
state of DevSecOps

711
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:57,350
is something that I believe

712
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:58,183
that

713
00:28:58,183 --> 00:29:01,990
is the reasoning and rationale
behind why academia thinks

714
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:05,100
that it's still in its infancy,

715
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,840
but that the marketing
folks are still thinking

716
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,199
that it's gonna be something

717
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,010
that's gonna be plateauing soon.

718
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:13,540
So I think there's just a
little bit of a disconnect there

719
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:16,200
and a mismatch that we have to solve for.

720
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,140
Adversaries are still an epic battle.

721
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:21,360
When you start to look at what's happening

722
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,300
and what are the top hacking vectors

723
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,070
and where are things happening,

724
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:28,280
web applications are really
high on the list right now

725
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:31,149
in terms of where attention is being paid.

726
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:34,160
You also see things like
desktop-sharing software.

727
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,260
And I will tell you in studying this,

728
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:37,850
this is one perspective,

729
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:41,020
and it was primarily a
perspective given by companies

730
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:44,300
that are really studying this space.

731
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,460
If you study other parts
of the supply chain,

732
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,380
you'll find that they
have the same elements,

733
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:50,020
but maybe in the reverse, like

734
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:52,410
actually if you look into the anti-malware

735
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:53,480
and some of those spaces,

736
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,390
you see that they're actually showing

737
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:57,700
a different perspective of this data

738
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,960
in a different dimension.

739
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,620
And it means really what we're seeing is

740
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:02,899
adversaries are leveraging
some of the things

741
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,800
that are great about what we like,

742
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,000
which is the advancements of clouds.

743
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,960
They're using it in a very adversarial way

744
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,753
and we have to get that
to be a forefront for us.

745
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:14,830
Perfectionism is another one.

746
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:17,090
I'd say I'm sure you're aware of it.

747
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:18,919
Spending a lot of time
on trying to make sure

748
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,460
you get every single thing done

749
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:23,070
and that software is
perfect before it comes out

750
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:26,879
can really hold back the
DevSecOps' maturity phase.

751
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,730
I think we really have to
solve for adversary resilience

752
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:31,690
and we have to get to the
point where perfectionism

753
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:34,230
in certain places is really crucial

754
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:36,520
versus that everything has to be done,

755
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,889
this notion that we're gonna have

756
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:40,180
a checklist approach to DevSecOps.

757
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:42,360
I'm not quite sure I'm there yet

758
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,550
and I could be talked into a lot

759
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:46,360
of things with a lot of data,

760
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,010
but for me,

761
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:49,570
this is a great

762
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:52,360
reference design and diagram
for folks that are trying

763
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,020
to envision a new set of

764
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,790
capabilities that are gonna help us

765
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:58,430
to make software more resilient.

766
00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:00,080
But I still think it has to get put back

767
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,620
onto that supply chain

768
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:04,590
and not just around the
continuous delivery pipeline

769
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:07,019
for us to get better at it.

770
00:31:07,019 --> 00:31:10,170
Measurement's another one where
we're all battling for it,

771
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:12,730
really, who is doing security metrics?

772
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:14,480
And sadly, I did this

773
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:18,350
check to find out how much

774
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:20,379
we have to go for this and I'd say,

775
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:22,300
DevSecOps metrics are really,

776
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:25,419
really at their forefront
in the infancy stage.

777
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:27,000
I'm hoping to

778
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,530
start to provoke more
conversation around this.

779
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:33,040
I wanna start to create
an exchange on metrics

780
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:35,770
and try to help the industry
to make sure that we're talking

781
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:38,950
about things like secure ability
and adversary resilience.

782
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:40,700
It's been a quest for me for some time.

783
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,420
I've always been very metrics-driven.

784
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:44,040
It's one of the things in my background

785
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,399
that you'll find that I'm

786
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,530
a big believer that if
you wanna do something,

787
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:49,226
well, you've got to figure
out how to measure it.

788
00:31:49,227 --> 00:31:51,520
And I think this is an
area where we really have

789
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,070
to battle it out and get to the point

790
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:54,620
where we're in agreement on metrics

791
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:57,760
that are really gonna move the
needle for software security.

792
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,760
So what's next?

793
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:02,530
What's the one last bit
of this stage and puzzle?

794
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:04,570
I think that adversary management

795
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:07,560
which is something that I'm
now doing for my organization

796
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:12,560
is a next generation of things
like red team and DevSecOps

797
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:15,510
and really having that conversation about

798
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:18,400
how do you balance
customers and adversaries

799
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,080
in terms of business decisions

800
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,720
and where you're gonna
spend your investment

801
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,910
in terms of the controls
and things that you're gonna

802
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:24,800
deal with,

803
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:28,990
and that in particular is a
sweet spot right now that I see

804
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,830
becoming a new conversation.

805
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:33,210
If you look around, folks
are now starting to talk more

806
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:36,620
about adversaries and
monitoring and things like that.

807
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:38,840
Security OKRs and metrics,

808
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,610
big on my list.

809
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:42,010
If you haven't read it,

810
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:45,270
read "Measure What Matters"
by John Doerr, fabulous book.

811
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:47,080
There's a lot of stuff
out there about OKRs.

812
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:49,870
Developers are really embracing OKRs.

813
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:52,476
You see that Google spent
a lot of effort on OKRs

814
00:32:52,477 --> 00:32:54,590
and I think metrics are really part

815
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:56,889
of what is gonna break
that glass ceiling in terms

816
00:32:56,890 --> 00:32:59,280
of making DevSecOps a forefront

817
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,070
and something that's really gonna

818
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:03,550
change and transform us for the longterm

819
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:06,020
in terms of the industry itself.

820
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:07,520
And then, fewer better suppliers.

821
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,500
I keep saying it over the years.

822
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,460
I think this is another guiding light

823
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:14,820
that we've got to be focused
on moving forward towards.

824
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,050
Security observability.

825
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:17,733
If you haven't spent any time
in the observability space,

826
00:33:17,733 --> 00:33:21,750
there's a whole bunch of new
work that's going on there

827
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,823
and I think that's a critical element.

828
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,283
The secure software supply chain,

829
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:30,159
it's not enough to say it's
a software supply chain.

830
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,510
I really think we do have
to add that word to it

831
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,690
that says it's a secure
software supply chain

832
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:36,500
so that we put the emphasis there.

833
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,960
We are seeing

834
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,700
really big attacks in the industry

835
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:42,820
that are starting to focus
primarily in this space because

836
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,450
it's not mapped out well.

837
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:45,480
We're

838
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:48,410
focused too heavily on the
continuous delivery pipeline

839
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:51,900
and we've got a perspective
that's too myopic, I believe.

840
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:52,860
And we've got to back up

841
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:55,280
and really look at the whole
dimensions of a business

842
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,870
to understand what could get
in and where do we wanna spend

843
00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:00,332
and invest to make something more secure.

844
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:03,240
Folks are spending and
investing in this area

845
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:06,320
and I'm seeing things that
may actually need to be

846
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:09,480
put in place for enablement
technologies, like laptops.

847
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,580
How safe are the laptops when
you're bringing new libraries

848
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:15,170
onto those machines as
development machines

849
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:16,929
and you're connecting
into these environments?

850
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:18,690
We really do have to find

851
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:20,360
more effort in the industry

852
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:23,080
to make innovations in this space.

853
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:26,799
So if you want to go and start to do work

854
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,699
around making strides
and and understanding

855
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:33,020
how to bring DevSecOps into your company,

856
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:34,210
the next thing you should do

857
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:38,550
is really figure out how to
drive DevSecOps outcomes.

858
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:40,699
Figure out what you need to achieve

859
00:34:40,699 --> 00:34:44,250
and create a common set of definitions

860
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:47,260
I think it's critical for that to happen.

861
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:48,659
Within the next three months,

862
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:50,509
I think that once you've kind of embraced

863
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:52,270
whether or not you're doing DevSecOps,

864
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:53,770
what you could be doing about it,

865
00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:55,570
whether some of these battles are

866
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:57,400
also happening in your organizations,

867
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:00,460
what you also could be highlighting.

868
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:02,840
Now you might wanna get involved in things

869
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,100
like finding out what your
critical objectives are,

870
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,330
identifying the metrics,
getting some OKRs,

871
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:09,370
defining security resilience,

872
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:11,859
understanding the adversary
dwell time and baseline

873
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:15,320
for 30 days on your
applications and your software,

874
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,570
really articulating
that as a understanding

875
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:18,630
of what you need to do

876
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:20,510
and whether the investments
you're making in security

877
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:23,100
are really bringing
that number down or not.

878
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,750
And that will be, I think,

879
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:27,300
instrumental in what you do

880
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:30,340
for the next six months to several years

881
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:32,070
is that your DevSecOps tools have

882
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:33,930
to actually be more accessible,

883
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:35,759
that it has to become more graceful.

884
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,010
Orchestration is gonna become a big deal

885
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,130
when it comes to DevSecOps.

886
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:41,090
We can't just have all
these point solutions.

887
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:43,340
It's too hard to bring all
that information together.

888
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:44,960
We've got to solve for

889
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,870
a view of the software supply chain

890
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:50,200
that makes it so we can
make DevSecOps a forefront

891
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,049
and that software security is
really the ultimate challenge

892
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:55,420
and goal that we're all taking on.

893
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,880
So I'm really excited about this topic.

894
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:00,570
Wanna definitely have more
conversations in the chat.

895
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:01,880
Feel free to ping me.

896
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:04,980
I'm gonna sit here and have
some more conversations live.

897
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,330
And

898
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:09,720
if you're wanna start getting
more involved with metrics,

899
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,830
please ping me privately

900
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:13,270
on Twitter at DevSecOps.

901
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:15,120
You can also reach me on LinkedIn.

902
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,240
I'm always looking for folks

903
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,080
to collaborate within the industry

904
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:21,490
and help to change and
transform the industry.

905
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:24,899
So thank you for your time today, and

906
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:27,170
really excited about seeing what's left

907
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:29,690
on the agenda for RSA this week.
