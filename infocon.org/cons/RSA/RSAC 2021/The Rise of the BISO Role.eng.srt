00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:02,583
- Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:02,583 --> 00:00:03,813
Welcome to this session,

3
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:06,320
The Rise of the BISO Role.

4
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,790
My name is Manuel Chowrimootoo.

5
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:11,879
I'm currently a BISO at
Cogeco Communications.

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,810
Cogeco is a telecommunication company

7
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:17,500
headquartered in Montreal, Canada.

8
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,570
And the objective of this presentation

9
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:21,240
is to share with you my story

10
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,810
on this role that I took
a year and a half ago,

11
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:27,500
helping cybersecurity practice

12
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,810
to start from scratch in my company.

13
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,560
I want to share with you this experience,

14
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,280
what is the role of a
BISO, what is a BISO,

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,380
and how we implemented that practice,

16
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,550
show a few of the challenges, the success,

17
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,040
things that worked, didn't work.

18
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,980
So if you find yourself this role

19
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:47,160
you will have some information,

20
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,962
and also have your
feedback as well on this.

21
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:53,030
So let's start it.

22
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:54,370
So here is our agenda.

23
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:56,140
It's pretty packed full
with the time we have,

24
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:59,120
but we'll do the best
to get it done in time.

25
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,723
So first of all, we
choose the role of BISO,

26
00:01:01,762 --> 00:01:04,440
what we did to get started,

27
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,979
and what did to implement
cybersecurity as a service

28
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:10,390
in the company I work for.

29
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:12,889
And then, we'll discuss
about the focus on value.

30
00:01:12,889 --> 00:01:15,580
That is very important
indicators for the executive

31
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:18,399
that will pay the bills
at the end of the day.

32
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,243
And give you some key takeaway.

33
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:24,199
So first of all, let's
define what is a BISO.

34
00:01:25,353 --> 00:01:27,059
BISO is an acronym that stands for

35
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,970
Business Information Security Officer.

36
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:34,243
So in my role, I work within
the information security team,

37
00:01:34,243 --> 00:01:37,210
representing the interest
of the business mainly.

38
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:39,470
That's a key part.

39
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:42,210
So it's a very recent
role in organizations,

40
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:44,860
and why I wanted to
give that presentation,

41
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:47,500
actually, when I came to
my first RSA Conference,

42
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,120
last year in 2020,

43
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,180
I just started on this role

44
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,780
and I was trying to meet
other BISOs as well,

45
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,100
to share challenges,

46
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,369
to understand what was happening,

47
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:58,470
and get some information.

48
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:00,400
Unfortunately, I could hardly find one.

49
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,860
Of course, when I started,
I made some search on Google

50
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:08,199
and, at that time, it landed
me only on a very few articles.

51
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,899
If you make a similar search now,

52
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,770
you will start to get a bit more hits

53
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:16,100
than from what I could get in 2020.

54
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:20,940
And the quote I'm sharing
here from CISOSeries.com

55
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,760
summarize really very well

56
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,459
one of the main function
that I do everyday as a BISO

57
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,800
is to be a business enabler.

58
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,290
Basically, I don't say no to any team

59
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:34,120
that needs to to bring a
software on the network,

60
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,160
but always yes, but...

61
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,117
And I think that's how
it is most everyday.

62
00:02:40,117 --> 00:02:43,253
And you will see more in the next slides.

63
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,470
As I say, it's a very new role,

64
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,109
and if you hit search on Google

65
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,840
you can get a few articles.

66
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,160
I want to share with you here

67
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,180
some of the articles that you can find

68
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:57,360
and I highlighted in green
the main one that comes in.

69
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,900
As you see, things that
come a lot are a bridge

70
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,240
from the centralized security
function to the business,

71
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,510
understand the goals of the business units

72
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:09,079
and what it will need to protect,

73
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,663
and being a link between
business and technology.

74
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,760
So to give you a bit of
background, I'll say to you,

75
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,130
I joined a team that just
started out within my companies.

76
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:25,040
So 15 individuals started
in September 2019,

77
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,350
forming a new corporate cybersecurity team

78
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:30,489
under the leadership of the CISO.

79
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:33,683
I joined that team four
months later in January 2020.

80
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,430
And my mandate when I landed was basically

81
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,810
those four points I'm sharing here.

82
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:43,810
First was to get the team
known with the organization,

83
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:46,200
get the service catalog known.

84
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,769
There was a pressing need to
deliver cybersecurity services

85
00:03:50,706 --> 00:03:51,706
to the organization.

86
00:03:52,758 --> 00:03:55,070
I had to connect with the
different business units,

87
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:57,829
understand their needs, what
they needed from security,

88
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:59,606
what they understand, what
they don't understand,

89
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:03,190
and what we could do to help
and organize the deliveries

90
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:06,700
and provide regular support
to the business unit.

91
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,850
So that was basically
the high level points

92
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:10,829
of time and dates,

93
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:13,830
and based on that, I had to weed out

94
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,280
how we were going to do this.

95
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:19,899
So to explain to you how I'd
function in the company I am,

96
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:22,659
so this is our structure
and operating model

97
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,370
that would be, and it
can be very different

98
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,620
in your organization
or in your experience.

99
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,490
And this is what I live through.

100
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:30,200
If you look on the left-hand side,

101
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,760
we have the corporate functions.

102
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,900
So for instance, internal
audit, procurement,

103
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,450
legal, enterprise risk,
product management,

104
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:42,099
and some other IT teams that
are at the corporate level.

105
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,350
On the right and side

106
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:48,320
are the IT teams with which we deal with.

107
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,530
And I bring the role here

108
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:53,080
so we can see the difference
between the CISO and the BISO,

109
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,517
which the first question
that can pop into your mind,

110
00:04:55,517 --> 00:04:59,370
"Why a new role again in security space?"

111
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:02,076
The CISO interact more
at the strategic level

112
00:05:02,076 --> 00:05:04,020
between the corporate functions

113
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,503
and the CIO and the CTO,

114
00:05:06,504 --> 00:05:08,750
the IT leadership.

115
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:12,510
And in my role as a BISO, I do
a little bit of the similar,

116
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:15,330
but at a more tactical
and operational level.

117
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:17,349
So I will deal also with
the corporate functions,

118
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:20,150
but with IT architecture
and operations team

119
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:21,750
within the business units

120
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,160
we have different business units,

121
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,080
three mainly in different locations.

122
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,969
To give a very concrete example,

123
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:30,120
let's say for instance,
interaction with internal audits.

124
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,160
So the CISO will sit
on the audit committee

125
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,170
and interact with the VP internal audit,

126
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,420
understanding the high
risk of the companies,

127
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:40,810
the critical risks,

128
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:44,730
and having all the high level information

129
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:46,810
at this point, and be
the strategy of course

130
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:48,420
on how we can help

131
00:05:51,168 --> 00:05:53,300
to attack those risks, literally,

132
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,150
and be the strategic plan with the CTO.

133
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:59,000
At my level, I will take in a notch more

134
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,040
more on the field at a tactical level.

135
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,900
So I will interact with
the director of audit

136
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,909
and the auditor's directly,

137
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:06,840
understanding what kind
of findings they have,

138
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,919
what are the critical ones,

139
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:12,040
what are the important ones
that they need to be solved,

140
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,150
that need to be remediated?

141
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:16,900
So then, I can work with them
and the IT architecture team

142
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,280
within the business units
to have them implemented

143
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,349
and support to close them on the field.

144
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:24,610
And that's why we have
those two different layers,

145
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:27,170
more of the tactical and operational level

146
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:28,323
compared to the CISO.

147
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,300
So the first year we had to do work

148
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,780
to meet the key partners.

149
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:35,419
So I defined the key departments,

150
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,890
as I just showed in the previous slide.

151
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:39,539
So I had to meet, for instance,

152
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,660
with director of procurement,

153
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:41,666
the senior buyers,

154
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:44,510
project management office individuals.

155
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:46,880
So to get ourselves
known in the organization

156
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,507
where they didn't really know us,

157
00:06:48,507 --> 00:06:50,622
I had to plan a tour of duty,

158
00:06:50,622 --> 00:06:54,530
or cyber roadshow as
we call it internally.

159
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:56,650
I had to get to know each department,

160
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,109
understanding the structure,

161
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:00,980
how many people are in this department,

162
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,617
what is their workload,

163
00:07:02,617 --> 00:07:04,890
what are their previous experience

164
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:06,599
with cybersecurity, if any,

165
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,350
what did work well or not well,

166
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:11,143
and understand their process
very important as well.

167
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:13,700
So I plan my meetings around,

168
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,810
but that had to be my deck.

169
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:17,530
I had to go with with tools.

170
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:21,320
So I prepare a cybersecurity
deck to present our practice,

171
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,909
who we are, how we prepared we are

172
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:25,570
what we can do, what our service offers,

173
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,010
and also understanding what they need

174
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:29,710
to see if what we offer
are meeting their needs

175
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:31,880
or do you have to fine tune?

176
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,063
So that was one of the first step.

177
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,479
So that helped us to get started,

178
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,870
and I had to literally take
the show on the road now.

179
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:45,690
So having book my meetings,
having my cyber deck enhanced,

180
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:48,780
I could go meet with the business units.

181
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,729
So in this role, as the face

182
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:52,720
of the new cybersecurity practice,

183
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,730
I introduced myself to the tactical

184
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:58,160
and operational operational teams

185
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,100
by organizing face-to-face meetings

186
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:03,440
when this was still
possible in early 2020.

187
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,660
Since then, we had to
move everything virtual.

188
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,880
And the goals of all
this meetings I've had,

189
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,820
with for instance, the
internal audit or procurement

190
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:15,090
or legal was really to
first increase awareness

191
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:16,750
of the cyber security practice.

192
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,053
You have security team to reach out to.

193
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:22,479
We wanted to reach out to
departments responsible

194
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,380
for implementing IT assets,

195
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:29,380
who is bringing softwares on
the network, for instance,

196
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,520
and get security onto the
business unit's agendas.

197
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:36,549
So during all these interactions I had,

198
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:39,799
the key focus for me
was always to take out

199
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:42,250
and understand the people, the process,

200
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,280
and the technology at a high level,

201
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,530
understanding who is doing what,

202
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:47,650
what are their processes?

203
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:49,860
How can we work with those teams?

204
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,260
For instance, the procurement
team had a guideline

205
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:55,200
so we could embed
ourselves in their process.

206
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,360
What technology are
they using to interact?

207
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,250
They have specific type of
forms or evaluate, for instance,

208
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,250
which is a tool used by
our procurement team.

209
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,200
And if they are not, maybe
we would need to build one.

210
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,790
So at least having this information

211
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:11,010
was going to help us to better interact

212
00:09:11,874 --> 00:09:13,593
with the business units.

213
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:17,800
After the road show,

214
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,449
I collected a lot of information,

215
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:21,360
learned a lot on what they needed,

216
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,790
and of course, they needed
a lot of very quickly.

217
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:27,610
So I really have the need to implement

218
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,160
a service request process

219
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,060
to really be able to interact
with the business units

220
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:34,741
because everybody has needs
everybody in security,

221
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:38,010
but you need to be able
to capture those requests

222
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,720
to ensure that our source (indistinct)

223
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,620
reach their objectives and our success.

224
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:45,400
So I built a structured
process at the beginning,

225
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,850
so we had a general mailbox

226
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:50,603
so they could reach us
out, phone number or email.

227
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:54,960
And we built a request form
initially on an Excel sheet

228
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,870
to be able to capture what they need.

229
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,770
So we built that template,

230
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:00,960
organized a folder structure,

231
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,710
we built a resource assignment process

232
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:05,600
to be able to staff the different needs,

233
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,050
and also defined the
different follow-up actions.

234
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,610
So my take out here from
the first experience,

235
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:15,130
it felt, of course,
overwhelming at the beginning,

236
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:17,510
but we did learn a lot along the way.

237
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:22,030
And my take out here was
to reevaluate regularly

238
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,730
and we found the process
to better accommodate

239
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,610
the BUs, business units.

240
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:28,540
For instance, I was saying
we had an extra sheet.

241
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,939
We quickly had to decommission it

242
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:34,940
and move to a more
user-friendly version forms.

243
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:38,950
So with drop down menus, once
we understood their services,

244
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:40,580
our services, what they need,

245
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:43,060
so we could easily build prebuilt menus

246
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,229
on a more user-friendly form.

247
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:47,510
Needs and priorities
are constantly changing,

248
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:50,934
so we had to reprioritize a lot.

249
00:10:50,934 --> 00:10:53,620
It could be that one day
this is what comes in

250
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,920
or there's a new request or a new need,

251
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,199
I need to un-staff an architect here,

252
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,690
send him somewhere else,

253
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:02,430
and renegotiate the
deadline, for instance.

254
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:05,569
Agreeing on a timeline, the
deliverable is very important

255
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,590
'cause everybody needs your help,

256
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:09,390
but you need to know what they need.

257
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,463
When can you deliver?

258
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,139
So quickly, we learned that sometimes

259
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:14,700
we had a one-time assignment,

260
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,750
sometimes it will be project iterations.

261
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,200
I could have a request to coming in,

262
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,210
saying they need someone
three hours a week

263
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:21,520
for the next six months.

264
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,510
Can we provide that support?

265
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:26,240
So these are things to consider

266
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:29,093
when you build such a thing.

267
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:34,190
Building relationships
is really important.

268
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:36,710
I had to reach out to regularly
to all the key players.

269
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:40,640
I built up committees on a monthly basis

270
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,030
with some of the key stakeholders

271
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:46,569
so we can discuss the risks, their needs,

272
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:48,870
their issues, tech decisions.

273
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:51,450
I also have all the regular
touchpoints on the phone,

274
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:53,410
so I can talk regularly

275
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:56,630
to all my business partners
to see what's happening,

276
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:58,200
what's going on.

277
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,160
I regularly showcase

278
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,550
the cybersecurity service
offerings regularly,

279
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:02,920
as I say, would be the practice

280
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,089
so new services are coming all the time.

281
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:07,010
I would say every month

282
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:10,750
every two months we have
new services we showcase.

283
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,650
I follow up regularly
on different requests

284
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:15,880
and concerns, and
communicate at all levels.

285
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,310
Communication is key in this job.

286
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:20,699
I need to face with IT management

287
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,800
my cybersecurity members, the requesters,

288
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,219
the partner teams, as I say, audit, legal.

289
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,549
They all speak different languages,

290
00:12:27,549 --> 00:12:31,884
so I need to be able to speak
security on their level.

291
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:33,597
So that's very important.

292
00:12:33,597 --> 00:12:36,307
And the coordination aspect,
it may sound obvious,

293
00:12:36,307 --> 00:12:40,843
but it's very important to work on.

294
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:45,069
We had to also define a focus plan,

295
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:47,030
and I think that's very important to do

296
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:50,040
to align with the CISO
and CTO strategy plan

297
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,560
because otherwise we'd go
in all directions at once,

298
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,400
and sometimes it's better to
take a multi-layer approach

299
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,610
and build a strategy along the way.

300
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:00,440
An example, defining the mandate

301
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,640
and the area of focus in a timeline.

302
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,680
For instance, the first year,

303
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,300
maybe you want to integrate cyber security

304
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,599
within the procurement process

305
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,340
and have it flowing at
a more mature level.

306
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,120
The next year, or six months,

307
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,057
you want to go on the PMR process

308
00:13:15,057 --> 00:13:17,223
and so on and improve along the way.

309
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:21,319
Having senior management
support is really key

310
00:13:21,319 --> 00:13:25,250
to get cybersecurity presence
of the key decision committees

311
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:28,820
on the tables, and the need
to really take you seriously

312
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,430
because at the beginning,
you will come in,

313
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:31,270
they don't know you,

314
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:34,300
so when you talk to a
lawyer for the first time

315
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,209
from the legal team,

316
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:40,180
they will literally tell
you, "What do you want?"

317
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,699
So having senior management support

318
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,380
help us a lot along the way

319
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,860
when we have our interactions.

320
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,990
From personal experience, I wanted to say

321
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:51,940
that we have to be aware of
the one size fits all approach,

322
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:54,770
which is kind of the
first way you want to go

323
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:56,890
because you need to
serve internal auditors

324
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:59,130
procurement, legal,
different (indistinct) units.

325
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:01,850
So want to have a funnel to capture this,

326
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:03,480
which is great at start,

327
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,450
but you need to be able to
tailor what you're doing

328
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:08,300
to the strategy of the business units

329
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:12,600
to their size with the company.

330
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,040
We quickly had to be the
catalog of success stories

331
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,699
'cause when we come, everybody
wants to work with you,

332
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,533
but they don't know you.

333
00:14:19,533 --> 00:14:21,900
They don't know what your capable to do.

334
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:25,490
So along the way we started
to build that capabilities

335
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,536
and showcase our different success stories

336
00:14:27,536 --> 00:14:29,680
with different departments,

337
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,983
different projects that we worked on.

338
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,473
And having of course the short-term

339
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:36,506
and long-term strategy is also key.

340
00:14:36,506 --> 00:14:39,730
It gets back to the point
I was mentioning earlier

341
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:42,633
to have a narrow focus and a timeline.

342
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,440
Now, we implemented
cybersecurity as a service.

343
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,850
So having all these requests coming in,

344
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:53,340
there are two key things
that we really do every day

345
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,770
is to manage the requests first.

346
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:56,930
So responding to the needs.

347
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:59,449
So the first step, review the requests,

348
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:01,550
correcting upfront
documentation and information

349
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:02,579
to know what it is about.

350
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:07,090
So I know ahead, do I need to
send them a network architect,

351
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:08,160
a cloud architect,

352
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,169
or someone for the sub planning.

353
00:15:10,169 --> 00:15:13,060
Applying resource allocation
and timeline, very important.

354
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:17,443
So we use a request tracker
tool that help us to do that,

355
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:20,950
to be able to ensure delivery of service.

356
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:22,760
To give you a corporate
example of services we did,

357
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:26,518
we did lots of architectural reviews,

358
00:15:26,518 --> 00:15:29,200
(indistinct) discount for PCI compliance,

359
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,513
third party reviews, log monitoring.

360
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:34,420
So I follow up regularly with what I call

361
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:36,260
our internal clients,

362
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,680
and hold regular meetings to make sure

363
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,193
that we deliver on time what they need,

364
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:44,260
and stay also in touch
for the post-delivery

365
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,010
because that's a market
tech feature of work,

366
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:47,400
give the review

367
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,880
they've gone to the next assignment,

368
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,180
but I still need to keep
in touch with my requesters

369
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,370
to see what's coming next,

370
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:54,203
whether they're happy,

371
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:55,829
what can we do better the next time?

372
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,994
So always keeping informed and ahead

373
00:15:57,994 --> 00:16:02,994
of the business unit's needs
and the corporate teams.

374
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:05,520
So for my experience here, as I say,

375
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,140
implementing and
communicating a streamlined,

376
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,920
rigorous process was key.

377
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,030
We spent a lot of time refining it,

378
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:15,230
fine-tuning it, making it a more seamless,

379
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:19,560
an easy tool to work with for
our different stakeholders.

380
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,160
Defining key performance
indicators is important.

381
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:22,992
At the beginning,

382
00:16:22,993 --> 00:16:25,690
I remember we were always
saying best efforts

383
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:30,680
was our service level objective.

384
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,530
It works at the beginning, but
in the long run, it cannot.

385
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:35,193
You need to give a timeline

386
00:16:35,193 --> 00:16:40,000
because otherwise you cannot
manage what you cannot measure.

387
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,250
So we defined this pretty quickly.

388
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:43,980
Once we had enough data
to see how much time

389
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:47,100
it takes to use a scan
review, for instance,

390
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,990
or third party review.

391
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:51,010
I would say to be aware of over-promise

392
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,280
and under-deliver trap.

393
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,939
I call it a trap because,
at the beginning,

394
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,330
you want to get their trust.

395
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:57,200
You really want to over-promise.

396
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,990
So that's why we hold
onto the best efforts

397
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:01,940
to avoid committing on a deadline.

398
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,740
Say, "Yes, you get it next week."

399
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:06,619
And what happens if you say
next week and you don't deliver,

400
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:08,349
you would get complaint right away.

401
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:12,112
So I would say to be aware of that.

402
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:17,679
Second aspect on a cyber
security as a practice,

403
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,579
as we call it, is to manage risk.

404
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:21,839
Manage request, manage risk as well.

405
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,240
So connecting regularly
with the audit, risk,

406
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,250
and governance teams is very important

407
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,780
so we can identify the high risk issues

408
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:33,120
and open findings to
help us staff the needs

409
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,729
and tackle what is the most important.

410
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:38,040
So working together with those teams

411
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,220
to propose and enforce the implementation

412
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,230
of security measures and techniques,

413
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:45,540
controls was very key.

414
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:47,500
If you can really to attend

415
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,660
being able to attend external

416
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:51,680
IT audit closing meetings is great.

417
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,030
We still try to get a spots

418
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,600
on those meetings yet,

419
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,800
but it can give you so much information

420
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,570
to be able to sit there

421
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,944
to help us to support the business units

422
00:18:01,944 --> 00:18:04,060
to implement those
recommendations, for instance,

423
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,793
or to challenge auditors as well.

424
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:07,920
So from our experience,

425
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,470
I would say connecting early

426
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:12,300
with internal audit teams is key.

427
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,970
It will help you to
collect so much information

428
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:19,860
on critical and high risk
to prioritize your requests

429
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:23,729
and the efforts towards the
more higher risk carriers,

430
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:25,930
and also to coordinate
with governance teams

431
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:28,360
to review the risk register
on a regular basis.

432
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,953
So to really sit with all those meetings.

433
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:34,760
The focus on value.

434
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,390
So another thing is that, your executives,

435
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:40,090
you want to know how well
you're doing, what's happening.

436
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:42,320
So we need to be able
to bring some reporting

437
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,300
on those activities,

438
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:46,919
and it was my one of my responsibility.

439
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,590
So there's always two sides when it comes

440
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:52,419
to give reporting, quantitative factors

441
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:54,670
and quantitative factors.

442
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:56,160
On the qualitative factors,

443
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,520
it's harder to measure,

444
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,950
but we are voicing the
potential risks that we see,

445
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:04,760
and the BU concerns that I
collect on my regular meetings

446
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:08,440
to senior management on the
field to collect those polls

447
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,610
and to bring them up a notch.

448
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:14,100
So establishing and communicating

449
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,350
corporate safety strategies

450
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:18,550
as well is very important
'cause what we see

451
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:21,040
on the field can help to
build those strategies

452
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,909
to fill the strategy up.

453
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:26,053
So kind of a top down approach
and bottom up approach.

454
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:29,250
Solving problems is key.

455
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,300
As I say, we're not here to say no.

456
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,332
We're here to say yes,

457
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:35,670
so we have to be creative sometimes

458
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:37,600
to propose alternative solutions,

459
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,500
mitigation strategies to be
able to work with a vendor

460
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:44,940
that could be lacking
some security controls.

461
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,720
For instance, work on action plans,

462
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,670
could be an example

463
00:19:49,431 --> 00:19:52,126
Considering the budget
constraints as well,

464
00:19:52,126 --> 00:19:55,240
and getting all the players on boards.

465
00:19:55,240 --> 00:20:00,140
So as you see, you will
see news travels very fast,

466
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,218
good or bad.

467
00:20:01,218 --> 00:20:02,260
It's gonna come.

468
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,093
You will know.

469
00:20:04,757 --> 00:20:07,480
We wanted to create a
culture of responsibility

470
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,033
and transparency as well,

471
00:20:10,828 --> 00:20:13,683
and being able to get all
the key players on board.

472
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:20,419
On the quantitative side, we
built reports and dashboards.

473
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:23,710
Of course, as you know,
management, they like dashboards.

474
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:26,160
They want to see things from what I call

475
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,910
a red, yellow, green perspective.

476
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:31,650
So we build those tools.

477
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:33,353
So we wanted to define metrics to showcase

478
00:20:33,353 --> 00:20:34,840
the value we're adding.

479
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:35,709
'Cause that's the point.

480
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:37,240
That happens after a few months.

481
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,960
It's what is the value you're bringing?

482
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,890
So we were able to commit to
timelines for key deliverables.

483
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:44,450
For instance, at some
point we started to see

484
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:47,340
that it takes us an average of two weeks

485
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,939
to provide a security opinion.

486
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:49,980
So then, great.

487
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,180
Someone needs an opinion

488
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,580
to offer security requirements
for your software.

489
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:56,870
Two weeks would be (indistinct).

490
00:20:56,870 --> 00:21:00,303
So we commit to formalize timeline.

491
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:02,850
We also implemented reporting tools

492
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:05,300
to highlight our team's
contributions and success

493
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,460
and number of effort hours.

494
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,650
So we create a report

495
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:11,392
reporting based on the audience

496
00:21:11,392 --> 00:21:14,370
because we want to see
more high level dashboards

497
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:16,469
and we highlight the red flags.

498
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:18,690
The business unit line managers

499
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:20,070
or the requests they want to see,

500
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,679
the status of the project, where we are,

501
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,090
what is the deadline, how many days?

502
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:25,209
So we put up digital comments

503
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:27,720
on these every week, even twice a week.

504
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,010
So we get always the last
pulse on how are we advancing.

505
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:33,930
So we were able to be those reporting.

506
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:36,007
That really helps you
because, at some point,

507
00:21:36,007 --> 00:21:37,990
you have so many requests going on,

508
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:39,770
it would be very difficult
to have everything

509
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:40,980
on top of your heads,

510
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:45,410
and having key information
centralized and live

511
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:47,193
is really, really helpful.

512
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,300
Now, let me give you some key takeaways

513
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,600
of my experience here

514
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,040
as a business information
security officer.

515
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:00,873
The day-to-day is actually
not as easy as it can look.

516
00:22:02,717 --> 00:22:04,070
You will become the in-house

517
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:06,743
cybersecurity sales
representatives, literally,

518
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,200
selling the best out of it

519
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:14,150
and trying to settle issues
sometimes, and negotiate.

520
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:17,173
So you have to wear many hats sometimes.

521
00:22:18,167 --> 00:22:20,550
I don't even know all the
time to describe my job,

522
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:21,383
what I do.

523
00:22:21,383 --> 00:22:23,500
Some days I will be a project manager,

524
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,290
a negotiator, a cyber expert on network

525
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:28,320
because I'm being front end
in the meeting like that,

526
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,110
or third party analyst.

527
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:32,760
But you come in, you
capture the key information,

528
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:36,680
and you can bring the expert
that you need at the table.

529
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,400
So that's a good thing

530
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,360
if you like to see things
from a wider angle.

531
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,560
Priorities can and will
changed at a moments notice.

532
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:48,600
So you have to be very flexible.

533
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,330
So I'd like to say that
every day is an adventure.

534
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:54,800
I wake up, take my coffee,
see the meetings I have,

535
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,639
and I plan the day, the direction.

536
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,130
It can go in a different one.

537
00:22:58,130 --> 00:22:58,963
It's all right.

538
00:22:58,963 --> 00:23:00,710
We still keep things on the focus.

539
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:03,560
After five, I can check back the points

540
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,960
I couldn't get done,
and follow up on them.

541
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,220
So you need to think long-term.

542
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,420
At the beginning, you would
tend to think short term

543
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:12,450
to get success,

544
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:14,040
to deliver, deliver,

545
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,010
but you need to see what are
the new services coming ahead?

546
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:19,610
What is the strategy of
the different departments?

547
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:22,639
Because, even if management
priorities will change,

548
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,940
you want to see what's
coming next to be ready

549
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:28,647
for the new upcoming initiatives.

550
00:23:28,647 --> 00:23:31,210
And actually, something I've experienced

551
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:34,370
is that people skills is
actually much more important

552
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:36,459
my role than the technical skills.

553
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,100
The reason why is because I coordinate

554
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:41,600
with so many internal
parties and external parties.

555
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,580
You can't know everything
in security, of course.

556
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:47,379
So your background will help you to go,

557
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:49,480
but you have to be
someone who wants to work

558
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,690
across the board.

559
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:54,600
So being able to connect
security and business,

560
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,379
understanding, being able to
have a meeting at eight o'clock

561
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:59,460
with a lawyer, at nine o'clock

562
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,540
with someone from procurement,

563
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,889
and then with network security,

564
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:03,730
and then a vendor, and so on and so on.

565
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:05,440
Being able to change tables

566
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:08,920
and having those people
skills is really key

567
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:12,483
when you have to deal with
different type of individuals.

568
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,200
The main challenges I faced

569
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,600
was to be able to bring the right people

570
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,689
at the right table at the right time.

571
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:23,240
Sometimes you will be on a meeting,

572
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,780
and then realize, had I known,

573
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:27,149
I would have brought a network
architect for instance,

574
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:28,370
or cloud architect.

575
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:30,927
So being able to filter
out things ahead of time

576
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:34,159
so we can bring the right people
and avoid too few meetings

577
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,140
and more delays is key.

578
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,560
It's difficult, but it's key.

579
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:42,379
With time, I was able to
find ways to reach this goal,

580
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,950
when I go to meeting, to
have the right people.

581
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:46,421
You would become the man in the middle,

582
00:24:46,421 --> 00:24:48,513
defending your teams,

583
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:52,810
representing them on different occasions.

584
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:53,643
And something I've noticed

585
00:24:53,643 --> 00:24:55,550
is that the non-active
departments like legal,

586
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:57,430
procurement, they need
a lot of reassuring,

587
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:59,410
especially when your contract closes.

588
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:01,680
They always want to verify
the security aspects.

589
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,873
Okay, they understand what's happening.

590
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:08,030
That's something that I
find interesting as well.

591
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:11,980
On the apply slides, as you know, RSA,

592
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:15,200
we like to give a plan as in
what you can do as actions.

593
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,610
I would say the first thing you can do

594
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:18,209
when you get back to your work

595
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:21,210
is to identify your
contact for cybersecurity

596
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:22,110
if you have not done that,

597
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:23,270
or if you don't know yet.

598
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:26,143
Who is your contact for
questions and concerns?

599
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:30,330
And requests, the cybersecurity
team service catalog,

600
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:31,163
what do they do?

601
00:25:31,163 --> 00:25:32,220
What do they offer?

602
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,610
How can they help you?

603
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:36,250
And what are the cyber security
policies that they have?

604
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:38,453
So collect those documents and contacts.

605
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:41,850
And in three months, review the policies.

606
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:44,620
If you have any questions,
ask the questions to the team.

607
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,600
See what kind of channel they have

608
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,550
for you to provide feedback
or to ask for services.

609
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:52,149
How can you reach out with
them and better interact?

610
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:54,993
Thank you.
