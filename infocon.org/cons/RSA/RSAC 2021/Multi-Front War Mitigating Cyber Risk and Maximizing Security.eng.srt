enterprise cybersecurity
infrastructure team member

34
00:01:23,413 --> 00:01:27,197
primarily working with
network visibility thanks.

35
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:31,030
- Great, all right, so thanks everyone for

36
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:35,310
for joining us today on
the panel at Matt we'll

37
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,970
we'll start with you
2020, interesting year,

38
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:41,010
definitely one for the, you know,

39
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:43,190
for the record books so,

40
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:46,289
what do you think if we could
rewind the clock two years

41
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:50,400
what do you think we collectively would

42
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,790
and could have done
differently two years ago?

43
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:57,240
If we knew that 2020 was gonna be

44
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,179
what it turned out to be, what,

45
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,730
what do you think the, you know

46
00:02:01,731 --> 00:02:03,750
your own experience and kind
of the IT world in general

47
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,960
what do you think we could
have done differently

48
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,763
or better if we had that,
that gift of foresight?

49
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:11,503
- Huh, that's a big one.

50
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:17,989
Proactively we were looking
to go more remote at the time

51
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:20,240
but it wasn't as robust,

52
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:24,490
so that kind of caught up with a lot of us

53
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:25,703
at the time I believe.

54
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:31,143
So are there specific things you think,

55
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:34,730
like looking back that you would have

56
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:36,329
would have like specifically

57
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,460
done differently to be ready,

58
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,850
I mean, when you say is it capacity,

59
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:43,140
is it scalable, authentication,

60
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,786
what kinds of things

61
00:02:44,787 --> 00:02:46,320
do you think would have
really made a difference?

62
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,430
- All the above, was
capacity, scalability,

63
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:52,320
more robust infrastructure

64
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,720
to handle all the various
different connections

65
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,533
to factor the complete
rollout user experience.

66
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:04,900
- Yeah, that's, that's
sure is an interesting

67
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:08,700
I don't envy you being
on the receiving end of

68
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,762
of a lot of rapid, a lot
of rapid learning there.

69
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,930
Tim, what do you think
kind of the IT world

70
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:16,930
would have done differently,

71
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,690
and when you look at your clients,

72
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:21,230
what experiences do you see?

73
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:22,489
- Yeah, thanks Scott.

74
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:25,250
I don't think anyone could
really have prepared enough ready

75
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:29,870
for 2020 and what the, what COVID brought

76
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:32,730
and the challenge is that the,
all IT organizations face,

77
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:34,940
so I think I'm quite glad and,

78
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:38,980
and quite thankful for the
IT administrators out there

79
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,670
for how they mobilized

80
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:43,010
and got remote access and,

81
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:44,989
and changed the way we work.

82
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,010
And I think that reflects

83
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:49,744
across many organizations that we see and,

84
00:03:49,744 --> 00:03:51,400
and you know, looking forward now,

85
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,110
as we're, we're coming to
the other side of things,

86
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,260
we're really seeing that

87
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,760
that digitalization journey

88
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,692
that we always talk about,

89
00:03:57,693 --> 00:04:00,862
it's always the big buzzword
of moving things into the cloud

90
00:04:00,862 --> 00:04:04,240
and adopting these new technologies,

91
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,519
we're gonna see that, that
continue to rapidly advance,

92
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,110
it's a wake up call
for some organizations,

93
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:13,640
but also from, from a risk perspective,

94
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,640
we've got to reflect back on

95
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,169
on that change of posture and what risks,

96
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:21,065
so we now having to
address or retro address

97
00:04:21,065 --> 00:04:25,090
as we move forward, as we've
now started to open up the

98
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:26,590
the organizational structures.

99
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,260
- So I'm trying to make sure I understand,

100
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,289
so would you say then

101
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:37,510
with some obvious exceptions
that from an IT perspective

102
00:04:38,457 --> 00:04:41,870
maybe that there were some
positives to this experience

103
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:45,320
that it helped us to
accelerate some things

104
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,099
that we really needed to be doing anyway

105
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,300
in terms of transformation?

106
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,440
- I think, I think certainly,

107
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,890
so I mean, you, you could,
you could almost say that

108
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:56,200
you know, there is the opportunity

109
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,842
for many organizations to,

110
00:04:57,843 --> 00:04:59,400
to actually make those

111
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,250
those longterm architectural changes

112
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:04,012
that maybe they've been
putting off for a while,

113
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:04,845
you know, the cloud adoption,

114
00:05:04,845 --> 00:05:07,390
the, the scalability, the remote working

115
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,810
that Matt talked about,

116
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:11,070
you know many organizations
probably were hesitant

117
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:13,280
to make those changes because of

118
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,640
operational requirements or,

119
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,736
or other business factors,

120
00:05:17,736 --> 00:05:19,539
whereas now, as an opportunity

121
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:23,550
because there's almost an urgent need to,

122
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,926
to have that in place

123
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:27,950
now that now that that need is,

124
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:30,510
is starting to to maybe
relax a little bit,

125
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:31,659
maybe they can move to

126
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:34,280
to sort of a more structured approach.

127
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:39,280
- Right and it probably helped someone

128
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:42,330
in just getting funding
for some of those programs

129
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:43,163
right, 'cause that,

130
00:05:43,163 --> 00:05:44,380
that's always part of the challenges

131
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,920
oh, we really wanna do this

132
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,150
ooh we have this other,
you know, requirement,

133
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:49,780
well, suddenly there
were some of these things

134
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:52,549
really were pressing business
critical requirements,

135
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:56,030
so putting them, moving
them to the top of the list

136
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:58,919
probably did not, did not hurt

137
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,370
Alli from your perspective, you know

138
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:06,120
if you were all given the gift
of foresight two years ago

139
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,820
what do you think we could
have all done better,

140
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:09,670
done differently.

141
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:15,120
- We probably I would
have been washing my hands

142
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,213
way more much earlier,

143
00:06:16,213 --> 00:06:17,820
(Scott laughs)
listening to whatever

144
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,750
kindergarten teachers told
us about hand hygiene,

145
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,340
but I think, you know, when I think about

146
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,869
what Tim and Matt are talking about,

147
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:25,440
I really, it, you know, to me

148
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,150
it wraps up into, you know digitalization

149
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:29,820
all of those advanced capabilities,

150
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,310
it's part of the innovation.

151
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:33,380
Right and what I think I hear from

152
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,500
with Tim and Matt are saying

153
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,440
and we're hearing it from our clients too.

154
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:40,310
It's the sense of, you know, are you, is,

155
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:44,270
are value exposes making you innovate

156
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,859
or you doing the innovation yourself.

157
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,120
And what ends up happening

158
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,350
is what we learned in 2020

159
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:52,460
is if you wait to be the innovator

160
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:55,060
and you let those external
forces be the impetus

161
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,280
where you have no choice, but to catch up,

162
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,650
right then, you end up
bringing back the security

163
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:01,510
then what happens is
you're on your back foot

164
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:03,330
you're on your heels already
with innovation right.

165
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:05,469
And then obviously, you know

166
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:07,700
security is going to be
the second step, right,

167
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:10,930
'cause you're still be rolling
out the new technologies,

168
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,530
security is the sort of the second thing

169
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:13,363
that you have to think of

170
00:07:13,363 --> 00:07:15,380
'cause you've just got
to get everybody online.

171
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,610
So how do you avoid that?

172
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:21,130
How do you avoid being
on your heels doubly so,

173
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:23,651
that's by always asking
yourself in your organizations

174
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:26,550
what is it that you can do
to be the forefront of change

175
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,580
right?, what is that new capability?

176
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,140
What is the new way of work?

177
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:32,190
What is the new way to access talent?

178
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,260
You know, all of those things

179
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,580
that did not enter my talking
about those are things that

180
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,440
that organizations should
have been thinking about

181
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,960
long before COVID,

182
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,870
and had they, then they probably

183
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:43,700
would have found themselves
in a much better position,

184
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:46,870
going into the pandemic and
then through the pandemic.

185
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:49,500
- So when you think about this topic,

186
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,640
you're really thinking about it,

187
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:54,979
not from the perspective of a specific

188
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:58,980
you know, upgrade or you know,

189
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,420
technology rollout

190
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:04,530
but more of a corporate culture change,

191
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:07,979
to really like force
yourself to stay ahead,

192
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:10,100
to think about what could go wrong

193
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,130
or what could go right,

194
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:13,483
and to, to be at the,
at the front of that.

195
00:08:15,653 --> 00:08:18,130
That makes sense I like that, that's not a

196
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:21,180
so it's not sort of a
silver bullet answer,

197
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:24,340
it's a, it's the way
you think about problems

198
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,400
sort of answer.

199
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,510
- Yeah it's, it's linking,
it's linking, you know,

200
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:31,110
it's kind of having a strategy, right,

201
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,809
it's being purposeful
in where you wanna go

202
00:08:33,809 --> 00:08:36,020
and taking those deliberate steps and not

203
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,169
again not being the
victim of circumstance.

204
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:41,162
- Got it, okay,

205
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:46,020
so turning into our next question

206
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,113
and we'll start with you since we're here,

207
00:08:48,113 --> 00:08:51,647
speaking of being the victim
of circumstance ransomware

208
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:57,370
has become sort of the
scourge of IT security right,

209
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:02,370
whether people are simply
encrypting your information,

210
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,140
and maybe giving it back

211
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:08,840
in exchange for a ransom
or arguably worse,

212
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,420
you know stealing and then
leaking your information,

213
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:14,193
and possibly both,

214
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,710
if someone finds out that you know

215
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:20,730
you wake up tomorrow morning, you find out

216
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:23,977
you're the subject, you know,
your enterprise and subject

217
00:09:23,977 --> 00:09:24,819
of a ransomware attack.

218
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,800
What's the, what do you recommend?

219
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,959
What's the first thing someone should do

220
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,269
when they gain that realization

221
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:34,230
when they realize oh wow,
this is happening to me

222
00:09:35,191 --> 00:09:38,140
- First, hopefully there
was a plan in place right.

223
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:41,720
So, I mean, and we've, we
know this from insert any

224
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,349
of the major cybersecurity
control frameworks

225
00:09:44,349 --> 00:09:46,448
or maturity guidelines, right like,

226
00:09:46,448 --> 00:09:50,130
is it NIST is it ISO?
Is it, you know, CIS 20

227
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:53,080
is it the seven different versions of NIS

228
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:53,913
that you can use,

229
00:09:53,913 --> 00:09:55,090
all of the sort of standardized,

230
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:57,150
these are best practices

231
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:59,530
all speak to have an
incident plan in place.

232
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:01,600
And in part of that

233
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,360
of course is have a chapter
that's devoted to ransomware

234
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,210
because as we know, in cyber security

235
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:08,310
there's sort of like the
broad incident response,

236
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:09,142
and then with ransomware,

237
00:10:09,143 --> 00:10:11,090
there's a couple of additional ones,

238
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:13,393
including regulatory guidelines around

239
00:10:13,393 --> 00:10:15,800
not accidentally or purposefully

240
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,040
hopefully not purposely,

241
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,240
accidentally giving money
to sanctioned organizations,

242
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,211
you know, the department of treasury

243
00:10:21,211 --> 00:10:22,270
especially the US organization.

244
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:25,410
I think that the fingers crossed, right,

245
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:28,640
speaking of not being a victim,
you have that plan in place.

246
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,370
And then it's following that playbook

247
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:32,430
because that playbook
ideally has been exercised

248
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:33,979
is embedded, it's been annually

249
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:36,060
at a minimum, if not quarterly review

250
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,819
based on the latest regulatory guidelines,

251
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,151
you know, I think Kim
and I are all gonna be

252
00:10:41,151 --> 00:10:42,710
on the same page besides
like talk to your external

253
00:10:42,711 --> 00:10:44,710
risk management organizations,

254
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:47,430
to support you whether
that's your insurance broker

255
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:49,370
that helped you pick up cyber insurance

256
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:50,783
or your insurance carrier,

257
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,020
and then ideally as part of that playbook

258
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,530
you've got all of those
partners in place lined up

259
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:59,560
either on retainer or having
established those relationships

260
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,719
of who you can call too,

261
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,220
because those are the experts right,

262
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,980
the firms in the world that
do the forensic studies

263
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:07,960
the firms in the world that
help you navigate the trickiness

264
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:11,180
of handling the ransom
demand and the ransom payment

265
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,959
informing your carriers to make sure

266
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,740
that everything that you
need on the paperwork

267
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,136
you need for your claim,

268
00:11:16,136 --> 00:11:17,930
informing the regulatory bodies

269
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:20,199
depending on what form of
malware it takes right,

270
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,090
all of this so at the end of the day,

271
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:23,090
everything that I'm describing,

272
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:24,940
those are all steps that
should have been baked out

273
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,700
in a really well thought out,

274
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,480
well exercised, well-tested playbook,

275
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,360
and then it's, and then it's, you know,

276
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,950
it takes some of the fear out.

277
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,130
It's going to be disaster,

278
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:35,843
people are gonna lose sleep

279
00:11:35,843 --> 00:11:37,009
for the first few weeks

280
00:11:37,009 --> 00:11:37,842
that's going to happen,

281
00:11:37,842 --> 00:11:39,460
but at least the first 72 hours, you know

282
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:41,426
nobody's running around
like a chicken because

283
00:11:41,426 --> 00:11:43,090
you've got a plan,

284
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:45,070
and all you have to do is
pull that binder off the page

285
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:47,180
you know, off the shelf and go, okay,

286
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,180
let's go through what we've exercised,

287
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,012
what we've trained on,

288
00:11:50,013 --> 00:11:53,410
but we all know where, you
know, our steps need to be.

289
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:55,082
- Got it, got it.

290
00:11:55,082 --> 00:11:58,360
Okay you know, Matt, I think
the rest of us are very lucky

291
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,700
that we can consider some of these things

292
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:05,410
in the abstract, like, you
know, ransomware attacks,

293
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:08,300
what about, what are your
thoughts like from your,

294
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,140
you know kind of
experience in the trenches?

295
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:14,770
How, how front of mind is like our

296
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:16,720
our ransomware attacks specifically,

297
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,090
I think they get lots of headline coverage

298
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:22,480
but is this something that, you know

299
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,217
you specifically spend like
a lot of time thinking about

300
00:12:25,217 --> 00:12:29,520
and if you don't mind,
can you share some of the

301
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:32,250
some of the steps you've
taken to be prepared,

302
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,150
yap that kind of thing were to happen?

303
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:36,940
- We all yes.

304
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,870
We, we all talk I think about it,

305
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:41,170
we hope it never happens to us,

306
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:43,329
but in in an event that
something does come down,

307
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:45,410
you know the plan is to

308
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:47,188
first we try to limit the connection

309
00:12:47,188 --> 00:12:48,657
to we'll say the internet

310
00:12:48,657 --> 00:12:52,320
or to the network, and then
do a quick assessment on

311
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,940
if there's any lateral movement

312
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,820
or any kind of activity
that's kind of abnormal

313
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,540
to the day to day,

314
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,500
and then as Alli was mentioning

315
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,490
just try to get your head
around the game plan,

316
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:05,520
focus on it, stay on the steps

317
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,490
and try to follow through with critical

318
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:09,620
within a couple hours to
kind of get a good feel

319
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,810
for what may or may not have taken place

320
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:12,910
and then move forward.

321
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,868
- Got it, okay,

322
00:13:14,868 --> 00:13:17,590
so you really say that
the first couple of hours

323
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:20,595
are kind of key to surviving or not

324
00:13:20,595 --> 00:13:24,240
they really understand the scope and

325
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,480
- Oh yeah,
- That your response

326
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,947
- Yeah then after that then,

327
00:13:27,947 --> 00:13:29,915
you just got to keep moving forward

328
00:13:29,915 --> 00:13:33,073
without panicking.
- Right, (Scott laughs)

329
00:13:33,073 --> 00:13:36,252
Right that's which may
be the trickiest part,

330
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,690
Tim, then you know, without using names,

331
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:41,240
I mean, have you been involved

332
00:13:42,715 --> 00:13:45,630
Tim in response to, to
any ransomware attacks?

333
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:48,390
Is that something you've
personally been involved in?

334
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:50,170
I'm sure your organization has.

335
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:52,380
- Yeah, I worked closely with the,

336
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,390
with the claims teams

337
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:55,640
and certainly one of
the interesting trends

338
00:13:55,640 --> 00:14:00,400
that we've seen you know,
over the last year is or so is

339
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,860
where ransomware used
to be just an encryption

340
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:08,633
of the devices, and, and
then, then in the payment,

341
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,610
now that there are a
lot more sophisticated

342
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:13,410
because they'll actually
be on your network

343
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:14,510
and they'll be hunting for data

344
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:15,850
and there'll be taking the data as well,

345
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:17,250
so they kind of have hit you

346
00:14:18,374 --> 00:14:21,082
with the double whammy
of data plus the ransom,

347
00:14:21,082 --> 00:14:22,058
so from a claims perspective,

348
00:14:22,058 --> 00:14:24,640
was, was mentioning you know,

349
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,270
that that can cause
more regulatory issues,

350
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:29,630
'cause you also have a data
breach to worry about as well,

351
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:30,890
and I think this is where

352
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:34,199
this is one of the strengths
of of cyber insurance

353
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,470
coming into play, as, you know

354
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:40,083
part of that team security and share,

355
00:14:41,607 --> 00:14:43,350
share team because

356
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:46,490
we've got the on retainer and we've got,

357
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:47,740
we have the service providers

358
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:50,240
that deal with these
incidents day in, day out

359
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,933
and know their around,

360
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,189
know their way around instance,

361
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:56,600
so as Matt said, you know,
that those critical moments

362
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,100
say of you've got your insurer on board

363
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,037
and they've got their
service providers on board

364
00:15:01,037 --> 00:15:04,360
you've instantly increased your team size

365
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,120
in terms of responding to that incident

366
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,700
you've got the the experts
and that they're talking about

367
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,450
and can really help you
through that incident

368
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:12,160
and I think that know, like I said

369
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,540
that's one of the strengths
where the insurance plays

370
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:17,250
because let's be honest,
not all organizations

371
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:20,570
have security expertise
all the time on top,

372
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:23,470
you know, we talk every year,

373
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:24,390
there's always the topic of

374
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:27,348
there's not enough security
professionals in organizations,

375
00:15:27,348 --> 00:15:31,790
so I think, and certainly for
the smaller organizations,

376
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:32,799
you know there no security guy,

377
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:35,557
so is, it's an IT guy,

378
00:15:35,557 --> 00:15:39,580
and so having, having that
insurance policy behind them

379
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,793
is sometimes a lifeline to them.

380
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,053
- Got it

381
00:15:45,504 --> 00:15:46,728
Okay you can just
- Okay

382
00:15:46,728 --> 00:15:50,170
I think I could just add to
Tim and Matt, you know, it's

383
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:52,750
to me it's not just as
security professionals,

384
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,910
you know I think Matt and kind of and Tim

385
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:56,160
are hinting around retrieve,

386
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,640
you wanna augment your skillset
inside your organization.

387
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,260
And there's the, there's the immediate,

388
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,600
you know what is it IT,

389
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,780
or the security team
going to do with response

390
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,439
who are the external augmentees

391
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,900
that you need to be, you know

392
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,569
helping you to bring in, you know,

393
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:11,820
teams like like champion

394
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,260
and the people that he works with

395
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,550
but then it's also internally

396
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,170
who in the non-technology people

397
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:17,689
that are also going to be involved,

398
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:19,870
right it's any kind of cyber incident

399
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:22,120
in particular like ransomware,

400
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,360
the idea is that there's,

401
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,650
it's all hands on deck, right,

402
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,430
like the CFO needs to be you know

403
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:28,300
monitoring the crisis communications

404
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,979
or the public relations team ,

405
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,570
the social media team
needs to be alerted because

406
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:34,480
there needs to be a coordinated
communication that goes

407
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,140
out there's the GCs office,

408
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:39,770
oh, my goodness is super
critical, you know,

409
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:41,680
so when we think about ransomware

410
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,000
you know I know that
topic is about security

411
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,770
but I love the title that
it's a multi-front war

412
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:48,130
right but in your organization,

413
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:50,500
and you have all of these
assets with different skillsets

414
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,270
all of which have a role to play

415
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:55,180
in the war in, you know,
in the security war.

416
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,449
And it's so important

417
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:59,340
in any kind of incident
that particularly ransomware

418
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,360
that you utilize,

419
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,350
every single one of those assets available

420
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:03,823
everyone has a role use them.

421
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:07,119
- Got it, yeah that makes sense,

422
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,065
I guess we have, you know,

423
00:17:09,066 --> 00:17:12,800
I think a lot of us do
think certainly on my side,

424
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,970
think more about the technical roles,

425
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:16,300
but you're absolutely right,

426
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,960
some of the most key team few,

427
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,329
most key team members,

428
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:22,939
are not going to be the
technical people, right,

429
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:26,461
I mean, that's gonna be to
your point, legal and social

430
00:17:26,461 --> 00:17:30,840
and finance and everything
else have to be involved.

431
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,442
And that does remind
me though, of, you know

432
00:17:33,442 --> 00:17:35,420
we were talking about a lot about

433
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,290
like making plans and having, you know

434
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:39,139
the plan in place and it's rehearse

435
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,410
and all that to respond to ransomware,

436
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:44,890
but just an anecdote I heard recently,

437
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:45,723
which I thought was funny,

438
00:17:45,723 --> 00:17:47,100
it's really important,

439
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,694
when you compile your plan
for ransomewhere response,

440
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:51,340
and you've got it all documented

441
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,580
and you're ready to go

442
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:55,010
and you just like print it out

443
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:58,590
because if you're really
subject to a ransomware attack

444
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,709
you may not have access to your laptop,

445
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:03,134
so you may have these
really, really great plans

446
00:18:03,134 --> 00:18:05,060
which are locked away on a hard drive,

447
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,929
that you longer get to,

448
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:09,660
and I think that's absolutely accurate,

449
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:12,290
and I'll bet if you were to do a survey

450
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:13,424
there would be an embarrassing,

451
00:18:13,424 --> 00:18:16,633
large number of people who
have found that out the,

452
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,075
the hard way.

453
00:18:19,075 --> 00:18:21,960
All right so let let's let's change topics

454
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:26,390
to supply chain, right,
this is so I'm an Austin,

455
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:29,163
and so the whole SolarWinds thing,

456
00:18:29,163 --> 00:18:32,520
I mean was not just sort of national news,

457
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,610
this was local news right,

458
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:39,610
for us and, you know pretty significant.

459
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:43,550
So Kim we'll, we'll go over to you,

460
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:47,100
I mean, obviously in, in
2020, you know, we really

461
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,899
the world was sort of forced to rethink

462
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:53,050
supply chain security and what it means,

463
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:54,899
and I think among other things a much

464
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:58,929
take a much broader sort of perspective

465
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,480
of what your supply chain is,

466
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,800
right because it's easy to think

467
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,680
if you're in hardware manufacturing

468
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,780
it's easy to think of like components,

469
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:08,100
like the things that plug
in on your circuit boards,

470
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,800
right, as part of your supply chain,

471
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:13,570
but I think this really among
other things made us realize

472
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:16,659
that the supply chain is
much broader than that,

473
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:19,640
it's kind of everything
you need to, you know, to

474
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,350
to get your, your, your work done, right

475
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:25,510
everything that's critical
for your, your operation.

476
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:28,000
So hopefully I think
we say this every time

477
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,660
hopefully this was a wake up call

478
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:32,173
about the importance of
supply chain security,

479
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:35,360
like, now that we're awake, hopefully,

480
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,649
like, what do you think

481
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:38,060
what are the big lessons learned?

482
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:41,300
What do we do differently moving forward?

483
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,780
And I think that the solar ones, you know

484
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:48,120
series of breaches is
particularly interesting,

485
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,024
I think because

486
00:19:49,025 --> 00:19:52,710
many of the people who were most impacted

487
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:54,980
were the people who in some
ways did everything right,

488
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:57,320
right if you didn't up
here, update your software,

489
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:00,490
right and you have your
old stale versions of orion

490
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,400
you are fine,

491
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,080
it was the people who
like did the right thing

492
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,060
and kept it up to date,

493
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,540
they have made, they may have been

494
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,190
in sort of the worst spot right,

495
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:08,832
'cause they were the ones
who've got the bad stuff.

496
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:10,054
So what are you,

497
00:20:10,054 --> 00:20:11,340
what do you think some
of the big takeaways,

498
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,752
the big lessons that we learned are.

499
00:20:12,752 --> 00:20:14,409
- So in terms of SolarWinds

500
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:15,672
we know that that was a big event,

501
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:18,240
we know that, that, you know,

502
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,340
no matter how much security,

503
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:23,659
awareness and, and tools and

504
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:27,110
and proactive measures are in place,

505
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:29,699
you know that those are
always those types of events

506
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,820
always gonna affect organizations

507
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,939
either directly because they're a target

508
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:36,170
or because there'll be collateral

509
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:39,120
and just so happened to be
using whatever, you know

510
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,415
in this case, SolarWinds, but, you know

511
00:20:41,415 --> 00:20:44,570
in whatever software
that was being used next.

512
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:46,879
I think for me, the big thing

513
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,930
and we about it earlier,

514
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:49,990
when we talked about digitalization

515
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:52,250
is from a supply chain perspective,

516
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,410
we really just know where
our digital assets are,

517
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:56,970
you know things like private keys,

518
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:58,570
also what software we're using

519
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:00,950
what cloud providers we're using,

520
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:03,290
all those, all those open libraries

521
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:05,850
that we might be, we might be putting into

522
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:07,810
a software service stacks

523
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:11,290
all those kinds of things, you know

524
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:13,145
supply chain is not easy,

525
00:21:13,145 --> 00:21:16,150
we know supply chain is not
easy at the best of times

526
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,420
for physical things,

527
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,453
but now we've got a whole
bunch of intangible assets

528
00:21:19,453 --> 00:21:23,360
that are digital and in a larger scale,

529
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,199
and, you know, when you
start looking at IOT devices

530
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,600
and that world,

531
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,340
you then got another incremental scale,

532
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:31,879
so I think, yes, a big big wake up call

533
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,982
of these things happen,

534
00:21:33,982 --> 00:21:36,200
and no matter how many security controls

535
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,260
you put in place,

536
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,923
you know, security, you
know, it will happen

537
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:43,000
but also a big wake up call

538
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,100
into the number of,
you know, digital foot,

539
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,915
what's the organization's
digital footprint these days.

540
00:21:47,915 --> 00:21:50,332
And how do you build
the risks around that?

541
00:21:51,921 --> 00:21:54,270
- Well and Alli you obviously
you advise people on risk,

542
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:55,540
how do you counsel people

543
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:58,713
to consider their supply chains now?

544
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:03,255
- It happening SolarWinds
is a nice headline

545
00:22:03,256 --> 00:22:04,670
for us to point to,

546
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:07,570
but we've always had
the same sort of dogma

547
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:08,850
that we've been trying to roll out

548
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:11,050
which is and it's exactly
Tim's point, right,

549
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:12,409
like your digital supply chain

550
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:15,070
and it's not just who
makes your server stack

551
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:16,560
and where you get your laptops from,

552
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,886
although we actually know
firmware issues as well

553
00:22:18,886 --> 00:22:21,770
but it's also, where is that?

554
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:23,129
Where is that hidden piece of

555
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:25,573
I loved Tim that you brought
up, right the open libraries,

556
00:22:25,573 --> 00:22:27,780
were there one piece of hidden tech debt

557
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,355
inside a source code that
you're not gonna find,

558
00:22:29,355 --> 00:22:33,510
right when you think about
the what you know, SolarWinds

559
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:34,910
to the cascading effects,

560
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:37,780
but when you think about the
immediate SolarWinds clients,

561
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:40,899
right your Microsofts and
your fireies in the world

562
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:44,490
who's going to be better equipped
to identify that tech debt

563
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:48,007
then those massive
organizations with, you know

564
00:22:48,007 --> 00:22:50,750
teaming with the world's best
cybersecurity specialists.

565
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,560
There are, I think that
there's some questions

566
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:54,540
inside the security community

567
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,387
about how closely they
are looking at each other,

568
00:22:57,387 --> 00:23:00,320
I certainly read some some
really interesting thought pieces

569
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,570
about, you know

570
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:03,320
were the warning signs always there,

571
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,560
and you know, was there,
was there hubris involved

572
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,990
across the security community

573
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:10,060
that probably should've picked
up on issues much earlier?

574
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:11,530
Are there questions around,

575
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:13,157
what is the esoteric debate around,

576
00:23:13,157 --> 00:23:15,159
you know proprietary security software

577
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,610
versus open source

578
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:18,600
that everyone can kind of investigate?

579
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,510
I am not a specialist,

580
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:21,240
I just think those
conversations are fascinating

581
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,270
but I think SolarWinds is triggering

582
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:25,856
a lot of those really really
academic level discussions

583
00:23:25,856 --> 00:23:27,490
that could change,

584
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:29,960
how the industry really
views itself moving forward,

585
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,867
and I think if, you know

586
00:23:31,867 --> 00:23:33,816
if you're not a Far eye

587
00:23:33,816 --> 00:23:34,670
and you don't have that
kind of talent pool

588
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:36,060
inside of your own health,

589
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,690
I think the question becomes

590
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:41,040
what I think is really
interesting is the same techniques

591
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,510
that have worked really well

592
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:45,560
for traditional non-digital supply chain,

593
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:48,970
still can work actually
in the digital space,

594
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:51,440
right, when you speak about
Trudy and one, you know

595
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,900
one of the things I did
before I joined marshes

596
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,410
I did supply chain consulting

597
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:57,860
and supply chain optimization
and risk mitigation.

598
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:00,336
And when you in much
more traditional spaces.

599
00:24:00,336 --> 00:24:02,856
And when you think about, you know

600
00:24:02,856 --> 00:24:05,320
are you concentrated in your risk?

601
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,909
Do you have one supplier,

602
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:09,610
or does that make you
thought you diversify

603
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:11,850
but all three of your
diversified suppliers only

604
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:13,810
use one sub supplier, right.

605
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:16,580
It's the same techniques
that have always worked

606
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,740
in supply chain management

607
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:20,270
to help you mitigate your risks there,

608
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:21,550
you can in the same way

609
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:23,768
that you expand your
perspective about digital,

610
00:24:23,768 --> 00:24:26,150
you know, on the one hand
you're kind of broadening

611
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:28,270
your view of what supply chain looks like,

612
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:29,870
but on the other hand
you're actually mirroring

613
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:32,550
your scope of mitigation
to the tried and true.

614
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:34,970
So those are, you know

615
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:36,840
it's interesting because
your procurement team

616
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,209
that's used to writing a vendor contract

617
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:42,970
for your water bottles or
whatever non-digital assets.

618
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:44,840
They probably have some
really great insights

619
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,077
that can be shared with the tech team

620
00:24:46,077 --> 00:24:48,303
and the security teams to think about.

621
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,480
- Yeah, that's an interesting take

622
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,980
are they there, the
concentration of risks,

623
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:54,813
that's kind of,

624
00:24:54,813 --> 00:24:56,240
it seems like an interesting topic

625
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,240
and the digital world like in some ways,

626
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,720
the more suppliers you have

627
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,180
the more risks you could
expose yourself to,

628
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,580
right I mean, it's a little,

629
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:07,800
it could be a little different

630
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:11,050
this is not my, my field
of expertise clearly

631
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:14,580
but I just said it would be
interesting to look into like

632
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:17,230
what's the same and like
working real benefit

633
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:19,600
and where are the places
that you need to really

634
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,719
be aware of, like differences,

635
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,140
you know, you're right
between like hardware supply

636
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:26,830
and having redundancy and you know,

637
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:28,490
things like software components

638
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:31,643
let's say as an example, or
like software on your network,

639
00:25:31,643 --> 00:25:36,550
I know a lot of, just a lot
of sort of IT management

640
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:39,350
that, that we work with,
you know one of the goals

641
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:42,315
is actually reducing the number of vendors

642
00:25:42,316 --> 00:25:44,420
that they have supplying
stuff for their network

643
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:46,596
just because there's a lot of overhead

644
00:25:46,596 --> 00:25:49,156
in managing lots of different vendors

645
00:25:49,156 --> 00:25:50,770
and lots of different suppliers,

646
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:52,950
so clearly there are trade offs right,

647
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:54,430
to be had, and you've
got to figure out what,

648
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:56,460
what works for, for you.

649
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,850
So, Matt I'm not gonna ask if you're,

650
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:02,459
if you're an Orion user, but you know,

651
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:05,280
when, when the holiday bear

652
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,360
you know, when that whole
attack, you know, sort

653
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,857
of started hitting light,

654
00:26:09,857 --> 00:26:13,050
and we started to realize
just how sort of permissions

655
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:15,677
and the, the duration, right,

656
00:26:15,677 --> 00:26:19,540
and the patience of, you know,
the hackers in this attack,

657
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:21,830
did that change the way that, you know

658
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:25,310
you guys thought about your supply chain

659
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:29,210
and the risks that whoever
those, whatever external vendors

660
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:30,330
you have, like the,

661
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:32,000
the risks that they
brought to your network

662
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,690
did that, did that force a change

663
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:37,193
in the way that you, you approached that?

664
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,810
- I don't think it, per
se forced to change,

665
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:44,399
I think it, it supported
some of the aggressive

666
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,970
movements we were trying to
take without source companies

667
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:51,300
and trying to do user awareness

668
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,716
and to try to mitigate
the possible exposures of,

669
00:26:53,716 --> 00:26:56,010
I wanna say call them the weak link,

670
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:59,080
but helping them understand,

671
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,169
keeping their network secure

672
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:04,658
and or fishing attempts
that kind of stuff,

673
00:27:04,658 --> 00:27:06,831
- That's okay
- so that kind of thing.

674
00:27:06,832 --> 00:27:08,690
- Okay all right so that's good,

675
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:11,193
so you, so for you, it was sort of,

676
00:27:12,242 --> 00:27:13,870
so it was validation that the steps

677
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:16,629
that you're trying to
take were the right ones

678
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:18,230
that there really is risk out there,

679
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:21,093
and you need to be sort of aware of?

680
00:27:22,001 --> 00:27:23,360
- Yeah it kind of helps support some

681
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,473
of the paranoia, some of
us have throughout the day,

682
00:27:26,473 --> 00:27:28,970
I think it got on (both laughing)

683
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:31,850
- Yeah, it's good when you can
prove it's not just paranoia

684
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:34,553
that you actually know
what you're talking about.

685
00:27:34,553 --> 00:27:35,890
(both laughing)

686
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:37,838
Yeah so it's interesting,

687
00:27:37,838 --> 00:27:40,193
I mean, this has come up
a couple of times that,

688
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,810
that at least, and maybe specifically

689
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:48,560
within the IT world,
some of the, you know,

690
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,610
some of the challenges that we've had

691
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:52,053
over the last, you know,

692
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,810
however long 18 months or whatever,

693
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:57,810
now have actually helped us to, you know,

694
00:27:57,810 --> 00:28:01,163
whether it's the kind of rush to remote

695
00:28:01,163 --> 00:28:03,170
and the rush to, to you know

696
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:05,110
move to the cloud and things like that,

697
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:06,919
or you know thinking about supply chain

698
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:11,880
with recognizing and taking
action on some of those risks

699
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,090
that it's actually helping us,

700
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:17,379
like there's, some of these
things are forcing attention

701
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:21,280
on the things that maybe we
knew were the right things to do

702
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,139
and had to be done

703
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:25,020
but they just couldn't be
effectively prioritized.

704
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:29,700
Right, so, you know, always
on the hunt for silver linings

705
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,210
maybe there, there are
some, some positives

706
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:35,497
and, you know as I guess the
hope would be as, or that,

707
00:28:35,497 --> 00:28:38,750
you know, we all get back to normal,

708
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:41,770
whatever that is that we can you know,

709
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:45,889
we can take some of those lessons with us

710
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,790
and continue that momentum, you know,

711
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:50,152
like Tim and I were talking
before the call about,

712
00:28:50,152 --> 00:28:53,345
you know sort of the impact of,

713
00:28:53,345 --> 00:28:54,330
of like the, you know,

714
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:57,214
now that we've been
working from home largely,

715
00:28:57,214 --> 00:28:59,980
maybe we don't have to
go back to the office

716
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,922
every single day, and so maybe, you know,

717
00:29:01,922 --> 00:29:04,460
traffic congestion and commuting

718
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:06,934
and things like that are,
are actually gonna be better

719
00:29:06,934 --> 00:29:10,350
as part of this, because
the world has figured out

720
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:11,959
how to support remote users

721
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,840
and you know how to manage time

722
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,673
and all of that stuff,

723
00:29:14,673 --> 00:29:16,020
even when people are remote,

724
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:19,810
that's not necessarily a a bad thing.

725
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:22,610
All right so I, I wanna remind everyone

726
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:25,020
that we are taking questions
in the chat window,

727
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:27,152
so we will, we will get to those

728
00:29:27,152 --> 00:29:32,152
but I will ask now for any
closing thoughts about, you know

729
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:36,453
the, this multi-front war that we're in

730
00:29:36,453 --> 00:29:39,530
and and managing risk you
know in our environments,

731
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:42,094
Kim, we'll start with you,

732
00:29:42,094 --> 00:29:43,983
any closing thoughts for the

733
00:29:43,983 --> 00:29:47,350
for the audience or, thoughts
for the audience yeah.

734
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:49,583
- Yeah, thanks Scott, I think that I mean

735
00:29:49,584 --> 00:29:51,110
my main thought

736
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:53,072
and I think we touched on,
on some of the concerns

737
00:29:53,072 --> 00:29:55,591
in the, in the, in the
discussion is it's really

738
00:29:55,592 --> 00:29:59,320
really rewarding to know
that other people share

739
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:02,010
share the same concerns,
but as we're moving

740
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:07,010
to this new world of, of
computer compute power everywhere

741
00:30:07,042 --> 00:30:09,654
people are working everywhere,

742
00:30:09,654 --> 00:30:12,800
there's so much increased complexity in,

743
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,470
in IT environment, and, Alli has mentioned

744
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:16,920
a number of times, you know

745
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,965
it's not just the IT and the security guys

746
00:30:18,965 --> 00:30:22,007
that are responsible for keeping,

747
00:30:22,008 --> 00:30:23,773
keeping that going it's kind of

748
00:30:23,773 --> 00:30:25,990
there's a little bit of
everyone's responsibility

749
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:28,210
and, and I know we always talk about

750
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:30,030
people process technology

751
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:32,250
is a big emphasis on people and process

752
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:34,250
and a little emphasis on technology,

753
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:37,110
that just that sheer scale of complexity,

754
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:38,209
if we don't get that right,

755
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:40,740
then we're gonna, we're gonna end up

756
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:41,970
in a in a complete mess,

757
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:43,093
going down the line.

758
00:30:44,187 --> 00:30:45,020
(Scott laughs)

759
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:48,170
- Yeah and and those challenges aren't

760
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:50,860
aren't theoretical, right, we
know that these things that

761
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:52,449
we don't know what will happen next

762
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:55,090
but we know that these
challenges are not just

763
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,805
are not just drawing board exercises,

764
00:30:57,805 --> 00:31:00,595
right, these things can, can happen.

765
00:31:00,595 --> 00:31:02,913
Mark, any closing thoughts you'd like to

766
00:31:02,913 --> 00:31:04,833
you'd like to share with everyone.

767
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:09,120
- Yes checks and balances
every once in a while

768
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,500
you kind of test the tool or test yourself

769
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,200
to make sure that what you felt it

770
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,120
was designed to do or
to alert on is there,

771
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,179
and maybe a little bit overlap

772
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:20,890
with multiple tools kind of
helps kind of give you an idea

773
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:22,380
'cause sometimes one tool doesn't see

774
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,040
where the other tool does,

775
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,330
but don't get too, too comfortable,

776
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:28,639
but at the same time
don't get too paranoid,

777
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,140
I mean, at the end of the day,

778
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:33,510
it's an evolving platform

779
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:36,430
with a lot of multiple
changes and risks that go on

780
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:38,787
in the day to day to do business.

781
00:31:38,787 --> 00:31:42,537
- Powerful all right,
and Alli bring us home.

782
00:31:44,506 --> 00:31:46,730
- All right, two, one actually
builds right off of Matt,

783
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:49,010
and it's kind of a flip side

784
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:51,381
but it's not as gonna be as contradictory

785
00:31:51,381 --> 00:31:53,510
as I could get down to my head,

786
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:55,701
so, you know, Matt's point
about don't be too paranoid.

787
00:31:55,701 --> 00:31:57,870
I would say, you know,

788
00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:00,929
in organizations you've got
a cacophony of voices, right?

789
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:03,380
One voice has to be that SNL character,

790
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,540
who's Debbie daughter.

791
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,770
Who's just got always like

792
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:10,210
everything could go wrong at all time.

793
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:13,180
And I say that not really jokingly

794
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:15,930
because you always want
that one voice to say,

795
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:18,780
hey, there's an angle we've missed right,

796
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:21,270
the whole organization doesn't
need to be down in the dumps

797
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:23,550
and be hyper paranoid all the time,

798
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:26,040
she's a terrible emotional
way to live a life,

799
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,480
so I don't necessarily recommend that,

800
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,942
I mean, that's what I do for a living.

801
00:32:29,942 --> 00:32:30,775
And it's pretty hard emotionally,

802
00:32:30,775 --> 00:32:32,541
there's a lot of bourbon
- (Scott laughing)

803
00:32:32,541 --> 00:32:34,608
in my cabinet, but I think that

804
00:32:34,608 --> 00:32:35,970
but I think you need, you need one voice

805
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:37,860
in your team to kind of balance out

806
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,010
the hope and the optimism,

807
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:41,300
and you know, everyone
wants to move forward,

808
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,810
everyone wants to have growth

809
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:44,357
and everyone wants wins and successes,

810
00:32:44,357 --> 00:32:46,800
and you need at least one voice that says

811
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,390
let me help you troubleshoot,
let me help you de-risk

812
00:32:48,391 --> 00:32:51,130
our ability to move forward.

813
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:52,750
So that's one, and then the second one

814
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:54,760
is what I think is what I
love about this conversation

815
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:55,620
is you've got a couple,

816
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:58,360
you've got practitioners
and Matt and Scott rate you

817
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,889
and you've got sort of people

818
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:01,988
in the risk industry that specialize more

819
00:33:01,988 --> 00:33:04,633
in a broader scope of
risk like Tim and myself.

820
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:07,930
I think what's really
interesting in cyber security

821
00:33:07,930 --> 00:33:11,030
in particular, is there
is more opportunity now

822
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,552
in this particular space for this

823
00:33:12,552 --> 00:33:15,420
for the concept of public
private with conversations and

824
00:33:15,421 --> 00:33:17,501
in pathways moving forward,

825
00:33:17,501 --> 00:33:22,501
and I know that, you know,
courtesy, revelations around

826
00:33:22,672 --> 00:33:24,530
what the government can or cannot do

827
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:27,090
in the security space
can, can cause tensions,

828
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:29,116
but I think that there's
also opportunities

829
00:33:29,116 --> 00:33:30,250
to really think about

830
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:31,900
when you think about the way technology,

831
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:34,720
right Like 5G rollout for example,

832
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,660
you're talking ultimately about

833
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:39,530
nationally important
critical infrastructure

834
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:41,070
and speaking of supply chains,

835
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:42,870
there are five main hardware suppliers

836
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:45,649
that can support the US 5G rollout,

837
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:48,030
that's ultimately a
national security issue.

838
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:49,889
So these questions that
we're trying to grapple

839
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:51,950
with in 35 minutes, right,

840
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:54,540
this is, we are a pretty
diverse set of voices

841
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:56,440
but it needs to be more and more diverse

842
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:59,220
and there needs to be a
public private conversation

843
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:01,560
with the public sector and
with government agencies,

844
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,460
as well as the thing about

845
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:04,788
what else can be done, what
information can be shared,

846
00:34:04,788 --> 00:34:08,219
what new policy driven ways do we need?

847
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:10,370
Do we need to help
secure everyone equally.

848
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:14,320
- Well, that could kick the whole another

849
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,750
multi hour discussion 5G
validation insecurities

850
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:19,080
being something very near and dear

851
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,569
to our tech keysight's heart.

852
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:23,525
So maybe next year, maybe we'll,

853
00:34:23,525 --> 00:34:27,424
we'll set across a, set
aside time for that.

854
00:34:27,424 --> 00:34:29,880
All right so thank you everyone,

855
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:32,170
I'd like to thank Tim and Matt and Alli,

856
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:35,239
my fellow panelists for joining us today,

857
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:38,299
and for those of you in the
audience, thank you very much.

858
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:40,710
And again, we will get
to as many questions

859
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:42,652
as we possibly can.

860
00:34:42,652 --> 00:34:46,067
Thanks everyone have a great day bye

861
00:34:46,067 --> 00:34:47,734
- Thanks Scott
- bye.
