1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:02,330
- Hi, everybody.

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:03,810
My name is Aaron Charfoos.

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:06,500
I'm a partner at Paul Hastings.

4
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,420
And along with my co-host Ericka Johnson,

5
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:10,840
who will introduced herself in one second,

6
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:14,469
we're doing Managing Privacy
and Cyber in a Pandemic,

7
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:16,510
Lessons Learned for 2020 and Beyond.

8
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:18,760
Ericka you wanna introduce yourself?

9
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,460
- Yes, well, good afternoon everyone.

10
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:21,930
My name is Ericka Johnson.

11
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:24,290
I'm a Senior Associate
at Squire Patton Boggs.

12
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:27,950
I really specialize in helping
companies mitigate the risk

13
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:30,980
of, and unfortunately
respond to cyber incidences

14
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:32,600
of all shapes and sizes.

15
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,930
And I'm excited to be here today

16
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:36,823
and to share some of our
lessons learned with you.

17
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,790
So, during the presentation today,

18
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:43,140
I'm gonna start the presentation off.

19
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,480
And if you have any questions,

20
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,900
please send those directly to Ericka.

21
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,800
I won't be able to see them,
but she'll be able to ask them.

22
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,019
And then when Ericka takes
over in the second half,

23
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:57,170
if you wanna send a message
directly to me, I can ask

24
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:00,770
as we go along and that way
we can keep it interactive.

25
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:02,420
And with that, let's get started.

26
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:06,380
So, today we're gonna talk
about a couple of things.

27
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:09,690
First of all, what's the
big deal with the pandemic

28
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:12,870
and COVID and information
that we're learning.

29
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:13,703
We're gonna talk

30
00:01:13,703 --> 00:01:16,290
about the challenge and
some data around it.

31
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:17,970
We'll talk about the legal framework,

32
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:19,860
and then I'm gonna kick it over to Ericka.

33
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,510
And Ericka is gonna talk
about the risk environment,

34
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:25,570
the rapidly evolving
security expectations,

35
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:29,070
particularly ransomware which
is a very hot topic these days

36
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:32,449
and forensic reports and e-discovery.

37
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:36,130
But first let's talk about
what the big deal is.

38
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:39,160
So, COVID has certainly accelerated

39
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,200
and appended a lot of pre-existing trends.

40
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,700
And for most people on this call,

41
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:48,120
that's probably not surprising,
but some things really

42
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:52,590
are really unanticipated
with what we've seen.

43
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,960
So, first of all, what has accelerated?

44
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,330
We all know that we've
accelerated the remote work

45
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:00,450
and increased reliance
on remote resources.

46
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:02,950
Everybody on this call has
figured out how to do Zoom

47
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:05,640
how to share Zoom, how to work from home,

48
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,133
how to keep dogs and kids quieter.

49
00:02:08,133 --> 00:02:11,780
But there's some things too
that have been very unexpected,

50
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,810
and it's really up-ended expectations

51
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:16,280
about information that
employers might expect

52
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,190
from their employees. And
we're gonna talk a little bit

53
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:20,570
about this in a few minutes.

54
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:24,269
And one of the things that
I think that for all of us,

55
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,260
that we're gonna see

56
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,649
is that many of these
trends are longer lasting

57
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:29,720
than we would expect.

58
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:33,760
I know that our firm, Paul
Hastings, is bringing people back

59
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,090
into the office, starting in
July, going through September

60
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,260
but we are planning for years

61
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:42,810
of asking health questionnaires
in many of our offices,

62
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:45,000
particularly in densely populated cities.

63
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,800
And so we are anticipating

64
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,740
that a lot of what we're seeing,
not just the remote work,

65
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:52,160
but also trying to gather
some more information

66
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,520
that was traditionally considered private,

67
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,720
will be something that we're gonna need

68
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,030
to do for the longterm.

69
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:00,030
So, companies need to really expect that,

70
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:03,210
that's gonna be an issue and
plan for it for the future.

71
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:07,220
And both of those, the
accelerated transitions

72
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,450
and the upended expectations

73
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:10,984
will have significant implications

74
00:03:10,985 --> 00:03:13,870
for both privacy and
cybersecurity as we're gonna see

75
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,490
in a minute.

76
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:19,390
As offices begin to reopen,
there are a number of dilemmas

77
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:24,153
over what information
employers should be collecting.

78
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:27,020
And the challenge really is the extent

79
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:31,640
that the information is truly
needed and how best to collect

80
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:35,880
and store it, and then apply
state and local mandates

81
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:40,260
on the reporting of positive
test results, contact tracing.

82
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,769
Can you take back seen information?

83
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:45,640
All of those kinds of things
are things that we really just

84
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,269
didn't have to deal with before.

85
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,125
Didn't have to concern
ourselves with before,

86
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:53,090
but definitely now, and
particularly with large amounts

87
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:56,200
of the workforce coming
back relatively quickly,

88
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,049
maybe not as quickly

89
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:59,610
as we all went remote,
but relatively quickly,

90
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:02,500
that's for sure something we're
gonna need to think about.

91
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,510
And the data is pretty staggering.

92
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:08,470
76% of organizations have
asked employees to notify

93
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,170
if they've been diagnosed,

94
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:12,579
something that people
generally haven't done.

95
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:16,190
I mean, in many cases, if you had the flu

96
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,640
you didn't have to tell your employer

97
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,349
that you had tested positive for the flu,

98
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:22,680
but now those are kinds of
things that we're asking about.

99
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,210
53% of employers have asked employees

100
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:27,890
about where their
personal travel has been.

101
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:29,450
What states have you gone to?

102
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:30,599
Who have you seen?

103
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,433
Where were you?

104
00:04:31,433 --> 00:04:32,266
Where were you?

105
00:04:32,266 --> 00:04:33,270
When did you come back?

106
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:36,890
All of those kinds of
things, 35% of employers

107
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:39,909
have asked regarding household
members COVID status.

108
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:43,230
And 23% have actually
physically taken temperatures

109
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:45,630
of employees as they walk in the door.

110
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:48,570
And particularly we've seen
this in many buildings,

111
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,950
particularly here in
Chicago, where I live.

112
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,360
When you walk into a building,

113
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,020
there is often a thermal
scanner that you walk

114
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,419
up to before you can
get into the building.

115
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,930
Something we'd never seen before,

116
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,780
probably something that
people really would have

117
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:03,080
objected to prior to the pandemic.

118
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,090
But now the line goes right up there.

119
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:06,849
It takes a thermal image of your scan.

120
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:09,600
And that's the first step to
getting into the building.

121
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:12,610
Some more data,

122
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:14,490
three and 10 organizations have been asked

123
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:17,710
to share anonymized COVID
data with a third party.

124
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:20,940
That's includes a government researchers,

125
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:23,290
non-governmental organization,

126
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:26,210
and 20% of employers have shared the names

127
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:28,270
of staff that have been diagnosed.

128
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,103
And that's either

129
00:05:29,103 --> 00:05:31,340
with other employees
or with the government.

130
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,419
We can talk a little bit

131
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:35,630
about that statistic and
how we do it properly

132
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:37,000
in a little bit.

133
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,990
15% have conducted data privacy

134
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:43,150
impact assessments focused
on COVID collection.

135
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:45,799
There's a lot more information
coming in the door.

136
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,790
Lot of people are subject
to the European regulations.

137
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,320
And even some regulations here

138
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,610
in the United States
are really assessing how

139
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:56,550
the privacy implications
of this need to be dealt

140
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:59,360
with on a case-by-case basis.

141
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,480
And about half of the
companies have adopted

142
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,850
a new technology to enable work from home

143
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:06,590
and almost 60% of those bypassed,

144
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:09,330
or expedited the privacy
of security review.

145
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:12,310
And this is something we hear
from a lot of our clients.

146
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,760
They rushed to get everybody

147
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,693
out the door, they rushed to put in place.

148
00:06:16,693 --> 00:06:19,140
Really the critical emergency things,

149
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,280
that we needed to see to get everybody

150
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,190
up and running quickly,

151
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:26,180
and then have really
started to double back

152
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,950
and now pay attention
to privacy and security,

153
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:32,613
particularly looking how that's
gonna work in the future.

154
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:35,280
So, here's some issues to consider.

155
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,289
Here's some of the kinds

156
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:38,018
of information that our clients

157
00:06:38,018 --> 00:06:42,309
are now getting, temperature
checks and questionnaires.

158
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,130
So, if your organization

159
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:47,260
is gonna start taking
temperature checks at the door

160
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:52,260
or having your employees
self-report them think about it.

161
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,728
Do you want people to
affirmatively give you

162
00:06:55,728 --> 00:06:57,410
what they've tested?

163
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:59,470
So, if a person tests negative just sort

164
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:01,030
of the regular temperature

165
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:03,270
do you need to know what
that temperature is?

166
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,930
Do you just wanna know that
they've tested negative

167
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:07,750
or do you just want them to default

168
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,620
to give you the information?

169
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,680
If they've tested positive to say,

170
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,360
I've got a fever today, who collects it?

171
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,020
Are you having a building
manager collect it?

172
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,419
For example, if you're renting space,

173
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,970
do you want the building to collect it

174
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:23,050
before people come in,

175
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:24,660
some buildings are actually collecting

176
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:27,140
it for the safety of all of their tenants.

177
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,789
In many instances for our clients,

178
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:33,010
if you can have somebody else
tasked for that information

179
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:34,620
privacy implications are less

180
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,760
because that is information

181
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,990
that maybe you're not going to get.

182
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,520
And then there's the question of,

183
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,659
is it really necessary to keep all of it?

184
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,090
And this is one of the really the most

185
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:45,320
important things that
we're gonna talk about.

186
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,969
We'll talk a little bit
more about all the rest

187
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:49,000
of the stuff that we're
gonna be collecting,

188
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,630
but do you actually
need to hold that data?

189
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:54,810
That is a really important point,

190
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:58,540
that we really are focusing
on with lots of our clients.

191
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,860
It's great to have an audit trail,

192
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,660
but do you really have to have it?

193
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,820
Do you need to be getting that information

194
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,310
from your employees?

195
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:08,330
Do you need to keep it,
if you are gonna keep it,

196
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:10,039
how long are you gonna keep it?

197
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,390
Because if we're just gonna get it

198
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,200
in and keep it forever,

199
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:17,490
then that in and of itself can
cause a number of problems.

200
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:20,220
For testing if you're gonna
be doing COVID testing.

201
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:23,483
So, like a PCR test or sort of,
or the swabs that you can do

202
00:08:23,483 --> 00:08:26,570
with the mouth, when will you require it?

203
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:28,180
Is it gonna be weekly?

204
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:30,170
Is it gonna be bi-weekly?

205
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:31,940
Is it gonna be every day?

206
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,940
And what are you doing with the results?

207
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,970
Are the results gonna be coming to you

208
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:38,299
or are the results
gonna be sitting perhaps

209
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:39,943
with the doctor who's doing it?

210
00:08:40,871 --> 00:08:43,419
And you're only gonna find out
if somebody tests positive.

211
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:45,069
If somebody does test positive

212
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:47,160
do you have a plan in place to communicate

213
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,750
that with the workforce?

214
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,890
So, in general, what we advise

215
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:55,230
is that it really isn't necessary
for you to tell everybody

216
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:57,630
that Aaron Charfoos has
tested positive for COVID.

217
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:59,550
If you saw Aaron the other day

218
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:01,170
you might wanna get tested.

219
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:05,069
In most instances, it's probably
good enough to simply say

220
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:08,350
that somebody who works
on your floor in your pod,

221
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:11,990
in your office, whatever the
case is, had tested positive

222
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:15,010
for COVID and it was in
close proximity to you.

223
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:16,819
And so you should get tested.

224
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,450
So, those kinds of questions
about how do you communicate

225
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:23,410
with the workforce and
who, if I test positive

226
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:26,079
and I'm on the 45th
floor, does everybody else

227
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,428
in the building need to know
when likely I haven't been

228
00:09:29,428 --> 00:09:31,330
in touch with them that often?
And we now know from some

229
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:34,750
of the new CDC guidance that
you really need to be in a room

230
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,950
with people for longer than
just maybe an elevator ride,

231
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:39,970
in order to increase their risk.

232
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:42,950
So, lots of companies are
making determinations report,

233
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,510
how are we gonna tell people?

234
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:45,700
When are we gonna tell people?

235
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,240
And who are we gonna tell?

236
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,080
And for us, when we report in,

237
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,190
are we gonna report our
diagnoses and using an app?

238
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:56,210
And then how is the company
gonna get rid of it?

239
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:58,090
So, in order to answer
a lot of those questions

240
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:00,080
we have to look at the legal framework,

241
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,970
and there are both existing

242
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:06,000
and proposed laws, and
at the federal level

243
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,720
and there are state
laws that we're looking.

244
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,600
And we'll talk a little bit

245
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,600
about the role of policy here as well.

246
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,430
First of all, in terms of existing laws,

247
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:16,800
one of the laws that people think

248
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,620
of the most is HIPAA and HITECH.

249
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,560
And we're gonna talk a little bit

250
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,550
about whether or not those
are actually applicable,

251
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:27,729
but they are really important to know.

252
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:30,620
So, HIPAA and HITECH are
gonna be the first two.

253
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:33,440
HIPAA is the law that governs the use

254
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,730
of information and connection

255
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:38,300
with insurance and with
the diagnosis of disease.

256
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,949
There are many states that have unfair

257
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:43,520
and deceptive acts and practices statutes.

258
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,600
So, why are those gonna be relevant?

259
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,920
While along with Federal

260
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,329
and State Information Practices, Act

261
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:52,120
those are gonna be relevant
because in many cases

262
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,210
they require you to explain how

263
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:58,110
for employees or visitors
to your office, you collect,

264
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:01,020
use store and delete information.

265
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:03,579
So, if you don't say anything
about taking information

266
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:07,200
about temperatures and keeping
it for the next three years,

267
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,310
you may have a problem 'cause
you haven't properly disclosed

268
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:12,689
under a state law that
requires you to explain how

269
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:15,490
you're gathering that kind
of personal information.

270
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:17,810
Similarly, if you promise
that you're gonna delete it

271
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:21,750
and you don't delete it,
again, many states would say

272
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:25,290
that you've deceived customers or visitors

273
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:28,560
to your site because you kept
it longer than you expect it.

274
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,400
Of course, for anybody who's operating

275
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,880
outside of the United States, the GDPR,

276
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:38,180
and along with other statutes
like Canada's PIPEDA.

277
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,469
Brazil has a statute.

278
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:41,080
That's like GDPR.

279
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,260
You have to be very careful,

280
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,420
because whereas in the United States,

281
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:47,400
information is protected.

282
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,030
This kind of medical
information is protected,

283
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:53,319
in the European Union it's
protected at a much higher level.

284
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:57,390
So, if you have European
operations, I'm gonna suggest

285
00:11:57,390 --> 00:12:01,569
that you keep much, much less
information, because keeping

286
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:04,670
it requires a lot more in terms

287
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:08,083
of the obligations that
you're gonna need to follow.

288
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:11,740
I mentioned the fact that HIPAA is often

289
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,960
the first statute that people think about,

290
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:17,470
but here HIPAA generally doesn't apply

291
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,740
to the information that we're collecting.

292
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:23,280
Even if an employer is
collecting it as part

293
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,490
of a workplace monitoring
program, or perhaps particularly

294
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:30,970
because they're doing it as a
workplace monitoring program.

295
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:34,410
So, HIPAA only covers
protected health information,

296
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:36,709
and that must be created, collected,

297
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:38,950
transmitted or maintained in connection

298
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:40,970
with the provision of healthcare,

299
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:42,440
payment for healthcare services

300
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,320
or the use in healthcare operations.

301
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,460
The EEOC in the United States has said

302
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:51,210
that employee testing
generally does not fall

303
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:52,970
within those provisions,

304
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:56,720
because what it is is
actually workplace monitoring.

305
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,250
So, why is that make a big difference?

306
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:02,220
Well, HIPAA requires a bunch

307
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:05,330
of different kinds of
protection that come along

308
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:09,960
with the data that you may not
want to have to sign up to.

309
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:13,610
And so for example, most states will say

310
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:16,750
that non HIPPA medical
information can be stored

311
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:21,040
in an employees file, but in a
separate medical file folder,

312
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,339
doesn't necessarily need to be encrypted.

313
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,920
Although like other
medical information often

314
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,560
it's a good idea to do
it because it may help

315
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,760
in the event that it's lost,
but there are less restrictions

316
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,350
around who can touch the
data and who can get it,

317
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:36,063
who you have to limit access to,

318
00:13:36,063 --> 00:13:38,540
HIPAA is far more restrictive

319
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:40,890
than some of the state
statutes are gonna be.

320
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:42,640
So, it is better to start

321
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,569
from a position where you're
gonna be protecting it

322
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:48,173
as just medical information
and not HIPPA, PHI.

323
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:50,360
And so that's one

324
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,810
of the reasons why you
wanna be very careful,

325
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:56,810
the place where this often
comes up is when you enter

326
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:59,790
into an agreement with a testing provider.

327
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:02,540
So, if you're going to
be doing COVID testing,

328
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:05,040
most testing agreements that I've seen

329
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,579
and we've negotiated quite a few

330
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:11,130
of these have said that the
information is subject to HIPAA.

331
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:15,000
And so if you inadvertently
promise to protect it

332
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,920
as if it was HIPAA protected information,

333
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,610
then you may be signing
yourself up to obligations

334
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,890
which you really didn't intend to do.

335
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:26,189
And so now you've really set
the bar high for yourself.

336
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:28,620
So, as you're looking
at agreements possibly

337
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:32,650
with entities that are gonna
test your employee population

338
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:35,550
many of our clients are
running vaccine clinics onsite.

339
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:38,130
If you're looking at the
vaccines, think about

340
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:42,410
whether or not you really need
to protect that with HIPAA.

341
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:44,560
And whether it's HIPAA
covered information,

342
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,239
talk to your lawyers and see whether

343
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,390
or not that's something
you really need to do.

344
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:51,640
And if the information
is lost and we have this,

345
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,350
we had a client who inadvertently lost

346
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:56,880
an Excel spreadsheet
that had the test results

347
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,460
of every employee within the company.

348
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:03,940
And because we had negotiated
the agreements ahead of time,

349
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,130
such that it didn't say

350
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:07,660
that you had to protect it with HIPAA.

351
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:11,632
We were able to avoid disclosures
to the federal regulators,

352
00:15:11,633 --> 00:15:14,330
because it had just gone
to the wrong person.

353
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,570
Had we not done that,

354
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:18,620
it would have been a much
more complicated analysis.

355
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,950
So, that's really that forward thinking

356
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:22,560
making sure you're paying attention

357
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,329
to how you're promising
to protect the information

358
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:29,070
is really important, in
addition to the federal laws

359
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:30,160
that deal with health care.

360
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,510
And these are really sort
of healthcare specific

361
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:37,210
but we've got a lot of EEOC
guidance on, can you test?

362
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:38,560
Should you test?

363
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,209
Can you ask for vaccine cards?

364
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:42,660
By the way we made this
presentation really

365
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,459
as the vaccines were rolling out

366
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:47,120
and the EEOC was issuing
some other guidance,

367
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,780
but the answer so far
from the EEOC is yes,

368
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:53,760
employers are permitted
to ask for evidence

369
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:57,740
of vaccines and you can take
the vaccine card if you want.

370
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,580
You can copy the information down,

371
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,290
including the person's name,

372
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:04,319
the kind of vaccine that
they got and some employers.

373
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,360
And there was a question

374
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,830
of whether or not this will
be permissible long-term,

375
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:10,800
but are even gonna keep that information

376
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,729
in the event then you
have to get a booster shot

377
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:16,770
at some point in time, they
will come back to the employees

378
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:18,750
and ask them, have you
gotten your booster shot

379
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,500
or reminders about booster shots

380
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:23,580
or potentially doing vaccine
clinics to get people

381
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,620
around their time for booster shots?

382
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,068
So, currently that's permissible,

383
00:16:27,068 --> 00:16:30,810
although, as we'll see in various states,

384
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:33,319
state laws are starting
to clamp down on some

385
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:36,500
of these privacy issues and
could definitely change that.

386
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,400
We do have a bunch of new laws,

387
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,230
and so whatever jurisdiction
you're operating in,

388
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:44,410
you should definitely be
paying attention to local laws.

389
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:46,550
The slide isn't meant to be comprehensive,

390
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:47,990
it's just meant to give you a sense

391
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:49,890
of what you should be looking for.

392
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:53,180
So, for example, in Kansas,
they require participation

393
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,839
in state contact tracing to be voluntary,

394
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,332
and mandates confidentiality

395
00:16:57,332 --> 00:17:00,420
and imposes data retention requirements.

396
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,250
And it also prohibits certain uses

397
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,280
of cell phone location, data.

398
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:07,109
This is important because as employers,

399
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,139
if you're gonna collect the information

400
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,609
and then think you need to turn it

401
00:17:09,609 --> 00:17:13,129
over to the local authorities,
if a person test positive,

402
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:14,339
you may need to make sure

403
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:16,709
that you've gotten the
proper employee consents

404
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:19,094
and that sometimes can happen upfront.

405
00:17:19,094 --> 00:17:22,694
So, if a person is going to get a test

406
00:17:22,694 --> 00:17:26,040
and that person is going
to sign a waiver form

407
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,720
so that the doctor can give the employer

408
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,140
the information, you could
also include in that form.

409
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:36,210
The fact that if local
regulation requires disclosure

410
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:38,810
of contract tracing that
you'll contact tracing,

411
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:39,929
that you'll do that.

412
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:42,140
So, think about those kinds
of things ahead of time

413
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:42,973
as you're working

414
00:17:42,973 --> 00:17:46,570
with the testing providers
or the vaccine providers

415
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:49,280
to make sure that you're
able to share the information

416
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,963
with anybody who you need to do.

417
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:53,950
New York has some unique statutes,

418
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:56,210
about contact tracers being hired

419
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:57,340
by the state health department,

420
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:00,149
and representing cultural
and linguistic communities

421
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:03,840
of the diversity of the
communities they serve.

422
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,139
South Carolina actually prohibits
local health departments

423
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:11,180
from using mobile apps can
create it for contact tracing.

424
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:13,390
So, we're seeing laws all across the board

425
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:14,770
in different jurisdictions.

426
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:16,940
And so it's really
important to pay attention

427
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:20,170
where you are to what
local laws there may be.

428
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:22,800
And in here in the City of Chicago,

429
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,620
there are actually some
laws being considered

430
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:27,560
that would prohibit asking
for the vaccine information.

431
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,730
So, again, as we move

432
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:31,010
from sort of getting back
to the office with testing

433
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:33,520
to getting back to the
office with vaccines,

434
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,200
we have a whole new set of
laws that we might need to deal

435
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,450
with that we really have
to pay attention to.

436
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:41,340
We also have a series of laws

437
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:44,919
at the federal level
that have been proposed,

438
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,810
many of which have died in committee

439
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:49,050
and haven't really gone very far,

440
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:52,139
but certainly are something
to pay attention to.

441
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:55,640
So, the COVID Consumer
Data Protection Act,

442
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,010
it said that you can't
have any contact tracing

443
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:00,010
without affirmative consent.

444
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:02,790
So, you have to specifically
ask somebody ahead of time

445
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:04,290
if we can do contact tracing.

446
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:05,480
Again, this takes us back

447
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,960
to that original question
when you're putting together

448
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,820
these programs, make sure
you look at everything

449
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:15,230
from the contracts that you
have with the testing providers

450
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:17,010
all the way to the consents
that you're getting

451
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:19,129
from the individuals and
know what you might need

452
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:21,990
to get consent for later on
because it's really hard,

453
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:24,440
once you've gathered the
information to go back

454
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,800
and ask again.

455
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:30,389
There are also two other
democratic proposals,

456
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:32,267
the Public Health Emergency Privacy Act,

457
00:19:32,267 --> 00:19:35,770
and the Secure Data and
Privacy for Contact Tracing.

458
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:37,970
Both of those laws actually spend a lot

459
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:40,210
of time talking a little
bit more about transparency

460
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:43,960
and use restrictions
rather than specifically

461
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:47,553
just preventing contact
tracing in general.

462
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:54,260
So, with that, why don't
I turn it over to Ericka?

463
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,093
Who's gonna talk a little bit

464
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:57,450
about what the risk
environment looks like.

465
00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:00,110
- Thank you Aaron, we're
really walked us through

466
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:02,740
what are the considerations, specifically

467
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:05,800
in the COVID-19 environment
about collecting data.

468
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,403
And he talked a lot about,

469
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,460
health centric data that,
you may be collecting

470
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,650
as part of your organization,
frankly, just to make sure

471
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:16,810
that your environment is
safe, your employees are safe.

472
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:18,610
And I think as he said

473
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:21,360
this is gonna continue
to be an interesting

474
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,582
evolving area of law.

475
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:23,670
What I'm gonna talk

476
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:27,730
to you about today is
mitigating your risk.

477
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:30,320
As you're collecting this
data, mitigating your risk

478
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,810
of a subtype of cyber incident.

479
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:36,110
And then what are some
considerations on the backend

480
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:39,699
if unfortunately you may be
a victim of a cyber incident.

481
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,470
And so to kind of do that,
we'll wanna start really talk

482
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:44,280
about what are our considerations,

483
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,129
really in this COVID-19 environment.

484
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:50,400
And so first talk about the
increase in cyber attacks.

485
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,900
We'll really kind of do a
deep dive into the trends

486
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,520
and frankly, what we're seeing right now,

487
00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:00,100
it's been quite an
interesting 12 to 16 months

488
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,480
and I'm sure many in this audience

489
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,520
can really attest to some
of these interesting trends.

490
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,970
I'll go through here shortly.

491
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,150
I'll follow up by talking

492
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:11,750
about written information
security plans, WISPs,

493
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:15,110
and while the slide is really focused

494
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:16,600
on what regulators are thinking,

495
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,879
I'm really gonna try to spend some time

496
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,150
about being practical and what it can help

497
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:22,920
for you and your organization to mitigate,

498
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,490
your risk and frankly, be
prepared on the backend.

499
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:27,600
Them I'm gonna talk about ransomware,

500
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,189
particularly in the wake of colonial pipe,

501
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:32,750
and then fourth I'll talk
about forensic reports

502
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,520
and can some considerations in the wake

503
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:37,443
of two fascinating cases
that came out this last year.

504
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:40,316
All right. So, really just kind of talking

505
00:21:40,316 --> 00:21:42,180
about the trends that we've experienced,

506
00:21:43,032 --> 00:21:46,679
COVID-19 has truly increased
the cyber incidents

507
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,080
that we've seen.

508
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,427
And so what we're really seeing is,

509
00:21:50,427 --> 00:21:52,689
and of the trends that I
like to talk to throughout

510
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:56,820
this presentation is we're
seeing threat actors now

511
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:00,340
during the two-fold
attack, it's exfiltration

512
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:04,451
of data prior to deployment
of ransomware attack,

513
00:22:04,451 --> 00:22:06,822
or deploying of an
encrypting your entire data.

514
00:22:06,822 --> 00:22:10,389
And so what we're seeing
more and more is this idea

515
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:14,370
of threat actors really using
exfiltration of your data,

516
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:16,959
as a way to kind of
strong arm you into paying

517
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,550
that ransom and why that's
really important right now

518
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:24,090
in the COVID-19 environment
as Aaron discuss is that,

519
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:27,260
we're seeing companies more
and more collecting this type

520
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:30,430
of, sensitive data.

521
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:34,210
And in the United States,

522
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:37,119
we've got a patchwork of 50 plus,

523
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:40,909
every jurisdiction has its
own breach notification law.

524
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:43,410
And in every jurisdiction there,

525
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:45,170
one of those definitions

526
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:47,640
of personal information
is health information.

527
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,440
And so by a broad definition,

528
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,950
taking people's temperature,
things like that

529
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:55,680
that very well and probably is likely

530
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,880
is to be considered health information

531
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,660
for data breach notification obligations.

532
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:04,530
And what we're seeing is that
threat actors are very smart

533
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:07,830
and they understand that,
they understand your industry

534
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:09,340
and they're very targeted.

535
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:14,340
And so what we find is B to C companies,

536
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:20,246
threat actors are using
this trend to go after

537
00:23:20,246 --> 00:23:24,493
your customer's data, your
customer sensitive data.

538
00:23:24,493 --> 00:23:28,820
What we're seeing is in B to
B businesses, they're going

539
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:32,370
after your business partners data.

540
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:33,550
And then they're threatening to say,

541
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:35,100
look if you don't pay us,

542
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,449
we're gonna make this public so that,

543
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:39,250
your business partners don't wanna data

544
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:42,343
or don't wanna do business with you.

545
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:46,670
And then just generally
seeing threat actors

546
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:50,360
just becoming more and more
and more sophisticated.

547
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:54,270
For example, we had a recent matter where

548
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:57,993
a CFO was tricked into
transferring $5 million,

549
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:01,330
because what he thought
was a CEO was explaining

550
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:04,679
this really complex
real estate transaction.

551
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,370
It turns out it was just
someone who had taken

552
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:12,090
over this CEO's account,
but I was just blown away

553
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:15,870
that this third actor was
able to speak the lingo.

554
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:19,770
Another example of just being
very highly sophisticated,

555
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:22,340
you'll see companies that have,

556
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:24,540
as more and more companies
these days are moving

557
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:27,240
from bricks to clicks,
they're moving online,

558
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:32,240
what we are seeing is companies
that do business online via,

559
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:38,480
online orders, threat actors are attacking

560
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,562
the public facing website.

561
00:24:39,562 --> 00:24:43,379
And then again, requesting some type

562
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:47,240
of payment due to release the website.

563
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,080
So, I mean, all in all

564
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,770
I've got some really great
statistics here, but I mean

565
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:55,090
the key takeaway is that COVID-19

566
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:58,620
has just continued to push
the trend even further.

567
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:01,830
And that we are prior to COVID-19

568
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:03,629
we saw cyber incidences

569
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:05,530
and as they come in
many different flavors,

570
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:07,139
as I'm sure this audience knows,

571
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:11,210
but we're continuing to see
just an incredible increase

572
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:14,300
in the amount of cyber
incidences and frankly

573
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,990
in the demands for ransom

574
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:18,760
that's been something
that I've personally seen

575
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:22,000
a huge change from the requests for tens

576
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,710
of thousands of dollars now to
tens of millions of dollars.

577
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:27,680
And so this is not meant
to scare everybody,

578
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:31,570
but it's more to say that
cyber incidences are happening,

579
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:33,439
and they're gonna continue to happen.

580
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,790
And unless your organization
is thinking about it,

581
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:37,810
and thinking about the
things that Aaron was saying

582
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:40,419
Aaron was saying, do you need this data?

583
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:42,460
How long do I need to store it?

584
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:46,600
If your company is not
thinking proactively

585
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,969
about that, you're already on your heels.

586
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:50,870
Because, well, last thing I will say

587
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:53,770
on this slide is what we're
seeing with our clients.

588
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:56,520
So, many of them are coming to
us and saying, well, why me?

589
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,910
I'm a plumber in the Midwest.

590
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:00,530
I'm a nonprofit organization.

591
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:01,510
That's a health center.

592
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:02,750
That's frankly, losing money.

593
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:04,290
Why am I getting hit?

594
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:07,050
The reality is these threat actors know

595
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:08,120
that they can exploit money

596
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:11,149
from you and everybody
is a potential target.

597
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:15,420
So, being proactive is
just incredibly important,

598
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:17,390
particularly in this environment.

599
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:18,690
So, one last thing I'm gonna add

600
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:22,200
to this slide before I go
on, is what we're seeing

601
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:27,200
is with fishing increase, no longer can,

602
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:30,330
I walked down to accounting or someone

603
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:33,879
in your organization, walk
next door and say, hey CEO

604
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,850
did you really want me to
transfer this 5 million?

605
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:38,540
Because we're in a remote environment,

606
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:41,610
it's just so much easier
for these threat actors

607
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:46,610
to exploit us using social
engineering attacks,

608
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,730
essentially where they're taking

609
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:49,130
over someone else's account,

610
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:51,630
they're purporting to be
someone that they're not,

611
00:26:52,685 --> 00:26:55,310
and in doing so it's generally we see

612
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:57,690
like a request for a wire transfer,

613
00:26:57,690 --> 00:26:59,190
because my bank account has changed

614
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:00,760
or because we need to do this deal,

615
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:04,150
because of the remote
environment, it's made it easier

616
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:07,160
for, the Nigerian prince to just suddenly

617
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,450
become so much more effective.

618
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:10,583
And that's really the
environment we're in.

619
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:13,580
Okay, and please let us know
if you have any questions

620
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:15,290
along the way and make
sure you just send them

621
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:17,923
over to Aaron and he'll
bring them up as we go.

622
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:19,863
All right.

623
00:27:19,863 --> 00:27:22,455
So, the rapidly evolving
security expectations.

624
00:27:22,455 --> 00:27:24,293
So, I talked about in the
last slide WISPs, so just kind

625
00:27:24,293 --> 00:27:29,245
of broadly to backup, a WISPs
is really your playbook.

626
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:33,536
It's your game plan.

627
00:27:33,536 --> 00:27:35,900
It's a document that sets forth,

628
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:40,900
what security protocols
that you have in place.

629
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:43,430
It sets forth what's your
incident response plan.

630
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:48,430
It can set forth what's
your disaster recovery plan.

631
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:51,270
It essentially is your playbook

632
00:27:52,163 --> 00:27:53,713
in the event that you have,

633
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:57,430
some type of cyber incident.

634
00:27:57,430 --> 00:28:00,720
And what I say here is
that yes, it's important

635
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,270
that regulators are now
expecting it more and more.

636
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:05,870
For example, if you go and report

637
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:07,570
a data breach in Massachusetts,

638
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:09,290
it forces you to answer the question.

639
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:10,280
Do you have a WISP?

640
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,970
Do you not have WISP?

641
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:15,690
But I think the key here
is that if your desire

642
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:20,550
and drive to have a WISP
is because of regulators.

643
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:24,129
I think that's the wrong
perspective based on,

644
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:26,790
kind of my conversation in the
last slide, the inevitability

645
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:30,200
of a cyber incident is,
and it can be big or small,

646
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,850
but it's likely I get three
to four phishing emails a week

647
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:34,929
and it drives me nuts,
but I screenshot them

648
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:37,300
for these presentations
so I can do them later

649
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,860
and I get kind of excited about it.

650
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:41,209
But the reality is the likelihood

651
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:43,310
that your organization
is gonna have some type

652
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:44,940
of cyber incident is high.

653
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:45,860
And so it was important

654
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:48,699
that you really take the
proactive measures to ensure

655
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:49,890
that you guys were prepared.

656
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:50,850
And one thing I love

657
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:53,790
that Aaron said is think about what,

658
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:57,264
he talked about specifically in collection

659
00:28:57,265 --> 00:29:00,310
of data related to COVID-19,

660
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:02,980
but this is a good
opportunity is to say, okay,

661
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,960
well, what other data do I have out there?

662
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,340
What other data?

663
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:08,919
We recently represented a university

664
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:13,107
and we had data back to like the '90s.

665
00:29:13,107 --> 00:29:15,163
And so it's thinking through,

666
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:19,030
understanding the data you have.

667
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:20,810
And I would strongly
recommend I'm not gonna go

668
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:23,840
in detail here, but do
a data mapping exercise,

669
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,689
understand where your data is.

670
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:29,670
And then as you create your WISP,

671
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:34,620
as you create that, the
value in that is thinking

672
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:37,010
through what security
controls that you have

673
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:38,660
in place working with your IT team.

674
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:42,790
And one thing I say is that
this is no longer an IT problem.

675
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:44,250
This is an everybody problem.

676
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:45,830
And if we put the onus

677
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:49,669
on it to just kind of protect everybody,

678
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:52,320
it's just not effective because
it's gotta be a team effort.

679
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,810
So, your plans got your
internal controls in place.

680
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:59,210
It also has your incident response plan.

681
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:00,470
An incident response plan

682
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:04,670
is literally your break glass here.

683
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:06,460
This is what we need to do.

684
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:08,460
Your plan basically walks through.

685
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,530
What would you do

686
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:12,100
in the event of some
type of cyber incident?

687
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,370
It's really important because.

688
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:16,270
- Hey Ericka we've got
a couple of questions

689
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:18,470
in the chat before we go
too far down the road.

690
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:21,270
Can you remind everybody that
what WISP stands for first?

691
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:23,460
- Yeah, Written Information Security Plan?

692
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:24,293
I'm sorry.

693
00:30:24,293 --> 00:30:27,040
I'm, botched that like five times.

694
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,139
- No, it's good.

695
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:30,000
Second question.

696
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,190
Are you seeing specific
written information

697
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:36,280
security plans that
are more COVID related?

698
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:39,220
So, companies may normally have a WISP

699
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:41,067
but do they have like a specific rider

700
00:30:41,067 --> 00:30:42,960
for COVID related issues?

701
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,070
- I have not personally seen that myself.

702
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:47,379
I think that's a absolutely best practice

703
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:49,560
but what I'm normally seeing is

704
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:52,730
that someone has written
one, three years ago,

705
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:55,610
it's dusty on a shelf
and we like blow it off.

706
00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:56,443
And we say one

707
00:30:56,443 --> 00:30:59,129
we have to tell them when
a regulator asks about it.

708
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:00,530
And so, I mean, I think

709
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:02,960
if someone's asking the
question, is it COVID related?

710
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,890
That makes me happy.

711
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:06,020
'Cause it tells me that
they're already thinking

712
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:08,220
that they have one and
they need to update it.

713
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:10,850
So, if that's your
perspective, that's great

714
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:13,800
because I can tell you're way ahead

715
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,572
of the game on most of our clients.

716
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:18,024
- And last question, and I'm pretty sure

717
00:31:18,024 --> 00:31:19,850
you're gonna give a lawyerly answer

718
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:21,990
on this one that it depends.

719
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:24,360
Are there any current legal penalties

720
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,679
for businesses who experienced breaches,

721
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:29,023
and for example of paying fines?

722
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:31,693
- Oh, say that again.

723
00:31:31,693 --> 00:31:32,685
I'm sorry.

724
00:31:32,685 --> 00:31:33,518
What was the question?

725
00:31:33,518 --> 00:31:35,700
- Sure, are there any
current legal penalties

726
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:38,020
for businesses to experience breaches

727
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:40,123
and for example, paying fines?

728
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,710
- Oh, well I'm glad you
asked that question.

729
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:47,523
So, paying fine specifically,

730
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,460
I may have to get back
to you on paying fines.

731
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:54,700
I just don't know that
off the top of my head,

732
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:57,150
but I will say that.

733
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:59,700
- It probably depends on the jurisdiction.

734
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:02,190
- Well, yeah, it definitely
depends on the jurisdiction.

735
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:05,990
I was gonna say in three
slides down, I really talk

736
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:09,029
about civil penalties in the
context of ransomware payments,

737
00:32:09,029 --> 00:32:13,170
but for just, having a breach itself

738
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:16,030
it definitely depends
based on the jurisdiction.

739
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:18,889
Well I haven't seen that in the context

740
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:23,340
of regulators, but what
I have seen is just a lot

741
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:26,649
of inquiries and a lot
of headaches for clients.

742
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:29,730
Just asking about what
you've done beforehand,

743
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:32,380
what you're doing now,
and really what I've seen.

744
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:35,970
Regulators are less focused
in my experience and fines.

745
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:37,810
And they're more focused on making sure

746
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:42,810
that you've remediated and
really getting in the weeds on,

747
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,760
what you've implemented going forward

748
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:48,180
and how you're gonna mitigate
your risk going forward.

749
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:51,040
I will say that it definitely does happen.

750
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,620
We had that had Uber,

751
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:55,239
we've had some sizable examples

752
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:58,730
of attorneys generals go
after bigger companies.

753
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:01,920
And it's generally in the
context when they fail to report

754
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,223
and they covered up,

755
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:05,990
and then that's when
they do get penalized.

756
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:08,570
So, yes, they do it
depends on the jurisdiction

757
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:10,280
but Uber is a good example of it.

758
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,590
And I'm really struggling

759
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:14,300
around the top of my head
of some other good examples

760
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,990
but I know there've been some big fines

761
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:19,860
but all of those were in the
context of failure to report

762
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,450
and intentionally, kind of covering it up.

763
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:26,190
That's really been the examples.

764
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:27,980
- Well, and I think that on top of that

765
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:29,870
there are some things that are not fines

766
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:31,310
which are still pretty painful.

767
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:33,870
So, if a regulator
requires you to implement

768
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:37,959
a written information security
program and then audits it,

769
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,560
and then comes in every single year

770
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:42,200
and audits it and has to
approve changes to it,

771
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,810
that can be really
challenging for a business.

772
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:47,440
But where we see a lot
of the commercial penalty

773
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,860
I wouldn't necessarily call
them penalties, but is often

774
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:54,229
in data breach litigation,
where individuals may be coming

775
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:57,960
after a class action or
where other companies

776
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,980
if you're a processor of
data for another company,

777
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:04,830
and you cause a breach, if
you lose their information,

778
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:06,310
you actually have a commercial risk

779
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:09,259
because they may have a
provision in the contract

780
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:11,880
which requires you to have
certain security standards.

781
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:16,040
And people can say that that
was a violation of that.

782
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,960
But like Ericka said, oftentimes one

783
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,480
of the biggest costs
is just the remediation

784
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,429
of the whole thing.

785
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,320
- It's a great plan about litigation.

786
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,120
Yeah, absolutely.

787
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,889
- So, there's another question here.

788
00:34:28,889 --> 00:34:31,109
Is there any case law where
penalties were lowered,

789
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:34,650
if an organization that
was breached was ISO 27001

790
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:37,173
certified or SOC 2 type audit?

791
00:34:38,554 --> 00:34:39,944
- We're gonna have to take that one

792
00:34:39,944 --> 00:34:43,360
and go back and do some research on that.

793
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:45,389
- What I would say is,

794
00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:48,225
I'm not sure that there's
case law, but there are plenty

795
00:34:48,226 --> 00:34:50,969
of jurisdictions that require
reasonable cybersecurity.

796
00:34:50,969 --> 00:34:53,152
And so the question is,

797
00:34:53,152 --> 00:34:56,040
is it reasonable to have those

798
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:59,250
what are you protecting and
how are you protecting it?

799
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:01,370
They may provide some defense

800
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:04,100
to the fact that it wasn't reasonable,

801
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,870
but it's not, some
jurisdictions, for example,

802
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:08,500
will say that if the data was encrypted

803
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:11,160
and the encryption key was not stolen

804
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:14,129
with the data, it's kind of
a get out of jail free card.

805
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:15,020
You're fine.

806
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:16,650
You don't even need to notify,

807
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:19,670
I don't know of any jurisdictions
which give a similar

808
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:23,300
get out of jail free
card for ISO or SOC 2,

809
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,883
but it can definitely help in the defense.

810
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,030
- Yeah, okay.

811
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:31,830
Any other questions before we go on?

812
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,750
Okay, thank you guys.

813
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:37,400
These are great questions so far.

814
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:41,690
Okay, so now we're gonna kind
of transition to ransomware.

815
00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:43,420
And I really do think that this is timely.

816
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:46,290
Obviously we didn't anticipate this when

817
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:49,250
we created the slide deck
a couple months back,

818
00:35:49,251 --> 00:35:53,130
but I find interesting with Colonial Pipe,

819
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:57,070
my takeaway from that was, it really,

820
00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:58,890
I think it shows the everyday American,

821
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:02,069
the reality of and the
impacts of ransomware attacks.

822
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:05,200
I was listening to a news broadcast

823
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,279
and the anchor said, oh, well, we hear

824
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,240
about these ransomware attacks
every two or three months.

825
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,292
It seems like it's becoming a problem.

826
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:17,050
As somebody who is in incident
response every single day,

827
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:18,133
I thought to myself, well,

828
00:36:18,133 --> 00:36:19,980
is that what the American public thinks?

829
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:23,130
Because we actually see these
things every single day.

830
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:25,950
And it's just not a matter
of if it's a matter of one.

831
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:28,319
And so kind of what I
talked about earlier,

832
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,670
on these key tactics of these bad actors

833
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:32,960
with ransomware I would
say three years ago,

834
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,970
we just saw threat actors coming in,

835
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:40,830
infiltrating the environment,
destroying the backups

836
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:43,020
and then encrypting
the entire environment.

837
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:45,170
And that was the M.O. there was no access.

838
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:47,003
There was no exfiltration of data,

839
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:51,060
but it's just significantly changed.

840
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:52,860
What we're seeing more and more is

841
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:57,860
that these threat actors
are exfiltrating data

842
00:36:57,950 --> 00:36:59,660
and they're doing a very good job,

843
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:01,560
of covering up their
tracks on the backend.

844
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,980
Like, you'll be able to see

845
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:04,960
that they're exfiltrating
data to, for example,

846
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:09,230
like an AWS bucket,
that's what they're called

847
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:11,780
or some of the third-party website,

848
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,730
but you won't be able to
see what's been taken.

849
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:15,990
And so they're very good
to let you know enough

850
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:17,580
that data has been taken,

851
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:19,580
but you just don't know
the full scope of it.

852
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:22,870
And that's part of the
negotiation is you pay for us.

853
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:24,279
We delete the data.

854
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,960
We tell you what, sometimes
they'll tell you what type

855
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:29,900
of data was taken and what I'm seeing more

856
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,810
and more clients who were actually paying

857
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:34,290
just not 'cause they
need the encryption key.

858
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:36,240
'Cause people have gotten
more savvy about backups,

859
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,549
but paying for the data to be deleted.

860
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:41,240
And I think for somebody
else who mentioned it

861
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,049
it's because of the litigation risk.

862
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:48,050
Okay, so what we saw, as I said earlier

863
00:37:48,413 --> 00:37:51,990
under COVID-19, we're
seeing incredible increase

864
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:56,979
in ransomware attacks, and
the government recognize that.

865
00:37:56,980 --> 00:38:00,170
And so the Department of
Treasury, two of their agencies

866
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:03,020
the Office of Foreign Asset Control, OFAC.

867
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:06,550
Or Financial Crimes
Enforcement Network, FINCEN,

868
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:08,900
they both issued an
advisory on October 1st

869
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:09,920
the exact same day.

870
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,253
And they were parallel advisories.

871
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,500
And essentially what they both said,

872
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:18,390
is that we're seeing an
increase of ransomware attacks.

873
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:21,017
And so we just wanna restate

874
00:38:21,017 --> 00:38:23,500
what the existing law is,

875
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,390
and completely paraphrasing here,

876
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:30,390
but essentially the existing
law is you cannot pay funds

877
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:32,690
to people on this designated list.

878
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:34,860
And I always mess up the
name. So, I wrote it down,

879
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:37,480
it's specially designated nationals

880
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,170
and blocked persons list.

881
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:43,380
And it's essentially lists
that is a sanctions violation.

882
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:46,530
If you pay people who are on this list

883
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:48,938
and it didn't say anything new,

884
00:38:48,938 --> 00:38:51,519
it just was kind of a reminder, look,

885
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:54,290
you victims of ransomware attacks,

886
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:55,640
those who are involved in this

887
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:59,359
to include cyber insurance companies.

888
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,343
So, as many of you know,

889
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,240
most of these organizations
now have cyber insurance.

890
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:09,370
And so it raised the
kind of the red flag of,

891
00:39:09,370 --> 00:39:12,350
hey, just so you know,
just so we're all clear,

892
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,480
we cannot be paying people

893
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,780
who are on this designated list

894
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:19,350
and, OFAC puts people on this list.

895
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:20,920
They put cyber criminals on this list.

896
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,090
And so, I mean,

897
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:24,520
I think it was part
enforcement just trying to say,

898
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:28,270
look, we're really trying to make a push.

899
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:29,950
To show they're putting
people on this list,

900
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:32,779
please don't pay those people.

901
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:35,800
And it really just restated existing law

902
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,800
and existing law said that if
you pay people on this list

903
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,700
there's a presumption strict
liability that, you know

904
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:47,569
you violated the law and
there's a strict liability

905
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:49,930
for the civil penalty for doing so.

906
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:54,930
And so, what I found
interesting about that is

907
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:58,740
it didn't really change
anything that we did.

908
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:00,828
Is it for a practical perspective,

909
00:40:00,828 --> 00:40:03,370
if you've got a client or,

910
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:06,520
as an organization you wanna pay,

911
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:09,470
for a decryption key or for the promise

912
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:14,000
to delete exfiltrated
data, you do an OFAC check.

913
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,050
That was something that we always did.

914
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:17,610
But some of the key takeaways

915
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:21,090
because of this is now OFAC checks

916
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:23,600
are very thoroughly analyzed.

917
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:26,120
We clearly document them.

918
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,810
Generally, you'll have
an attorney on your team.

919
00:40:27,810 --> 00:40:29,690
That's part of your
incident response team,

920
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:31,940
which should be part of the
team that you've created ahead

921
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:33,890
of time in your incident response plan.

922
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:36,170
You thoroughly document that,

923
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:38,900
and you have a written memorandum
from your attorney saying

924
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:40,430
we've done our due diligence.

925
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:43,482
Generally you use a third party
to do an OFAC check on them.

926
00:40:44,537 --> 00:40:48,270
And then another thing
that we've done as a result

927
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:51,050
with our clients is,
well, we have them go look

928
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:54,620
at their cyber insurance
policy now and say,

929
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:57,310
sometimes there'll be indemnification.

930
00:40:57,310 --> 00:41:02,310
If, for example, you pay
this ransom and it turns out,

931
00:41:02,453 --> 00:41:05,340
oh, they were on the designated list.

932
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:06,290
You're fined.

933
00:41:06,290 --> 00:41:08,120
Then you could try to turn
your insurance carrier

934
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:11,653
and try to receive, or
you're identified for that.

935
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,379
As a practical matter, though.

936
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:17,030
What really, what we're seeing is

937
00:41:18,937 --> 00:41:21,710
that insurance carriers are
so much more involved now,

938
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:24,820
their due diligence is, 'cause generally

939
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:26,510
if you were gonna pay the ransom

940
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:29,090
you need to get the
approval from your carrier.

941
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:31,860
What we're finding is carriers
are so much more hands-on.

942
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:34,420
They wanna read the OFAC check report.

943
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:36,360
They wanna make sure
everything's good to go,

944
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,070
because they understand
that they potentially

945
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:39,623
could be on the line as well.

946
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:43,410
And then the third thing that
we've really taken from this,

947
00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:45,140
and kind of a lesson learned is just,

948
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:47,009
as part of your incident response plan

949
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:49,880
because if the regular does ask,

950
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:53,750
for your WISP that you have
in there, make sure as part

951
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:56,540
of your like check mark in responding,

952
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:57,990
make sure you're doing an OFAC check.

953
00:41:57,990 --> 00:41:59,459
So, that's just showing regulators

954
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:02,640
that your focus and
you're aware of the law

955
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,339
and you're complying with the law.

956
00:42:05,195 --> 00:42:06,250
Now finally, a to key takeaway

957
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:08,660
from this is if you think you run

958
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:12,899
into a situation where you
may have made a payment,

959
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:16,360
you shouldn't have, the
alert basically says,

960
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,120
look, we'll give you leeway.

961
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,259
If you're proactive and letting us know,

962
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:26,236
that's something that they'll
take into consideration.

963
00:42:26,236 --> 00:42:29,850
And so really all this did
was just let everybody know

964
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:31,259
that this law is existing.

965
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:33,460
And really the key takeaways we've seen

966
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:35,640
is that the due diligence
has to be much more

967
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,089
on the OFAC check.

968
00:42:37,090 --> 00:42:39,730
Cyber insurance carriers
are much more involved,

969
00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:41,720
in any ransomware payment

970
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,649
and we're just more thorough on this step.

971
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:45,010
And we've always been thorough

972
00:42:45,010 --> 00:42:47,210
but we're just even
that much more thorough.

973
00:42:50,208 --> 00:42:52,470
- Hey, Ericka, I have
one question and actually

974
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:55,267
a helpful follow-up from
some people in the chat.

975
00:42:55,268 --> 00:42:58,776
First question, nobody's
asked this, but lots of people

976
00:42:58,776 --> 00:43:00,225
I'm sure thinking about it

977
00:43:00,226 --> 00:43:02,920
how many of your clients
actually pay the ransomware?

978
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:08,350
- I'm so glad you asked
that, it's a mixed bag

979
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:13,960
and it really it, so
some considerations are,

980
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:16,330
I have some clients who are
just like, I don't care.

981
00:43:16,330 --> 00:43:19,160
My company will go under before
I pay these threat actors.

982
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:21,660
And it's a moral stance that they take.

983
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:24,680
And so that's kind of one
bucket of individuals.

984
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:25,980
Another bucket we've seen

985
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:30,980
is those who are so terrified of the data

986
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:33,839
that's been exfiltrated,

987
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,420
that they're paid just for the deletion.

988
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:38,620
So, oftentimes we've gotten really good

989
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:40,270
about having Bible backups.

990
00:43:40,270 --> 00:43:41,970
And so that's less of the issue,

991
00:43:41,970 --> 00:43:43,259
but you'll have clients who pay

992
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:45,499
because they're worried about,

993
00:43:45,499 --> 00:43:47,939
all the sensitive data
that may have gotten out.

994
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:50,240
And so that's another
clear trend I've seen.

995
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,189
And then the third trend,
I think this really runs

996
00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:53,850
into Colonial Pipe is that you feel

997
00:43:53,850 --> 00:43:57,830
like your hands are tied,
your data has been encrypted.

998
00:43:57,830 --> 00:43:59,830
You don't have a viable backup.

999
00:43:59,830 --> 00:44:02,450
You haven't had a WISP. Well,
I don't know in that case

1000
00:44:02,450 --> 00:44:04,339
but clients don't have a WISP.

1001
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:06,390
So, one thing they haven't
thought through is,

1002
00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:07,940
well, what's our disaster plan.

1003
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:10,120
How do we move to manual processes?

1004
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:12,870
And they just can't
further moving forward.

1005
00:44:12,870 --> 00:44:13,857
And so then they pay for it.

1006
00:44:13,857 --> 00:44:16,460
And so, those are really
the trends that we see

1007
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:17,810
in those who end up paying.

1008
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:24,240
- And just as an update, thank
you to Steven and Stephanie,

1009
00:44:25,707 --> 00:44:27,440
Stephen pointed out that Ohio actually

1010
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:31,910
has a statute chapter 1354

1011
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:35,190
on businesses maintaining
recognized cybersecurity programs.

1012
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:37,200
It provides an affirmative defense.

1013
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,020
So, that generally means if
you're sued after the fact,

1014
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:44,500
you can use that as a
defense against the breach.

1015
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:45,960
Again, it's probably
a little bit different

1016
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:46,810
than an encryption,

1017
00:44:46,810 --> 00:44:49,130
because encryption would preclude you

1018
00:44:49,130 --> 00:44:51,260
from even notifying anybody about it.

1019
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:54,680
This is afterwards,
but it's a great point.

1020
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:57,120
And Stephanie said that both Utah

1021
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:59,210
and Connecticut have recently enacted

1022
00:44:59,210 --> 00:45:03,200
or introduced litigation with
those similar kinds of issues.

1023
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,799
So, thanks to everybody.

1024
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,840
- Absolutely, and I think
what that really does

1025
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:09,310
is highlights the nuance in all 50

1026
00:45:09,310 --> 00:45:11,660
of these U.S. jurisdictions.

1027
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:15,920
And many of our clients
are not just U.S. focused.

1028
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,170
They've got operations in the U.S.,

1029
00:45:18,170 --> 00:45:21,110
in Africa and Latin
America the South Pacific.

1030
00:45:21,110 --> 00:45:24,460
And so it does get very
nuanced very quickly.

1031
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:25,840
And I'm glad you guys mentioned that

1032
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:30,490
because even some jurisdictions
I'm working on a matter now,

1033
00:45:30,490 --> 00:45:34,609
sometimes you can't get
all of the addresses.

1034
00:45:34,610 --> 00:45:36,012
So, you have to substitute notice.

1035
00:45:36,012 --> 00:45:41,000
Well, sometimes in some
jurisdictions, if you have relied

1036
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,130
upon your incident response
plan, to the extent possible

1037
00:45:44,130 --> 00:45:46,010
it precludes you from
having to go through some

1038
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:49,670
of these bigger steps
for substitute notice

1039
00:45:49,670 --> 00:45:51,780
which usually is like notifying the media,

1040
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:54,160
putting on your website,
a lot of other steps.

1041
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:58,720
And so, there's no downside
to having a good whisk.

1042
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,270
That's really the key takeaway.

1043
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:03,660
- Another question, in the
chat, while you were talking,

1044
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:07,069
how can companies confirm
deletion of exfiltrated data

1045
00:46:07,070 --> 00:46:08,530
if that's what they're looking for?

1046
00:46:08,530 --> 00:46:11,653
- Yeah, you have to rely
on the threat actor says,

1047
00:46:12,516 --> 00:46:15,510
and so often what we do is we work

1048
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:19,500
with a vendor that has
like Dark Web monitoring.

1049
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:22,260
And so they will,

1050
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:24,180
for a period of time, they'll go out

1051
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:26,600
and they'll use their zeros
and William's algorithms.

1052
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:28,670
And not the zeros and one person,

1053
00:46:28,670 --> 00:46:30,710
but they'll go out and they'll see whether

1054
00:46:30,710 --> 00:46:33,480
or not they'll go on these
threat actors, shame sites

1055
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:35,640
and see whether or not there's
any evidence of the type

1056
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:37,440
of data that we would have expected.

1057
00:46:39,287 --> 00:46:40,140
In my experience.

1058
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:43,810
We haven't seen that.

1059
00:46:43,810 --> 00:46:47,413
I've never seen we've paid
and it didn't work out.

1060
00:46:47,413 --> 00:46:50,980
And that's not to say that's
the case for everybody,

1061
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:55,300
but their business model
is, trust us, pay us.

1062
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:56,430
It'll all go away.

1063
00:46:56,430 --> 00:46:58,710
And if it were kind of gets
out that you can't trust them

1064
00:46:58,710 --> 00:47:01,470
by paying them, it kind of
negates their business model.

1065
00:47:01,470 --> 00:47:05,290
So, but I think a lot
of people in this room

1066
00:47:06,170 --> 00:47:11,170
that Colonial Pipe, paid 55
million for the decryption key.

1067
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:13,910
And I really hate the mis-characterization

1068
00:47:13,910 --> 00:47:15,819
of it didn't work,

1069
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:19,300
because oftentimes you'll get
a key from the threat actor.

1070
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:22,950
And it's just, it's not as
efficient as you'd like it to be.

1071
00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:27,509
Oftentimes it'll instead of
just decrypting one file,

1072
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:29,450
it'll keep the decrypted file

1073
00:47:29,450 --> 00:47:31,230
and then it'll create a whole new file.

1074
00:47:31,230 --> 00:47:33,710
And so it's just slower.

1075
00:47:33,710 --> 00:47:36,750
And so some companies that
need to get it back up faster,

1076
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:38,500
they find manual ways around.

1077
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:42,320
But the decryption key in my
experience has always worked.

1078
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:45,430
It's just maybe not as fast
as people would like it to be.

1079
00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:48,340
- And just to add to that, I mean,

1080
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:50,080
one of the things that we've heard

1081
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:52,960
in conversations with the
FBI or the secret service

1082
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:55,200
as we're working through
some of these incidents,

1083
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:59,109
we've actually heard
that Ericka, as you said,

1084
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:02,894
this is a business model
that is based on trust.

1085
00:48:02,894 --> 00:48:06,209
If the consumers who are those

1086
00:48:06,210 --> 00:48:09,080
of us who get hit with a
ransomware, no longer trust

1087
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:12,250
that the hackers will unlock,
it will actually be a problem.

1088
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:14,930
Causing the whole thing unravels,

1089
00:48:14,930 --> 00:48:16,710
there's actually evidence

1090
00:48:16,710 --> 00:48:20,760
that in the cases where
hackers didn't unlock it,

1091
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:25,070
other hackers have attacked
those hackers as retribution

1092
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:27,910
to really threatening their business model

1093
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:29,299
and a very lucrative one too.

1094
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:32,910
So, we do see that there is almost some

1095
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:36,609
weird self-governance in
the space where the hackers

1096
00:48:36,610 --> 00:48:41,400
are making sure that
people are undoing it.

1097
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,290
- And their customer
service it's very good

1098
00:48:43,290 --> 00:48:45,216
once you pay paid, it's pretty amazing

1099
00:48:45,216 --> 00:48:47,540
they're there for you
to make sure it works.

1100
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:49,623
It's quite fascinating.

1101
00:48:50,742 --> 00:48:52,357
- And to help you buy cryptocurrency

1102
00:48:52,357 --> 00:48:56,740
and get it to them too,
800 numbers and all.

1103
00:48:56,740 --> 00:49:00,419
- Yeah, it's a pretty
interesting business model.

1104
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:04,713
And I don't know,

1105
00:49:06,133 --> 00:49:07,337
just get a quick tangent here.

1106
00:49:07,338 --> 00:49:08,920
I know, President Biden,
he implemented the new,

1107
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:10,770
his new executive order

1108
00:49:10,770 --> 00:49:14,020
and I think it's gonna be helpful,

1109
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:17,330
but I just wanna know
what the long-term plan

1110
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:19,700
is for companies like people in this room,

1111
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:21,390
at the end of the day,

1112
00:49:21,390 --> 00:49:25,080
you guys are protecting
your own infrastructure.

1113
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:26,823
And so I don't know.

1114
00:49:26,823 --> 00:49:31,493
I just really hope we come
up with a big solution.

1115
00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:33,483
All right.

1116
00:49:33,483 --> 00:49:35,390
That's the marine in me coming out.

1117
00:49:35,390 --> 00:49:38,790
Okay, so let's go ahead and
now turn to forensic reports

1118
00:49:38,790 --> 00:49:43,790
and discovery, over the last year

1119
00:49:44,490 --> 00:49:47,580
I guess since, so June
was the last first case.

1120
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:50,500
So, we had the Capital
One breach come out,

1121
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:53,039
then a case came out

1122
00:49:53,039 --> 00:49:57,200
and then the Clark Hill
matter came out as well.

1123
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:02,200
These are both two cases that
they really focused on whether

1124
00:50:04,370 --> 00:50:08,589
or not the forensic
report was discoverable.

1125
00:50:08,590 --> 00:50:10,700
And let me back up a
little bit, and I apologize

1126
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:13,984
if you guys already know
this, but a forensic report

1127
00:50:13,984 --> 00:50:18,790
is a report created by,
usually your IT forensic team

1128
00:50:18,790 --> 00:50:21,529
that you retain for this incident,

1129
00:50:21,530 --> 00:50:24,260
and what a forensic
report does, is it details

1130
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:28,140
the holes in your plan,

1131
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:30,210
how the threat actor was able to get in,

1132
00:50:30,210 --> 00:50:31,940
the date that they were able to get in,

1133
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:33,450
what data they were able to access,

1134
00:50:33,450 --> 00:50:35,520
what data they were able to exfiltrate.

1135
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:37,490
It really is.

1136
00:50:37,490 --> 00:50:41,759
It's a document that basically
says, how you got hacked

1137
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:44,400
and frankly, why you got hacked.

1138
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:49,400
And so, during litigation, plaintiffs,

1139
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:50,640
of course they want this document,

1140
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:52,799
because they wanna know how,

1141
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,360
or where your security measures
in place were reasonable.

1142
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:56,830
That's usually what it turns on.

1143
00:50:56,830 --> 00:51:00,160
And so this document is so important

1144
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:03,450
to really understand the
nature and scope of the breach.

1145
00:51:03,450 --> 00:51:07,339
And so it's always really hotly contested,

1146
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:10,100
and so matters that are going,

1147
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,580
that have the potential
to go to litigation.

1148
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:15,340
These two cases really say a lot,

1149
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:18,140
and it's a very evolving area of law,

1150
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:20,540
but these have been our most recent cases.

1151
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:24,020
And it's just to see how
this continues to evolve.

1152
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:28,640
And so I'll kind of talk through
what were the key takeaways

1153
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:32,537
for each of these cases and
a little bit about them.

1154
00:51:32,537 --> 00:51:36,136
And so, the Capital One
breach, I think many of us know

1155
00:51:36,136 --> 00:51:40,160
I think the threat actor
was a woman from Seattle

1156
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:41,640
I wanna say, or something like Northeast,

1157
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,870
I'm sure someone chatting as much more,

1158
00:51:43,870 --> 00:51:46,850
but essentially there was this millions

1159
00:51:46,850 --> 00:51:51,770
of customer data that
was potentially exposed.

1160
00:51:51,770 --> 00:51:56,770
And so in this case, they brought in,

1161
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:00,430
they had an outside, they
routine outside counsel,

1162
00:52:00,430 --> 00:52:04,279
and outside counsel essentially retained

1163
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:08,780
their existing IT forensic vendor mandate.

1164
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:13,230
And so the court in this case said, look,

1165
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:18,190
this report was not created
in anticipation of litigation.

1166
00:52:18,190 --> 00:52:20,300
It was created for business purposes

1167
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:24,083
and therefore this forensic
report is discoverable.

1168
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:25,753
And so, let me walk

1169
00:52:25,753 --> 00:52:29,720
through some of the key
takeaways from this litigation.

1170
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:34,720
Number one, to maintain
attorney client privilege.

1171
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:38,130
You really wanna make sure
you work with a vendor

1172
00:52:38,130 --> 00:52:41,590
for which you have no
pre-existing relationship.

1173
00:52:41,590 --> 00:52:42,580
So, in this case, they worked

1174
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:45,810
with Mandiant and they
had a preexisting MSA,

1175
00:52:45,810 --> 00:52:48,299
a preexisting a statement of work.

1176
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:50,000
And what the court said is that,

1177
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,940
how can you anticipate litigation?

1178
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:53,980
If you've already kind of come up

1179
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:55,780
with what you're gonna do ahead of time.

1180
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:57,960
And so the court said, hey, look

1181
00:52:57,960 --> 00:52:59,977
that was on anticipation of litigation.

1182
00:52:59,977 --> 00:53:03,220
And so for us, or as a practical matter,

1183
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:05,790
we ensure that if the client does have

1184
00:53:05,790 --> 00:53:08,140
an existing IT service provider,

1185
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:12,270
we will like to bring in our
own third party forensic team

1186
00:53:12,270 --> 00:53:15,290
because it's really
about creating a report

1187
00:53:15,290 --> 00:53:18,100
in anticipation of litigation,
helping the attorney.

1188
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:21,299
And as I go through this
list of four here or five

1189
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:24,760
rather just know that it's about
the totality of the search.

1190
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:29,110
Circumstances not one of
these really is game changing

1191
00:53:29,110 --> 00:53:31,810
but I'm gonna go through
what that best practices are.

1192
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:34,563
The second thing is,

1193
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:38,861
what I just said is retain a second firm.

1194
00:53:38,861 --> 00:53:40,259
Generally you'll have,

1195
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:42,680
either your own in-house IT firms

1196
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:45,796
or a third party IT service provider.

1197
00:53:45,796 --> 00:53:48,819
It's always best to bring in somebody new.

1198
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:50,410
So, you could really make the argument

1199
00:53:50,410 --> 00:53:51,859
that we brought in these new guys

1200
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:55,677
and they're solely focused
on litigation and not,

1201
00:53:55,677 --> 00:53:58,180
we're not just recycling
the old team in here.

1202
00:53:58,180 --> 00:54:00,500
Who's already been involved.

1203
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:02,050
As a practical matter,

1204
00:54:02,050 --> 00:54:03,360
your IT service provider.

1205
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:04,890
You're gonna be very involved with,

1206
00:54:04,890 --> 00:54:06,529
they know the infrastructure.

1207
00:54:06,530 --> 00:54:08,590
They were probably there to
help you respond immediately

1208
00:54:08,590 --> 00:54:13,590
to the incident, but
they're gonna be involved.

1209
00:54:16,270 --> 00:54:19,550
I'm realizing now that we're
just about out of time.

1210
00:54:19,550 --> 00:54:22,270
And so let me just run
through the list really fast.

1211
00:54:22,270 --> 00:54:27,020
Number one, have no
preexisting relationships

1212
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:30,003
with your IT security team,

1213
00:54:31,250 --> 00:54:33,910
always best to retain a second one.

1214
00:54:33,910 --> 00:54:37,640
If you have to use your
existing IT service provider,

1215
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:39,859
create a new statement of work,

1216
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:41,640
and don't just recycle
your old one as they did

1217
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:45,960
with Mandiant, use your report only

1218
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:47,370
for litigation purposes.

1219
00:54:47,370 --> 00:54:48,490
In this case, they shared

1220
00:54:48,490 --> 00:54:51,990
with like 50 plus employees,
their accountants, regulators.

1221
00:54:51,990 --> 00:54:53,779
So, don't do that.

1222
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:56,550
Only provide in-house as much as possible,

1223
00:54:56,550 --> 00:54:59,033
and then pay for it out
of your litigation budget.

1224
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:02,940
Clark Hill basically affirmed Capital One

1225
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:06,556
but they had a few nuances
and really their nuance was,

1226
00:55:06,556 --> 00:55:09,693
if you're going to provide your,

1227
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:13,700
if you're a pry the forensic
report to anybody provided,

1228
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:16,529
you focus only on your in-house counsel,

1229
00:55:16,530 --> 00:55:17,850
because in that matter,

1230
00:55:17,850 --> 00:55:20,910
they provided to the IT
team leadership and the FBI,

1231
00:55:20,910 --> 00:55:22,100
and they still said, well,

1232
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:24,560
that's still for business purposes.

1233
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:26,020
That's not anticipation litigation.

1234
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:28,940
So, minimize who you're providing it to.

1235
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:31,320
And don't have any of your recommendations

1236
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:34,110
for bettering your IT environment in that,

1237
00:55:34,110 --> 00:55:35,630
'cause that's more business.

1238
00:55:35,630 --> 00:55:37,110
I apologize that we had to race

1239
00:55:37,110 --> 00:55:38,990
through this last slide.

1240
00:55:38,990 --> 00:55:39,990
I lost track of time,

1241
00:55:39,990 --> 00:55:44,990
but if you're in a situation
where you do have to do,

1242
00:55:45,832 --> 00:55:48,100
if you are gonna do a forensic
report, make sure you're

1243
00:55:48,101 --> 00:55:50,010
with an attorney that
understands the nuances

1244
00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:50,900
of these two cases,

1245
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:53,130
because they really do set the groundwork

1246
00:55:53,130 --> 00:55:57,340
for what you need to
know to mitigate the risk

1247
00:55:57,340 --> 00:56:01,070
that this will be discoverable
during litigation.

1248
00:56:01,070 --> 00:56:02,050
- Hey Ericka.

1249
00:56:02,050 --> 00:56:04,570
And there's something on here
that I wanna re-emphasize

1250
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:05,470
for everybody too.

1251
00:56:07,310 --> 00:56:09,000
Don't write it down.

1252
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,170
I mean, there's so much

1253
00:56:10,170 --> 00:56:13,930
that we can do with just
talking to the forensic experts,

1254
00:56:13,930 --> 00:56:18,410
having them talk through things
and it's hard, we get it.

1255
00:56:18,410 --> 00:56:21,069
We understand that if
you're a regulated industry

1256
00:56:21,070 --> 00:56:23,170
sometimes you've got to
do a root cause analysis.

1257
00:56:23,170 --> 00:56:25,630
The engineers wanna figure
out what's going on.

1258
00:56:25,630 --> 00:56:27,170
We understand all of that,

1259
00:56:27,170 --> 00:56:29,380
but at the end of the
day, so I'm a trial lawyer

1260
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:32,520
and I can tell you that, trying
to piece together, a trial

1261
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:35,490
with bits and pieces of deposition
testimony from one person

1262
00:56:35,490 --> 00:56:38,680
and others, one thing,
but having 150 page report

1263
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:41,029
which explains absolutely
everything that went wrong

1264
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:44,030
with the company is an
entirely different one.

1265
00:56:44,030 --> 00:56:45,483
Don't write it down.

1266
00:56:45,483 --> 00:56:47,850
We can get around the written requirements

1267
00:56:47,850 --> 00:56:49,299
in almost every circumstance.

1268
00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:54,859
- Our clients who are
litigation is likely,

1269
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:55,963
we do the same thing.

1270
00:56:56,820 --> 00:56:57,653
- Yep.

1271
00:56:59,350 --> 00:57:02,240
- Okay, so recap, we really went

1272
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:06,700
into reopening protocols,
collection procedures,

1273
00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:08,689
and then what to really think through

1274
00:57:08,690 --> 00:57:11,839
to mitigate the risk of
that data and other data,

1275
00:57:11,839 --> 00:57:13,890
potentially being exposed

1276
00:57:13,890 --> 00:57:15,640
during some type of cyber incident.

1277
00:57:16,630 --> 00:57:18,210
Thank you guys so much for your time.

1278
00:57:18,210 --> 00:57:19,043
I'm sorry.

1279
00:57:19,043 --> 00:57:20,870
We ended up going fast the at the end

1280
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:22,270
but we're still available.

1281
00:57:22,270 --> 00:57:23,830
If anyone has any questions we can stay

1282
00:57:23,830 --> 00:57:25,752
on like a few more minutes.

1283
00:57:26,827 --> 00:57:28,087
- Yeah, I think we got a couple

1284
00:57:28,087 --> 00:57:29,523
of minutes left for any last questions.

1285
00:57:33,350 --> 00:57:36,007
Looks like maybe not.

1286
00:57:36,007 --> 00:57:37,190
- Okay.

1287
00:57:37,190 --> 00:57:38,023
- All right.

1288
00:57:38,023 --> 00:57:39,630
Well, thank you everybody.

1289
00:57:39,630 --> 00:57:41,560
We really appreciate your taking the time

1290
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:42,700

1291
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:45,323
