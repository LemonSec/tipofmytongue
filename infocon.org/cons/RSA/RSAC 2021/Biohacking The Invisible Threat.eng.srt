1
00:00:00,063 --> 00:00:01,970
- Welcome to my session.

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:03,756
This is Biohackers, The Invisible Threat.

3
00:00:03,757 --> 00:00:05,133
And my name is Len Noe.

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,433
I wanna start today by asking
you guys one simple question.

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,010
What does a cyborg look like?

6
00:00:13,237 --> 00:00:15,410
When you hear the word
cyborg, what comes to mind?

7
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:18,760
Maybe a "Terminator," or a
"Star Wars", or "Star Trek."

8
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,230
Everyone who knows the definition

9
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:22,560
will probably have a vision in their head.

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,400
I'd even be willing to
bet that it's all shiny,

11
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,900
and to some extent, robotic looking.

12
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:27,959
Well, I hate to pop the bubble

13
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,920
but that just isn't the case anymore.

14
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,200
Cyborgs are not only on the movie screens,

15
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,280
they walk among us and you
may be friends with one

16
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,080
and just don't know it.

17
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,610
These are my hands.

18
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:40,370
I'm a biohacker in the
truest sense of the word.

19
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:43,110
I'm not only an augmented human
with microchips in my hands,

20
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,913
but I'm also a white hat hacker.

21
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:48,450
I'm a hacker that has modified
my body to take advantage

22
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:49,640
of the available technology

23
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,600
to turn myself into the attack vector.

24
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,420
I'm gonna explain what
my current chips are

25
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,660
as well as giving you a roadmap
on what I'm looking to do

26
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:59,022
on my journey to become
even more than human.

27
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:01,640
These are my hands,

28
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,099
the following capabilities
with my current implants.

29
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:06,750
I have a FlexNext.

30
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:11,750
This is a combination
NTAG216 13.56 megahertz NFC

31
00:01:11,894 --> 00:01:15,000
and T5577, 125 kilohertz

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,133
low frequency RFID with a
very large antenna cord.

33
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I have a NExT chip, same
NTAG216, 13.56 megahertz NFC

34
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:29,013
and T5577, 125 kilohertz,
low frequency RFID.

35
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:32,913
I have a FlexM1 "Magic" 1k.

36
00:01:33,755 --> 00:01:38,755
This is a 13.56 megahertz
Mifare S51k emulation chip

37
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:43,350
with 4-byte NUID zero sector
that's completely writeable.

38
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:45,190
And finally, I have a VivoKey Spark 2

39
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:47,310
crypto bionic implant.

40
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:52,310
This is a 13.56 megahertz ISO 14443-8

41
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:57,350
an NFC type four supporting
AES 128 bit encryption.

42
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,540
Finally, I'm also in negotiations

43
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:01,690
to safely encapsulate a Peg-Leg

44
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:04,640
which we'll be discussing a
little bit later in this talk.

45
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,700
Augmented humans are not
science-fiction, we're here,

46
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,470
we're not going anywhere.

47
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:12,623
And as the technology
continues to evolve solely.

48
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,650
I've broken today's talk
into three separate sections,

49
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:19,010
yesterday, today and tomorrow.

50
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:21,769
I'm not gonna spend a lot
of time on who we were,

51
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:25,210
just enough to show that
the biohacker trans-human

52
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:28,680
is just the point where
science, technology,

53
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,743
and humanity meets.

54
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,640
The idea behind implanting technology

55
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,089
inside the human body has
been around since the 1950s.

56
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,470
The patent for the first
cardiac pacemaker was submitted

57
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:41,513
in 1952 and was the size of a table radio.

58
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,559
With the advent of the
transistor in the mid 1950s,

59
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,880
the ability to construct
the fully implantable device

60
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,390
was achieved in may of 1958.

61
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:52,420
The first implantable
technology was actually

62
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,619
placed inside of a test animal.

63
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:57,070
The first human to receive an
electrical device implanted

64
00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:00,079
in the body was in
Buffalo, New York in 1960.

65
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,120
The tech up to this point was very static

66
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,510
and didn't allow for much in the way

67
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:05,600
of conditional executions or modification

68
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,590
from the original programming.

69
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:10,393
1964 gave hosts to the
first implantable technology

70
00:03:10,393 --> 00:03:12,930
that can take data from the body itself.

71
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:15,370
Through the 70s and 80s,
there were advancements

72
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:18,250
but nothing that would
set the world on a tear.

73
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,820
1990 is when things
really started to pick up

74
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:21,930
for the implant community,

75
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:24,410
and the creation of
smart devices all the way

76
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:26,240
through to today where the discussions

77
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,620
of AI are commonplace.

78
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,790
For biohackers, our history was forged

79
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:31,810
by the medical profession

80
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:34,130
to address deficiencies of the human body

81
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,359
from a reactive perspective.

82
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,150
By that I mean that the
issues were already there.

83
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,650
Additionally, there was no options

84
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:44,540
for an individual to enhance
themselves through technology.

85
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,510
So who are we today?

86
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:49,280
People like myself are
referred to by many names.

87
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,410
Biohacker, grinder, transhuman,

88
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:54,290
regardless of what name
you wanna put on us,

89
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:55,820
we all share the concept of moving

90
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:58,840
beyond the human form we were born into.

91
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,790
The term transhuman was first coined

92
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:03,750
by Julian Huxley in 1957.

93
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,400
The movement he created was fueled

94
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,340
by multiple people looking
to extend the capabilities

95
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,010
of the human itself.

96
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:12,840
So where do you find
implantable technology?

97
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,693
The same place we find
everything else, the internet.

98
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:18,120
There are multiple implant microchip

99
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,610
manufacturers to choose from.

100
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:23,310
I personally work exclusively
with dangerousthings.com.

101
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,580
These are just some of the types

102
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:27,450
of implants and technologies
available out there.

103
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:31,570
There are magnets, both
lifting as well as biosensing.

104
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:35,900
We have flexible NFC, flexible RFID,

105
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,900
encapsulated NFC and RFID,

106
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:42,750
and believe it or not,
even encapsulated LEDs.

107
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,000
There are multiple barriers

108
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,630
within these categories to
address specific requirements

109
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,370
per use case.

110
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:50,570
I'm not gonna go into the procedure

111
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:52,210
on how we install the implants,

112
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:54,789
but let's just say there are
needles or scalpels involved

113
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:57,470
based on what implant we're talking about.

114
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:00,710
These devices were designed
to make people's lives easier.

115
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:03,390
We have the ability to start
our vehicles with implants.

116
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,200
Imagine never losing your keys again

117
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:08,640
or how many people have
fobs to access a gym,

118
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,570
or a shared garage, or a storage unit?

119
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:14,360
All of these could be
stored on an implant.

120
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,570
What about being able to
pay for goods and services

121
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:20,360
with the same methods as Apple
Pay or the Android wallet

122
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,360
but you never have to worry
about forgetting your phone?

123
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,960
Every one of these activities

124
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,162
constitutes a legitimate use case.

125
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:31,100
Unfortunately, not all of us are friendly.

126
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,800
This introduces a new attack vector.

127
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,900
As security professionals,

128
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,599
we need to start looking beyond
what we're comfortable with,

129
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,700
beyond the normal attacks
that we've heard on for years.

130
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,130
The attacks and the end
game may not have changed

131
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:45,580
but the delivery method has
come right off the movie screen

132
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:48,900
and into our companies,
infrastructures and data centers.

133
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,770
Security admins know the
normal attack vectors,

134
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:55,560
USB drives, fishing, CVEs
the list goes on and on.

135
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,720
But how do you address the fact

136
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,690
that any of your employees
could potentially

137
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:01,170
have a full Linux system to RFID

138
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:03,550
or NFC chips beneath their skin?

139
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:07,610
What if someone implanted a
HID or proximity access chip

140
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,730
for physical access?

141
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:12,260
There would be no evidence
of any type of compromise

142
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,849
to the naked eye.

143
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:16,300
chip implants utilize
the same technologies

144
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,330
that an enterprise are
using, RFID door badges,

145
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:23,419
NFC for IoT, MIFARE,
HID or proximity cards

146
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,860
for physical access.

147
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,113
And that's just a few.

148
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:28,350
With the number of regulations

149
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:31,250
and audits that companies are
required to do for compliance,

150
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,430
how would you know if someone
has bypass your security

151
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:35,930
and brought a rogue asset
into your environments?

152
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:38,220
The simple answer is you wouldn't.

153
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,780
The Peg-Leg is a single board computer

154
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,979
that's been modified to
a minimalist form factor

155
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:43,789
with a wireless charging receiver.

156
00:06:43,789 --> 00:06:47,669
And then incased in bio-polymer
implanted within the body.

157
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:49,210
This is on the outer edge of extreme

158
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:51,419
even for most biohackers.

159
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,490
This is not a simple
process in making sure

160
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:55,170
that the SBC is completely sealed

161
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:57,260
has called at a number of individuals

162
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,340
that have attempted this implant

163
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:00,960
to require emergency removal surgery.

164
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,630
This still doesn't stop the
many more including myself

165
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:05,980
from trying to get one implanted.

166
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:09,010
These devices have Wi-Fi as
well as Bluetooth capabilities

167
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:12,690
and can be accessed over
SSH from a mobile device.

168
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:15,640
This would allow a bad actor
to have access to binaries

169
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,990
or even something as
widely known as responder.

170
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,940
They can be made into rogue access points

171
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,963
as well as command and control servers.

172
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,980
The possibilities for a
concealed Linux platform

173
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,960
are only limited by one's imagination.

174
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,150
Originally intended to act as
a log list file transfer drop,

175
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:34,729
the Peg-Leg was originally designed

176
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:37,230
to leverage the PirateBox software.

177
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:40,070
However, as with anything
in the technology space,

178
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,690
people took that simple idea

179
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:44,530
and it branched out to more
creative or devious areas

180
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,359
based on your perspective.

181
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,800
All extra solutions have been implement.

182
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,570
These devices are headless,

183
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:53,240
but have a Wi-Fi access point configured

184
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,000
to allow access to the implanted device.

185
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,770
Once connected, the attacker
has the access to a terminal

186
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:01,890
for interactive processes or
it can be such a performed

187
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:04,180
non-interactive scans
and suites for low energy

188
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,540
Bluetooth that can be utilized

189
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,568
for an attack like BlueBorne.

190
00:08:07,568 --> 00:08:09,550
Or working in junction with a USB share

191
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,430
application like VirtualHere,

192
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:14,040
an attacker could execute
mousejacking attacks

193
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,070
and inject automated payloads
with tools like jacking,

194
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:19,760
almost standing and having
your casual conversation

195
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,173
or sitting at their desks.

196
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,760
The total number of Peg-Leg
implants is not widely known

197
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,340
as this was a community-based project.

198
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,489
However, the fact that there's
at least one individual

199
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:30,960
that has this ability should be more

200
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,210
than enough case for security
admins to take notice.

201
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:36,230
Let's take a moment to think about this.

202
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:37,700
How as security professionals

203
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,370
can we regulate secure locations

204
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:40,280
that people have the ability

205
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:43,049
to conceal full computers within the body?

206
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:45,240
This becomes an even greater
challenge for companies

207
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,790
or governments who may
require elevated clearance

208
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:50,730
to access files or physical locations.

209
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,110
This essentially removes the power

210
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:55,390
and control from the security systems

211
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:57,620
by office gating systems
that could be leveraged

212
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,203
for nefarious purposes.

213
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:02,960
Let's continue with
our next attack vector.

214
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,920
This one is around the
issue of physical access.

215
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,020
Any company will have
restricted locations on prem.

216
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:11,750
Whether that be executive
offices, to supply rooms,

217
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:14,750
to server rooms, the need
to keep access restricted

218
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:18,190
in some locations is just
a part of daily business.

219
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,920
I'd be willing to bet that
a large number of people

220
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,103
in attendance have a
badge just like this one.

221
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,319
Then additionally I
would bet a large number

222
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,170
of people that feel
that this type of badge

223
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:31,800
and reader system for physical
access is an acceptable risk

224
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,540
from an audit perspective and as such,

225
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,800
should appease the C-level execs

226
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,670
and the fact that our
locations are secure.

227
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:40,000
This is RSA.

228
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,110
I really hope nobody here believes that.

229
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:43,700
How many people have an access badge

230
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:47,240
on a lanyard or retractable
belt clip most of the time?

231
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,960
How many of us are
spatially aware to the point

232
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:52,360
where if we were talking
to someone say like me,

233
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,930
would you notice if I pull the tool

234
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:55,989
like the Proxmark ChameleonMini

235
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:57,530
and was able to read your access badge

236
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:58,959
while we were talking?

237
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,950
I know.

238
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:02,830
There's no way that somebody
would be able to do that to me.

239
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:04,790
Well, I really hope you're right.

240
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:06,110
I have countless case studies

241
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:08,570
that involve cloned access badges.

242
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:11,360
The act of cloning an
access badge isn't new.

243
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,150
The technology has been
commercially available

244
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,800
for over a decade.

245
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,900
What makes this attack factor different

246
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,180
is there's no evidence of the breach.

247
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,589
Unlike the old days where an attacker

248
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:22,540
we need to have a copy of the cloned key

249
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,510
or a battery pack for the Proxmark

250
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,410
can replay the scrape data.

251
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:28,300
Now attackers can write this information

252
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,300
to a subdermal implant and proceed

253
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,990
with no way for a security professional

254
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:34,910
to know that they've accessed their system

255
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:36,829
or how they've been compromised.

256
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:39,380
Let's talk about our first
attack demonstration.

257
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,780
This one's called handshake.

258
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,680
The handshake is a clone and replay attack

259
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,479
that utilizes a tool like Proxmark

260
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,150
to read the data contained
on a card or a fob,

261
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:51,360
and then store that data,

262
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,760
and either rewrite that tag
information to another tag,

263
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,069
in this case, I'm gonna rewrite it

264
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:58,970
to the implant that's in my left hand.

265
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:02,850
So let's go ahead and
let's kick off our attack.

266
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:06,580
So we can see we're starting
off here on a mobile device.

267
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:10,020
There is some social
engineering involved in this.

268
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,130
So as we can see,

269
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:16,130
I'm opening up my Proxmark
ChameleonMini, we see my badge.

270
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:19,240
And this can be done this quickly.

271
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,180
I hold my reader up, click the button,

272
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,780
and we can see on my screen
how I've now been able

273
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:27,803
to import all of the data from that key.

274
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:30,760
Now we're going to turn around

275
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,473
and we're gonna actually export that data.

276
00:11:35,156 --> 00:11:37,280
And we can see there's all
the information contained

277
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,882
within my access card.

278
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:41,650
I'm gonna name this as
simple friendly name

279
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:43,093
and I'm gonna call it LensID.

280
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:47,160
From here, I'm gonna go turn around,

281
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:50,093
use that same information,

282
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,480
and I'm gonna rewrite that information

283
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,173
back down to my hand.

284
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,640
Just like that.

285
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,990
That simple.

286
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:01,940
Now, when I go ahead and I scan my hand,

287
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:05,520
we'll see that I have the
exact same information

288
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:09,183
that was on my original
chip within my access card.

289
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:13,569
So now we can go ahead and
use a different program

290
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:18,069
and we're gonna actually write the data

291
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:21,490
from my ID card to my hand.

292
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,990
So we're gonna give it a
friendly name of implant.

293
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:28,170
Then we're gonna use a
different tool on my cell phone.

294
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:30,360
Part of the point behind this is to show

295
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,210
this all can be done
through a mobile device

296
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,860
while we're sitting there
talking to each other.

297
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,710
This takes very little time,

298
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:41,170
and once I actually had that initial read,

299
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:45,122
I can use that data as many
times as I want repetitively.

300
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,710
So once again, we're gonna turn around

301
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:50,820
and I'm gonna open up
my MIFARE Classic Tool

302
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,143
on my mobile device.

303
00:12:53,023 --> 00:12:54,373
And I'm gonna select Clone.

304
00:12:55,990 --> 00:13:00,160
I'm gonna first import the
tag that we had just done,

305
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,223
LensID.

306
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:05,913
File copied.

307
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,550
Now we're gonna go ahead

308
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:12,223
and we're going to import the second key.

309
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,603
Just a moment while I import it.

310
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,290
And now all we have to do,

311
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:26,010
we're gonna take a look and
we're gonna actually show

312
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:29,060
the differences between
my original implant

313
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,902
and what was actually on my ID.

314
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,199
We do see that there is
a different sector zero.

315
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,003
So at this point, all I
have to do is write my tag,

316
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:43,433
select my original card ID,

317
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,630
select all the different keys,

318
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:53,630
use my phone, set it up,
program the chip in my hand.

319
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,210
And now when I turn around and I come back

320
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:59,980
and I do an additional scan
to actually take a look

321
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:03,023
at what type of data
is actually on my hand,

322
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:08,190
you'll see that now the
chip has been rewritten

323
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:12,190
so that the information in
all of the sectors on my hand

324
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:14,290
now match all of the sectors

325
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:17,293
that are originally on my ID.

326
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:21,960
So let's just go ahead and
walk through these last steps.

327
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:27,363
Go ahead and we'll take one
last dump of the new card.

328
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:33,622
Here we go, reading the chip
after it's been rewritten.

329
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:37,900
We go back to my device.

330
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,750
We'll see that we have a new
card that's been identified,

331
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,200
you create the dump.

332
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,863
If we go back and we do our diff,

333
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:48,703
we'll see that it is exactly the same.

334
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:52,079
So if we think about this,

335
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,900
any of the standard MIFARE-style cards

336
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:58,610
could very easily wind up being cloned

337
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:00,093
in this exact same manner.

338
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:02,910
Look at that.

339
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,173
Exactly the same.

340
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,343
Pretty scary, huh?

341
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:12,050
NFC or near-field communication
is an amazing technology

342
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:14,790
that many of us have in
our pockets right now.

343
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:17,380
Every Android device has
full access to transmit

344
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,810
or receive NFC data.

345
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:23,369
Apple is a bit more complicated
to explain functionality.

346
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:26,700
With iOS 11, iPhone 7 and 8 and X,

347
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,070
can be used to read NFC tags.

348
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:33,380
iPhone 6 and 6s can be
used to make NFC payments

349
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,220
with Apple pay, but has no ability

350
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:38,370
to read standalone NFC tags.

351
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:42,420
Apple at this time only allows NFC tags

352
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:44,410
to be read via their internal apps.

353
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:47,920
There's no native
support for native reads.

354
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,800
I can almost hear all of the iPhone people

355
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,550
out there cheering.

356
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,522
You get a pass on this one for now.

357
00:15:54,601 --> 00:15:56,610
I've not heard of any roadmap for iPhones

358
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:58,960
but as the functionality
continues to be adopted

359
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,280
for industries evolving IoT,

360
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,930
I have to believe that Apple is weighing

361
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:05,063
the security concerns very carefully.

362
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:10,250
Like I just stated,
standard NFC utilization

363
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,670
can be almost anything from beaming a file

364
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:14,550
to a coworker or a friend,

365
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:18,010
to using a key fob or
app to transmit a signal

366
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,623
to a receiver to allow
some actions to take place.

367
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:23,606
Here's where it gets interesting,

368
00:16:23,606 --> 00:16:26,010
NFC gets its power from the receiver.

369
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:27,770
There's no internal power required

370
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:29,920
to be able to keep a
loaded tag in waiting.

371
00:16:31,286 --> 00:16:33,609
The implant that I'll be
using for this first attack

372
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:35,873
will be the flexNExT NFC chip.

373
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:39,329
I'm gonna be showing two
different attack vectors

374
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:40,490
that explain NFC.

375
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,660
The first one is called Leprosy,

376
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,760
the second attack I call Flesh_Hook.

377
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:47,403
Same protocol but a
much different payload.

378
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:51,122
So let's take a look at
the first attack, Leprosy.

379
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:54,620
This attack may not always work

380
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,660
as there are a few conditions
that need to be met

381
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,110
in order to execute properly.

382
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:02,993
For starters, NFC must be enabled,

383
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,879
allow apps from unknown
sources must be enabled,

384
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,193
and you really need a
pretty good social engineer.

385
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,849
At this point, like I said,

386
00:17:12,849 --> 00:17:15,409
it's just a matter of social
engineering a situation

387
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:18,193
where I can get my hands
physically on your device.

388
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,767
I hear it all the time,

389
00:17:20,767 --> 00:17:22,887
"I never let my phone out of my sight."

390
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:26,470
I don't need it out of your sight.

391
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:28,630
This attack, as well as Flesh_Hook

392
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,880
are designed to be
performed in plain sight

393
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,313
and actually standing
right next to my victim.

394
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,360
I don't think it would be
a large stretch to assume,

395
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,830
if we work together and
maybe even if we didn't,

396
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:44,889
if I was to make a scene
about an issue with my wife,

397
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:47,420
or my children, or my granddaughter,

398
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:49,920
and I was pleading for
someone to help make a call,

399
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,530
I know the good samaritan and someone

400
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,053
will be there to be my victim.

401
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:57,879
We all have a built-in control
to try and avoid conflict

402
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,430
as well as not wanting to be viewed

403
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:01,580
by our peers as uncaring.

404
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,413
As an attacker,

405
00:18:02,413 --> 00:18:04,770
I know this and I will
do everything in my power

406
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:06,560
to take advantage of it.

407
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,919
Once the phone or tablet is in my hands,

408
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,380
receiver in the device
will pick up the tag

409
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:13,290
I have programmed in my hand

410
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:15,210
that's pointing to a
web location containing

411
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:20,210
an infected APK that was created
using Metasploit MSFvenom.

412
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,870
For anyone not familiar with MSFvenom,

413
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:24,469
it's part of the Metasploit framework

414
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,600
and is used to create connections back

415
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,300
to the command and control server.

416
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,560
So I've gotten the device in my hands,

417
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,570
the cheapest program to either
install or save the file.

418
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:35,520
I go through the motions

419
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,960
of what appears to be making a phone call.

420
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,180
What I'm actually doing is loading the APK

421
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:43,260
and then quickly returning
the voice back to you.

422
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:45,040
This attack would provide persistence

423
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,810
as well as a hidden icon,

424
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:48,800
so you as the owner
would not be able to see

425
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,030
anything out of the ordinary,

426
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:52,963
as well as not finding anything
in the applications list.

427
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,229
What if that was a work phone?

428
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:59,207
What if that was your
device You do banking with?

429
00:18:59,207 --> 00:19:01,060
In this scenario I'm already in your phone

430
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,693
before I even left the room.

431
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:06,770
From the Metasploit server, I
can gain access to contacts,

432
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:09,379
emails, photos, downloads,

433
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:12,040
essentially anything that's on the device.

434
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,970
So let's go ahead and let's take a look

435
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:17,130
and see what that attack
looks like in real life.

436
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:20,440
So what we see here on your screen,

437
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,520
this is my setup online attack box.

438
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,810
In the top, I've set up an ngrok session

439
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:30,230
for the ability of obfuscation.

440
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:33,780
So lemme show you how quickly
this attack really happens.

441
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:37,570
So all you have to do is
start my Metasploit listener

442
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:41,970
listening for the connection from that APK

443
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:44,723
that I'm going to install
on that target device.

444
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,070
I go ahead and I set it up

445
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:49,370
according to the configurations
on the correct ports,

446
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:50,620
and I start my listening.

447
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:54,307
Here we are, just a standard cell phone.

448
00:19:54,307 --> 00:19:56,290
"Oh my gosh, I'm having an emergency,

449
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:59,930
please let me use your phone,
I need to make a phone call."

450
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:01,090
By getting close enough

451
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:03,026
all I need to do is trigger that NFC tag

452
00:20:03,027 --> 00:20:05,120
and as you can see on the screen,

453
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,500
it's prompting me to download or cancel.

454
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,520
This is the time where I
can be making it look like

455
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,460
I'm trying to remember my phone number

456
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:15,320
for my injured father, my injured wife,

457
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,060
my injured daughter,

458
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,919
all the while creating such a scene

459
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,890
that you're not paying attention
to my physical activity,

460
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:24,510
then the fact that I'm actually installing

461
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:27,090
an application on your phone.

462
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:29,310
That's it, it's over.

463
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,800
It's done.

464
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,540
I can hand you your phone back.

465
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,300
And if you take a look at the screen,

466
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:38,350
you'll see that now I actually
have a shell to your device.

467
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:39,240
I do a sys info.

468
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,130
I'm on your Android.

469
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:43,320
I can dump your call log.

470
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,879
There you go, call log dumped.

471
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,350
I know everyone that you've just called.

472
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:49,622
I'm dumping your SMS messages.

473
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,980
I can even open a complete shell

474
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,853
and start navigating the file
structure of your device.

475
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:58,179
I'm not gonna go too much

476
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:00,990
into the actual physical
attack of the device,

477
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:04,750
because what I'm trying to
focus here on is the vector.

478
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:09,583
The vector of me as the
human element, as the attack.

479
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,220
So that fast, that phone
is now being pawned.

480
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,900
For the final demonstration,

481
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:19,722
I would like to introduce
an attack called Flesh_Hook.

482
00:21:19,722 --> 00:21:22,210
In this use case, I
programmed the chip in my hand

483
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:24,790
to point to a very, very specific website

484
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:27,610
that's been compromised
with the BeEF suite.

485
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:30,550
BeEF is the browser exploit framework.

486
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:33,879
this infects or hooks the
browsers of any devices

487
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,570
that connect to it and
allows remote code execution

488
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:38,433
as well as potential persistence.

489
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:40,239
For the BeEF suite,

490
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,430
the attacker can enumerate the local land

491
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:43,950
the device is connected to,

492
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:46,670
as well as execute
advanced phishing attacks

493
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:49,060
executed on the device itself.

494
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:51,409
Again, this requires a
bit of social engineering

495
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:52,870
but as we just talked about,

496
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:56,209
this really isn't a
problem for any good hacker

497
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:59,070
with any type of social
engineering skills.

498
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:02,000
What makes this attack
more dangerous than Leprosy

499
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,600
is there's no need to install anything.

500
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,590
Along with the fact
that most mobile devices

501
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:09,570
have some type of web
browser pre-installed,

502
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:11,810
NFC and the browser are
the only requirements

503
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:14,220
for this attack to actually function.

504
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:17,420
So let's go ahead and let's
take a look at how this looks.

505
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:20,030
Again we're gonna start
from my parrot attack box

506
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:22,083
and we're gonna go ahead

507
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:23,993
and we're gonna launch the BeEF suite.

508
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:29,130
This takes just a moment to get started.

509
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:30,240
And once it's finished,

510
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,020
I will actually have a running web server

511
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:36,750
that if I can have you, as
in your browser connect to,

512
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:40,563
just by the means of making
that initial connection, I'm in.

513
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:45,909
So we're gonna go ahead and
open up the BeEF control panel

514
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:48,600
and you'll see that this has its own UI.

515
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,449
Again, I'm not trying
to take credit for BeEF,

516
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:52,940
I'm just leveraging BeEF

517
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:57,370
for the attacks that will be
installing from my implants.

518
00:22:57,370 --> 00:22:59,350
So here we go again.

519
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:01,070
I have a computer.

520
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:02,169
I have a phone.

521
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:03,003
Oh my goodness,

522
00:23:03,003 --> 00:23:04,710
"Hey man, let me see
your phone for a second,

523
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:07,310
I wanna show you something on YouTube."

524
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:10,129
In this case, I have an exact duplicate

525
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:12,010
of the puTTy installation.

526
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:14,460
But that's really all it took.

527
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:17,030
Now we can see on the screen
within the BeEF suite,

528
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:20,110
I actually have a new browser

529
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:22,243
and it's an Android OS device.

530
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:27,110
From here, I have the ability
to start watching any number

531
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:31,340
of pre-compiled modules and executions.

532
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:36,010
Just to show that we've
actually got a true hook

533
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:37,910
into this browser, I'm gonna go ahead

534
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:39,990
and I'm just gonna run a location check.

535
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:41,380
And if anybody's wondering,

536
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:45,160
currently I'm located just
outside of Austin, Texas.

537
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,510
So if we go ahead and we run our command,

538
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:49,629
we can actually look that right there,

539
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:52,140
Texas, city, Pflugerville.

540
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,910
And if any of you guys want
to come looking for me,

541
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:55,280
I'm really not in Pflugerville,

542
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,810
that's just the closest city to me.

543
00:23:57,810 --> 00:23:59,610
But it's that easy.

544
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:02,879
Again, I'm not trying to say
I created the BeEF suite,

545
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,790
I just really appreciate the ability

546
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:08,129
that they give me to allow
myself to attack people,

547
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:11,393
utilizing the chips that are
actually already in my hands.

548
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,720
So just for fun, we're gonna run around

549
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,330
and we're gonna launch a
couple of few other things.

550
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:19,480
We're gonna do a ping sweep.

551
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,990
And just like this, we're actually able

552
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:23,750
to see any devices that
were actually connected

553
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:26,090
to the same LAN that that mobile device

554
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:27,389
was actually connected to.

555
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:32,003
So this brings us to the future.

556
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:36,423
Who will we become as
technology continues to evolve?

557
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,910
When we talk about the future of implants,

558
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:41,630
it's as if we're trying to write

559
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:44,000
a new science fiction movie.

560
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,490
companies like Tesla are working

561
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:47,580
on technology like the Neuralink.

562
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:49,980
A brain implant that
will allow interfacing

563
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:53,060
between the brain directly
to a computer system.

564
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,950
This sounds like a
man-in-the-middle scenario

565
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:56,423
just waiting to happen.

566
00:24:57,310 --> 00:25:00,190
Products like the Wiliot,
a Bluetooth receiver

567
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:03,340
that requires no batteries, it
gets its power from the air.

568
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:06,480
We all know that Bluetooth
is not vulnerable, right?

569
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,480
Anybody ever heard of BlueBorne?

570
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,023
Imagine if that attack could
jump from a person to a person.

571
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:17,020
Or what about implantable Wi-Fi
transmitters and receivers?

572
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:20,129
There's a product in
development called Neurograins.

573
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:21,610
Nobody's ever been able to compromise

574
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:23,840
a Wi-Fi network before, right?

575
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,040
What if the Wi-Fi network
was your neighbor?

576
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,600
These are just what we know about.

577
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,080
Currently the biggest restriction

578
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:34,600
to advanced technology implants
is still the power source.

579
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,250
There's not currently an effective way

580
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:38,240
to provide clean power to any devices

581
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,030
on a commercial implant.

582
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:41,577
This is the same issue with the Peg-Leg

583
00:25:41,577 --> 00:25:44,410
and the need for the
indirect fast charging.

584
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:46,170
It's not always the computer technology

585
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:47,580
that needs to catch up.

586
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:51,419
In this case, the only thing
holding back progress is power.

587
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:53,660
Once that's been addressed,
the possibility of 24

588
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:55,550
by seven access to an embedded system

589
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:58,100
in the body is not a far stretch.

590
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:01,290
I wanna take a moment to talk
about the legality, morality,

591
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:04,463
and ethical issues around
implanted technologies.

592
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:07,210
From a legal perspective,

593
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:10,123
there's no federal laws
regarding microchip implants.

594
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:13,390
At the state level, as you
can see from the graphic,

595
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:15,290
there are multiple
states that have adopted

596
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:17,090
different types of legislation.

597
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:18,750
There are essentially two types of laws

598
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:21,700
that have been passed around
microchip implants in the USA.

599
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:25,129
One is just a ban on employers

600
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:28,150
mandating employees microchip themselves.

601
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:31,000
And number two is just
an all-out general ban

602
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,930
on microchip implants as a whole.

603
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:36,670
So let's talk about the liability

604
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:38,383
from an employer's perspective.

605
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:42,680
If an employee gets chipped,
does that in and of itself

606
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,400
make that employee a security risk?

607
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,710
What if they're just using
the chip to access a gym,

608
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:51,150
or a garage, or anything that has nothing

609
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:52,490
to do with the company?

610
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:55,463
But the chip could be used
in an offensive manner.

611
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:59,370
Would that be something
that a CSO would wanna know?

612
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:02,010
We allow employees to bring
personal phones to work,

613
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:04,150
excluding restricted areas,

614
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:07,040
but detection is much more obvious.

615
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,500
What should the current
legislation stems from a push

616
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:12,670
by companies to replace
access badges with implants

617
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:13,983
for physical security?

618
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:18,680
But as this may help from a,
"I lost my badge," perspective,

619
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:22,170
it doesn't enhance the
security posture for a company.

620
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:25,330
Remember, implant chips
at this point are static.

621
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:26,689
They require a reader

622
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:29,170
or power source to be able to function.

623
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:32,070
Now, just like with the handshake attack,

624
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:34,460
bad actors could use the same tools

625
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:36,770
and scrape the target's
implant information

626
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:39,200
the same as if it was a physical key card.

627
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,810
The main difference being that
you can take your key card

628
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:43,720
and lock it at home when you go out.

629
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:46,083
Implants are on all of the time.

630
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:50,190
There's a receiver within
range, they will read the chip.

631
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:51,810
There is currently no off switch,

632
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:56,350
and as such, attackers
would now have 24/7 access

633
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:59,733
to the physical data
contained on that implant.

634
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:06,430
When the concept of
morality and ethics come up,

635
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:10,300
unfortunately faith comes into play.

636
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,389
I wanna take a moment to say

637
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:13,520
that I am in no way being disrespectful

638
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,643
to any religion, faith.

639
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,370
I'm simply speaking, just to the questions

640
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:21,053
that I have personally heard.

641
00:28:22,724 --> 00:28:24,020
As an international speaker,
I've had discussions

642
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:26,673
with people all over the
world about my implants.

643
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:31,003
The discussions typically
go in one of two directions.

644
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:36,623
Mostly it starts with fear
from whoever's talking to me.

645
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:39,639
I've been told that I have
the mark of the beast,

646
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:42,260
I've been told that I'm
being tracked by the man.

647
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:45,020
I've been asked as to
what's the exact same chip

648
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:47,940
that people would put
into their dogs or cats.

649
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:49,430
All of these conversations are driven

650
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:52,350
by the fear of the
unknown or the difference.

651
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:53,510
I've had acquaintances tell me

652
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:56,190
that they are physically afraid
of me due to my implants.

653
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:57,310
I don't know what they're afraid of,

654
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:58,860
it's almost as if they
think that I'm gonna turn

655
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:00,760
into a Terminator and go on a rampage.

656
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,320
The truth is that there are
more people like me out there

657
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,260
than you could ever imagine.

658
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:07,890
The difference is that
I don't have a problem

659
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:10,283
with people knowing who and what I am.

660
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,280
Many others like me keep
their implants secret

661
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,120
over the concern of the social stigma

662
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,040
associated with chipping.

663
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,649
The decision to augment ourselves

664
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:21,470
shouldn't hold a no weight
in regards to the issues

665
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:24,530
of faith or morality, provided
the decision is still left

666
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:26,590
with the individual, not a mandate

667
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:28,320
from any type of authority.

668
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,250
Like I said earlier, not
all of us are friendly

669
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:31,453
but most of us are.

670
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,623
Next, how far is too far?

671
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:38,639
We have briefly touched
on the Tesla Neuralink

672
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,800
in the Peg-Leg.

673
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,030
Two very different products

674
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:43,870
with broad sweeping
ramifications to the individual

675
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:46,639
as well as employers and law enforcement.

676
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,140
I remember a movie from 1995
called "Johnny Mnemonic,"

677
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:52,770
where the lead actor has
a hard drive in his brain,

678
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:54,460
and he's used as a storage device,

679
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,660
as a courier for stolen data.

680
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:58,960
Or "The Matrix," where
to learn a new skill,

681
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,587
we just load the instruction set,

682
00:30:00,587 --> 00:30:03,350
and we have that knowledge
within our minds.

683
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:04,580
The genie is out of the bottle

684
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:07,159
and there's no way it's going back in.

685
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,810
As technology continues to advance

686
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:10,149
and improve the quality of life,

687
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:12,310
we need to remember that any tool,

688
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:16,080
regardless of what its original
intent was, can be misused.

689
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,270
As security professionals,
we need to be aware of this

690
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:20,300
and adapt our countermeasures
to include these

691
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:23,040
to these new attack vectors.

692
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:26,120
The fact that there's nothing
unilateral across the board,

693
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,870
it will in most locations
become a corporate decision

694
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:31,560
on how to address chipped employees.

695
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,639
Without a better understanding

696
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,700
of the technologies being discussed,

697
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:37,530
these choices may be made
for the wrong reasons.

698
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:39,639
To say anyone with an implanted technology

699
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,700
is an automatic threat would be to say

700
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:45,093
that any car owner could be
a vehicular homicide suspect.

701
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:48,343
Now let's talk about some takeaways.

702
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,420
But in the next week,

703
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:53,170
you should be able to identify
if there may be any contact

704
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:56,320
with systems that are deployed
within our environments.

705
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,840
Within the next three months,

706
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,490
we should be able to
have a full understanding

707
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:01,610
of the scope of our vulnerabilities,

708
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:03,790
as well as starting to evaluate
and define the addition

709
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:06,480
of new security protocols
to add second factor

710
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,573
to your contactless configurations.

711
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:11,449
Within the next six months,

712
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:13,450
we should be at the implementation stage

713
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:14,960
of the second package.

714
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,580
This is where we're removing
an attacker's ability

715
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:18,689
to compromise access

716
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:21,263
with only the available tag information.

717
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:24,649
I would like to take a
moment to talk just about

718
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:28,573
some of the mitigation
strategies on both RFID and NFC.

719
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:32,890
Look into switches for RFID.

720
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:35,580
Switches are required both the RFID tag,

721
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:38,320
as well as the code be
entered into a keypad.

722
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,179
Essentially multifactor.

723
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:41,840
A locked password.

724
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,770
A lock password is a 32 bit password,

725
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:44,870
which must be transmitted

726
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:47,300
before a tag will transmit its data.

727
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,620
Skimmers will be unable to access the data

728
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,919
since they can't provide the password.

729
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,880
This is a simple and very popular way

730
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,850
to protect passive UHF systems

731
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:59,669
which often have limited
computational abilities.

732
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:01,460
Basic access control.

733
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,450
The reader must supply a specific key

734
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:06,430
before the tag will reveal
any personal information,

735
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:08,070
blocking potential skimming.

736
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:10,659
This method is commonly applied to protect

737
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,750
the sensitive data stored in passwords

738
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:17,070
and passports for being read by outsiders.

739
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:19,669
Finally, mutual authentication.

740
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:22,410
In this process, the sensor
will send a line of code

741
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:25,400
to the tag, which will
decipher it using the key,

742
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,680
which is known to both entities.

743
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:31,070
If the tag is successful, it
can then send the line of code

744
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:33,909
to be similar deciphered by the reader.

745
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:36,400
Once both the tag and
the reader are certain

746
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:39,690
that neither is an imposter,
they can transmit their data.

747
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:41,970
This method prevents anyone
from stealing the data

748
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:45,580
through skimming, as no
other reader will know

749
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:48,330
what that specific special key was.

750
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:51,389
And eavesdropping because
the key itself has never sent

751
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:53,353
between the reader and the tag.

752
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:57,520
For NFC, the most important advice is,

753
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:02,330
if you're not using NFC, turn it off.

754
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:04,620
Stay on top of patch management.

755
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:07,169
As manufacturers update their software,

756
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:09,083
make sure that you stay current.

757
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:11,760
Education.

758
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:15,220
Make sure to educate your
employees about the NFC protocol

759
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:19,680
in general and the inherent
vulnerabilities that it implies.

760
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:22,360
And finally, utilize blocking shields

761
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:25,423
for any type of NFC tags
when they're not in use.

762
00:33:26,872 --> 00:33:29,610
At this point, I'd like
to open this floor up

763
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:31,389
to any questions.

764
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:35,440
And finally, I'd like to
say thank you for your time.

765
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,020
I hope to see you all
out in the world again.

766
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:40,450
And for anyone that's interested,

767
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:43,250
there is going to be an
additional Q&A session

768
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:44,690
around this topic.

769
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:46,890
We'll provide you the URL shortly.

770
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:49,590
Thank you very much for your
attendance and your time.
