1
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:03,790
- The all round digital transformation

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:06,290
makes every company a software company,

3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:09,629
which relies on a multitude
of third party vendors.

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,420
Thus adding to a difficult
to manage third party risk.

5
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:15,360
The services contain code,

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,480
and code always has vulnerabilities

7
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:21,310
which put the interconnected
users, industry, societies,

8
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:23,140
countries at risk.

9
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:26,570
Will there be a global policy
response to address that risk?

10
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:29,070
Is fixing our common cyber vulnerability

11
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,560
even possible at all?

12
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,570
Imagine while living in a town that is hit

13
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:35,680
by a cyber attack,
particularly the energy grid

14
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,700
in our town is attacked.

15
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,560
And also imagine we'll
living in an ideal world

16
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,550
where the cyber attack has
been mitigated very quickly.

17
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:44,739
Hard to believe?

18
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,583
Well, let's watch it right now.

19
00:00:47,568 --> 00:00:49,818
(cheering)

20
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:00,809
- [Narrator 1] A massive power outage

21
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,730
has hit Southern Klimbondia.

22
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,330
At 9:23, everything went dark.

23
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:07,830
It is still unclear
what caused the outage?

24
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:10,687
A government spokesperson
says, "We are investigating."

25
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:15,130
We now hear that the power outage

26
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:17,033
is also affecting neighbor States.

27
00:01:19,607 --> 00:01:22,550
- I almost started my first cup of coffee

28
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:25,470
but when random systems went offline,

29
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:27,943
it was clear something weird was going on.

30
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:32,179
All we knew was we were hit by ransomware.

31
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,580
They had encrypted our systems

32
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:36,640
and asked for a hefty
payment to release them.

33
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,940
What we didn't know at that
moment was how far it had spread

34
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:42,833
but we could see it
minutes later on the news.

35
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:45,880
- [Narrator 1] The
energy minister, Vokania

36
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,839
has just joined his colleagues
from Republia and Fredonia

37
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,930
and expressed his severe
concerns about the power outage.

38
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:55,023
It seems to be affecting the
home network of Enerklimbondia.

39
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:59,360
An Enerklimbondia spokesperson
told us they will aware

40
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,400
of the problems and
working with the government

41
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,453
to quickly remediate the situation.

42
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,700
- We brought in our
cyber security provider.

43
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:12,060
And they quite quickly noticed
this was a much bigger thing

44
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,260
than just some ransomware.

45
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:17,130
Obviously we were
attacked by another state.

46
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:18,840
They then also reached out to the company

47
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,050
whose operating systems

48
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:22,263
spread all across our infrastructure.

49
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,530
- [Narrator 2] This is
a difficult situation.

50
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:27,660
Critical infrastructure is under attack

51
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,329
by a sophisticated actor.

52
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:31,380
The software is from a foreign country

53
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:34,390
and you have to get everyone
on a table to find a solution

54
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:38,089
as it is a question of both
national and global security.

55
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:39,340
In an ideal world,

56
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:42,670
you reach out to a national
cybersecurity point of contact

57
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:45,980
most likely associated with
the ministry of interior.

58
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,780
They connect the attack company

59
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:51,150
with the software manufacturer,
a cyber security company

60
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,440
and the cyber emergency response teams

61
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,640
in the attacked country,

62
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,160
in the country of the
software manufacturer.

63
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:00,930
As the organized cyber exercises
before in joint trainings.

64
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,570
They quickly exchanged
information on the threat

65
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:05,950
analyze and compare forensic samples.

66
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:08,410
And if you were lucky, you find a way out.

67
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:10,100
- I thought we were screwed,

68
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:13,040
but they kicked off a response
scenario to the government.

69
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,900
The funny thing is
whoever built that attack

70
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,620
against us was lazy.

71
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:21,080
They reused some buggy
code from an older campaign

72
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,580
and that allowed us to
get the systems back up.

73
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:26,550
- [Narrator 1] After 12 hours
of insecurity and anxiety,

74
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:27,990
people in Southern Klimbondia

75
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:30,240
and neighboring countries
returned to normal.

76
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:34,070
A government spokesperson
said that a consented effort

77
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:37,140
between cyber emergency
response teams, governments

78
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,790
and software companies
made the quick resolution

79
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:41,510
of the outage possible.

80
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:43,829
We believe this was an
attack by another nation

81
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:45,470
on our infrastructure.

82
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,270
The government will keep investigating

83
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,920
and will decide about counter
measures in due course.

84
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,209
- So, let's go back to the reality

85
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:00,930
where we don't have this
scenario at least right now.

86
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,520
This is the RSA Conference

87
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,587
and our panel discussion is titled today,

88
00:04:04,587 --> 00:04:06,260
"The Ticking Cyber Bomb:

89
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:10,440
Is There a Global Policy Response
to Fix Value-Chain Risks?"

90
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,960
My name is Anastasiya Kasakova,

91
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,090
I'm a senior public affairs
manager at Kaspersky

92
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,024
coordinated global cyber diplomacy project

93
00:04:16,024 --> 00:04:18,799
and our global transparency initiative.

94
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,019
The company's program to
enhance accountability

95
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:23,280
and transparency in cybersecurity.

96
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,986
I'm happy to introduce our experts today.

97
00:04:25,986 --> 00:04:28,719
Jon Fanzun, special
envoy for cyber, foreign

98
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,210
and security policy

99
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:33,430
at the Switz Federal
Department of Foreign Affairs.

100
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:37,190
Jon and his colleagues are
organizers of the Geneva Dialogue

101
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,719
an international conversation

102
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,240
on responsible behavior in cyberspace.

103
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,190
In last year particularly,
Geneva Dialogue gathered

104
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:47,060
industry partners to discuss
security of digital products

105
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,933
including mitigating vulnerabilities.

106
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,719
Then also we have Craig Jones,

107
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,850
director of cyber crime at Interpol

108
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:56,080
to share an operational global perspective

109
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,039
as well as enforcement
on how internationally

110
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,180
law enforcement professionals
cooperate and work together.

111
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:08,090
And finally, we have on with
us today, also Serge Droz,

112
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:10,810
the chair of the board
of directors at FIRST.

113
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,940
Foreign for Incident
Response and Security Agents,

114
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,830
the premier organization of
recognized global leaders

115
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,560
and incident response.

116
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,570
Serge actively participate in
discussions on cybersecurity

117
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:25,803
at various policy matters in
particular related to normal.

118
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:29,609
On the screen you may also
see our Twitter accounts

119
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:32,190
therefore comments if you like to tag us.

120
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:36,170
As for the questions, please
do not hesitate to ask them,

121
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,600
we would be happy to
interact with you afterwards

122
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,300
and share our answers in a real form.

123
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:46,075
So starting right now, our panel
circuses on two key blocks.

124
00:05:46,075 --> 00:05:47,996
First, we will discuss trends,

125
00:05:47,996 --> 00:05:50,000
existing good practices to address them

126
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,660
and the challenges to develop
a global policy response.

127
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:56,550
Then our key question will
be what possible ingredients

128
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:59,033
of a global policy response might be.

129
00:06:00,055 --> 00:06:01,820
But we focus on the value chains

130
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,700
which following the OT definition,

131
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:07,020
implying concepts similar to
the concept of supply chains.

132
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:10,299
It however focuses on a particular actors

133
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,400
and the roles in
developing digital products

134
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,060
and ensuring the security.

135
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,910
Today we will combine
both concepts, value chain

136
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,487
and supply chains as
they're both important

137
00:06:18,487 --> 00:06:20,773
for development a global policy response.

138
00:06:22,287 --> 00:06:23,630
Kaspersky researchers have been tracking

139
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,610
several trend groups that focus

140
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:28,040
on a highly targeted supply chain attacks,

141
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,116
a key recent trend and
the modern supply chain.

142
00:06:31,116 --> 00:06:33,240
And you know what the
fed actress have gotten

143
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,090
on a dangerous path targeting
and exploring vulnerabilities

144
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:40,080
in the update and the
build system for software.

145
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,539
Users who are always
asked to install patches,

146
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,740
may get back doors into the devices.

147
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,790
And while you can be a
dragon in this operation,

148
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:48,493
you may also be a weapon too.

149
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,050
What are the threats we might see?

150
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:55,880
What are the operational
technical and policy challenges

151
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,150
to address them?

152
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,950
And I'm happy to pass the
floor first to Director Jones,

153
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:02,887
to share his opinion too.

154
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:04,903
- Thank you very much.

155
00:07:04,903 --> 00:07:07,933
It's really a lot to be here
at this conference today.

156
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:11,920
So I'm a director of
cyber crimes, Interpol

157
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:16,560
and I run a global program
for 194 member countries.

158
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,310
And that's looking to
coordinate the efforts

159
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:22,970
of law enforcement globally
to combat cyber crime.

160
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:25,700
Now, the mandate we have is
to reduce the global impact

161
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:28,950
of cyber crime and protect
communities for a safer world.

162
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:31,130
So I think everything we've seen so far

163
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:34,100
comes back to what's the policing purpose.

164
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:37,260
We are looking to protect
life and property.

165
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:41,090
But we now live in this
massively interconnected society

166
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:44,020
and policing normally works in a local

167
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:46,270
or regional mastery boundary.

168
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:49,082
Whereas now we're having
to work be connected

169
00:07:49,082 --> 00:07:51,659
through 194 countries.

170
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:54,550
Investigating massive types of incidents

171
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:56,240
in crimes that occur.

172
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,120
And what we have to understand is

173
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,470
what are those vulnerabilities?

174
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:00,810
What are those weakest links?

175
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:05,790
Because that one small weak
link can lead to a cyber crime

176
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:07,890
or a cyber attack effectively.

177
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:11,120
And also police are not
the first responders now.

178
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,209
So when an attack happens,
the people don't dial 991,

179
00:08:15,209 --> 00:08:18,360
911 or 999 for the
police to come and attend

180
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,510
they go through their IT departments

181
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:23,940
or they phone up a first
responder who has that experience

182
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:24,900
and comes in.

183
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,280
So the initial response is by someone else

184
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,409
phasing the police, the
ambulance, or the fire brigade.

185
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:33,090
And for us in police,
that's sometimes difficult

186
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:35,140
for us to comprehend because our role

187
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,650
is as a first responder
and we do come out.

188
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,990
We secure the scene,
we gather the evidence

189
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:43,251
but we're not in there at
that first moment in time.

190
00:08:43,251 --> 00:08:45,109
Now that moves us into another stage.

191
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:48,730
Then it's when police are and
is reported to the police.

192
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:51,180
Cyber crime is under reported.

193
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,739
And it's very difficult for me to sit here

194
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,520
and start giving you some global figures

195
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,890
around the amount of crimes
that are being reported

196
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:59,750
because some countries
don't even record that

197
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:03,080
as a cyber crime or what is a cyber crime.

198
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,120
And then how do we bring
all those data together

199
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,660
and aggregate that globally?

200
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:10,410
So again, that's one of the
challenges that we're looking at

201
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:11,992
on our cyber crime program.

202
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,490
So when we look at how
we can deal with this

203
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:16,820
and some of the good practice

204
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:20,700
this is about building that
trust between law enforcement.

205
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:24,160
It's building it on a national
basis, a regional basis

206
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,040
and a global basis.

207
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,949
Within our cyber crime
program, we just look at crime.

208
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:32,830
So that's, non-state actors
organized crime groups.

209
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:35,600
But when we look at the vulnerabilities

210
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,490
any threat actor can take advantage

211
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:39,820
of those vulnerabilities.

212
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,710
And that then comes
into that important role

213
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:44,100
that policing has, is to prevent crime.

214
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,610
So a different approach is how we can work

215
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:50,350
with private partners, with SATs,

216
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:52,270
to identify those vulnerabilities,

217
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:54,410
make people aware of those vulnerabilities

218
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:55,949
and then pluck them.

219
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:59,410
And coming back just finally
to the mandate of our program

220
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:02,180
is to reduce the global
impact of cyber crime.

221
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:05,219
So as we started on this at the beginning,

222
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:08,710
we talked about, can we
actually stop cyber crime?

223
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:11,360
And I think for all of
us, it's about the people,

224
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,600
the process and the technology.

225
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,830
And looking at all those different areas

226
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:18,020
and trying to identify the
vulnerabilities in there.

227
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:21,970
And then get people to take
care where they go on line

228
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:25,800
but also coming on to the
different sorts of protection

229
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,310
that you can have, which
is the technical side.

230
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:31,250
So I think that's just for me as an opener

231
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,557
and I'll hand it back, thank you.

232
00:10:33,557 --> 00:10:35,470
- Thank you so much Director Jones.

233
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,810
I really like the point
that police is probably

234
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:40,359
the first to contact if
something happens in a computer

235
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,320
but the police is not the
one who actually might help.

236
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,830
And I wonder how many really
people call the police

237
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:47,870
if something happened in the computer.

238
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:50,850
I remember some polls that
people must look prefer

239
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,790
to search in Google or
call some trusted friend

240
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,480
instead of police.

241
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,987
You also touched on a really
important notion of trust.

242
00:10:57,987 --> 00:11:01,087
And right now, really
glad that we have Serge,

243
00:11:01,087 --> 00:11:03,230
to speak a little bit more about the role

244
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:07,490
how incident respondents
see this picture too.

245
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:09,423
So Serge, all the floor is yours.

246
00:11:10,447 --> 00:11:12,770
- Thanks Anastasiya and
thanks for having me here.

247
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:14,360
My name is Serge Droz, I'm the chair

248
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,970
of the Reform of Instant
Response and Security Teams.

249
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:19,500
It's an umbrella organization
that brings together

250
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,200
the cyber first responders.

251
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,330
We are the teams that are on the ground.

252
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:27,120
Kind of the firefighters when
something really happens.

253
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,380
Most of our members arrive
from large companies

254
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,220
or from governments.

255
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:36,620
And we currently have
something over 500 members

256
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,660
which may sound like a
lot, but actually it's just

257
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:41,810
a drop in the back because
there's many more companies

258
00:11:42,986 --> 00:11:44,569
that are affected.

259
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:48,760
Now, Craig was talking about supply chains

260
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,727
and how important this is.

261
00:11:50,727 --> 00:11:53,252
The topic of today is
with the value chains.

262
00:11:54,575 --> 00:11:55,750
I think one of the big challenges

263
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,720
is that these value chains
they're totally global.

264
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,740
They're like the internet
that do not respond

265
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,590
to any geographical borders

266
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:05,170
and it just takes the
shape through on the ground

267
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:07,459
to stop the growth of the crime.

268
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,320
And the same is true in cyberspace.

269
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:13,070
Actually, a lot of the
big underground fibers

270
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:14,850
that connect these to the rest,

271
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:17,310
runs through the various
Suez canal that was blocked.

272
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:18,670
So it wouldn't have taken that off

273
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:22,160
for that ship to take out
a lot of these connections.

274
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,939
And for us, it's really hard to understand

275
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,960
where are these kind of weakest links.

276
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,330
When we think of weakest
links in a supply chain,

277
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:32,270
a cyber supply chain,

278
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:35,750
we always think of these high-tech outfits

279
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:38,310
but it may be something super simple.

280
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:40,839
If you talk about pharmacy,

281
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:44,940
it may be a little shop
that produces glass flasks

282
00:12:46,138 --> 00:12:47,930
to transport vaccinations.

283
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:51,770
If that's gone and that super
tech, the whole thing stops.

284
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:55,579
So the big companies, they're
all kind of indicating,

285
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,200
we know how to work together.

286
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,420
But you've missed so much,

287
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,469
you miss many of the operators off

288
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:03,880
the crucial smallest things
that we tend to forget.

289
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,000
I think that's one of the big challenges.

290
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,300
Now, when I say the big companies

291
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:12,010
the big organizations
and they work together,

292
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:13,040
what does that actually mean?

293
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,310
Well, it means that your security teams

294
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:18,801
collaborate even though their companies

295
00:13:18,802 --> 00:13:20,702
or their employers may be competitors.

296
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,030
Sometimes people are quite astonished

297
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:27,459
how openly we work together.

298
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:30,210
How openly I'll start talking

299
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:34,773
to security teams from
competing companies.

300
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:36,829
But the reason for that is a simple one,

301
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:38,630
we all have the same enemy.

302
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:41,620
Cyber-criminals and all these crimes

303
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,120
will make our lives difficult.

304
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:47,699
But the way we work
may sound really great.

305
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,400
And everybody talks
about information sharing

306
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,310
but it is actually quite hard.

307
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:52,977
Craig mentioned it needs trust

308
00:13:52,977 --> 00:13:55,000
and building trust is a hard thing.

309
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
It means we need to be meet,
we need to meet in person.

310
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,150
Trust is an inherently human thing

311
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,850
and we tend to forget that.

312
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:06,920
You cannot create trust between computers.

313
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:11,250
That is an absurd notion
that trust is between

314
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,840
maybe the system
administrators of the computers

315
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:17,820
who then kind of use
extends to our computers

316
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,467
to represent that trust or something.

317
00:14:20,467 --> 00:14:24,060
But it's a human thing and
the question now becomes

318
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,530
how you start building trust.

319
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:27,510
Then that's where FIRST
comes into the game

320
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:28,840
and try to build a platform

321
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,210
where we bring these people together

322
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:33,855
so they can start talking, they
can start building up trust.

323
00:14:33,855 --> 00:14:36,093
And what we also see is
that in an increasingly

324
00:14:36,093 --> 00:14:39,959
political climate building
up trust across borders

325
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,370
and across nations or political blocks

326
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:44,220
becomes increasingly hard.

327
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:47,930
Yet our economies are entangled

328
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,969
and cyber criminals involves justice.

329
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:52,280
It's we all divide and conquer.

330
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,949
That's what cyber criminals
really really know.

331
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:57,910
And I think one of the biggest challenges

332
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:00,750
much bigger than all the
technical challenges that we have

333
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:03,870
is really how can we get the
people to work efficient?

334
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:08,780
That's the security teams,
that's the technical engineers

335
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,360
that make the systems run.

336
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,430
But it's also security
teams and law enforcement.

337
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:15,800
How can we work better?

338
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,400
How can we work better together?

339
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,240
What are our rules?

340
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,173
These are all kind of big questions.

341
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:25,380
They're not really super new questions

342
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:26,213
but they're still unanswered.

343
00:15:26,213 --> 00:15:30,150
But on the good side, security
teams continue working.

344
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:33,370
We have a lot of security
teams that especially

345
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:35,910
during these COVID times
have been working together

346
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:39,959
relentlessly to help organizations

347
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,100
to protect against cyber crimes.

348
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,175
I'm also really happy to
say that we're working

349
00:15:44,175 --> 00:15:45,469
together with the Interpol coming up

350
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:50,040
these best practices to bring
together law enforcement

351
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,209
and cybersecurity specialists.

352
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:55,910
So that we start to learn
each other's understanding

353
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:59,949
and each other's issues
and each other's language

354
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:01,231
is that's what really needed

355
00:16:01,231 --> 00:16:04,903
when we want to work together efficiently.

356
00:16:04,903 --> 00:16:06,920
Back to you Anastasiya.

357
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,483
- Thank so much Serge.

358
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:13,280
I had a question about if the
Interpol and FIRST cooperating

359
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,260
you already answered on that.

360
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:17,300
But if you'd like to probably share

361
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,660
a little bit more details

362
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:22,990
any particular examples where
the success actually happened

363
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:25,250
because of the close cooperation

364
00:16:26,691 --> 00:16:28,340
between police and law enforcement

365
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,753
and incident respondent.

366
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,709
- Let me jump in.

367
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:37,280
So FIRST and Interpol are building

368
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,203
what we call a special interest group,

369
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:43,689
which our region has many
that actually focuses

370
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:46,480
on exactly this kind of collaboration

371
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,594
where we try to call up as best practices

372
00:16:48,594 --> 00:16:51,433
for both sides for all involved parties.

373
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:55,770
Police officers need
to know about security,

374
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:58,610
people need to know so
that this conversation

375
00:16:59,611 --> 00:17:00,444
is gonna be a successful one.

376
00:17:00,444 --> 00:17:03,319
Because let's not forget
that police is not the same

377
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,140
as the firefighters.

378
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:07,810
And that's the same in
an incidence response.

379
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:09,460
And it's important that all people

380
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:12,530
and all the involved parties understand.

381
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:14,569
We also trying to make
sure that in all our events

382
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:17,682
we regularly have people
from law enforcement present

383
00:17:17,682 --> 00:17:19,603
talking about their sides.

384
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:23,440
It is still getting to know
each other much better phase

385
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,722
and I think there's still
a lot of room to do.

386
00:17:25,722 --> 00:17:29,879
Sadly I think Craig, you and
me needs to have a lot to do

387
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,580
and that's my take on it.

388
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,080
Maybe you wanna elaborate too.

389
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:37,503
- Absolutely, building out on that point.

390
00:17:37,503 --> 00:17:39,703
Part of what we're
focusing on at the moment

391
00:17:40,631 --> 00:17:42,590
who does Interpol, who
does law enforcement

392
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:43,750
need to partner with?

393
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,930
Now, in national constructing countries,

394
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:50,150
there's some very, very good interactions

395
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:52,480
between law enforcement and also

396
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,170
the national cybersecurity
center, cybersecurity agencies

397
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:58,330
where they have clear
incident handling rules

398
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:00,020
when an instance comes in about

399
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,603
who takes the incident to start with,

400
00:18:01,603 --> 00:18:04,150
who manages it, who takes the lead.

401
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:07,290
So it's understanding
those roles and rebates.

402
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:08,810
But one of our private partners

403
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:11,030
who've just come on board, a shadow server

404
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:13,120
and we're doing a piece of
work with them at the moment.

405
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,580
with two national SATs in
two different countries,

406
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,389
one in Europe, one in Asia.

407
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:20,620
And what we're doing
there is supplying them

408
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:23,909
with information where service providers

409
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:26,330
in the countries are the
most exposed systems.

410
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:28,270
Now that's probably normally

411
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:31,010
a sort of critical national infrastructure

412
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:33,670
a SAT angle that they're looking at.

413
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:35,370
We're trying to add value to that.

414
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:38,340
But also trying to work out
where does police add value?

415
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:41,753
Because in some countries,
the SATs are very small.

416
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:46,060
They don't have that
capacity or capabilities.

417
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:48,030
So again, working with FIRST,

418
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:50,210
we're looking at
identifying those countries

419
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:52,770
then how can we support them, what models?

420
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:56,020
And again, it comes back to
what's best practice as well.

421
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:58,747
So how could we demonstrate
what best practice is?

422
00:18:58,747 --> 00:19:02,010
And it comes back to
protecting communities.

423
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:03,700
And that's what we're all trying to do

424
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:04,800
at the end of the day.

425
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:08,823
- Thank you.

426
00:19:08,823 --> 00:19:10,350
I guess that one of the
really key challenges

427
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:13,429
that we all agreed on is the
lack of capacity sometimes.

428
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:16,690
So, it's definitely one
of those that really

429
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:19,170
like capacities to address the challenges.

430
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:22,538
But coming back to the notion of trust,

431
00:19:22,538 --> 00:19:24,550
there's definitely probably
they trust to people

432
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:26,940
but also to trust to the products we use.

433
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:29,460
And this is something that
I mentioned in the beginning

434
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,926
and I'd like to pass the floor right now

435
00:19:31,926 --> 00:19:33,020
to Jon because Geneva Dialogue

436
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:35,150
is one of the probably bright examples

437
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:39,093
how do you ensure trust in
modern digital products?

438
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:43,230
- Yeah, thank you very much.

439
00:19:44,206 --> 00:19:47,139
Under special envoy for
the foreign security policy

440
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:49,250
in the Swiss ministry of foreign affairs,

441
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,300
our office is responsible

442
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:54,710
for the strategic and
operational management and design

443
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:56,970
of Switzerland cyber
foreign security policy.

444
00:19:56,970 --> 00:20:00,500
And we also run as you
mentioned the Geneva Dialogue.

445
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:04,503
But for your question, we
talked a little about of trust.

446
00:20:04,503 --> 00:20:08,418
And I say what we ultimately
need to boost cooperation

447
00:20:08,418 --> 00:20:11,251
and global response is great trust

448
00:20:12,327 --> 00:20:13,430
as it was mentioned before.

449
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:16,013
And the thing is trust between States,

450
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,430
trust between the States
and the private sector,

451
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:24,410
but also trust between civil
society, the private sector

452
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:27,523
and this is this triangle with the States.

453
00:20:29,108 --> 00:20:31,030
In the international relations,

454
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:36,030
why is so hard to develop more trust?

455
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,010
I think what we are missing
at international level

456
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:45,000
is a shared vision
among the global powers.

457
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,030
We see many divisions about
the nature of the internet,

458
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:51,870
about how human rights
should be protected,

459
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:55,562
how new technologies should
be governed, if at all.

460
00:20:56,966 --> 00:20:59,090
About the treatment of personal data

461
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:01,570
by law enforcement and the industry.

462
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:06,350
Some of those divisions like
most of the data protection

463
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:09,230
are not only among the main competitors,

464
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:12,180
but also among allies.

465
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:16,510
This lack of unity among
States has repercussions

466
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:18,683
also on the private sector in my view.

467
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:22,852
How can we advance in this context?

468
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:26,240
Let me make some points.

469
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,350
First, I think we need the
willingness to work together

470
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:31,270
on the basis of consensus.

471
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:34,790
And to reach compromise on how exactly

472
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:37,139
international law applies in cyberspace,

473
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,330
how human rights should be protected,

474
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:41,810
how norms of responsible state behavior

475
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:43,203
should be implemented.

476
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:47,670
One example that consensus
is still possible

477
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:50,520
is to report of the
open-ended working group

478
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:54,796
on cyber ICT security
in the framework of the

479
00:21:54,796 --> 00:21:57,780
first commentary of UN.

480
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:01,180
Under the leadership of the
Swiss ambassador Zellweger,

481
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:04,073
it was possible to reach
consensus and have a report.

482
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:09,683
I think it's a great diplomatic effort

483
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:15,660
and success due to the member States

484
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:20,193
and also other actors that
contribute to that process.

485
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,700
It was possible to
reaffirming important issues

486
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:27,923
such as that the capability of UN Charter.

487
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:31,590
Going forward, I think we need to ensure

488
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:33,689
that the new cyber crime convention

489
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:37,148
within the United Nations
will not undermine

490
00:22:37,148 --> 00:22:41,090
existing standards set
by the council of Europe

491
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:42,740
in the Budapest convention.

492
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:47,740
And in our view it's also
important that this frame work

493
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,743
is based on consensus.

494
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:53,720
Just want to mention few other points.

495
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,990
And a second way of
increasing trust in our view

496
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:59,050
is confidence building.

497
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:03,610
On the regional level, the OSC have agreed

498
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:06,370
on the 60 confidence building measures.

499
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:11,239
They can and should be used
by participating States

500
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:14,933
to increase transparency
and exchange information.

501
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:18,810
Third, we also need more engagement

502
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:22,330
between major powers
to come to agreements.

503
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:24,240
Switzerland, as a neutral country

504
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:28,380
is ready to host and is ready with Geneva

505
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:33,310
to host if there is a
possibility for such agreements.

506
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:35,090
And third element to build trust

507
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:38,439
we also need to implement
what we agreed on.

508
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,510
Only if we show time and time again

509
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:44,040
that we comply with what we agreed.

510
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,760
We can build confidence and trust.

511
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:51,653
And last point, I think
it's very important

512
00:23:51,653 --> 00:23:56,653
for the implementation that
we involve stakeholders.

513
00:23:57,290 --> 00:24:02,290
The technical community are
represented by SATs, sorry.

514
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:07,639
Our conversations today
and the private sector

515
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,120
are far more resourceful than States

516
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:13,719
when it comes to addressing
digital security flaws.

517
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,820
What is more, those
stakeholders are strong

518
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:19,720
in network globally, as you mentioned

519
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:23,373
which makes it easier to
achieve consensus at this level.

520
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:26,582
So with that back to you.

521
00:24:28,147 --> 00:24:29,592
- Thank you so much.

522
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,820
What I heard, at least the ingredients

523
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:35,409
of the successful global
pulse response might be

524
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:38,690
the confidence building
measures, increase the capacities

525
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:42,980
for these parties that are
involved addressing those risks.

526
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:45,867
But I also like the notes
that both Director Jones

527
00:24:45,867 --> 00:24:48,450
and Serge noted about the legal barriers

528
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:50,188
or the policy barriers.

529
00:24:50,188 --> 00:24:55,188
Would you like to provide
more reflections on that?

530
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:57,510
Is there any way to fix this?

531
00:24:57,510 --> 00:25:00,473
Maybe Director Jones,
starting with you first.

532
00:25:02,718 --> 00:25:05,680
- So that's a really good question.

533
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,999
One area with tricky working at the moment

534
00:25:07,999 --> 00:25:09,530
is on our global program

535
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:12,180
is what is that response
of law enforcement?

536
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:14,670
How do we cooperate and collaborate?

537
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:17,760
Because each nation has its own laws,

538
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,000
its own jurisdictions effectively.

539
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I think if you look at the
EU model with Europol and EC3

540
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,110
how they've combined a
number of countries together

541
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:30,969
they have common frameworks
they can work to.

542
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:34,450
Where we're looking at how
Interpol can work in that space

543
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:38,370
is as that neutral organization
bringing those countries

544
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:41,510
that maybe would not have
that face to face dialogue

545
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:46,210
but would not look to speak at
times around certain issues.

546
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:48,600
So as to again, here in Switzerland,

547
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,290
we're a neutral organization.

548
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:55,290
So we just recently had an
operation with the FBI in the US

549
00:25:55,562 --> 00:25:59,409
where we looked at
stolen credit cards forum

550
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:01,020
called Joker's Stash.

551
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:03,170
We worked directly with Russia on that.

552
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:04,930
We were able to bring
those countries together.

553
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:07,020
And that to me is a really important space

554
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:11,240
where I see Interpol connect
in a proactive manner,

555
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,680
identifying that the threats, the risks

556
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,700
and the high harm that's been caused

557
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,740
and then start bringing
those countries together

558
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:20,210
where either the threat actors are

559
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:24,280
or whether the infrastructure
is or whether the victims are.

560
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:27,930
And look to see how we can then disrupt.

561
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:30,500
So we may not always
have a judicial outcome.

562
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,410
I know, particularly in the UK,

563
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:34,610
one of our measurements on cyber crime

564
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:37,459
was how many criminals
did we arrest in the UK?

565
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:39,670
Well, the attackers are global.

566
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:42,650
So to have a metric in
a national environment,

567
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:45,130
just measuring one small element.

568
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:46,530
Again, it's quite difficult

569
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:48,550
for police to show our value add.

570
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:50,419
So when we're going back and saying, well,

571
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:51,550
this is what we've achieved

572
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:53,280
because we need to be able to do that

573
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,940
to show that we're
prioritizing the cyber crime,

574
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:58,910
we're going after the
criminals and we have results.

575
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:00,890
That's what we actually
need to amplify out

576
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:03,360
through a regional and
global model as well.

577
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,129
So I think that sort of covers
most parts of the question

578
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:08,393
you've just asked there.

579
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:12,230
- Yeah, I'm totally agreeing
and I think it's really

580
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:15,070
more easy to do within the sort of group

581
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:16,639
of a like-minded countries

582
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,260
or the countries which
have a shared vision

583
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:22,320
as Jon highlighted.

584
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,399
But making the most caliber,
is it possible at all?

585
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,843
Serge, what do you think?

586
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:30,350
- That's a really good question.

587
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:31,469
That's a very hard question.

588
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:34,650
I think at the end of
the day, it's a decision

589
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:36,469
that States have to face

590
00:27:36,469 --> 00:27:40,193
or to take if they really wanna
tackle this problem or not.

591
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:44,783
Right now we might be
optimistic in the sense that

592
00:27:44,783 --> 00:27:48,899
we kind of kind of lived the
serious level of cyber crime

593
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,730
but if it becomes too much,
it just becomes too painful

594
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:53,550
and then states start reacting.

595
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:56,493
So the question is just
how long do we wait?

596
00:27:59,173 --> 00:28:00,460
I do have my hopes.

597
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:03,120
I mean, are we gonna get better in a year?

598
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,979
But there is still a
lot of work to be done

599
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:09,840
and I think I mean, you
mentioned is it's often

600
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:16,620
like-minded organizations to
not only talk about States

601
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:17,613
that work together better.

602
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:18,580
But even here we actually

603
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:20,376
have a regulatory policy challenges.

604
00:28:20,376 --> 00:28:23,970
Often there's a liability
issue and for various reasons

605
00:28:25,003 --> 00:28:29,409
we all sitting around the table
or I guess on our back cams.

606
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:31,480
And we each know the
other side knows something

607
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:34,150
that would help me or the other guy a lot

608
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:36,100
but we can't really tell it.

609
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:38,639
Because kind of the legal
compliance guy on the side

610
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,550
outside the camera is standing there

611
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:41,860
and saying, no, no, no, no, no

612
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:43,830
you're not gonna tell this.

613
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:47,330
And I think that is a way
where we need to make progress.

614
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:50,500
So that security teams or the good guys

615
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,610
to say it simply, can
actually get their work done.

616
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:54,889
I think there is some progress

617
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:58,830
if you look at the European in
this directive diversion tool

618
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:00,629
that actually starts recognizing

619
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:03,720
that security teams not violate privacy,

620
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:06,210
they actually makes that
privacy becomes better.

621
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:08,350
So that information that's stolen

622
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:10,629
doesn't end up in the hands of criminals.

623
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:13,050
These are things we need to work on.

624
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:15,930
Another topic that sometimes
makes our lives extremely hard

625
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:18,123
is badly implemented sanctions.

626
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:23,690
And there's some security teams
not even allowed to talk to.

627
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:28,690
And that's a problem in a
global cyber supply chain.

628
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:30,900
So these are a couple of things

629
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,710
that I think need to be addressed.

630
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:35,400
And then something that
I think is also relevant

631
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:39,700
for law enforcement is the
problem of jurisdictions.

632
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:42,050
A lot of cyber crime
that I meet in my day job

633
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:46,383
actually happens on our servers
which are in Switzerland,

634
00:29:46,383 --> 00:29:48,170
but the criminals and the victims

635
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:49,440
are both outside Switzerland.

636
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,070
So who should I go to?

637
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:53,780
Everybody tells me I'm
not responsible for it.

638
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:56,510
And that is totally okay, the Swiss police

639
00:29:56,510 --> 00:30:00,120
is not responsible for an
armed robbery on a German bank.

640
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:03,600
But maybe it should be
responsible for cyber crime

641
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:08,159
that passes to a Swiss territory

642
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,566
even if it's only through a fiber.

643
00:30:10,566 --> 00:30:13,893
I think that's one of the
big challenges to add that.

644
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,300
I think we're on a major border,

645
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:20,743
it'll probably take us some
more years, but we'll see.

646
00:30:22,773 --> 00:30:26,128
- Great that you actually
create so much optimism.

647
00:30:26,128 --> 00:30:28,595
It's actually quite inspirational.

648
00:30:28,595 --> 00:30:31,750
But I agree that probably
in most of the challenges

649
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:34,270
on the policy side rather
on the technical side

650
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:38,280
and also here from my
colleagues security researchers.

651
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,980
But I actually don't
really have the problems

652
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,750
to cooperate with other companies,

653
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:45,060
with other organizations
to share the information.

654
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:50,060
The barrier is indeed the sort
of new borders in cyberspace.

655
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:53,580
And from that Jon, probably
you'd like to share

656
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:54,413
a little bit more.

657
00:30:54,413 --> 00:30:58,987
You also mentioned on the UN
level, the recent OWG report

658
00:30:58,987 --> 00:31:01,340
and I guess UN level is the only one level

659
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:04,780
where all States have
the means to cooperate

660
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:08,270
with the charter to discuss
this topic, or maybe I'm wrong.

661
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:09,273
So what do we think?

662
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,647
- Yeah, thank you.

663
00:31:12,647 --> 00:31:16,040
You ask if collaboration
and cooperation is possible.

664
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,980
I think, yes, the open-ended working group

665
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:23,980
as you mentioned, is an example
that consensus is possible.

666
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:26,240
But on the other hand,
I think it also shows

667
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,010
a little bit the limits of cooperation

668
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:34,010
and what is possible at
the moment in this context.

669
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:39,740
I think there are also
possibilities to find common ground

670
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:44,740
and to see where we can have
confidence building measures

671
00:31:47,019 --> 00:31:50,963
on a level that doesn't
need a lot of trust.

672
00:31:50,963 --> 00:31:53,010
I think we have to identify

673
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:56,640
where it is possible to collaborate.

674
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:01,500
And I also wanted to
mention the Geneva Dialogue

675
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:06,131
as a complimentary
element to the discussions

676
00:32:06,131 --> 00:32:08,770
on a political level.

677
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:13,770
The force of this dialogue is among others

678
00:32:16,006 --> 00:32:17,310
that this is global.

679
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:22,203
It's not among like-minded,
it's among the private sector

680
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:27,280
and they come from all continents.

681
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:31,920
And that is I think the
force of this dialogue

682
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:35,710
and this is sort of bottom up approach

683
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:40,050
where the top down
approach policy approach

684
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:44,780
is probably necessary of
course but can't reach

685
00:32:46,009 --> 00:32:49,413
every angle of our problems.

686
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:52,080
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, excellent.

687
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,260
Thank you so much.

688
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:55,000
And I guess the time is almost up,

689
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,120
so we must bring our panel
discussion to a close,

690
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,429
but let's finalize in that Twitter forum.

691
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:01,235
What do you believe one at least component

692
00:33:01,235 --> 00:33:05,419
is a key ingredient in building
a global pulse response.

693
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:07,603
Just one, so Serge, what do you think?

694
00:33:09,534 --> 00:33:11,163
- After this panel it's so obvious,

695
00:33:11,163 --> 00:33:15,334
it's global collaboration
across trust gaps,

696
00:33:15,334 --> 00:33:18,304
across any other gaps that we may have.

697
00:33:18,304 --> 00:33:20,843
It's really collaboration.

698
00:33:20,843 --> 00:33:22,843
- Great, Director Jones?

699
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:26,760
- It's cyber partnerships against crime.

700
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,850
And I think when you look
at how we're now operating

701
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:32,750
with our private partners
and being able to bring data

702
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:35,600
from private partners and
share with private partners,

703
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:39,253
again, I'm very optimistic my
glass is definitely half full.

704
00:33:40,822 --> 00:33:42,879
- Superb, great, thank you so much.

705
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,253
And Yon, what do you think?

706
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:46,570
- I agree completely.

707
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:48,750
Cyber security is a team sport.

708
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:52,070
We need everyone on this place

709
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:57,070
which each role play to have
a free secure cyberspace.

710
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,190
- Thank you, thank you all.

711
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:02,910
And I also would agree better cooperation

712
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:05,200
is the core element of course.

713
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,710
I hope you find the discussion useful.

714
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:08,909
If there are any questions,

715
00:34:08,909 --> 00:34:11,989
feel free to reach out to us
and ask additional questions

716
00:34:11,989 --> 00:34:14,370
which will be passed along to speakers.

717
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:17,310
We will do our best to
share answers shortly.

718
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:19,870
Please also join me in thanking
our great experts today

719
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:22,580
who have shared their very
frank and useful remarks.

720
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:25,835
Thank you very much, Director
Jones, Serge and Jon.

721
00:34:25,835 --> 00:34:27,918
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
