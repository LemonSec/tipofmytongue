00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:03,770
- Hi, my name is Christopher Crowley.

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:05,779
I'm gonna be presenting
on the Cybersecurity

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:08,310
Operation Center Technology Taxonomy,

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:10,350
which I use as part of my consulting

5
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:13,263
and instruction for
cybersecurity operation centers.

6
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:16,610
I'm gonna start with my Apply Slide,

7
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:18,830
because I want you to
thinking about these things

8
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:20,709
as I go through the material.

9
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:22,940
Immediately right now in the chat window

10
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,830
as I'm going through the taxonomy,

11
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:26,360
I'd be interested to hear if you think

12
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,349
that I'm missing things,

13
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:28,640
or if you think that there are things

14
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,850
that this is just too
large of a taxonomy list.

15
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:33,440
The technology that I'm gonna go through

16
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,245
is extensive and thorough.

17
00:00:35,246 --> 00:00:37,900
I would like you to consider that

18
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:41,330
as a general guide for
everybody in the world

19
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:44,239
for their security operation
centers as a reference,

20
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,610
of all the technology that we need

21
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:47,230
in order to be able to do this.

22
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:49,879
Then when you go back to work,
I'd like you to crosswalk

23
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,950
that listing with the
things that you have,

24
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:54,490
and I'll talk about how I
would like you to assess

25
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:56,950
the shortcomings that you
might have in your environment

26
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:00,190
and then plan to acquire
appropriate technology

27
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:03,010
for your environment, and then
implement it in a good way.

28
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:05,770
So let's start off with
why I'm even doing this.

29
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:10,390
I see a problem globally
of selection of technology.

30
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:11,223
And I'll talk about a couple

31
00:01:11,223 --> 00:01:13,470
of examples of this in a moment.

32
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:16,360
What I have found is when
helping people to build

33
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,293
out their security operations centers,

34
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:21,560
is even if I go to a very large vendor

35
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,740
who probably owns all
the various technology

36
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:25,179
that I'm gonna talk to,

37
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:26,137
I can't go to them and say,

38
00:01:26,137 --> 00:01:29,370
"Hey, I just wanna buy the SOC
package, give me everything."

39
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:30,410
It doesn't exist.

40
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:32,009
And if you can provide that

41
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:33,970
I'd be interested to hear that right?

42
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:35,000
There are actually a lot of people

43
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,140
in the world that look
for something like that.

44
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,940
Just give me the SOC package
because I want to build a SOC.

45
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:43,710
What I actually prefer doing though,

46
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:46,690
is starting with this
long list of technology

47
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:51,149
and then selecting the right
thing for the organization.

48
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:55,100
And hopefully this
technology taxonomy is useful

49
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,470
to you in doing that for your environment.

50
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:00,679
There's also a lot of market
information that's out there

51
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:05,480
that is provided by vendors
and analysis companies.

52
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,710
These are good,

53
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:10,030
but they're not really open
listings of everything.

54
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,410
They're usually focused
on specific capabilities

55
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:15,760
and specific technologies,
and then comparing the vendors

56
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,070
within those specific technologies.

57
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:22,620
So, my view of the problem
is that we need a solution

58
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,918
and this is a start of that solution.

59
00:02:25,918 --> 00:02:29,960
I want you to think about
picking the technology for you.

60
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,530
Now, the way that I do this
and the way that I suggest

61
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:35,280
that you do it for yourself
is have a complete list.

62
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,710
And then get to that point

63
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,620
of here are the things
that we actually need.

64
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,577
A lot of times people say to me,

65
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:43,237
"Hey Chris, what's the absolute minimum

66
00:02:43,237 --> 00:02:46,727
"that a SOC needs in
order to do the things

67
00:02:46,727 --> 00:02:49,590
"that a cybersecurity
operations center does?"

68
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,260
I don't take that approach.

69
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,387
I say, "Here's all the
stuff that we could use.

70
00:02:53,387 --> 00:02:56,550
"What are your intentional functions?"

71
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:59,317
And then I say, "Here's the
technology that we'll need

72
00:02:59,317 --> 00:03:01,930
"in order to make those things happen."

73
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:04,690
Now, you might also have
constraints of budget.

74
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:08,140
Most people who run SOC
have a constrained budget

75
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:10,589
you might also have
constraints around open source.

76
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,305
You can use it, or your favorite.

77
00:03:12,305 --> 00:03:16,070
You might have specific
vendors that are excluded

78
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:19,100
from the selection that you can make

79
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,590
because of import or export restrictions

80
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,640
or government telling you

81
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,350
you can't use that particular software

82
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:26,280
in this particular agency.

83
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,190
Whatever it is, you have to
then work around all that

84
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,140
and try to glue all these technologies

85
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,600
that you pick together.

86
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:37,239
So, in this listing, I
am defining the boundary

87
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,370
of the technology
taxonomy for those things

88
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:43,030
in order to run the
security operation center.

89
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,970
I'm not talking about
all of your IT needs.

90
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,550
I'm just talking about the cybersecurity

91
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:48,260
operation center needs.

92
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:51,380
So, as an example of where
that boundary exists,

93
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,940
let's say you have an LDAP server

94
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:56,300
for your authentication
for all of your users.

95
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:59,020
That's not really part
of our infrastructure

96
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,330
and the tools that we
need, but we would need

97
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:05,000
something to be able to monitor
that authentication system.

98
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,030
This might be LDAP,

99
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,780
it might be a proprietary
implementation of LDAP.

100
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,600
So if you've got active directory,

101
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,440
I don't expect your SOC to
run the active directory.

102
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,769
I expect your IT team to
run that active directory.

103
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:18,409
And then we instrument

104
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:20,660
that active directory in order to see it.

105
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,443
That would be part of our
infrastructure components.

106
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:25,880
Other things that I'm not gonna talk about

107
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,412
because I just really don't have time

108
00:04:27,412 --> 00:04:31,390
is how do I align people
with the technology?

109
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:33,710
What's the minimum that's
absolutely necessary?

110
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:34,930
How do I maintain this?

111
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,110
Even though mentioned
the ideas of maintenance

112
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,950
because I think that's an important aspect

113
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,800
of procuring tools.

114
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,980
I also won't talk about how
I advocate use of use cases

115
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,410
and hunting and training,

116
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,370
and all these other things
that actually are important

117
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,090
for a SOC just don't
have time for it okay?

118
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:52,099
I have other resources out there online

119
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,810
that you could look at
in order to get the frame

120
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:57,680
of where my thoughts
are on those subjects,

121
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,250
but for now I'm really just
trying to focus on technology.

122
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,380
But also I'd like to point
out, and this is an excerpt

123
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:06,180
from the 2020 SOC Survey that I wrote,

124
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,710
released it in December of 2020

125
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,450
basically a collection of questions.

126
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:15,180
I asked about about 30 or 40

127
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,970
different specific technology types.

128
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:20,870
I said, "Do you use this
technology in your SOC?"

129
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:24,097
And I also asked,

130
00:05:24,097 --> 00:05:27,317
"Do you have this fully
implemented in your environment?

131
00:05:27,317 --> 00:05:29,387
"And if you have it purchased

132
00:05:29,387 --> 00:05:31,747
"have you not even yet implemented it?"

133
00:05:31,747 --> 00:05:34,540
And so these sorts of
questions are insightful.

134
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:37,650
And something that I find that we do

135
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:42,560
as a global cybersecurity
community is we tend to buy tools

136
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,400
and then don't even implement
them, that's unfortunate.

137
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,150
And I think that the
reason why that happens

138
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:52,489
is because we are inclined to buy

139
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,190
the latest and greatest thing,

140
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:58,550
rather than thinking about
our technology portfolio

141
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:02,170
as a cohesive set of tools

142
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:04,190
to accomplish specific objectives.

143
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,820
So the first time I tried to do this,

144
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,080
I actually mapped technology

145
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,120
to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.

146
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,590
If you're not familiar with the
NIST Cybersecurity Framework

147
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:13,179
it's really a phenomenal framework

148
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,090
to think about in terms

149
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:16,510
of how you do cybersecurity operations.

150
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:17,960
They talk about identify,

151
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,820
protect, detect, respond and recover.

152
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,500
And so what I did was I took this

153
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,410
and then I took the technology
list that I had at the time.

154
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:29,310
This was actually part of
the 2018 Sands SOC Survey

155
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:31,840
that John Pescatore and I co-authored.

156
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,609
This was an attempt to help
to make it easier for people

157
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:38,940
to answer the questions about
the technology that they used.

158
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,930
It actually didn't work great.

159
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:43,500
It was a novel experiment as it were.

160
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:47,480
And what I found was actually,
if I looked at the categories

161
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,060
and then where the technology was,

162
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:52,263
almost all of the technology
was in the protect and detect.

163
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:57,400
So, I also wanna sort of
frame this conversation

164
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,359
about what I think a security
operation center needs to do.

165
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,950
And I discussed this in the
context of functional areas.

166
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:07,485
So, for SOC functional areas,

167
00:07:07,485 --> 00:07:09,660
I consider a steering committee.

168
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,280
This is where your customers,

169
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,539
I actually use the term constituents,

170
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:16,160
these are the people who you're
supposed to be defending.

171
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,120
Those people and their information systems

172
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,720
are what you're supposed to defend.

173
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,950
And the steering committee
helps you to understand

174
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:26,000
what their needs are, it
helps them to have a venue

175
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,990
to provide feedback to your SOC.

176
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,820
It also helps your SOC
to be able to communicate

177
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,719
to those constituents

178
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,810
to tell them about the threat
landscape, as you see it,

179
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:39,350
to provide metrics and
other sort of communication

180
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:40,640
from the SOC.

181
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:45,010
So that sort of exterior,
but a necessary functional

182
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:47,190
capability for security operations.

183
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:50,350
Similarly, the command
center is an interchange

184
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:53,110
sort of more of a technical
and tactical interchange

185
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:56,780
from the SOC, to its constituents.

186
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:00,940
The command center in
my functional area model

187
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:04,750
is actually intended to provide
guidance for the operations

188
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,230
of the internal functions of the SOC.

189
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:10,050
It also helps to prevent
them from being interrupted

190
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:12,450
by people asking for information.

191
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,349
Monitoring is identifying
that we have problems.

192
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:17,770
Threat intelligence is
tracking and understanding

193
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:20,409
the adversaries who are attacking us,

194
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:22,340
incident handling is dealing with problems

195
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,289
when they come up.

196
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:26,690
Forensics is deep dive
authoritative technical analysis

197
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:28,430
of the information assets

198
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:31,770
which we're investigating
at any given time.

199
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:35,069
And self-assessment is
things like baseline creation

200
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:37,440
vulnerability management,
penetration testing,

201
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,190
and the development of exercises,

202
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:42,230
both for our SOC staff
and for the constituents

203
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:46,600
in order to make them as
effective as they can possibly be.

204
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,760
Now, part of this then becomes a question

205
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,727
for you probably of, "Well,
I've got three people.

206
00:08:52,727 --> 00:08:54,380
"How do you expect them to
do all of these things?"

207
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:57,077
Or "I've got 150 full-time staff

208
00:08:57,077 --> 00:08:59,510
"and we don't organize them that way."

209
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:03,200
That's okay, I discuss this
in terms of functional models

210
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,670
in order to talk about all the things

211
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,829
that I think security
operations needs to be.

212
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:09,440
And if I'm telling you
a list of technology,

213
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,740
I should be providing you
at least with a backdrop

214
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:15,300
of what I expect that
technology to be used for.

215
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,109
So if you've completely
outsourced incident handling

216
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:21,180
to some third party, well,
you probably can exclude

217
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,662
some of the technology
items that I specify.

218
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:28,430
So, this is another
aspect of all of this tech

219
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:30,099
is how do I then interact

220
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,820
with my managed security service provider?

221
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,420
Who's, they're running one SIM

222
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:37,360
and I'm running a different
SIM, or how do I decide this?

223
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,690
I'm not really going to
solve that for you now

224
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:41,990
but I am gonna give you some ideas

225
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:44,814
about how I've seen people
implement technology

226
00:09:44,814 --> 00:09:48,199
in coordination with managed
security service providers.

227
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,320
The short story is maybe
you have technology

228
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,130
that you really like, and you're looking

229
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:53,780
for a security provider.

230
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:56,040
And part of the requests that you make

231
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,260
to those security providers

232
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:00,760
is we use this SIM, you need
to be able to use it too.

233
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,340
We're gonna have this on premises SIM,

234
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,250
and you're gonna monitor those things.

235
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:07,000
Maybe you're out shopping
for a service provider,

236
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,920
and they are able to
specify the technology

237
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,010
that they want to use.

238
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:15,020
And then you'll implement
that in your environment.

239
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:17,329
So, you have to decide what
the right approach is for you

240
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:18,413
in that context.

241
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:23,050
So let me get into the
definition of the categories.

242
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:28,050
This is a number of
categories with subcategories

243
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:32,300
and with specific technologies
inside of each sub category.

244
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:35,290
Now, I don't actually have
the time to go into it here

245
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:38,170
but I actually additionally have a list

246
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:41,360
of example technologies,

247
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,750
inside of each of the technology
types which I'll site.

248
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:45,810
There's a lot of information

249
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:47,609
that I've collected on
this over the years.

250
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:49,290
I find it to be very useful.

251
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:52,500
I don't mean to specifically
endorse any vendors

252
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,780
and I'm gonna really
try to avoid specifying

253
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,990
any vendor names here,

254
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,630
because that's not the
point of today's talk.

255
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,370
So. I'm gonna get into these now.

256
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,153
The first category is visibility.

257
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:08,180
Visibility in the context
of external awareness.

258
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,620
My SOC needs to be aware

259
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,900
of the things that are
happening out there.

260
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:15,890
And so this includes threat
intelligence portals.

261
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:18,610
The way that we ingest information.

262
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:20,170
And so we might have a data feed

263
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:22,790
that we're ingesting related
to threat information.

264
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:26,170
We might also use that
technology or different one,

265
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:28,490
where if we're capable and mature enough

266
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:31,040
to be able to produce threat intelligence,

267
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,230
we're then disseminating that
information to our partners

268
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:37,060
who we've agreed to share
threat intelligence with.

269
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:39,949
We have ways to track globally

270
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,640
on all of the different threats

271
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,550
that are changing in the environment.

272
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:46,630
We have some sort of indicator
of compromised portal

273
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:48,170
where we can look for stuff

274
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:49,920
that we've encountered previously.

275
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,660
We can also use some sort of a portal

276
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:55,230
in order to correlate from an IP address

277
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:58,800
to a host name or an
internet service provider.

278
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,969
All of these things are part

279
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:03,610
of our portal that allows
us to understand information

280
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:04,660
about our threats.

281
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:05,740
We also want to have some sort

282
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,480
of operational status tracking

283
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,870
and this is operational status
of the information systems

284
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,940
which we're supposed to be defending.

285
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,970
If that system's down,
we should know about it.

286
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:16,760
If that system is performing poorly,

287
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,380
we should know about it.

288
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:20,870
And we should be able
to use that information

289
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:25,560
to help to inform our
security related insights.

290
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:30,560
Similarly, the global
stage that is unfolding

291
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:36,780
at all times also affects
our cybersecurity concerns

292
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:38,710
and infects them too, right?

293
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:41,050
So, that global stage is something

294
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:43,579
that my security operation
center should be aware of.

295
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:46,740
And you might have a
feed of news information

296
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:49,330
relevant to your market sector,

297
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:51,250
to the regions that you operate in.

298
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,660
And this is not about
cybersecurity at all,

299
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:54,750
just the real world.

300
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,960
I mean, we're part of the real world too,

301
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,240
but the other things that
are happening in the world

302
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,483
that are not specifically
relevant to cyber.

303
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:04,020
Another part of this is the weather.

304
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:06,069
As the weather changes,

305
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:08,810
we have impact in cybersecurity, right?

306
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:11,270
Tornadoes and hurricanes and tsunamis

307
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:13,720
and other things that
actually are affecting

308
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,773
the operational environments
that we're intending to defend.

309
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:21,430
Related to this, is what I
call the internet weather.

310
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:23,739
As undersea cables get cut

311
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:28,140
and DNS hosting environments get affected

312
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,930
or taken down or BGP routes are published

313
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:34,410
that reroute traffic from
one place where it should be

314
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:36,557
to another place where it shouldn't be,

315
00:13:36,557 --> 00:13:39,600
"Oops, sorry that was
a mistake," they said.

316
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,960
But this is the sort of thing
that we should be aware of.

317
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:45,140
And we need a way that we
can maintain that visibility

318
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:47,240
from within our SOC.

319
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,030
Another aspect of technology that we need

320
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:51,329
is the ability to communicate.

321
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,400
In communications, we
use telephones, right?

322
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,750
This is cellular service

323
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:59,000
and sort of our commodity telephone lines,

324
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,800
maybe VoIP, however you've
decided to solve that problem.

325
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,490
Additionally, in our communications,

326
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:06,570
we probably want to have

327
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:08,560
some sort of way to maintain a connection

328
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,609
between our staff inside of the SOC.

329
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:13,160
This is chat, and email, and file sharing,

330
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,900
and collaboration platforms,

331
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,448
we might have an authoritative
knowledge management portal

332
00:14:17,448 --> 00:14:22,448
where we share information
internally among our staff.

333
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:25,819
If those communication capabilities

334
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:28,160
aren't already encrypted,

335
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,578
well, you probably are gonna
need to select some technology

336
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:33,910
to overlay on top of that to
provide end-to-end encryption

337
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,516
and protection of the confidentiality

338
00:14:35,517 --> 00:14:38,280
and integrity of that information.

339
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,689
Similarly, you need to
communicate with the people

340
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:43,470
who you're protecting and
some of this might be public.

341
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:45,770
And so you have a website
where they can browse to.

342
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:48,640
And some of it might be
part of your constituent

343
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,150
delivery of information.

344
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:53,340
This might be metrics or the
tickets that they're working on

345
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:56,260
service level objective
tracking, the status of the SOC.

346
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,480
If you're operating in a diminished status

347
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,470
I wouldn't really want
to share that publicly

348
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:03,053
but I would wanna inform
my constituents about it.

349
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:07,300
Another aspect of our technology portfolio

350
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,718
is the operations.

351
00:15:08,719 --> 00:15:10,410
This is something that a lot of people

352
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,610
just think is the only aspect of the SOC.

353
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:14,080
But I disagree with that.

354
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,960
I think it's actually a larger portfolio

355
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,290
that we need to consider.

356
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:19,569
So the orchestration and automation,

357
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:21,310
this is a category of tools,

358
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:24,640
which is actually stands on its own.

359
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:28,170
This is the glue in many
cases that allows us

360
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:30,180
to make multiple different systems

361
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,880
coordinate with one another.

362
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,140
That's kind of the
definition of orchestration.

363
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:37,510
Automation is do these tasks computer.

364
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:39,590
I want to have it done repeatedly

365
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:43,270
with high precision on an ongoing basis.

366
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:46,490
Ticket tracking is another
thing that helps us

367
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:48,590
to manage our work and our workflow.

368
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:52,140
And there are a lot of
different vendors out there

369
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:54,319
that sell ticket tracking systems,

370
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,880
I mean, everybody has one.

371
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,570
This is something that the
correlation to the owner,

372
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:04,960
is actually a tool that we
can use in order to track

373
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,930
who is assigned to a specific asset.

374
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:12,170
We can also track who is
responsible for a specific asset.

375
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:14,490
That responsibility
allows us to understand

376
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:15,930
who we're supposed to inform,

377
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:17,569
when there's a problem with that asset,

378
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:20,540
it might also tell the SOC
what they're allowed to do

379
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,959
or not allowed to do on a given technology

380
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,750
at a specific moment in time,

381
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:29,750
based on what owner exists
for that information asset.

382
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:32,280
And since we're talking about operations

383
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,699
part of the stance that I hold

384
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,740
about a security operations center

385
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:39,840
is that you should have at least

386
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:44,840
as good of a DevSecOps
process for your own tools

387
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,329
as the IT teams who you're
intended to protect.

388
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:52,650
Otherwise, if you can't keep
up with them in that regard,

389
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:55,319
you are going to risk

390
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,880
not being able to defend
those information systems.

391
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:00,480
So you're probably gonna need tiers

392
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,860
across all of these important systems

393
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,470
in order to be able to test

394
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:07,950
before you push things to production.

395
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:10,394
The detection and protection tools,

396
00:17:10,394 --> 00:17:14,050
are organized in this taxonomy

397
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:17,149
in terms of what it
protects or detects on.

398
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:20,390
And so the first category
of this is the end point.

399
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:22,250
If you're doing forensics,

400
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:27,250
you would need ways to be
able to extract information

401
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:31,310
from those hosts that you're
responsible for protecting.

402
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:33,408
You might call this a HIDS tool,

403
00:17:33,408 --> 00:17:36,560
or a HIPS tool or a endpoint
detection and response tool,

404
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,580
or endpoint protection platform,

405
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,649
or a malware protection system,

406
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:41,880
kind of don't care what you call it.

407
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,570
But I need something
which is on that system

408
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:47,669
which is an overlay of
the standard processing

409
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:51,760
of that system in order to
protect it from malicious code.

410
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,900
And to help us to understand
when malicious code runs,

411
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,500
especially in case we're not exactly sure

412
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,290
that it's malicious and we need to be able

413
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:03,470
to then investigate it after the fact.

414
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:06,000
I also need ways to collect memory,

415
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,310
this is part of my acquisition of assets.

416
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:10,230
I would like to be able
to do you do that remotely

417
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:13,360
from the comfort of my
analysts workstation,

418
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,184
but sometimes that doesn't work.

419
00:18:15,184 --> 00:18:17,340
Maybe I don't have the instrumentation.

420
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,970
Maybe I don't have the network access.

421
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:22,300
Maybe I'm moving across a satellite uplink

422
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:25,581
and I'm not gonna move a
two terabyte extraction

423
00:18:25,582 --> 00:18:28,650
of some information off of that host

424
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,500
when I'm doing a host based file system

425
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,910
and memory collection, right?

426
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:36,400
So these sorts of things, I
have remote ways to do this.

427
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,420
I might also need to
have a local collection

428
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,710
mechanism for this.

429
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:42,490
I might have user behavior analytics tool.

430
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:45,140
I need to be able to collect
from my mobile devices.

431
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:49,270
I, if I'm dealing with
encrypted platforms,

432
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:51,940
I probably need some
way to escrow them keys

433
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,870
in advance of using encryption keys

434
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:57,080
on those endpoints, in order
to be able to read the data,

435
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:00,290
if I do a full device collection

436
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:04,270
from that host that I'm
trying to investigate.

437
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:07,260
Similarly on all my network assets,

438
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:10,410
I tend to to have some sort
of network instrumentation

439
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:12,740
with a network intrusion detection

440
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:16,090
and network intrusion protection tool.

441
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:19,830
I will collect my logs across
to all of my network assets.

442
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:22,460
And I might have a lot of
different types of application

443
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,170
that actually run on my network,

444
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:25,740
that I need to wait to instrument.

445
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:28,630
Maybe you have full PCAP,
If you do have full PCAP,

446
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:31,180
I hope you also have TLS intercept.

447
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,350
In terms of the infrastructure,

448
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:36,590
all of the stuff that allows
us to run our network,

449
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:39,139
needs to be instrumented for our SOC.

450
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:41,060
If you haven't thought about e-discovery,

451
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,909
please think about that.

452
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:45,870
If some other team inside
of your environment

453
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:48,550
is already making e-discovery happen,

454
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:50,830
I wouldn't try to pull it into my SOC,

455
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:55,169
but I will advise you
that if your organization

456
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:58,400
is asked to do some form of e-discovery,

457
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,487
it's coming to the SOC to say,

458
00:20:00,487 --> 00:20:03,870
"Hey, can you go find
these things for us?"

459
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:07,169
So having a technical
implementation of this in advance

460
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:08,950
is actually really good idea.

461
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:11,920
All of our logs on our user activity,

462
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,320
we can collect that as
part of our infrastructure,

463
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,080
our Wi-Fi systems also useful
in terms of instrumentation

464
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,550
to understand what's
happening in our environment,

465
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:22,800
our malware detonation devices,

466
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,760
some people call this a automated sandbox.

467
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,140
The idea of this is that
we're able to instrument

468
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:31,670
by running an opening documents,

469
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:34,100
running executables
and seeing what happens

470
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,270
in order to make a
cybersecurity assessment

471
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:38,760
of those things that are
coming into our network.

472
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:43,260
So, we might have a portion
that you call the cloud.

473
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:45,210
I call it your extra structure.

474
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:47,360
'Cause there are a lot of
things that are actually part

475
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,350
of your infrastructure which you don't own

476
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,830
and manage and control.

477
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:54,360
And so cloud is a nice term for that.

478
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:57,199
I think extra structure is more precise

479
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,160
because there are a lot of things

480
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,950
which actually aren't part of the cloud.

481
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:03,850
So, we need to be able to
instrument those systems

482
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:05,513
to do extraction of information

483
00:21:05,513 --> 00:21:09,220
for our analysis within our SOC.

484
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:12,120
We might be using data tokenization tools,

485
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:17,120
wherein we put representations
of data in cloud storage.

486
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:21,060
And then when someone wants
to actually see the real data

487
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:26,060
behind that, it actually looks
it up in the token server.

488
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:31,280
And if the system that's
requesting the real data,

489
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:35,520
is vetted, then the user is
allowed to see that data.

490
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,770
And across all of this, for our detection,

491
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:42,570
and ultimate prevention, we
wanna be able to correlate

492
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:45,230
these various data elements,

493
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:47,720
in order to understand that
maybe we have a problem.

494
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,610
And we typically use a
SIM in order to do this.

495
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:53,280
This security incident
and event management

496
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,210
is really good at doing correlation

497
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:58,210
but it's not the only tool
that can do correlation, right?

498
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:01,900
So we might have an engine
that just does log correlation

499
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,800
and stitches things together for us.

500
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,409
We might have a tool which is really good

501
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:09,070
at doing historical
analysis with new indicators

502
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:11,280
of compromise that we
just learned about, right?

503
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,720
So this is rapid searching

504
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,180
across massive volumes of technology.

505
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,590
It's not really a SIM

506
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:20,770
but it is a specific search
tool that allows us to look

507
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:22,403
for our cybersecurity issues.

508
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:27,480
With all this data that we
need to actually investigate,

509
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:31,010
we need ways to be able to
store that for the long-term.

510
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:34,320
One aspect of this is
the idea of aggregation.

511
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,300
And there may be certain
data which references

512
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:41,340
specific types of information

513
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:44,590
that your organization
needs to store or label

514
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:46,330
in precise ways.

515
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:48,110
They're usually legal statutes

516
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:50,530
which require that you protect

517
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:55,420
say a personally identifiable
information in a specific way.

518
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:58,820
And there are various legal
terms for this across the globe

519
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:00,020
that you need to be aware of.

520
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,400
If this is financial information,

521
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,040
if this is information
about a specific individual,

522
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,830
you need to protect that appropriately.

523
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:09,149
And part of your security portfolio

524
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:13,460
might be appropriately
labeling where that data lives

525
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:15,840
so that the security controls are matched

526
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,770
to the type of data that's stored

527
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:19,960
on your information systems.

528
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,240
You might also have to
archive these things

529
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,310
for a certain amount of time

530
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:25,810
because there are legal
requirements to do this.

531
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:30,730
Archive is the standard
sort of retention of data,

532
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:32,700
but then retention requirements

533
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,620
you might have specific cases

534
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:37,699
where you need to store
something for longer.

535
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,300
And the security operations

536
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,270
might be responsible for doing that.

537
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:42,610
And in that sort of case

538
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:45,449
we're asked to store a file system image,

539
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:47,821
or a log entry, or a log file,

540
00:23:47,821 --> 00:23:49,919
for an extended period of time.

541
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:53,280
Where you store that is something
that you should consider

542
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:56,729
and have protection for
those storage things.

543
00:23:56,729 --> 00:24:00,430
Since all of this is a physical construct,

544
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:03,010
ultimately we then need physical controls

545
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:05,120
around where we're storing our data.

546
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,010
These might be rooms
that we have a key to,

547
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:10,550
these might also be
safes within our office

548
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:14,450
or the office might be
in a safe, or a safe.

549
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:15,793
I've actually worked in some offices

550
00:24:15,793 --> 00:24:19,830
which to get in the door,
you have to know the code,

551
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:23,939
on a very complicated
safe, and that office

552
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:27,450
is effectively a vault in its entirety.

553
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:28,530
Not a fun place to work

554
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:31,770
but places where I've
worked in the past, right?

555
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:33,889
So this sort of physical
control is important

556
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:35,390
depending upon the sort of information

557
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:36,714
that you're protecting.

558
00:24:36,714 --> 00:24:40,070
As part of your information
protection portfolio,

559
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:42,700
you also need to be able to
destroy information, right?

560
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:45,601
So, the ultimate destruction
of an information asset,

561
00:24:45,601 --> 00:24:49,040
is usually the security
team's responsibility.

562
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,760
Next, top level category is the idea

563
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,910
of deception technology.

564
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:55,440
This is cool, I think.

565
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,220
I think it's kind of a
thing that a lot of people

566
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:02,530
don't consider this as
a viable technology.

567
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:03,889
But a lot of vendors recently

568
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:05,430
have been working in this space

569
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:10,430
because with deception, we tip
the advantage in our favor,

570
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:14,159
in terms of access to assets.

571
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:17,020
So, internet connectivity
is an example of this.

572
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:21,062
If I want to interact with a threat,

573
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:25,870
I should not be necessarily
divulging that that's coming

574
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:28,270
from my actual network.

575
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:29,760
In order to do this effectively,

576
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,210
I might also create some personas.

577
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:34,280
Now this might be
associated with my business.

578
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:39,280
And when I go to interact with
an adversary controlled asset

579
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:42,560
I have a specific email
address that I use,

580
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,879
in order to sign up for the whatever,

581
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,480
rather than my actual email address.

582
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,404
So, these sorts of personas,
if this is an email address

583
00:25:51,404 --> 00:25:55,360
that the attackers can't
find anywhere online,

584
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,092
they might not send the attack.

585
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:02,190
So, this is a part of deception
is management of personas,

586
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:04,260
having research networks to do this,

587
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:07,180
and networks where we can
actually do testing and modeling.

588
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:09,150
Having a scale model of the internet,

589
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,480
is actually a good idea,

590
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,090
if you're doing advanced
deception type work.

591
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:16,060
You might do automated
network quarantining

592
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:19,030
where in a system which wants to connect

593
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:21,010
to your computer network,

594
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:22,960
is actually going to be interrogated

595
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,730
prior to being allowed on
the real network, right?

596
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:27,070
This sort of automated quarantine

597
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:27,960
has been around for a while,

598
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,572
but it's actually an aspect of deception.

599
00:26:30,572 --> 00:26:33,850
Another way that we could use
this exact same technology

600
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:37,290
is when we have a host,
which we're suspicious of,

601
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:38,879
after it's been allowed in,

602
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,640
we can actually flip it
into a quarantine sub-net

603
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,940
for some period of time.

604
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:45,310
It would be great if
that quarantine sub-net

605
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:47,983
looks exactly like our real network.

606
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:52,340
And then we can actually
watch the system in isolation

607
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:55,880
to see if it is in fact, a problem or not.

608
00:26:55,881 --> 00:26:59,240
We can deploy this in
terms of honeytokens.

609
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,860
The idea of a honeytoken is
the stuff that an adversary

610
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:04,219
would typically collect
in our environment,

611
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:06,100
just give it to them.

612
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:08,010
Now, the point of that
is that it actually makes

613
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:13,010
it so that it's easier for us
to detect the reuse of this.

614
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:16,332
As an example, if you're
suspicious of employees

615
00:27:16,332 --> 00:27:19,530
taking intellectual
property and sharing it

616
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:22,620
with other places you could
embed inside of the files

617
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:26,399
which contain your intellectual
property, unique tokens,

618
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:30,020
and those unique tokens
could then fingerprint back

619
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:34,050
to who took that intellectual
property and then shared it.

620
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:35,440
Maybe they didn't share it on purpose.

621
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,520
Maybe they were compromised.

622
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,460
Maybe their home system was compromised

623
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:41,160
where that information
was actually stored.

624
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,510
So this sort of honeytoken

625
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:45,577
is useful for our long-term tracking.

626
00:27:45,577 --> 00:27:47,590
If you look at the industry,

627
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:50,250
and the news associated
with large-scale breaches,

628
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:54,760
there is almost always some
aspect of credential reuse.

629
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:58,350
Guess what give them credentials to use.

630
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:59,310
And then detect them.

631
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:01,810
Don't give them credentials
that get them into good stuff

632
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:03,340
give them credentials that make it easy

633
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:06,189
for you to identify that
it's an adversary using that.

634
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:09,100
Go Pre-populate the, "Have I been poned?"

635
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,669
Space with fake tokens,

636
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:14,020
and see if people try to
log in with them, right?

637
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:17,430
And you could actually also
have high interaction honeypots

638
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:19,500
and low interaction
honeypots with a system

639
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:22,510
that the attacker is actually
going to interact with

640
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:24,520
and then you can monitor them.

641
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:27,010
From an analysis perspective we need tools

642
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:29,830
to help us to model and test
what we're dealing with.

643
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:33,000
We need spaces where we
can develop new rules

644
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,057
for our endpoint systems

645
00:28:34,057 --> 00:28:37,660
and our network detection
systems in our SIM.

646
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:41,930
We should also be able to
track change in the IT systems.

647
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:44,440
And we typically call this change control.

648
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:47,840
Now, you might have good
baselines, I hope you do.

649
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,980
But the idea of baselining a system

650
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,780
we also need technology to be
able to do that effectively

651
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:56,070
and then track the changes
to our baselines over time.

652
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:58,820
We also wanna be able to do analysis

653
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,907
of the indicators that we have

654
00:29:00,907 --> 00:29:03,679
and you might not like the IOC term,

655
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,710
that's kind of fallen out
of Vogue here recently,

656
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:07,360
so, whatever you call it,

657
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,610
in terms of specific elements of data,

658
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:12,030
related to things that
attackers are doing,

659
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:16,410
as you build those indicators,
as you develop them,

660
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:19,710
you should have a way that you
actually do that regularly.

661
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:21,090
And this tends to be done

662
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:23,510
on some sort of an isolated workstation.

663
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:25,060
So isolated workstations

664
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:27,060
for threat intelligence production,

665
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:29,974
isolated workstations
for forensic analysis,

666
00:29:29,974 --> 00:29:31,990
high-performance workstations

667
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:35,080
which have lots of RAM and
lots of hard drive space.

668
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:38,879
And the ability to process
lots of data simultaneously

669
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,710
with software, which is
specifically intended

670
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:43,900
to do that processing.

671
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:46,770
We also have vulnerability
management platforms

672
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:48,510
where we can do remediation tracking

673
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:51,600
and scanning of vulnerabilities
within our environment.

674
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,510
As we deal with a code quite frequently,

675
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:56,480
we wanna have disassemblers, and debuggers

676
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,940
and other tools of that sort,

677
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:01,990
in order to allow us to understand
what can that program do

678
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:04,540
from a static analysis perspective.

679
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:08,020
We might have simulators for our staff

680
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:09,610
in order to train them.

681
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:13,129
We might also have simulators
that we use in order to assess

682
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:16,693
and train our employees or
our constituents as well.

683
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,780
So I hope you got all that.

684
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,740
That's the technology taxonomy.

685
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:23,200
If you have thoughts on that,

686
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,560
hopefully you've been typing them

687
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,440
in the chat window while I've been going,

688
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,850
but if you have thoughts on that,

689
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:29,246
of, "Chris there's no way

690
00:30:29,247 --> 00:30:31,460
"that we could ever
buy all of this stuff."

691
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:33,830
Okay, I understand it, but
I'm not gonna sell you short

692
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:34,970
by giving you the short list.

693
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:36,167
And then you come back and say,

694
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:38,040
"Oh, well you forgot about
all these other things."

695
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,590
And if I forgot about something,

696
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:41,852
please, please put it in the chat window.

697
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:46,490
So, the technology thoughts
that I have at this point.

698
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:51,210
First of all, your
cybersecurity operation center

699
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:54,240
is the defense of the information assets.

700
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,360
And if your SOC does
not have the same level

701
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,344
of confidentiality, integrity,
and availability protections

702
00:31:00,345 --> 00:31:04,450
of the systems that
it's intended to defend,

703
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:06,250
you might encounter a problem.

704
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:08,000
If your adversary realizes

705
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,710
that your SOC systems are vulnerable,

706
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:15,490
a clever adversary would go
ahead and modify those systems.

707
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:18,790
So you're flying blind, but
you're not even aware of it.

708
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:20,360
A less clever adversary

709
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,199
would just knock those SOC systems out

710
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,210
while they went into attack.

711
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:26,330
So that you were aware that
you were blind at that time.

712
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:28,250
In terms of system administration,

713
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:29,780
you have to figure out
who's gonna take care

714
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:30,690
of all these tools.

715
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:32,910
I mean, if I'm asking you
for good availability,

716
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:34,760
integrity, and confidentiality,

717
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,440
that means solid systems administration.

718
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,260
I'm not gonna go too far
down the rabbit hole of this,

719
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:42,879
but I do wanna say that
a trend that I've noticed

720
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,000
is that a lot of people
are outsourcing this

721
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,020
'cause it's so hard to do effectively.

722
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:49,820
And it is so expensive
for many organizations.

723
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,830
Similarly, when I mentioned this early on,

724
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:53,550
is that we need some sort of a glue

725
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:55,889
to stitch the information together

726
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:59,650
between all of our disparate systems.

727
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:03,130
Now these systems, these
systems all have data

728
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:05,270
and I wanna be able to collect that data

729
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:06,720
into one central environment.

730
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,320
Or if I can't do that, I wanna
be able to go get that data

731
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,810
on an as-needed basis.

732
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:15,310
I wanna be able to make
configuration changes rapidly.

733
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:17,470
And I'd like to automate
a lot of that stuff.

734
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:22,470
So the ability to integrate
between disparate systems

735
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:27,023
has frequently been the
area of actual scripting.

736
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:30,480
And so scripting is a good way to do that,

737
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,230
you might also then hire
professional services

738
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:34,270
to help you with this.

739
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:36,117
You might lock yourself in, by saying,

740
00:32:36,117 --> 00:32:38,267
"We've decided on this particular SIM,

741
00:32:38,267 --> 00:32:39,877
"and we will only use tools

742
00:32:39,877 --> 00:32:41,897
"which effectively
integrate with that SIM.

743
00:32:41,897 --> 00:32:44,197
"Or this ticketing system,
or that network IDS

744
00:32:44,197 --> 00:32:46,449
"or this endpoint protection."

745
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:48,320
It doesn't matter how
you lock yourself in,

746
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,000
but we actually decide
to do this frequently.

747
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,120
And then the last thing,

748
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,550
and I know it's a bit of a buzzword,

749
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:56,300
but the SOR tools are actually intended

750
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,530
to solve this problem.

751
00:32:57,530 --> 00:32:59,460
And they're like scripting with,

752
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:00,940
what you see is what you get

753
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:04,400
overlay on top of it with a
whole bunch of standard plays

754
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,773
already built for you.

755
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:09,027
And of course now you need to decide,

756
00:33:09,027 --> 00:33:11,557
"Hey, where am I gonna
host all this stuff?"

757
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,380
So, various locations globally,

758
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:16,010
you might need to buy 10 of these

759
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:17,629
and deploy them all over the place.

760
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:20,460
You also need to consider if
you're gonna share your toys,

761
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:23,630
your tools with your IT teams, right?

762
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:28,420
Your technology is actually
probably really useful to them.

763
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:32,500
And you expect them to give
them their data to you.

764
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:35,740
You might also consider
sharing your tools with them.

765
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:37,800
So, how do you use this?

766
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,970
One thing that I'd like
you to consider doing

767
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:43,970
is be skeptical of your own confidence

768
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:46,860
in knowing all the tools that
are actually in your SOC.

769
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,000
You might know them all.

770
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,810
Does everybody in your SOC know this?

771
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:52,950
And so I have some videos about
how I advocate for hunting.

772
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:56,190
And the first thing that
I suggest as a hunt,

773
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:58,774
is to hunt your own tools.

774
00:33:58,774 --> 00:34:02,129
And so this actually drives
the notion of hunting

775
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:05,210
as a skeptical and creative practice.

776
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:08,100
It also is intended to get
everybody on the same page

777
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:12,679
to understand that this
is what we do for hunting.

778
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:15,960
And hunting your own tools, I
should have everybody come up

779
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,350
with the same results
and have that be 100%

780
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:21,569
across everybody agreeing on the hunt.

781
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:23,679
So, after you've done that

782
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:28,000
and gotten to some sense of
agreement across all your staff

783
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,280
I would like you to take this taxonomy,

784
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,120
modify it to suit your purposes,

785
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,480
or just start with the whole list,

786
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,810
and then say we should get a tool

787
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:39,830
because we do this thing all the time.

788
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:43,049
And this particular tool
would make us more efficient

789
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:45,010
in doing that thing.

790
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:47,989
That's a great selection
criteria for technology.

791
00:34:47,989 --> 00:34:50,919
Similarly, you can actually
take the MITRE ATT&CK framework

792
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,580
do a defensive gap
analysis on those things

793
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:56,810
where you're confident in
being able to do detection,

794
00:34:56,810 --> 00:35:00,250
crosswalk it with what the
MITRE ATT&CK framework says

795
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:04,770
about specific threat actors
who are targeting people

796
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:07,509
in organizations in your industry

797
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:10,980
and then use the MITRE evaluations,

798
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:15,980
which sites which tools are
effective at specific behaviors

799
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:19,320
and then select technology based on that.

800
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,950
It's a great way to use
this taxonomy, right?

801
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:25,109
The combination of the
MITRE ATT&CK evaluations

802
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:28,010
with a long list of specific technologies

803
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:31,760
and the vendor information
associated with that,

804
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,300
that's a great approach to this.

805
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:36,070
And some of you might
actually have a consideration

806
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:37,447
where you can say, "You know what?

807
00:35:37,447 --> 00:35:41,107
"He says, this is all the
stuff, we've got 80% of that,

808
00:35:41,107 --> 00:35:42,550
"let's just go buy it."

809
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:43,830
And there are actually some SOCs

810
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:45,880
in the world that will do that.

811
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,019
Now, I don't think that
that's the best approach

812
00:35:48,019 --> 00:35:52,060
but if you're that big of a
security operation center,

813
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:53,400
having one of everything,

814
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,530
is actually not an unreasonable idea

815
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:57,690
because there might be a specific instance

816
00:35:57,690 --> 00:36:00,240
where a given technology is perfect

817
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,350
for that particular case.

818
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:06,130
And one of the thing about
technology, it's all broken.

819
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:09,810
It all falls apart in given circumstances,

820
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:11,299
much of it is vulnerable

821
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,410
in ways that we don't yet understand.

822
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:16,493
So having a backup tool is
actually a pretty good plan.

823
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:21,433
Having a plan is what I
really want you to have.

824
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,330
This long list is intended to help you

825
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:26,509
to facilitate building plan.

826
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:28,990
There are amazing tools that are out there

827
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:31,910
astounding tools that
do incredible things.

828
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:33,930
But there's a global scourge

829
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:36,569
of partially deployed tools, right?

830
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:39,660
Tools purchased without actually
ever getting implemented.

831
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:41,379
That's kind of sad, really.

832
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:43,920
And so, what I would like you to do

833
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,050
to take away from this
talk, is to basically think

834
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:51,070
about your strategic
vision of those things

835
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:53,950
that you want to deploy
in your environment,

836
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:55,310
and how you're gonna do it.

837
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:58,250
So, I'll remind you of the action items.

838
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:00,240
Right now put it in the chat window.

839
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,220
If you can remember all
the things that I said

840
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:04,442
what did I miss?

841
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:07,060
That'd be great, I'd love to hear that.

842
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:09,450
I'll just absorb it into the
taxonomy and move forward

843
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:11,669
and share it with other
people in an updated version.

844
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:13,860
If you wanna have credit,
I'll include that.

845
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:17,640
If you think this list is too
long, tell me why I'm curious

846
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:22,440
this is something that I've
obstructed across years of work.

847
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,230
And if you think that I'm
wrong with this approach,

848
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:27,563
I would actually love
to hear that criticism.

849
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,470
I would then like you to take this

850
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:33,709
and consider is this
the right list for me?

851
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:37,170
I actually have a spreadsheet
that I share publicly

852
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:39,010
for this list, right?

853
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:41,403
And you can take it and
adapt it to your needs.

854
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:44,649
So, I'd like you to start
with what's right for me

855
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:47,150
and the functions that I
actually need to perform?

856
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:50,510
And then I want you to take
that list of shortcomings

857
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:54,370
and use a threat intelligence
informed criteria

858
00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:58,319
for selecting what technology
will solve problems for you.

859
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,060
These might be efficiency problems.

860
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:03,110
These might be problems that
you think you know what?

861
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:05,193
No technology will solve this for me.

862
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:09,630
I don't need technology
to solve these problems,

863
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:11,210
but I do have some technology

864
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:13,650
that'll solve those coverage problems.

865
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:16,380
And then I want you to going forward,

866
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:18,940
buy your tools in a way
where you really understand

867
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:20,290
how you're gonna deploy that,

868
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:22,460
on the systems where it matters.

869
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:25,730
And so with that, I want
to thank you for your time.
