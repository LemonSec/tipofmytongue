1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,550
- Welcome everyone, or should I say

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:05,050
good morning, good
afternoon, good evening,

3
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:06,220
and maybe even good night.

4
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:08,039
This is the first time the RSA Conferences

5
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:10,020
hosted college day virtually,

6
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:11,799
so for you that are around the globe,

7
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,400
we welcome you, and we're grateful

8
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,540
that you are showing up here today.

9
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,369
We're excited to talk to
the future cyber warriors.

10
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:21,110
I've got some excellent
veterans behind me.

11
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:23,530
I'd like to take just one
second to tell a little plug

12
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:26,410
for RSA Conference, which
is in its 30th year,

13
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:28,980
probably older than most of you actually.

14
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,990
But RSA Conference started
30 years ago to talk

15
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:34,470
about all the pressing
problems that were happening

16
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,490
in cybersecurity, and it has only grown,

17
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:38,640
from the 44 people where we started,

18
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,060
to where we are today.

19
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:41,840
It's at the intersection of business,

20
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,850
technology, academia, and nonprofits.

21
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,068
This morning, we are so blessed to be

22
00:00:47,068 --> 00:00:50,199
to have an incredible panel of CISOs.

23
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,069
From people from the media sector,

24
00:00:53,069 --> 00:00:56,260
from the technology sector,
and from the defense sector.

25
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:57,669
And they all have different perspectives,

26
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:59,180
and they're here to share them.

27
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:01,220
What I'd like to do is
just ask you to go ahead

28
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:04,959
and put any of your comments
and questions into the chat.

29
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:08,750
Please observe our code of
conduct, and let's get started.

30
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,370
So to get us started, to kick us off,

31
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:13,130
I'd like to turn it over to John Skimoni

32
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:15,699
and just talk about,
John why cybersecurity?

33
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,800
And where do you see the jobs going today?

34
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:22,890
- Cybersecurity, because
it's probably the most fun

35
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,900
and challenging and satisfying
profession on the planet.

36
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:28,360
You know, usually you can
pick one of those three,

37
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,080
maybe two, but not all three,

38
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,039
but cyber security is all three.

39
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,070
And then, you know, as a
bonus, it pays pretty decent,

40
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,490
and people need and value it,
and there's job opportunities.

41
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:41,729
So it's probably 15 different
reasons to get into cyber.

42
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:43,520
You know, for me personally, ironically,

43
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,979
many of those things,
weren't the case back

44
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,010
many years ago when I
started in the profession,

45
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:50,250
it wasn't actually even
really a profession,

46
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,867
but I still, at the time, found it fun

47
00:01:51,867 --> 00:01:53,230
and had a passion for it,

48
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:56,211
and that's why I pursued it to begin with.

49
00:01:56,211 --> 00:01:58,890
- You know, before we
actually pass on the mic,

50
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:01,011
I forgot to say that
you should also mention

51
00:02:01,011 --> 00:02:03,630
where you're working from,
but the good news is,

52
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:06,679
right behind you is a great
advertisement for the company,

53
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,539
but I figured you should
just throw in your title.

54
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:09,979
So when we get to the
other two, so go ahead,

55
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:12,301
John, can you please provide your title,

56
00:02:12,301 --> 00:02:13,482
and the company as well?

57
00:02:13,483 --> 00:02:15,380
- Yeah. I was gonna say my branding team

58
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,420
would not allow me to have you get away

59
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,850
with not knowing where
I'm currently sitting,

60
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:21,970
but I do work for Dell Technologies.

61
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:23,430
I'm the Chief Security Officer here,

62
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,510
and I've had the privilege of being

63
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,510
in that role for about the last 4 years.

64
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,330
- Excellent.

65
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:33,160
Mike, you share a little
bit about where you work?

66
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,859
Even though people might not recognize

67
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,073
your background either.

68
00:02:37,469 --> 00:02:40,203
- Yes, good old overt, right?

69
00:02:40,203 --> 00:02:43,130
So, Mike Gordon, I'm the Chief
Information Security Officer

70
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:44,523
for Lockheed Martin.

71
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,579
- And can you talk a little bit about

72
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:51,303
what you see is the job
market in cybersecurity today?

73
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:55,680
- Oh, I think the job
market is endless right now.

74
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,360
There are jobs everywhere
in cybersecurity,

75
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,950
and I think there's something
for everybody in this field,

76
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:06,640
and I think a lot of
folks can get intimidated

77
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,390
by cybersecurity because there's a lot

78
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:11,944
of really hardcore ones and zeros people,

79
00:03:11,944 --> 00:03:14,429
you know, reverse engineering, malware,

80
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:17,050
you know, offense and
defense kind of capabilities.

81
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:20,420
And we tend to, I'm gonna be
the man of many hats today,

82
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:24,209
So we tend to look for the
unicorns in this field, right?

83
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:27,483
These people who are able
to do just about everything,

84
00:03:27,483 --> 00:03:30,540
but that's not really,
really the case, right?

85
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:33,260
I think there's a lot of
different skills and specialties,

86
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:36,820
and we need people who are good at IT.

87
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:39,180
And I think we need people
who are good at governance,

88
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,390
risk compliance, policies,
and just understanding

89
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:44,177
the world around us, so
that we can, you know,

90
00:03:44,177 --> 00:03:46,852
defend our corporations
and defend our nation.

91
00:03:48,231 --> 00:03:49,210
- That is great, Mike!

92
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:51,020
And I don't even know how
you're gonna top that, Andrea,

93
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,640
but I'm gonna turn the
question over to you.

94
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,760
Can you share a little bit about yourself?

95
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,390
And then maybe talk
about, like, the training

96
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:59,920
that's happening for
cybersecurity professionals?

97
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,690
What's the spectrum?

98
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:04,480
- Okay. So my name is Andrea Abel.

99
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,140
I am the least impressive background,

100
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:10,732
but I work for a media
company, NBC Universal.

101
00:04:10,733 --> 00:04:13,090
Our company wears a lot of hats,

102
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:16,829
you know us for Saturday
Night Live broadcasts,

103
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:18,320
but we also do theme parks,

104
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:23,320
so Universal Studios,
Sports Engine, Fandango,

105
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,438
you name it, NBC universal probably

106
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:30,080
is involved and invested.

107
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,979
So it means my job is never dull,

108
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:36,883
just like Mike and John's
is equally never dull.

109
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:40,540
You know, I think I may take the question

110
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,313
a little different from training.

111
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:45,989
I am maybe the person on the panel,

112
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:49,150
I didn't set out to have
a career in cybersecurity.

113
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:51,669
I think like John said, it
wasn't really a career path

114
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:54,267
when I graduated from college,

115
00:04:54,267 --> 00:04:58,290
but I've always loved
solving tough problems.

116
00:04:58,290 --> 00:04:59,750
And actually that's how I got involved.

117
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:02,950
There was a tough problem
and I got brought in.

118
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:05,310
And I think, when you think about

119
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,790
how you've grown your career,

120
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:10,370
or how you've been training,
there is a lot out there now.

121
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:14,207
There's so much more than when
I started out in the field.

122
00:05:14,207 --> 00:05:16,440
But I'll tell you the thing that I think

123
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:20,520
both helps me feel energized,

124
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,960
and keeps me wanting
to do cybersecurity is,

125
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,510
you know, I will say I credit Mike Gordon

126
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,909
for my, part of my development.

127
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:31,970
You know, sitting at the table with people

128
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:33,740
who are so smart and passionate,

129
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:36,610
and when you will all want to
solve a challenge together,

130
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:38,930
that type of on-the-job training,

131
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:41,600
being willing to ask questions, dive in,

132
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,600
and take a chance, and
then make a difference.

133
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,800
That's right. The man of many hats.

134
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,700
He did not do that at the table

135
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,647
when we were sitting there before.

136
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,645
So normally he wore one hat,

137
00:05:52,645 --> 00:05:54,339
(Andrea laughs)

138
00:05:54,339 --> 00:05:56,610
but that, at the end of the day,

139
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:58,410
cyber is the ultimate team sport.

140
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:00,400
And if you're willing to come in,

141
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,830
and bring your knowledge,
right, to the table today,

142
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,849
and then figure out
what you want to learn,

143
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:08,060
and then you can start
to pursue it through

144
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,240
you want to learn more about Cloud?

145
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,700
Go to a Cloud guru, right?

146
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,469
Their training programs are great.

147
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:14,330
The SANS training is amazing.

148
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:17,000
And then companies have
rotational programs,

149
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,810
and I'm sure we'll talk about those later,

150
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:21,380
but I think the idea of being willing

151
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,700
to throw your hat in the ring, I guess,

152
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:27,159
is what I will say is the best training

153
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,490
for a cybersecurity professional.

154
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:30,780
- Yeah. Hey Andrea, I'll just add in,

155
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,359
it's really been a privilege to work

156
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,950
with folks like Andrea, and John and

157
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:36,210
I think as folks get into this field,

158
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:38,623
we realize it is a very
tight-knit community.

159
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:41,810
You know, every company
needs cyber people,

160
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:43,130
unfortunately there's not a whole lot

161
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:44,350
of cyber people in the world,

162
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:46,510
so there tends to be
about one or two degrees

163
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:49,909
of separation and we all
know each other pretty well.

164
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,500
And that is a great thing
too, is building the network,

165
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,510
and building the relationships,
and comparing notes.

166
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:57,190
I mean the three of us worked for

167
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:59,330
three incredibly different companies,

168
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:01,390
but we face a common problem,

169
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:04,027
and those are, you know,
adversaries who are really,

170
00:07:04,027 --> 00:07:06,669
really intent on breaking
into our businesses,

171
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:08,070
for different reasons.

172
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:10,390
And the skills that people can bring

173
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:12,849
to help fend them off are endless.

174
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:15,560
So it is a privilege
to work with you guys.

175
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,910
- Yeah. And I like the team analogy too,

176
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:20,430
because it does get into the notion that

177
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:22,130
it's an active role, I mean,

178
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:24,390
there's very few professions where

179
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:27,419
you can compete and win, or
you can compete and lose.

180
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:29,700
You know, it's like, just
like if you all play sports,

181
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:33,030
most people play sports
for pleasure and, you know,

182
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:35,729
dream about playing sports
to get, you know, paid,

183
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:38,709
and do it professionally,
and 99% of people can't.

184
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:39,930
You know, cybersecurity is very similar.

185
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,790
I mean, we all play against the same team.

186
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:43,350
You know, it's literally
the same hacking groups

187
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:45,380
potentially hacking into
each of our companies,

188
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,520
highly competitive, it's highly complex,

189
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,349
it's highly challenging, but
it can be super rewarding,

190
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:52,380
you know, when you band together

191
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:55,290
and actually do effectively against some

192
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:56,900
of these challenges,
which are really important

193
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,640
to not just our companies, but you know,

194
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,820
the customers we support,

195
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,993
which represent a broad swath of society.

196
00:08:02,937 --> 00:08:04,270
- I think that's so fascinating,

197
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:05,370
that all three of you mentioned

198
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:07,800
A, team playing, and B,
that this is a network,

199
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,070
and that you have to build.

200
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:12,110
And what I want, what
I'd love for you to do

201
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:14,080
is to just share a little bit more about

202
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,150
you know, this market has changed.

203
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:19,739
The number of people in
this industry has changed.

204
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,720
How do you actually build this,

205
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,670
how do you actually build your network?

206
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:29,430
- Well, I think all of us
probably have similar approaches,

207
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:32,500
but there's a limited number
of experts in this field,

208
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,640
even today, and the field's
probably 10 years old.

209
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,630
And so, I think we tend
to take an approach of

210
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:43,809
train the trainer and we
take chances on hiring folks,

211
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:45,492
in Lockheed, based on
how they think, right?

212
00:08:45,493 --> 00:08:48,340
That was my original purpose
of my, "how" hat, right?

213
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:51,850
It's really, how do you
address tough problems?

214
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:53,630
And so we tend to interview people,

215
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:55,880
and we're looking for
that analytical mindset,

216
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,300
not so much detailed overt
knowledge about cybersecurity,

217
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:03,020
because I mean, I think the
college world has evolved.

218
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:03,853
There was no such thing,

219
00:09:03,853 --> 00:09:05,349
I think I can speak for John and Andrea,

220
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:06,850
none of us had any,
there was no such thing

221
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:09,480
as a cyber course when we were in college.

222
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,070
There wasn't even such
a thing as cyber, right?

223
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:14,210
And so, many of us have all come

224
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:16,630
from different walks of
life, and different careers,

225
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:19,197
and learned the skill
because of that, you know,

226
00:09:19,197 --> 00:09:21,410
"how" thinking, "how do
I solve this problem?"

227
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:23,439
And so we tend to look for that,

228
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,560
and we tend to try to
grow a talent pipeline

229
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:29,430
from early career professionals
into senior professionals,

230
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:31,709
and then, you know,
supplement that if we can,

231
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:34,000
by hiring an occasional expert,

232
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,340
but there's only a few
of them to go around,

233
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,590
and it's a very competitive
market for today.

234
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,110
- Yeah. So I'll piggyback off Mike.

235
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:44,410
I think, you know, what
you're talking about,

236
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:45,420
building your network,

237
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,910
I think there's lots of things,

238
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:49,430
and maybe you're not sure
you want to be in cyber,

239
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:51,250
you know, you're still figuring out

240
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,070
what that career path is.

241
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,960
You know, any company that offers a type

242
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,499
of rotation where you can rotate in,

243
00:09:57,499 --> 00:09:59,330
I want, at the end of the day,

244
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:02,180
if I can get anyone who
works at NBC Universal

245
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:05,819
to think a little bit more
about cyber, it helps us.

246
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:09,280
So I will say, you know, I will,

247
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,980
I welcome those rotational opportunities.

248
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:14,090
And I would encourage
you, if you get a chance,

249
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:15,640
it helps you understand the business,

250
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,430
which makes you a better
cyber professional also.

251
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:20,140
So that idea of being able to rotate,

252
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:23,340
and really think through,
and then from a cyber,

253
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:26,020
like a leadership perspective,
I want to, you know,

254
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:29,050
develop as many advocates
and champions as I can.

255
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:31,109
So even if you don't end up in cyber,

256
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:34,010
I want you to always
have cyber on your brain.

257
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:36,830
And when all else fails, I'm not ashamed

258
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:41,180
to bribe people via happy
hours or fun activities.

259
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:43,250
So, you know, that's, when you talk about

260
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:45,090
building your network,
it's about being willing

261
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:47,780
to go out, and not
share, you know, details,

262
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,819
but talk about those common problems,

263
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:53,820
and items, and share those, and build up.

264
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:57,560
And there's all sorts of groups and both,

265
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,369
you know, in-person, and, you know,

266
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:02,460
they went a little bit
online over the past year,

267
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,320
but, I will say, just that idea

268
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,230
of being willing to share your experiences

269
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:09,310
with a group and open up to all of that,

270
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:12,949
those are all great ways to,
not only build your network,

271
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:16,263
but, you know, you learn
a lot in the process too.

272
00:11:17,821 --> 00:11:20,890
- It's not directly, not
directly related to networking,

273
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:22,620
but I think Mike hit on,
or started to hit on,

274
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,870
a really key point that relates to a topic

275
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:28,250
I get a lot of questions on
as I talk to college students,

276
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:31,350
or those entry-level professionals,

277
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:33,930
and it's, you know,
what skills do you need?

278
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:36,979
And what, you know, what
knowledge is most important?

279
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,710
And what Mike said is super important.

280
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:39,850
I mean, it may be the most important thing

281
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:41,600
you'll hear in this session.

282
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,170
You know, it's really
about attitude, aptitude,

283
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:47,240
and as you think about
where to spend your time

284
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,230
in potentially preparing
for a cybersecurity career,

285
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:51,260
be really thoughtful about
what you're learning,

286
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:53,939
and what is perishable, versus
what's going to be lasting.

287
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,510
Because a lot of times, you
might get a certification

288
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:59,380
or a class in how to run
this specific vendor's tool

289
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:02,970
to do this specific function,
you know, like tool X,

290
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:05,840
you know, and how to scan a
network for vulnerabilities.

291
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,640
And, you know, those skills
are important in the near term,

292
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,110
and they are tangible and
real, but at the same time,

293
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:13,070
the things that are lasting are, you know,

294
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:14,750
the knowledge and the
experience you might gain

295
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,687
around why is vulnerability
scanning important?

296
00:12:16,687 --> 00:12:19,190
You know, what's that tool actually doing?

297
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:21,280
And it may be a totally
different experience,

298
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,120
even five years from now, how
you do vulnerability scanning,

299
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,230
but did you truly learn the
essence of that function?

300
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:29,610
Or did you really just
learn how to run a tool?

301
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:31,460
And so it's a little bit
nuanced, but thinking

302
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,080
about the skills and
knowledge that you're gaining,

303
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,420
and really focusing on
trying to gain skills

304
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,961
and knowledge and, importantly experience,

305
00:12:37,961 --> 00:12:40,760
that isn't going to be perishable
because, in particular,

306
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,702
this industry is changing and
moving at such a fast rate

307
00:12:43,702 --> 00:12:46,182
that you can be an expert
today in something,

308
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,620
and you know, a year and
a half from now, you know,

309
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:51,060
your knowledge is completely irrelevant.

310
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,130
And so that's just a really
important concept, I think,

311
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:54,730
as you think about what classes to take,

312
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:56,650
what certifications to pursue,

313
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,110
and certainly us as hiring managers,

314
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,300
those are some of the elements
that we're considering

315
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,459
when we look at the resume,

316
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:03,880
and then, more importantly,
beyond the resume,

317
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,760
at how you learn, how you problem solve,

318
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,350
and how lasting that's
gonna be in contributing

319
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:10,857
to a role with any of our companies.

320
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,579
- One of the things that I've talked

321
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:18,860
to all of you about, I
mean, Dell Technologies

322
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:21,630
and Lockheed are obvious
picks for cybersecurity

323
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:23,710
but NBC Universal, like you were talking

324
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:26,710
about at the beginning,
Andrea, is very different.

325
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:28,830
And you kind of don't realize this,

326
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:31,100
as Mike hit on the very first point,

327
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,610
is that this is now cybersecurity

328
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:34,470
is in every facet of our lives,

329
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:36,440
we've become more interconnected,

330
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,560
but the weird part is, like,

331
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,530
how do you find out about going

332
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:41,699
into places that are not traditional,

333
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:45,070
or easy fits, like a technology company?

334
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:47,520
How do you find out about those groups

335
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,733
and how do you start to look
for the jobs in those markets?

336
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:56,390
- So, you know, I'll
start and just say that,

337
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:59,080
you know, I think John
maybe said, you know,

338
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,530
earlier that cybersecurity
is a shared problem.

339
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:04,339
There isn't an industry or a company

340
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,273
that doesn't have the issue.

341
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:12,120
And so, you know, I will,
I'll be the first to say

342
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,700
I wasn't necessarily
someone who was out looking.

343
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,710
I was, my heritage is
from Lockheed Martin.

344
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:20,430
I'm a very proud of that heritage.

345
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:23,540
I wasn't looking to leave.
An opportunity came.

346
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:27,319
And the opportunity that
presented itself was,

347
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,620
you know, we have this company here,

348
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,790
and we want to transform, and we realize

349
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:33,599
that we need to address the threat.

350
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,870
It is in front of us,

351
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:37,660
and we have to go through, I mean,

352
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:41,550
when you think about it,
adversaries, you know,

353
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:46,550
we see that E-crime has grown
exponentially lately, right?

354
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,470
That attack's regardless of your industry.

355
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:53,480
But we also have, you know,
varied areas of interest

356
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,880
in terms of, you know, news reporters.

357
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,370
You think about the election cycle,

358
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:59,460
as things have gone through.

359
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,500
There's a lot of threats that
you may not think through,

360
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,090
and so I think when you
begin to talk to companies,

361
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:06,678
you start to realize the, you know,

362
00:15:06,678 --> 00:15:09,780
what they have worth protecting.

363
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,800
And most companies aren't
gonna be in business

364
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,810
if they don't have
something worth protecting.

365
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:16,349
And I think that's where,
you know, the idea,

366
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,810
especially, you know, I'm so proud

367
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:20,130
of my Lockheed heritage
because of things like

368
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:22,830
the Cyber Kill Chain and
Intelligence Driven Defense,

369
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:24,620
and then those have further expanded

370
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,750
and become, you know, the
MITRE ATT&CK framework,

371
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,410
and things like that, that we all can use

372
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:31,000
and have that common
vocabulary, even though we

373
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,940
bring different business challenges to it.

374
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:36,180
Different business approach,
different, you know,

375
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,729
legacy environments,
greenfield environments,

376
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,820
and all of that, and
that's part of the dynamics

377
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:43,110
that make everyone's
job really interesting.

378
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:46,270
So, you know, I would
just say that there is no,

379
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:49,460
there are very few places
that can say they have no need

380
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:54,460
for security or cybersecurity,
but I think the attack

381
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:56,320
surface varies the type, you know,

382
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,390
the exact nature of, you know,

383
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:01,370
how frequently you see
threats, and the type of it.

384
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:05,970
But there's more commonality
than you may anticipate.

385
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:09,400
- Yeah, you know, I'll chime
in on that Cecilia and Andrea,

386
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,520
but I think the interesting
thing now, as Andrea said,

387
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:15,340
is every company needs
cybersecurity professionals, right?

388
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:18,720
So find an industry that
you're interested in.

389
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,490
I work in Lockheed
because I was interested

390
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:22,830
in airplanes and aerospace, right?

391
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:24,700
And I came into the company as an engineer

392
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:25,870
to design stealth fighters,

393
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:27,360
and I did that for a little while,

394
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,240
and I ended up in this
field of cybersecurity,

395
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,690
and so it's just really cool for me

396
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,680
to be a cyber defender for the things

397
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,430
that I was interested
in in the first place.

398
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:37,020
But if you're interested in the law?

399
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:39,069
Go find a law firm, and
work in cybersecurity there.

400
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:40,200
If you're interested in the media?

401
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,780
Go work for NBC or a firm like that one.

402
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:45,350
If you like IT and
technology, go talk to John.

403
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:47,417
But I think if you find the
field that you're interested in,

404
00:16:47,417 --> 00:16:49,560
and the industry that
you're interested in,

405
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,229
then that will help you
want to stay passionate

406
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:54,670
about what you're doing,
and you'll be passionate

407
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:57,963
as a network defender,
defending that enterprise.

408
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:02,637
- So I'm gonna ask John
a quick question about,

409
00:17:02,637 --> 00:17:04,810
you know, a lot of times, oftentimes,

410
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:06,970
students are coming in,
and they don't necessarily

411
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:08,800
know how to put their skills to something

412
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,919
that translates to what you know,

413
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,327
or what you're looking for.

414
00:17:12,327 --> 00:17:16,859
Can you give some tips
and ideas around, like,

415
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:19,880
we heard Andrea talking
about problem solving,

416
00:17:19,881 --> 00:17:20,930
and creative thinking, you know,

417
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:23,190
those are, kind of, very big words.

418
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:24,710
How can you actually prove that?

419
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,760
If you're in college right now,

420
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,480
what should students be doing to actually

421
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,820
get their resume ready for you to see it,

422
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,683
and you to like what you see?

423
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:37,090
- Yeah. I mean I think
demonstrated experience

424
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:38,100
is important.

425
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,070
So there's a difference between, you know,

426
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:42,840
learning a skill, or acquiring
a piece of knowledge,

427
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,080
and actually using it,
and proving that you know

428
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:48,379
how to use, and apply
yourself, in a meaningful way.

429
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:50,670
And, you know, you can do
that without any money.

430
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,521
You can even do that
without any education.

431
00:17:52,521 --> 00:17:53,950
You know, I know people that have started,

432
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:55,990
you know, built networks
in their basement,

433
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:58,050
and created their own little, you know,

434
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:01,450
hacking platforms and, you
know, set up hacking teams.

435
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:02,530
I mean, what's really cool,

436
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:05,100
I think a lot of colleges
and clubs even have

437
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,010
like hacking teams now
where you can do things

438
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:10,129
in legal ways to learn how
to hack, learn how to defend.

439
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,580
Just getting that
experience and showcasing

440
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:15,780
your problem solving,
your analytical skills

441
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,899
in a meaningful experiential way.

442
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,310
I think it's important.

443
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:21,340
One other thing I'd call out.

444
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,189
I mean, what was just discussed

445
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:23,800
in the prior question, I think is amazing.

446
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,530
I mean, we're one of
these professions where

447
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:29,840
you can apply your skills in just

448
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,060
the most diverse set of
circumstances possible.

449
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:35,830
So like for me, I used to work
for the defense department.

450
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:38,199
I worked and, got to see, and you know,

451
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,700
get on like planes and subs
and all these amazing things.

452
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,460
It was crazy. Then I went to Sony,

453
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,669
and I was on like a Hollywood
studio around movie stars

454
00:18:44,669 --> 00:18:46,910
and seeing how the
entertainment industry works.

455
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:49,250
Now I'm working for a
technology company, you know,

456
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,790
seeing how we just
transform companies' lives

457
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:54,040
with technology and data, but I'm still

458
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,540
doing essentially the same job,

459
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:58,659
and applying the same knowledge,
skills, and experience,

460
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:01,270
but I'm impacting the world
in totally different ways.

461
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:03,400
What's cool is the inverse
is also true, right?

462
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:07,300
So cybersecurity needs
a wide and diverse array

463
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,750
of skill to actually, successfully achieve

464
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,540
cybersecurity programs' goals.

465
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:14,010
Like, we need lawyers,
we need communicators,

466
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:16,450
we need finance people,
we need project managers.

467
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:17,880
We need all of these different types

468
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,800
of trades and skillsets that aren't,

469
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:23,270
in their, at their core
cybersecurity specific,

470
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:26,139
but we have blended
professionals, as I call them,

471
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:28,070
across the team where, you know,

472
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:30,820
a large percentage of our cyber warriors,

473
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:32,580
their skills and
experience that they gain,

474
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,110
sometimes even their passion, may not be

475
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:36,651
the cyber piece of it,
but they're helping cyber,

476
00:19:36,652 --> 00:19:39,590
and our group, achieve our goals because,

477
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:40,959
again, we need policy writers,

478
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,470
we need all these different skillsets.

479
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:44,950
And so, again, that
misperception that you have

480
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:47,060
to be highly technical to
get into cybersecurity,

481
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,629
or you really have to be
into the ones and zeros,

482
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:50,880
isn't true, and so I just think

483
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,550
having that broader perspective
is pretty foundational.

484
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:56,260
And again, the field,
the field needs people.

485
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,930
I mean, we have millions more jobs

486
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,360
than actually people to fill them.

487
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,840
So that's an important data point

488
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,993
that we shouldn't lose
sight of in the session.

489
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:05,800
- Yeah. John, I just
wanna piggyback on that.

490
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,649
We actually had an entry-level person

491
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:08,940
who was trained as a journalist.

492
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,960
They did have some background,

493
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,910
but came in, and was
just really interested,

494
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:18,490
but her research skills
really enabled her to come in,

495
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:21,260
and learn how to do threat
modeling, and different,

496
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,560
and so she took a skill
that doesn't, you know,

497
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:26,200
when someone says you're
trained as a journalist,

498
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,597
it doesn't naturally make you think,

499
00:20:27,597 --> 00:20:30,260
"Oh yeah, you're a perfect
fit for cybersecurity,"

500
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:33,210
but she came in and became
a security engineer.

501
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:35,250
And so I, you know, I
just want to, you know,

502
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:39,210
there is no limit, and I
think it's that curiosity,

503
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:41,270
and willingness to
learn, and ask questions,

504
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,620
and open yourself up to that.

505
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:45,350
So I do think there is
that, you know, exactly,

506
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:47,879
there is no, there's nothing
that should rule you out,

507
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,050
other than than your own
willingness to dig in,

508
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:53,600
and ask questions, and learn.

509
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,469
- Yeah, I agree.

510
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:57,200
And, you know, getting that
first job can be tough.

511
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,700
You know, I'm in an
interesting spot right now.

512
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:01,720
I've got a son who has got
one more year of school,

513
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,110
and so we're working on his resume,

514
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:05,810
and this is high school,
and before college,

515
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:08,659
but you know a high school
resume and a college resume,

516
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,050
they're not that much different, right?

517
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:12,010
There's not a whole lot of real life

518
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:14,950
job experience in there, and so I think

519
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:18,390
it's important to emphasize
your interest and your desires.

520
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:20,230
Let that passion come through

521
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:22,760
when you're putting yourself
on paper in a resume,

522
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,080
or coming out in an
interview and, you know,

523
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,746
demonstrating that you are
very interested in the field.

524
00:21:27,747 --> 00:21:30,550
You know, certainly folks that we hire

525
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:32,810
as early professionals are, you know,

526
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:35,017
we find the ones who seem to
be interested at nighttime,

527
00:21:35,017 --> 00:21:36,290
"What are you doing in the evening?"

528
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:37,889
You know, "I'm building servers,

529
00:21:38,878 --> 00:21:41,010
and I'm trying to, you
know, secure this or that

530
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:43,220
on my home network" or whatever it may be,

531
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,900
and there was a couple
of questions, I think,

532
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,910
that have fit this broader
question in the Zoom

533
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:48,203
chat, Cecilia.

534
00:21:48,203 --> 00:21:49,168
- Yep.

535
00:21:49,169 --> 00:21:50,002
- So we had a question
from George on, you know,

536
00:21:50,002 --> 00:21:53,116
how valuable are certifications early on?

537
00:21:53,116 --> 00:21:55,030
And I think different answers
from different people,

538
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:56,734
you'll get on that one.

539
00:21:56,734 --> 00:22:01,250
For me, I think if you have
a technical certification

540
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:03,980
early on, that you're a
certified ethical hacker,

541
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:08,550
or you've got some kind of
hands-on keyboard certificate,

542
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:10,010
that gives you a little bit of an edge

543
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:12,240
when you don't have any
career experience, right?

544
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,020
It kind of as I was saying
before, it demonstrates

545
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,700
that you had some passion for that,

546
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:19,196
and that you took some
initiative to go learn it.

547
00:22:19,196 --> 00:22:20,860
A little bit of a longer answer is,

548
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:22,651
the day-to-day on the job.

549
00:22:22,652 --> 00:22:24,740
It doesn't help that much, right?

550
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:27,380
But I think it helps you
get in the door early on.

551
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,010
There are, sometimes there's requirements

552
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:31,250
in certain DOD spaces
and government spaces,

553
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:33,440
you need to have certain
certifications, but,

554
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,545
for the most part, I
think it is an enabler,

555
00:22:35,545 --> 00:22:38,570
but get the ones that are respectable.

556
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:41,250
Ones that have true merit
and really demonstrate

557
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:43,080
that it's a hands-on keyboard exercise,

558
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:43,970
that you knew what you were doing,

559
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:46,263
versus you were able to
study and pass the test.

560
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,889
- That is actually really telling.

561
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:52,040
I think one thing I want to also add,

562
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,330
as a social scientist amongst this group,

563
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:56,860
is that those, and John
did already mention,

564
00:22:56,860 --> 00:23:00,120
that lawyers, and my background
is in public affairs,

565
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,830
that's where I have my master's,

566
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:04,949
and there are many paths and many needs

567
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,960
because we have to have
these different perspectives.

568
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,570
And Andrea touched on that as well,

569
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:10,200
just bringing in a journalist.

570
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,080
So we did get a question in for somebody

571
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,629
that was asking about where do you find,

572
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:19,310
so how do you, if people who are looking

573
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:21,240
at cybersecurity careers look,

574
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,670
where should they go, and where can they

575
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:23,710
learn more about the field?

576
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:25,570
Because it's a very broad field.

577
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:28,350
So do you guys have some
resources that you can think of?

578
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:31,820
I know one that I recommend
frequently is the NIST,

579
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:36,240
and Cyberseek map that
has a very comprehensive

580
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,290
like channeling, so you can
look at the different careers,

581
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:41,090
and you can see where you could go from,

582
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:43,629
you know, starting here to going there,

583
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:46,530
but any ideas of where
somebody that doesn't have

584
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:47,363
a technical background?

585
00:23:47,363 --> 00:23:48,920
Mike, you're talking about like learning

586
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,607
the hands-on skills with the keyboards.

587
00:23:51,607 --> 00:23:54,430
I think that I might recommend,
as a social scientist,

588
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:58,330
that you go to club
meetings, you go to events,

589
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:00,899
like DEF CON, and you
don't have to actually

590
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,250
play some of the games, but you meet some

591
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:04,620
of the people, and you
build that network there.

592
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,659
Other thoughts, Andrea?

593
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:10,770
- Yeah, I would say, I think the one thing

594
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:13,050
I would mention is, you can
also look at internships.

595
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:15,340
So for example, you know,
and I believe you know,

596
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:18,020
I'll speak for NBC, but
I know Lockheed and Dell

597
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,160
have the same thing, right?

598
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,640
But, you know, if you're
really interested and curious,

599
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,850
but you're not sure you want to commit,

600
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:24,240
internships are a great way.

601
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,880
And if you go out to like
the NBCU career site,

602
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,360
you'll find there are both associate

603
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,709
and internship programs, which
are usually over the summer,

604
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:34,370
but there's some flexibility.

605
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:37,659
Those types of experiences
are fairly well-rounded

606
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:38,970
and often they're, you know,

607
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:42,890
we put in different types
of jobs across, you know,

608
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:45,510
what our needs are,
across all of the areas.

609
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:48,390
So we could have one
on awareness or policy,

610
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:50,810
you know, which might take more of someone

611
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:53,040
with a communications background

612
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,460
versus something more technical.

613
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,320
You know, we've talked about
vulnerability management.

614
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,740
That's always a place
where interns can come in,

615
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:01,840
and really learn and
understand what it's like

616
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,560
to mobilize across a large enterprise.

617
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:08,950
So I can't say enough about,
if you have the ability,

618
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:11,330
you know, to pursue
internships, to go after that,

619
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:13,250
because it gives you both that opportunity

620
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:15,770
to see on the job; do
you really like this?

621
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:18,290
You know, is this a team
you want to be part of?

622
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:20,360
Or is this not quite, you know,

623
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,820
maybe it's not exactly what you thought,

624
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:25,360
and give you that information and feedback

625
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,760
before you have to fully commit.

626
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,660
And so I, that, and,
you know, I'll just say

627
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:34,100
all sorts of, you know,
I even love, you know,

628
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:37,350
Twitter following some
professionals, and articles,

629
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:40,129
and things like that,
just keeping up on items.

630
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:42,150
And then as you find a topic, I mean,

631
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:43,650
it's pretty easy to go out and find,

632
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:45,780
there are a plethora of training materials

633
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:48,270
when you really want to
do that deep dive as well.

634
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:50,790
So I think sometimes just staying abreast

635
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:53,090
of what's going on, and
then figuring out where

636
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:55,189
you want to jump in, is
another thing that just

637
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:58,100
helps build that knowledge base, you know,

638
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,659
that you want, you want people

639
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:02,170
to be looking around at what's happening.

640
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:03,770
And then, thinking about, you know,

641
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,550
when you come into an interview,

642
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:08,710
how do you process, and apply
that, and feed that back?

643
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:10,080
And so, building those skills,

644
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,340
thinking about how you'd apply,

645
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,860
asking those questions when you

646
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,449
go to those networking events,

647
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:17,253
those are skills that
translate to a good interview.

648
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:21,900
- Yeah, and while my fellow
panelists were talking,

649
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,260
I was recruiting in the chat,

650
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:26,530
so I would encourage folks
to check out our internships.

651
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:28,440
We've got rotation programs, you know,

652
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,610
specifically for that purpose though.

653
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:32,659
I mean, it's a great
opportunity to see the breadth

654
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:35,580
of just the roles and
functions that exist.

655
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:39,570
Yeah, I mean, it's just so
much more diverse, really.

656
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:41,659
I think people perceive
this monolithic name

657
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:44,030
of like a cybersecurity professional.

658
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:46,310
I also put in a link to
one of the frameworks

659
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:47,620
that's out there, that sort of lays out

660
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:49,239
all the different types of roles

661
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,060
within the traditional construct.

662
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,210
I don't think it covers, sort of,

663
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:55,050
the lawyers, and communicators,
and project managers,

664
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:56,177
but I wouldn't want to lose sight of that.

665
00:26:56,177 --> 00:26:58,199
And one of the questions
in the chat was, you know,

666
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,110
from one of these folks that maybe doesn't

667
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:03,490
have the technical or cyber
specific skills and backgrounds.

668
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:05,270
You know, I think, honestly,

669
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:07,550
one of the most difficult things to hire,

670
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:09,240
and one of the most needed things to hire,

671
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,830
are people who aren't just sort of

672
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:14,360
the traditional cybersecurity backgrounds,

673
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:17,560
but they are a skillset or experience base

674
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,770
that we need, that have learned enough

675
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:23,379
about cybersecurity in the
space to apply their trade.

676
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:26,758
And so, looking at legal
as an example, you know,

677
00:27:26,758 --> 00:27:29,500
lawyers are a dime a dozen,
and I'll say that jokingly,

678
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,030
as I work in the legal department at Dell,

679
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:33,910
and maybe some are watching
now or on the recording,

680
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:36,450
but, you know, security, not dime a dozen,

681
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:38,930
but cybersecurity people you can find.

682
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:41,440
Finding a lawyer who
deeply understands cyber

683
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,850
and privacy law specifically,
and the applications,

684
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:46,169
and the evolving landscape
where every three months

685
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:48,540
a country's passing a new
national cybersecurity

686
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:51,680
law that's causing organizations
to change our policies,

687
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,310
and how we, I mean, those are, you know,

688
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:55,830
those are the folks that
need that unicorn hoodie

689
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:57,570
that Mike's laying out, and so,

690
00:27:57,570 --> 00:27:58,950
for those on the call who are watching,

691
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:01,100
that may have one of those
non-traditional backgrounds,

692
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,263
but you're interest is in cybersecurity,

693
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:04,560
I would highly encourage you to start

694
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,360
building some cybersecurity
experience again

695
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,870
through reading, online learning,

696
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:10,327
maybe a basic-level certification course.

697
00:28:10,327 --> 00:28:12,630
And you get that blended resume together,

698
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:14,280
it's going to be really powerful.

699
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:17,589
- Yeah. Yeah, I agree.

700
00:28:17,589 --> 00:28:18,422
And I don't have a whole
lot to add to that.

701
00:28:18,422 --> 00:28:20,400
I think, you know, some
good points around.

702
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,360
Find the local communities
of interest around you.

703
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:25,370
They're everywhere
today for cybersecurity.

704
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,969
You know, whether they're, you know,

705
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:29,980
get together over lunch,
or go to a SANS course,

706
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:32,600
or a SANS event, or
Cecilia mentioned DEF CON,

707
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,760
just wandering around there,

708
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,410
and getting to know a few people.

709
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,649
Just seek out others
that are, have the same

710
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:40,973
and similar interests,
and build that network.

711
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:46,083
- So, in the chat, also from Alexandra,

712
00:28:46,083 --> 00:28:48,480
they said that they've noticed many jobs,

713
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,460
or even internships,
still have requirements

714
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,560
that are difficult for someone with

715
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,690
little security background to get.

716
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:54,730
What's your recommendation?

717
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:58,370
I mean, is it, is it to
get the certification?

718
00:28:58,370 --> 00:28:59,923
How could they get in the door?

719
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:03,370
- Apply to companies that
are more open-minded.

720
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:05,100
Like, I think some of those on the call.

721
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:08,669
You know, I mean, there
are huge ramifications

722
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:12,100
to these artificial HR constructs I think

723
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:15,254
a lot of organizations still
unfortunately lead through

724
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:17,899
in how you structure your job postings

725
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,640
and cater to your requirements.

726
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,030
Again, for us, we're
really looking for people

727
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:23,490
with passion, aptitude,
problem solving skills.

728
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:25,740
Of course you need some
skills and experience

729
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:28,320
relative to the job, but we at least try

730
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,540
to structure our, you
know, outreach in a way

731
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:33,580
that doesn't box out, or be exclusionary.

732
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:34,870
I think one of the really exciting things,

733
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:37,581
as we sit in 2021 in the
session, is, you know,

734
00:29:37,581 --> 00:29:39,260
we can pretty much hire any role

735
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,730
from anywhere in the world now today,

736
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:42,490
with what technology is enabling us to do.

737
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:45,790
And so we can get just greater
reach to candidate space,

738
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:47,540
get greater access to diverse,

739
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:49,580
or expanded diverse candidates.

740
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:52,590
So I think it's a really
exciting time to be more open

741
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:55,230
to get a greater candidates in the door.

742
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:56,840
I think a lot of, you know, companies,

743
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:59,540
including those on this call,
I know feel the same way.

744
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:00,990
- Well, we've had similar
questions, I think,

745
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:03,310
in past years about, you
know, "Hey, these are,

746
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:04,790
you guys are all big companies,

747
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:07,300
and I can't seem to get my resume

748
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:11,020
through your automated
screening processes." Right?

749
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:13,129
And I think our consistent
answer year over a year,

750
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:15,867
and I still believe in it
is, you know, find a friend,

751
00:30:15,867 --> 00:30:19,933
find a person that, you know
that has the relationships

752
00:30:19,933 --> 00:30:23,550
in those companies and, you
know, send them an email,

753
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:26,485
and you know, get to know that person.

754
00:30:26,485 --> 00:30:29,510
And it really requires
a human, in many times,

755
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:30,760
to get in the door these days,

756
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:33,460
especially at an internship level.

757
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:35,220
And you know, the cool thing is, like,

758
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:37,270
the world is open now,
in terms of LinkedIn.

759
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:38,980
I know all of us are out there.

760
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:41,900
And so, you know, find somebody

761
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:44,770
that is a cybersecurity
professional on the LinkedIn system,

762
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:47,330
or your other favorite, you know, website.

763
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:50,041
And don't be afraid to
reach out to the person.

764
00:30:50,041 --> 00:30:52,720
Corporations and leaders who are sincere

765
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,085
about hiring talent will
respond back to you.

766
00:30:56,085 --> 00:30:58,770
- Yeah. The other thing I'll mention is,

767
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:00,610
if you don't feel like you have like

768
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:02,659
that perfect match or
enough of the skills,

769
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:04,620
like you may have to work a little harder,

770
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,110
you may have to reach out like, you know,

771
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:08,740
in our case to the
recruiters, or the people.

772
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:10,820
And really you almost
have to sell yourself.

773
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,921
You have to say, "here's why."

774
00:31:12,921 --> 00:31:14,870
And like, if you're in
the process of pursuing

775
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:17,149
like one of those certificates or things,

776
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:19,910
let the recruiter know, make those items,

777
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:22,000
talk about your passion, you know.

778
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,980
You do, there are opportunities,

779
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:27,290
but sometimes it's not enough
just to submit your resume.

780
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:31,020
So, you know, I will say that you may

781
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:32,389
have to be a little bit, you know,

782
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,800
apply some of that
creative problem solving,

783
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,990
but there are ways to
get, to what Mike said,

784
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:39,590
get a person on the
phone, show the interest.

785
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:42,100
Get feedback if you don't make it

786
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:45,129
All of those things will
help you tune the resume,

787
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:47,657
and tune your experience so that

788
00:31:47,657 --> 00:31:50,693
you can find something
that's a good match.

789
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:53,360
- So I'm gonna give a little plug here

790
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,399
for the session that's
coming up this afternoon,

791
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:58,810
because a lot of those
recruiters, or HR representatives,

792
00:31:58,810 --> 00:32:01,720
will be on that session this afternoon,

793
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,540
it's called Job Search 2021,

794
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:04,570
and they're going to give you tips

795
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:07,570
on all of these things,
including networking.

796
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:10,290
I do think networking is really important,

797
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:13,139
but I kind of want to
talk just very briefly

798
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:17,290
about what your thoughts
are on how you actually

799
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:20,740
bring somebody into the team,
when we've all been living

800
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:24,330
so disparate, disparate lives,
we haven't been together.

801
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:25,889
So what have you been doing in order

802
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:27,820
to create that cohesive feeling,

803
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,570
like I'm part of something big,

804
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:30,939
especially for the new people

805
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:32,590
who are just coming on your team?

806
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:37,960
- I guess I'll start, I think,

807
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,860
you know, in the last year and a half,

808
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:43,311
every major corporation,
every small corporation,

809
00:32:43,311 --> 00:32:46,327
every college and university
has had to learn to adapt

810
00:32:46,327 --> 00:32:49,990
to a remote and changing world, and,

811
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:52,100
the interesting thing
is, I think for people

812
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,748
who are interested in this
field, it wasn't that hard.

813
00:32:54,749 --> 00:32:56,220
We're kind of, you have a little bit

814
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:57,920
of a technologist running
through your veins

815
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,660
when you want to be a
cybersecurity person.

816
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:03,840
And so we've done a lot of
Zooms, and we're all kind of,

817
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,370
everybody's getting Zoom-ed out, you know,

818
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:07,540
but, but it works, and you know,

819
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:10,180
a lot of us do video
meetings and video calls

820
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:12,200
so you get to see the
people you're working with.

821
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,960
I've got people on my team that have been

822
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,080
on the team for a year now.

823
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,125
I've never met them in person.

824
00:33:17,125 --> 00:33:19,635
And you know, I'm really,
really excited to do that.

825
00:33:19,635 --> 00:33:21,580
I think I see everybody
shaking their, we all do.

826
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:24,300
But I think you can still
be welcoming, you know,

827
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:27,350
through a virtual environment,
and onboard people,

828
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:29,199
have a buddy, just like
you would do in person,

829
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,240
that helps, you know, get
them through the nuances

830
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,350
that are the new company
and the new career

831
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:36,391
that people have chosen.

832
00:33:36,392 --> 00:33:37,410
And I've been trying to
figure out a good time

833
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:39,450
for this one, but, so, you know,

834
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:42,276
don't be afraid to have
some fun with folks, right?

835
00:33:42,276 --> 00:33:45,284
You know, it is a
stressful work environment.

836
00:33:45,284 --> 00:33:49,444
The nation, the world has
all been pretty stressed out

837
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:53,032
in the last year and a half
for a lot of various reasons.

838
00:33:53,032 --> 00:33:56,179
Whether it's the pandemic,
or social issues,

839
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:58,470
it's been a stressful time for everyone.

840
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:00,710
And I think having a
little levity in it all

841
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:03,190
is good and finding
ways to have, you know,

842
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:05,390
coffee chats, or book
clubs, or different things

843
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:07,980
with your teams virtually
are an important part

844
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:10,273
of building that inclusive environment.

845
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,909
- So one of the other questions
that came through chat

846
00:34:14,909 --> 00:34:17,810
was about, you guys, we could talk about

847
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:19,210
John, you just mentioned that can be

848
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:20,739
from anywhere around the globe,

849
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:23,959
but the reality is,
that if you're a citizen

850
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:24,989
that's outside of the United States,

851
00:34:24,989 --> 00:34:28,506
it's hard for somebody to
get hired by a US company.

852
00:34:28,507 --> 00:34:31,840
And another one came in for
a private message, Mike,

853
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:35,800
that was about specifically
around defense industry,

854
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,219
and working for the government.

855
00:34:37,219 --> 00:34:39,207
All three of you have done that.

856
00:34:39,208 --> 00:34:41,230
Do you have any, can
you make some comments

857
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:44,520
on just, how to overcome
some of these obstacles

858
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:48,112
that might stop somebody
from entering into the field?

859
00:34:51,002 --> 00:34:52,040
- There's a few thoughts, I guess.

860
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,820
I mean, one, this was said
earlier in the session,

861
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:59,230
every organization in the
world needs these roles.

862
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:01,780
So, firms in the UK need these roles,

863
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:03,770
firms in Malaysia, government in Malaysia,

864
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:06,600
government of name your country, you know,

865
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,720
small town city clerk managing the records

866
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:12,866
of a local town in some
random country in Asia.

867
00:35:12,866 --> 00:35:15,980
You know, I think that
the cybersecurity industry

868
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:19,700
obviously became more
prevalent in certain countries.

869
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,700
Over the years, security
companies themselves

870
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:25,089
were more prevalent in certain countries.

871
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:27,310
Certain countries started
hiring and investing

872
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:29,799
in cybersecurity earlier than
potentially other countries,

873
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,040
and other portions of the world.

874
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,650
I think all of that is
beginning to normalize,

875
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:35,040
though, and roles are everywhere.

876
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,270
On top of that, you
know, most international,

877
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:39,410
you know, global companies that even have

878
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:41,899
their US headquarters have representation

879
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:44,580
across the world, and hire overseas,

880
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:47,470
often including
cybersecurity professionals.

881
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:50,189
So that's not a broad
case, but like at Dell,

882
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:52,090
for instance, I know we
have our cybersecurity

883
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:54,370
professionals spread all over the world.

884
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:56,339
Majority of the people aren't in the US.

885
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:59,210
In fact some of our
premier hubs are located

886
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:02,210
in both Asia, Europe,
all across the globe.

887
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:05,370
So I'd say, you know, I put
into the chat at one point,

888
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:07,279
you know, ignore what they say in a job,

889
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,700
you know, apply, apply apply.

890
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,710
Just, you know, there's
a little bit of, sort of,

891
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:14,100
tenacity and grit that may be required.

892
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,797
It's frustrating when you
hear people like us say,

893
00:36:15,797 --> 00:36:17,043
"Oh, well there's 3 million more jobs

894
00:36:17,043 --> 00:36:19,580
than there are available
people," when you sat

895
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:21,440
and applied to like 50 jobs last month,

896
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,606
and haven't heard back from a one of them.

897
00:36:23,606 --> 00:36:25,750
There's a certain reality
to that on the ground,

898
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,670
I realize, I think, you know,

899
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:29,830
it is a numbers game,
it's a persistence game.

900
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:32,190
So just be persistent, if nothing else.

901
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,190
And that would be a broad encouragement.

902
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:36,900
- Yeah. And there's a
question there from John

903
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:39,137
about UK and US citizenship,
and things like that.

904
00:36:39,137 --> 00:36:41,590
And, you know, to John, to your question,

905
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:43,820
some of the most brilliant people I know

906
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:46,740
in cybersecurity work
outside of the United States,

907
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,669
are citizens of other
countries, UK being one,

908
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:50,893
Australia being another, Singapore.

909
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,260
It's cool.

910
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:58,176
Most multinational firms have a division

911
00:36:58,176 --> 00:37:00,940
in the UK, for sure, where you're at,

912
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,720
and many other places around the world.

913
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,182
And, to John's point, you may have to be

914
00:37:05,182 --> 00:37:07,060
a little more persistent
to find that branch

915
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:10,810
of the business that's located
in your particular country,

916
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:13,240
but we're pretty much all out there.

917
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,209
Three global companies here on the phone.

918
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:19,110
And so, you can find that
job in your backyard,

919
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:21,070
it just might be a little harder to find.

920
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:22,520
- And sometimes you
may have to approach it

921
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,720
a little differently
than would feel obvious.

922
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,279
So, you know, NBC universal is part

923
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,700
of the Comcast global family.

924
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,549
So it's really three companies, right?

925
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:34,848
It's Comcast, it's NBC
universal, and now Sky.

926
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:38,830
Sky is UK-based, it also
has Italy and Germany,

927
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:40,430
and so we actually have had people apply

928
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:43,250
for both Sky jobs that
run at separate companies.

929
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:46,600
And we also have people
in NBC who sit in the UK

930
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:49,430
and Scotland and other,
you know, other places.

931
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:51,529
And so, you know, you
may not naturally think

932
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:52,507
if you're in the UK,

933
00:37:52,507 --> 00:37:54,740
"Oh, I'm gonna apply for
an NBC universal job,"

934
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:56,183
but we do have it there, and sometimes

935
00:37:56,183 --> 00:37:58,590
it's US-based jobs that we then

936
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:01,320
relocate because you have that ability.

937
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,260
So sometimes you can apply to a job,

938
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:06,210
even if it says US, and the company

939
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:08,983
can make those adjustments
behind the scenes too.

940
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:11,960
- So we are coming up.

941
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,982
Oh, sorry, John, you
finish, 'cause this is,

942
00:38:13,982 --> 00:38:15,556
and then we'll come up on the end.

943
00:38:15,556 --> 00:38:16,812
Yeah, go ahead.

944
00:38:16,812 --> 00:38:17,645
- Yeah. I was only gonna say, I mean,

945
00:38:17,645 --> 00:38:18,850
just one more, again, it's a general tip,

946
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:21,569
but if companies aren't
open-minded, I mean,

947
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:24,548
a big part, you know, it's
not just choosing a job,

948
00:38:24,548 --> 00:38:26,209
it's choosing a company.
So just be thoughtful.

949
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:28,770
And, you know, I think companies that are

950
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:30,700
being more thoughtful
in their job postings

951
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:33,220
and how lacking they are at restricting,

952
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:35,629
how global they are in nature, I mean,

953
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:36,970
it's the old way of doing business,

954
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:38,410
to sit and have to see your team,

955
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:41,180
be physically with them,
have to be in the same town,

956
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:43,491
you know, both technology, and I think,

957
00:38:43,491 --> 00:38:45,741
you know, unfortunately
in large part accelerated

958
00:38:45,741 --> 00:38:48,100
by our horrible pandemic, you know,

959
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,511
the world is one community right now.

960
00:38:50,511 --> 00:38:52,040
And, you know, I think modern companies

961
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,650
that have inclusive cultures,

962
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:55,610
that want to diversify their workforce,

963
00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:57,460
have that mindset.
There's three on the call.

964
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,880
There's many more out there.

965
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,020
So just be thoughtful, even as
you're looking at companies,

966
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,973
especially as you get to
the point where you realize

967
00:39:02,973 --> 00:39:05,170
that you are really
attractive, as a candidate,

968
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:07,770
if you're in the cyber
field, and you have a choice,

969
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:09,170
and that's a powerful thing.

970
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
- Well, as we are coming up,

971
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,490
that's actually a great
note to end on, John.

972
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:17,660
This has actually been a really important

973
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:18,500
and incredible session.

974
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,420
I, again, thank all of our experts,

975
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:23,500

guys show up every year,

976
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,840

977
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:27,500
and you are committed to helping us build

978
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,780
out the next generation of cyber warriors.

979
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:32,030
I thank all of you for coming here today,

980
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:33,470
and I'd also like to invite you

981
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:35,410
for that session this
afternoon, where we will be

982
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:37,560
having the exact things
that they talked about.

983
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:40,560
We will be covering how to
read the job description,

984
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,710
and how to make your resume actually apply

985
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:44,890
to that job description, and we'll have

986
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:46,810
another person that will
give you interview tips,

987
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:49,310
that are from Dell, actually John.

988
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:51,980
Kristine, and Carrie! I know!

989
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:54,450
So we have a great team
coming up this afternoon.

990
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:57,060
I'd love for you to join us for that.

991
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:59,990
The other part of RSA
Conference is open to you now.

992
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:02,549
All the sessions are on demand
for the next two months,

993
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:04,830

994
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:06,160

995
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,450

Bye bye.
