1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:02,750
- Welcome everybody to the panel

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:04,720
Cyber's Past Present and Future:

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,090
The Truth is Stranger than Fiction.

4
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,170
I believe this is the sixth time

5
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:11,719
that we've had this panel back together,

6
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:15,300
but honestly I think I lost
track somewhere around 2018,

7
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,220
But we've got the same
incredible group of panelists

8
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:21,590
that we had over the
last five or six years.

9
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:22,550
My name is Dan Hubbard,

10
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:24,920
I'm the Chief Product Officer at Lacework

11
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,700
a cloud security company.

12
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,050
And let's introduce the panelists.

13
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:30,930
Super excited about this year.

14
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,650
It's certainly has been a an interesting

15
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:35,920
journey if you will, over 2020,

16
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,010
but we're gonna jump in
into the content in a sec.

17
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:42,540
First off, I'll like to
introduce Andy Greenberg.

18
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,540
Andy is a writer for "Wired"
he's the author of "Sandworm:

19
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:48,130
A New Era of Cyberwar

20
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:50,910
and the Hunt for the Kremlin's
Most Dangerous Hackers."

21
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:54,910
And Andy can be reached
on Twitter at @_greenberg.

22
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:56,550
Then we've got Nicole Perlroth,

23
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:59,470
who's a cybersecurity reporter
at the New York Times.

24
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:01,330
And our most recent author

25
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:04,247
of "This is How They
Tell Me the World Ends."

26
00:01:06,272 --> 00:01:09,580
Virtually next to Nicole,
we've got Joseph Menn,

27
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:12,929
author or most recent author
of "Cult of the Dead Cow,"

28
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:15,320
but also author of "Fatal System Error,"

29
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,250
and "All the Rave: The Rise and Fall

30
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,027
of Shawn Fanning's Napster."

31
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:23,300
Joseph works doing investigative
stories at "Reuters,"

32
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,610
and can be followed @josephmenn.

33
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:27,790
And lastly, certainly not
least we have Kelvin Poulsen

34
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:29,630
who's an investigative
journalist and data geek

35
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:33,259
at the "Wall Street Journal,"
and author of "Kingpin."

36
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:36,530
And it can be followed
on Twitter at @kpoulsen.

37
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:39,340
So let's kick off the round table,

38
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:42,503
and let's start off with,

39
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:45,200
we've been, you know

40
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,180
we've been talking about this topic

41
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,840
for six plus years here.

42
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,960
But if we step back to
kind of the beginning

43
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,220
of your journey and security,

44
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,730
I'd love to hear from
each one of you kind of,

45
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:58,340
what keeps you writing about security?

46
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,870
I mean, certainly things have changed

47
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,790
over the number of years
you've all been involved,

48
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,210
but let's talk about

49
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:07,309
how you still stay excited
about the topic itself.

50
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:09,430
Andy, why don't you kick us off?

51
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:13,010
- Well, I started my career
at "Forbes" like Nicole,

52
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:15,259
actually, we worked together at "Forbes"

53
00:02:15,259 --> 00:02:16,091
for quite a few years

54
00:02:16,092 --> 00:02:19,270
and I found that well
I wanted to get a job,

55
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:21,020
and business writing was
like the easiest place

56
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:21,930
to get a job.

57
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:23,340
Then I found that within business writing

58
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,870
technology was the most
interesting thing to me,

59
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:26,900
and within technology,

60
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,970
all of the drama and conflict,

61
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:33,500
and kind of like adversarial undergrounds

62
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,640
stories of I guess good guys and bad guys,

63
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,049
black hats and white hats,

64
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:41,310
was in this world, was in cyber security,

65
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:43,270
or whatever we called it back then.

66
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:45,800
Like it was,

67
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,740
there were business stories,

68
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:50,090
there were technology stories,
but there was real conflict,

69
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:52,120
which is what produces,

70
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,120
which is what produces
stories for journalists.

71
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,494
So it was just the kind
of never ending fountain

72
00:02:58,494 --> 00:03:01,780
of interesting threads to pull on.

73
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,940
And that's what I've been
doing for, I don't know

74
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:06,210
15 plus years now since then.

75
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:07,170
Yeah.

76
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:08,003
- Yeah.

77
00:03:08,003 --> 00:03:09,350
Awesome. Kevin, how about you?

78
00:03:10,539 --> 00:03:14,212
- You know, the nice thing
about covering security is

79
00:03:14,212 --> 00:03:17,640
the people you're covering
are always innovating.

80
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,230
So there's always something new
and exciting to write about.

81
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:22,290
Like the bad guys,

82
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:25,200
come up with more and more
inventive things to do.

83
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,179
And the good guys come up

84
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,400
with their own inventive ways to try

85
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,453
and foil them or track them down.

86
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:34,459
So it's never really the same thing

87
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,620
like one year to the next.

88
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:36,453
There's always something new

89
00:03:36,453 --> 00:03:40,263
and the people tend to be very
interesting on both sides.

90
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,000
- Yeah, certainly a lot of
interesting personalities

91
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,430
that's for sure. (chuckles)

92
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:48,570
That's one of the things
I love about it actually.

93
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:49,403
Nicole.

94
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,510
- I, when I started
covering cyber security

95
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:56,850
at the times I thought, maybe
if I do a really good job

96
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:58,720
on the cyber security thing

97
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,681
they'll let me go back to
covering venture capital.

98
00:04:01,681 --> 00:04:03,275
And then I just never left.

99
00:04:03,275 --> 00:04:05,760
And just like Kevin said,

100
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,160
every year it's a whole new thing.

101
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,290
Just when you think you
have your arms around

102
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:15,040
Chinese intellectual property
theft, Snowden happened

103
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,930
and after Snowden it was Sony,

104
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:19,700
and the hacks of target,

105
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:23,395
and then the 2016 hacks of the DNC,

106
00:04:23,395 --> 00:04:27,462
and the long awaited interference
that didn't happen really

107
00:04:27,463 --> 00:04:29,760
at the end of the day and the election,

108
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,800
and now it's SolarWinds,
and they Neon thing.

109
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,940
And it's like, you have no choice

110
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:37,117
because you can't even
pull your head above water,

111
00:04:37,117 --> 00:04:37,950
(laughs)

112
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:40,902
long enough to think about
doing something different.

113
00:04:40,903 --> 00:04:42,463
But I have to say,

114
00:04:42,463 --> 00:04:45,970
this is my 10 year
anniversary at the "Times."

115
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:48,683
which feels insane because
it's gone by so quickly.

116
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:51,000
And I don't know about you guys

117
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,793
but I am just so exhausted
on this treadmill of,

118
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:59,110
this is only going to get worse.

119
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:02,520
We are only going to see these
attacks get more serious,

120
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,200
and come from further
corners of the globe.

121
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,680
And some days I just wake up
and I have that realization

122
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,560
that my life is only going to get harder.

123
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,650
The longer I stay with this beat in it,

124
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:16,690
it's a little bit overwhelming,

125
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:18,850
especially, after 2020,

126
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:21,320
when we've all been stuck in
our homes for the last year.

127
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,860
So, I don't know how much longer,

128
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:26,820
I'll be covering the day-to-day
news, but I don't think

129
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,340
once you cover this for long enough,

130
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:32,450
you have a sense that
you can't abandon it.

131
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:34,770
But maybe you can apply
it to quirkier stories

132
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:35,789
or that kind of thing.

133
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,800
But I'm sure we're all pretty tired

134
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:40,580
with the new cycle particularly

135
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,380
just over the last six months or so.

136
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,163
- Yeah, for sure.

137
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:49,219
- I'm totally fried.

138
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,640
I've been doing this for 20 years and

139
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,240
in the beginning one of
the reasons I focused on it

140
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,750
in addition to the sort
of the conflict stuff

141
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,850
and really is like a counterpoint to the

142
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:02,580
silliness of the.com boom, at the time,

143
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:05,128
in '99 when I started,

144
00:06:05,128 --> 00:06:08,860
it was much more real and important.

145
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:12,970
But I had always been thinking
about the fact that this,

146
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:13,850
soon enough,

147
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:15,770
I was thinking about how
this was gonna get bigger

148
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:17,514
and more important.

149
00:06:17,514 --> 00:06:19,630
And more vital.

150
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:22,130
And that's absolutely been true.

151
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:24,930
I mean, technology has
become more important

152
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:27,780
to everything and within that,

153
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,390
security and privacy issues have been,

154
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,200
really fundamental the CRUX of technology

155
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,263
for good and for ill.

156
00:06:35,234 --> 00:06:39,450
So every year it gets more important.

157
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:41,469
Which is great for a career,

158
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:45,990
but it is exhausting and yeah

159
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:48,100
like you have to keep right.

160
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:48,933
I think all of us,

161
00:06:48,933 --> 00:06:50,580
we have to keep raising
our news threshold,

162
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,659
so if it doesn't involve a Nation State,

163
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,420
it better be a pretty good story.

164
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,260
You know, at this point.

165
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,900
All the the breach of the day stuff

166
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,063
just, it all looks the same.

167
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:02,523
- Yeah.

168
00:07:02,523 --> 00:07:04,010
It almost kind of has to be a hobby

169
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:05,320
and a job at the same time

170
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:09,313
or else it's termed impossible
to grok the scale of it all.

171
00:07:11,025 --> 00:07:12,450
So over, you know,

172
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:14,780
amongst us here we've got,

173
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:19,330
I think counted six authored
books amongst all of you.

174
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:22,573
And three of you have published
books since our last panel.

175
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:24,990
Nicole, Andy, and Joseph.

176
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:27,680
Can you give us just a
kind of a one or two line

177
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,870
about your books

178
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:32,760
and give us a little plug
of what they're all about.

179
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:36,300
Nicole why don't you
start, the most recent?

180
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:41,300
- So my book is about the
underground exploit market,

181
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:45,440
and what I just described
sort of the growing

182
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,500
spread of these capabilities
to further corners of the globe

183
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,320
or foreign governments are acquiring

184
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:55,240
the skills and talent
to conduct cyber attacks

185
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,450
for their own reasons,

186
00:07:56,450 --> 00:08:00,630
whether it's surveillance
or battlefield preparations

187
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:01,853
or classic espionage.

188
00:08:03,534 --> 00:08:08,534
And I always have trouble
(laughs) answering this question

189
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:11,310
because it really started
out as a focus look,

190
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:13,350
at the underground cyber arms trade.

191
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:14,900
But by the end,

192
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:18,849
you can almost hear me just on deadline,

193
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:23,010
trying to get as much in as
possible from what happened

194
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:25,200
in 2020 ahead of the election.

195
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,610
And so many things happened,

196
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:29,910
just in the last year that by the end,

197
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,760
I don't know if I can
really say it's a book

198
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,470
about the underground exploit market,

199
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:35,870
or it's just a book about the nightmare

200
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,780
and mess that we are in

201
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:40,852
and at one point have to untangle.

202
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,790
- Great so Andy?

203
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:48,339
- Well, my book is "Sandworm,"

204
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,950
is about this hacker
group called Sandworm,

205
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:52,950
that I started tracking in 2016.

206
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:55,505
And my editors actually
the time of "Wired"

207
00:08:55,505 --> 00:08:59,070
were asking me to find
the big story of cyberwar

208
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:02,360
and they were thinking
about the election hacking,

209
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,410
but I went looking for
what I thought was like a,

210
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:08,300
was real cyber war where,
hackers are actually causing

211
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,729
State sponsored hackers
are causing disruptive,

212
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:14,140
or destructive effects
in the middle of a war,

213
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,370
a kinetic war,

214
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:19,110
which I found in Ukraine where

215
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:20,720
essentially Ukraine had had a revolution,

216
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,330
Russia invaded and then
launched a cyberwar on Ukraine

217
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,040
where they were attacking
every part of society,

218
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,969
destroying all terabytes of data inside of

219
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:30,920
banks and government agencies.

220
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:31,752
And then ultimately

221
00:09:31,753 --> 00:09:34,250
causing the first two blackouts
ever triggered by hackers

222
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,440
both in Ukraine.

223
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,660
So I started tracking "Sandworm,"

224
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,660
this group that was
doing these unprecedented

225
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,810
actual acts of cyberwar,

226
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:44,859
and then just as I started
to write about them,

227
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,690
as I published my first big
magazine story about them

228
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:49,540
they released not Petya in Ukraine,

229
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:52,270
which was this worm,
piece of automated code

230
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:54,970
that spread from Ukraine,
to the rest of the world,

231
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:57,980
to the entire world cost
$10 billion in damage,

232
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,610
was the worst cyber attack in history.

233
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:03,210
So, once that happened, I
could see that there was like a

234
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:04,680
an arc of a story of,

235
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,040
you could look to Ukraine to
see the future of cyberwar,

236
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,219
and then the future of
cyberwar caught up with us

237
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:11,560
and hit us in the West as well.

238
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,599
And I realized that there was a book

239
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,550
to be written about that.

240
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:16,959
And so the book kind of starts
out as a detective story

241
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,570
of tracking these attacks,
figuring out who did it.

242
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:21,020
And then it becomes a disaster story

243
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,943
of watching now Petya
unfold across the world.

244
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:30,320
- Awesome. Joseph, "Cult of the Dead Cow."

245
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,010
- So my prior book, "Fatal System Error"

246
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:35,960
was depressing as hell.

247
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,270
And it was 10 years ago,

248
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:40,370
and it basically said we're screwed.

249
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:41,940
The tax service keeps growing,

250
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,980
the geopolitics are such that

251
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,950
there's no reason why somebody,

252
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,240
for example, in Russia,

253
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,193
hacking "Fox" in the U.S
has anything to worry about,

254
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,463
and vice versa.

255
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,542
And, you know,

256
00:10:54,542 --> 00:10:57,350
all the reasons why,

257
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:59,840
things are going to
get, dramatically worse

258
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,040
and really mess up our lives.

259
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:05,953
And I didn't wanna write
another book that was like that.

260
00:11:05,953 --> 00:11:08,010
That said, well, we're
also screwed in this way.

261
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:10,590
Which you haven't thought about
enough before or something.

262
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:12,140
I wanted to do something positive.

263
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:14,090
Which is much harder to do.

264
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,133
And also sort of,

265
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:17,880
educate newer entrants

266
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,070
to the field of security,

267
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:22,720
and remind folks who've been in it

268
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,593
for awhile of really core questions.

269
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:28,040
And so I think the "Cult of the Dead Cow"

270
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,410
because they are still around today.

271
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:31,689
They go all the way back

272
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:35,230
to the bulletin board days,
more than 30 years ago.

273
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:36,670
And because one way or another,

274
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:39,370
they were in every sort
of major inflection point

275
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,450
in this, in InfoSec.

276
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:45,270
So, they came up with
coordinated disclosure,

277
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,763
responsible disclosure,

278
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:52,400
they did the gimmicky
thing where they threw out

279
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,180
working exploits at DEF CON
from the stage of DEF CON

280
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:57,323
to the adoring throngs,

281
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,610
the first to make sort
of like a media spectacle

282
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:03,290
of what they were doing with any success.

283
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:04,620
They invented hacktivism,

284
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,380
which they defined as

285
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,800
hacking security work in
service of human rights

286
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,250
which has come to the fore
again fairly recently.

287
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:13,920
And then they kind of
lauched the industry.

288
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,300
I mean, they formed @Stake

289
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,339
very early security boutique,

290
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:21,080
and they found Veracode,

291
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:25,223
one of the first big code
analysis, binary analysis firms.

292
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:28,900
And then they ran somebody for president,

293
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:31,064
conveniently right when I was publishing,

294
00:12:31,065 --> 00:12:32,761
(laughs)

295
00:12:32,761 --> 00:12:34,510
which brought some attention on it.

296
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:36,910
But I'm really interested
in the ethical development,

297
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:39,490
their moral development
from teenage pranksters,

298
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:42,150
who didn't really have
particularly strong ethics

299
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:44,640
to leveling up as the Stakes rose

300
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,110
and suddenly everybody's online.

301
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:48,850
And how do you get a monopoly
like Microsoft to care

302
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:50,180
about security.

303
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:53,310
And they had to deal with
all these ethical issues.

304
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:56,030
And they came out in different places.

305
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:58,948
But I think that's
something that has been lost

306
00:12:58,948 --> 00:13:02,410
now that cybersecurity is
a nice clean profession,

307
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:03,900
they don't really think about the morality

308
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,750
of the decisions that
they're making all the time.

309
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:09,340
And I think it's worth
everybody's while to revisit that

310
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,693
and figure out where
they stand personally.

311
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,414
- And if could, a second,
- Jump in and say,

312
00:13:15,414 --> 00:13:20,343
as a person who doesn't have
a book to promote right now,

313
00:13:21,358 --> 00:13:23,900
all three of these books
are just outstanding.

314
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,890
And it's an embarrassment

315
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:29,293
of riches that we're able to have like

316
00:13:29,293 --> 00:13:31,560
three books of this caliber,

317
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,089
all covering completely different aspects

318
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:37,763
of the same, same cybersecurity beat.

319
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:40,670
So.....

320
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:41,670
- Well, I just read,

321
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:44,910
I re-read "Kingpin" and
preparation for this, and it is

322
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:47,469
I should say Kevin's book "Kingpin"

323
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:49,930
is a wonderful narrative.

324
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:52,089
It's like the kind of tight

325
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:54,760
and gripping single

326
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,430
kind of like single character focused

327
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:59,839
narrative that I've always wanted to find

328
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,320
in a cybersecurity story.

329
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,983
And I hope people are still
buying it and reading it.

330
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,998
- I really am.

331
00:14:06,998 --> 00:14:07,831
- Yeah.

332
00:14:07,831 --> 00:14:09,710
- I mean, not in droves,

333
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:12,450
(laughs)

334
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:15,000
for many, many, many years, but yeah.

335
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,640
People are still buying it so we can say,

336
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,620
it's always a pleasant surprise to

337
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:22,500
get a little residual check or something.

338
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,917
- It is, it is

339
00:14:23,917 --> 00:14:26,950
(indistinct)

340
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:27,810
- I was just gonna say,

341
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:30,650
it is hard to find one
character 'cause this,

342
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:35,650
the stories are so diffused
and complicated and yeah.

343
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:38,290
So I mean, that's real achievement,

344
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:40,430
to be able to tell it all
through one person makes it,

345
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:42,810
it's so much easier on the
reader, if you can do that.

346
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:43,642
- Well, actually, I mean,

347
00:14:43,643 --> 00:14:46,640
you had the one character
who you'd had, it seems

348
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:50,930
like complete access to like
wonderful personal drama

349
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:52,560
of Max visions life,

350
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,369
but then also the FBI agent tracking him,

351
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:59,110
and like his kind of accomplice,

352
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:03,140
and his accomplices mistresses and things,

353
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,680
it was just wonderful access.

354
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,890
And you also like hit your
access I thought very well,

355
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:08,540
just to tell the story straight.

356
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,420
It was really well done.

357
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,740
- Yeah, thank you.

358
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,080
I think that's the reason

359
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,650
that I have not written another book

360
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:18,120
is nobody like Max has really popped up,

361
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,260
and I don't know how to reproduce it.

362
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:22,030
So that's really just
kind of waiting for him

363
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,329
now that he's out of jail.

364
00:15:24,682 --> 00:15:25,515
(Dan laughs)

365
00:15:25,515 --> 00:15:26,910
- I remember when I,

366
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:30,367
I remember when I first
thought about doing a book

367
00:15:30,367 --> 00:15:32,847
and I met with some publishers, they said

368
00:15:32,847 --> 00:15:34,447
"You need a donkey,"

369
00:15:34,447 --> 00:15:36,310
"Find your donkey, the person who's gonna

370
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:39,170
carry your narrative all the way through."

371
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:41,780
And I never found my donkey.

372
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,100
And that meant that

373
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:46,180
at times I had to use those
words that have been beaten

374
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,660
out of us at the New York Times,

375
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:51,270
I am me to kind of take
the reader by the hand

376
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:54,000
but it was painful and awkward.

377
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,830
And I, to really envy

378
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:58,510
that you clearly found the perfect donkey.

379
00:15:58,510 --> 00:15:59,343
So he's now,

380
00:15:59,343 --> 00:16:02,189
you said he was about to get out of jail.

381
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:04,080
- Oh, he's out actually, yeah.

382
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,470
They had to take a little bit of time

383
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:08,280
because he staged a keeper while in jail.

384
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:11,521
Involving a helicopter drone
and stolen credit cards.

385
00:16:11,521 --> 00:16:12,550
(laughs)
- Wow.

386
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:16,872
- Not enough for like a 300 bucks so.

387
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:21,275
- I dunno, it kind of sounds
like a Netflix series.

388
00:16:21,275 --> 00:16:22,108
- There you go.

389
00:16:22,108 --> 00:16:24,280
- Nicole. I thought you
made an extra little donkey,

390
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,113
I should say.

391
00:16:25,113 --> 00:16:26,140
- Thank you.

392
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:26,973
Thank you.

393
00:16:26,973 --> 00:16:29,449
(laughs)

394
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:32,050
- Can you guys provide
a little bit of insight

395
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:35,969
to maybe aspiring security practitioners

396
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:37,790
or writers about the process?

397
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,219
Like start, you know

398
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,140
it seems like it could,

399
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,250
you know I've never written a book

400
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,600
but it seems like it
could be anywhere from,

401
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,070
two years to five years, there's a span

402
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:49,453
a time continuum that's all over the map.

403
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:53,210
What's kind of the process
from beginning to end

404
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:54,410
and kind of walk through,

405
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:55,920
what some of the, you know

406
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,030
the one thing I've learned
from listening to a lot

407
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:00,386
of you guys speak in podcasts
and other areas is that

408
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:02,219
sounds like you don't do it for money.

409
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,970
That's the one thing
I learned for sure is,

410
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:06,150
that there's a lot of work,

411
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,829
when you turn out kind of the time,

412
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:11,699
the time per hour, as
it takes to write these

413
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,923
incredible pieces.

414
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:15,359
But give me

415
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,079
or give people a little bit
the insight into the process.

416
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,030
Kevin, why don't you kick us off there?

417
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:26,683
- Yeah.

418
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:31,410
Now when we pass this to someone else

419
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:32,710
and I'll pick it up later.

420
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:33,870
- Sure.

421
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:35,689
- I'll...
- Andy ?

422
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:37,010
Or Joseph, yeah, go ahead.

423
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:37,843
- I'll take it, sure.

424
00:17:37,843 --> 00:17:41,210
So, the nice thing about all of our jobs,

425
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:43,570
is that we're looking for stories anyway.

426
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:46,899
And in a book is really different,

427
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,043
from a big story.

428
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:52,010
Publishers among other things,
one or like a third act

429
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:54,170
and in a lot of the journalism
you're trying to cause

430
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:55,283
the third act.

431
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,969
But nevertheless it's great.

432
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:01,800
It's a great way to mine

433
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,149
what's going on in the industry

434
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:07,920
for ideas and for sources
and for characters.

435
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,113
And so I actually think it's,

436
00:18:11,013 --> 00:18:12,240
I think it's really symbiotic.

437
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,190
I don't want to be a full-time author.

438
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:18,580
And I would be a little
bummed to be just reporter.

439
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,710
I really liked the day job,

440
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:21,333
but they feed off each other.

441
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,730
And so I'm not in a mad rush.

442
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:25,480
I've got really high standard for book.

443
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,960
I may only write one like
every eight years or so.

444
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,383
'Cause it's exhausting.

445
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,550
To me the most exhausting part

446
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:33,680
of the process is actually
the book proposal,

447
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,064
because you're writing that on spec.

448
00:18:36,064 --> 00:18:39,633
And so that's a weekend and
vacation type of project.

449
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:43,419
And it's a genre that
isn't like convertible

450
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:45,763
into anything else,
including the actual book.

451
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:47,483
It's you know,

452
00:18:47,483 --> 00:18:49,407
you're writing it for an agent,

453
00:18:49,407 --> 00:18:52,040
you're writing it for the
head of the publishing house,

454
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,510
and like a line editor.

455
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:56,424
The person is actually gonna
be trying to buy it and fix it.

456
00:18:56,424 --> 00:18:59,260
And my worst case,

457
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:02,129
I wrote multiple proposals
that did not become books.

458
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:06,330
And the one that became
my first book on security,

459
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:08,260
took years of rewriting

460
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:10,460
and recasting

461
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:12,243
and it's like debilitating.

462
00:19:12,243 --> 00:19:15,860
I tell you the whole thing
is like a person year for me.

463
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,520
Each of my books has been a person year,

464
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,400
but sometimes it's stretched
out over more years.

465
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,010
It's always more years than one.

466
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:24,593
And sometimes it's like four or five.

467
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:28,403
- Wow.

468
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,034
Anyone else wanna share kind of

469
00:19:31,034 --> 00:19:31,867
their insight

470
00:19:31,867 --> 00:19:35,280
into the kind of writing
to publishing process.

471
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,310
- It's a lot to have a forum

472
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:40,629
to put something out like in magazines,

473
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:45,230
like some sort of long form
outlet to get started in

474
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:47,290
that introduces you to the
people that you need to talk

475
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:50,230
to for an eventual book.

476
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:53,333
Gives you an idea of what
the narrative looks like.

477
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,310
And it helps,

478
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:58,590
with the pitch as well when
it comes time to write one.

479
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:00,310
If you could show that,

480
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:02,163
you have something out there already,

481
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:04,910
and that there was interest in it.

482
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:06,663
So that's an advantage.

483
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,870
We saw that with you,

484
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:11,750
like Andy described with
his "Wired" article leading

485
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,913
to the "Sandworm" book.

486
00:20:15,182 --> 00:20:17,670
- And you did a "Wired"
piece, the next vision, right?

487
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:18,503
- Yeah. Exact same.

488
00:20:18,503 --> 00:20:19,362
Yeah, same thing.

489
00:20:21,085 --> 00:20:22,640
And that's kind of how that started.

490
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,053
So that helps a lot.

491
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:26,940
And there are a lot of outlets now,

492
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:29,283
where to do that kind of long form,

493
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:35,480
without access to an old
school print magazine.

494
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,870
So if you can put something together there

495
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:39,423
that's a great place to start.

496
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,410
- Great.

497
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:44,280
- I'll just add,

498
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:47,750
I'll add that my process
wasn't a process at all.

499
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,370
It was a total mess.

500
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:52,120
I wish I had taken that
route where I wrote one

501
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,540
long form story that became a book.

502
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:58,803
Instead I was approached by an agent,

503
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:01,980
and had been approached
about books before.

504
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,470
But the last thing I wanted to do

505
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,880
after covering nonstop packing all day

506
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,900
was go home at night
and write about hacking.

507
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:09,950
And I was approached by an agent,

508
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:13,980
and when I Googled her, she
represented a lot of the chefs

509
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,740
at restaurants in San Francisco

510
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:18,170
I could never get a reservation to.

511
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:20,880
And so I thought, okay,
well she does cookbooks.

512
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,150
And my husband is a chef,

513
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:25,500
and maybe she'll want to publish

514
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,440
I'll publish his cookbook one day,

515
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,690
and I'll go out to dinner with her

516
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:31,030
and I'll get to go to one
of my favorite restaurants.

517
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:32,007
And I showed up

518
00:21:32,007 --> 00:21:34,200
and this is really the
sign of a good agent.

519
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,210
And I think this is
probably my number one tip

520
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:37,710
is find a good agent.

521
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:40,360
I showed up and she had
a whole dossier on me,

522
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:43,010
with articles I had written,

523
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:48,010
and possible protagonists,
and even chapter headings.

524
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,530
And I left the dinner
really with no choice

525
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:51,950
but to commit to writing a book.

526
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:53,093
And I sold it,

527
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,980
and I committed to
writing it in nine months,

528
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,210
which was a joke.

529
00:21:58,210 --> 00:21:59,740
And it was actually cruel.

530
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:04,010
I can't believe that they had
me sign something like that.

531
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:05,554
It took me seven years,

532
00:22:05,554 --> 00:22:08,230
the first publisher canceled on me

533
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:10,340
because they were so
sick of waiting for it.

534
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:12,790
They didn't care that the shadow brokers

535
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:14,520
had appeared on the scene,

536
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:17,540
and were dumping the
NSA's (laughs) exploits

537
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:18,960
or that not pecho was happening.

538
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,320
They just wanted the copy

539
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,149
and they just wanted to get it out.

540
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:24,350
So they canceled on me.

541
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:26,480
And I ended up having to resell the book

542
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,240
in the middle of all
of this, to a publisher

543
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,880
that gave me about half the advanced

544
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,980
that the original
publisher had had given me.

545
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:39,530
But the guy there at Bloomsbury,

546
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:41,513
Anton Miller really
believed in the project.

547
00:22:41,513 --> 00:22:43,473
And that's the second thing I would say is

548
00:22:43,473 --> 00:22:47,270
find an editor who truly
believes in the project

549
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:50,803
and will do anything to get
you over the finish line.

550
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,210
And the third thing I would say is try

551
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:56,520
and find your one donkey

552
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,160
that can carry the narrative through,

553
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:01,770
because I think it's a lot more helpful to

554
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:05,680
have that one person,
than to be jumping around

555
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,690
and figuring out the
through-line yourself.

556
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:11,730
But yeah, those are my
big, those are my big tips.

557
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:13,365
Wish I could say it was a clean process.

558
00:23:13,365 --> 00:23:14,663
It wasn't. (Nicole laughs)

559
00:23:14,663 --> 00:23:17,090
- Has your recovery been in touch now

560
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:18,370
that your book is a best seller

561
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:22,479
or have you been in touch
with them in any like VPNs?

562
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,720
- They emailed my agent the
day it made the bestseller list

563
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,650
and said, "Looks like we quit too early."

564
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:30,540
So that was good.

565
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,850
They didn't send it to me,
but they sent it to my agent

566
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:34,974
and I I'm probably going to frame it.

567
00:23:34,974 --> 00:23:37,057
(laughs)

568
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,413
- That's awesome.

569
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:45,020
How about, you know, I don't know

570
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:48,270
the Gong Show that his tour was 2020

571
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:50,410
brought a lot of negative things,

572
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:52,130
but in journalism,

573
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:53,543
it seems like there may
be some positive things

574
00:23:53,543 --> 00:23:54,679
that came about it.

575
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,790
You know, I found that
Twitter became such a noise.

576
00:23:57,790 --> 00:23:59,649
The signal noise ratio
just went off the charts.

577
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:02,820
So it felt like people were
actually paying less attention

578
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,520
to Twitter and more attention

579
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:07,129
to long form content and podcasts

580
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:09,370
and kind of more meaningful stuff,

581
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:11,139
any insights to what you're seeing there,

582
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:13,820
any changes that you've witnessed

583
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,530
in ways that you're publishing content

584
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:16,740
that it's been a little different

585
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,403
since the pandemic?

586
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:25,970
Anyone Andy, Kevin?

587
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:29,310
- Well, I guess like
when the pandemic began,

588
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:32,399
I was finishing up, this like the biggest,

589
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,880
the longest feature I've ever
written about Marcus Hutchins

590
00:24:37,301 --> 00:24:40,230
the black hat turned white hats,

591
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:42,920
but then treated like a black
hat by the FBI and arrested

592
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,780
after he had found the kill switch

593
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:47,550
and Wannacry that prevented it's

594
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:49,540
this terrible worm
spread around the world.

595
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:51,250
You probably all know this
Marcus Hutchins such in story,

596
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:53,750
not from me, but just from
like being in the industry.

597
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:56,960
But I was terrified that
nobody wanted to read

598
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,960
anything that wasn't about
COVID-19 back in April of 2020.

599
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:06,650
And then I think like, exactly in May,

600
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:08,950
just before this piece came out,

601
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:10,240
it seemed like people just

602
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,510
got bored of reading
pandemic news and wanting to

603
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:14,090
just read anything else.

604
00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:15,280
And it was just kind of,

605
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,180
it worked out kind of perfectly,

606
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,730
that somehow, as you said Dan,

607
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:21,500
that like people just wanted

608
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,850
almost more like escapist narrative

609
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:25,034
long form stories.

610
00:25:25,035 --> 00:25:28,790
And so that became like
the most read thing

611
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:30,120
I've ever written.

612
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,699
I think just because

613
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,900
it was telling like a totally
different kind of story

614
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,450
and people just could
get wrapped up in it.

615
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:36,360
And they,

616
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,979
at the same time that they
were watching "Tiger King,"

617
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:42,260
they were like wanting to just
a good long drama to follow

618
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:49,210
- Anybody else seen any kind
of meaningful differences?

619
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:50,640
- Well, I do think that

620
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,370
this sort of like the
information overload thing on top

621
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:55,602
of the pandemics or doom scrolling,

622
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:03,080
was a lot and I think
people were looking for

623
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,590
longer explanatory stuff

624
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,703
or fun escapist stuff or both.

625
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,610
So, yeah, I think it was
actually a really good year

626
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:17,610
for narrative nonfiction and
for really good analysis of

627
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,080
where COVID came from and what went wrong.

628
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,031
And I hope,

629
00:26:23,031 --> 00:26:25,373
I hope we're carrying that forward.

630
00:26:25,373 --> 00:26:26,480
I think we are,

631
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,960
I mean everything seems
a little less hyper

632
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,713
than it was through November.

633
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:34,960
And I think,

634
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,100
I hope we emerged from
this like less distracted

635
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:41,580
and more able to focus
on meaningful stuff.

636
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:42,899
It seems like it's possible

637
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,040
it use to be impossible to get anything

638
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,723
on TV that wasn't about Trump.

639
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:50,193
Even if it's like some third rate,

640
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:53,030
first-term Congressman,

641
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:55,330
mouthing off one side or another

642
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:58,310
looks like that's all
anybody was talking about.

643
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:01,513
And I think there's room for
dialogue about more things now.

644
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:04,993
- Great.

645
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,607
So with SolarWinds,

646
00:27:08,607 --> 00:27:13,388
and I just saw the, I think
it's the CEO of SolarWinds

647
00:27:13,388 --> 00:27:15,389
or the CSO of SolarWinds

648
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:18,803
is getting the keynote at RSA this year.

649
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:24,930
Supply chain attacks
seem to be very prominent

650
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:29,090
or it seems to expose something
that I think we've known

651
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:31,280
for quite some time, but at scale.

652
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:34,720
Much like Sony exposed a bunch of things.

653
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,600
And some of these kind
of watershed attacks

654
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:41,620
you can open eyes to
kind of what's possible.

655
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:44,419
Are you guys seeing more
interest in supply chain

656
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:45,510
and kind of attacks that

657
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:48,240
are a little more interesting around that?

658
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,250
You know, in the news or
through research or through some

659
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:51,143
of your sources?

660
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,330
Nicole, you're nodding your head.

661
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:55,633
So I hope that's yes.

662
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,673
- Well, I was just

663
00:27:57,673 --> 00:27:59,620
I was thinking of it,
the last question too

664
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:02,800
about what everyone wanted
to read in the pandemic.

665
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,610
And on some level we all became

666
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:07,219
election reporters last year.

667
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:08,350
And then it turned out

668
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:11,149
that actually we were
looking in the wrong place.

669
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:14,680
And I was part of this group

670
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,800
of reporters who were getting
these briefings by hourly

671
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,730
from DHS on election day.

672
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:24,730
And it's just been stunning
thinking back to that day,

673
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:27,717
and thinking back to Chris Krebs saying,

674
00:28:27,717 --> 00:28:29,700
"It's just another
Tuesday on the internet."

675
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,920
And even hearing from Chad
Wolf, backing up that claim.

676
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,870
And now we know that at that very moment,

677
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:38,010
Russian we think Russian hackers

678
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:39,783
were reading Chad Wolf's emails.

679
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:43,160
It just really gets to the fact that

680
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:46,550
just when you think you have
your hands around one thing

681
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:49,127
you're just thrown in a
completely different direction.

682
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:51,220
But on supply chain attacks,

683
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:53,410
I mean, I think on some level

684
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:56,183
we all knew something
like this was inevitable,

685
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:01,523
and it was just amazing to
call up the spokespeople

686
00:29:01,523 --> 00:29:04,169
at some of the victim agencies,

687
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:06,330
that didn't even know what SolarWinds was

688
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:07,973
or that they were using it.

689
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:12,460
And also amazing that the day it came out,

690
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:14,860
you could just go to SolarWinds website

691
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:17,169
and see that it was used by

692
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:20,680
more than 400 of the
fortune 400 and the Pentagon

693
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,253
and the department of
energy, et cetera, et cetera.

694
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:28,950
But probably what's most
interesting for us is,

695
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:30,550
if this is the SVR,

696
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:34,030
like everyone seems to
think it is, we know them

697
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:35,530
we know them from those hacks,

698
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:38,020
they pulled off in 2014-2015

699
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:40,710
on the white house and
the State Department.

700
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:43,530
And what I remember from that attack

701
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:47,260
is that people described
getting them out of the systems,

702
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:49,710
like hand to hand digital combat.

703
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:51,270
Just because they had been discovered

704
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:53,290
in a hallway didn't mean
they were gonna go out

705
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:56,350
the back door or they were
in there to stay in there.

706
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:57,780
And I think at one point even took

707
00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:01,660
over the RSA NetWitness tool,

708
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:04,680
that was looking to identify
more Russian backdoors.

709
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,050
So the fact that they
were in these systems

710
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:08,230
for more than nine months,

711
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:09,880
is a huge problem.

712
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,960
And it'll be a long time

713
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,897
I think before anyone can confidently say,

714
00:30:12,897 --> 00:30:16,919
"We found every last backdoor
and compromised application."

715
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,360
But I think that good news
with SolarWinds is just

716
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,300
that it leaves the new
administration, no choice

717
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:26,129
but to deal with some of
these things that we've talked

718
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:29,670
about for years and years,
like real-time threat sharing,

719
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:31,670
and possibly a bill of materials.

720
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:33,220
And some of,

721
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,440
I've just been impressed

722
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,403
watching the latest Senate hearing,

723
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:42,300
to see the nuance in the
questions for the first time.

724
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:45,690
Like you, you will usually
watch these hearings wincing,

725
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:50,690
but to see the level of
awareness among lawmakers

726
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,440
jumped up from where it has been,

727
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,810
I think was really impressive.

728
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:58,850
I just, this one is going
to be very hard to unwind.

729
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:01,080
And I think unfortunately,
it's going to dominate most

730
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:03,473
of our lives for the next year.

731
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:05,983
Hopefully not longer.

732
00:31:07,809 --> 00:31:09,710
- And are any of you seeing,

733
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:11,340
sorry, go ahead, Joseph.

734
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,540
- I was just going to add that.

735
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:15,600
Yeah, I agree.

736
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,693
I agree with all of that.

737
00:31:16,693 --> 00:31:19,400
I think SolarWinds is
really interesting and it's

738
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,090
I feel bad for SolarWinds,

739
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:22,708
because it's not just SolarWinds.

740
00:31:22,709 --> 00:31:25,270
There are vectors we don't know about yet.

741
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:27,900
We know that Microsoft was abused

742
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:30,950
their gear was abused pretty badly

743
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:32,370
and there are security companies.

744
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:34,189
They were really after security companies

745
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:35,453
to use that as a vector.

746
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:38,260
Which is, you know

747
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:40,460
it's been a goal for a
while, but to see it,

748
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:45,112
this sophisticated and effort
with this much success,

749
00:31:45,996 --> 00:31:48,363
should be terrifying to people.

750
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,470
Particularly people in this space.

751
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:52,303
I think,

752
00:31:52,303 --> 00:31:55,873
I think supply chain is
one of those big, ugly,

753
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,330
nearly unfixable things.

754
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:02,470
And it'll be interesting to
see how they take a run at it.

755
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:06,500
I think the draft executive order on cyber

756
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:09,520
make some interesting
progress towards that.

757
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:14,050
So agencies have to identify
their most critical software

758
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:17,230
and they have to report,

759
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:19,690
vendors have to report
when they're breached

760
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:21,220
to their government customers.

761
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:23,580
So we're gonna find out a lot about

762
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,003
a lot more hacking this way.

763
00:32:28,693 --> 00:32:29,526
- Great.

764
00:32:31,897 --> 00:32:34,040
What do we think,

765
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,629
any predictions for what are gonna be

766
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:38,140
the big stories over this
next coming year here?

767
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:40,840
Obviously we've got supply,
we've got a new government

768
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:47,040
in the U.S here, lots of change.

769
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:50,600
Hopefully we're on the
good side of here of COVID.

770
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,110
But any predictions on any

771
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:54,139
or what do you believe are
going to be the big stories

772
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:59,080
of kind of the big theme
that comes out from 2021?

773
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:04,080
- I think Ransomware is
going to dominate in 2021.

774
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:08,120
I think, we had,

775
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,580
had there not been a
pandemic and an election,

776
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:12,592
it would have dominated in 2020.

777
00:33:15,347 --> 00:33:17,710
It's something that kind
of started off as a joke,

778
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:20,860
with like CryptoLocker and
hundred dollar ransom demands.

779
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:23,870
And now they're getting a
million dollars at a pop.

780
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:25,850
And they're crippling hospital networks

781
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:28,090
and putting lives in danger.

782
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:31,300
And the Ransomware operations have like

783
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:34,399
they've reached a state of near perfection

784
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:38,270
when it comes to criminal cyber activity.

785
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:40,100
So I think we're gonna see us some

786
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:44,603
serious damage done in
a Ransomware attack.

787
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:51,660
And it's gonna endure
huge, huge amounts of money

788
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:56,003
being lost over the next nine months.

789
00:33:57,770 --> 00:33:59,410
- Yeah. I see there's even brokers now

790
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:01,690
that will broker the
payment of the ransom,

791
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:03,940
which is something you
never really expected.

792
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:06,823
Anybody else, any other themes?

793
00:34:09,279 --> 00:34:11,000
More of the same,

794
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,263
more of the same, a bit
bigger, faster, better?

795
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:18,010
Well, let's, you know, Oh,
sorry go ahead, Joseph.

796
00:34:19,773 --> 00:34:23,600
- Ransomware is my number one
pick for the story of the year

797
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,610
and there are always great
line extensions where

798
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:28,489
they can rob you multiple times.

799
00:34:28,489 --> 00:34:31,058
First to unlock your
stuff and then to stop

800
00:34:31,059 --> 00:34:32,453
me from leaking it.

801
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:37,150
That's gonna be really bad.

802
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:40,330
But there's a number
of real-world conflicts

803
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:42,159
that are heating up,

804
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:44,629
China and the U.S are circling each other

805
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:48,060
and in around Taiwan and other issues.

806
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:50,480
And Russia's got troops right now,

807
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,210
more troops on the border with Ukraine.

808
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:56,940
So I think there's going to
be more cyber kinetic stuff

809
00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:01,393
that causes no real things
to blow up more pain.

810
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:06,070
- Great. Well, believe it or not

811
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:09,040
we are out of time, like any

812
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,100
at least from my perspective,

813
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,420
like any good conversation.

814
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:13,720
And it seems to have gone a lot faster

815
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,403
than I would've expected.

816
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:18,590
The last time I was at RSA was

817
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:20,840
when was that? March, maybe February

818
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,780
late February of 2000,

819
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:24,310
you know right before the pandemic.

820
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:26,520
So certainly

821
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,880
I think that was the last
event that must I've gone

822
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,360
as a matter of fact.

823
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,050
And we didn't really,

824
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:34,270
I think know what was about to happen.

825
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:37,509
So here's hoping that next
year we have the opportunity

826
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,760
whether it's in San Francisco

827
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:41,830
or decided to be somewhere
else to do this in person

828
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:43,210
and kind of get back to

829
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:48,000
a little bit of a more interactive
audience participation.

830
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,800
But I'd like to thank you,
Joseph, Andy, Kevin, and Nicole

831
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:54,270
certainly a pleasure to do this again.

832
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:55,697
I'm super lucky to be able to do this

833
00:35:55,697 --> 00:35:58,280
and to track your
progress has been amazing.

834
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,770
Hopefully you all have
new books in the works

835
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:03,240
and it sounds like Kevin's
got something going on

836
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,424
that he's not telling us,

837
00:36:04,425 --> 00:36:06,150
(laughs)

838
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:07,410
But I look forward

839
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:09,740
to reading those just like your last ones.

840
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:11,189
And thanks a lot for your time.

841
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:13,103
Have a great, have a great time.

842
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,798
- Thanks so much Dan.

843
00:36:15,798 --> 00:36:17,497
- Thanks Dan.
- Next year drinks.
