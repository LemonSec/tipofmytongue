1
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:03,540
- Hello everyone, and welcome.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:04,670
My name is Alyssa Pugh

3
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:07,640
and I am the GRC Content
Manager for Tandem,

4
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,790
an information security
and compliance application.

5
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:13,540
Today, I am here to talk with
you about 10 things to include

6
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,750
in remote work IT risk assessments

7
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,360
and how this type of assessment

8
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,803
promotes operational
resiliency in our businesses.

9
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:24,009
To start, I'd like to ask the question,

10
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:26,220
where were you when we were given 15 days

11
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,640
to slow the spread?

12
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,060
Feel free to go ahead
and type in the Q and A.

13
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,570
I'll be keeping an eye on the questions

14
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:33,360
as we go through our session today.

15
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,589
And I would love to engage

16
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,800
with you during our time together.

17
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,470
For me, at the time, I was
the Tandem support manager.

18
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:42,740
My team had already gone home for the day

19
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:44,950
and I had just finished
wiping down their desks

20
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:47,910
with what I didn't know was
the last supply of Clorox wipes

21
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:49,940
I would see until October.

22
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:51,530
We knew COVID was a risk,

23
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:54,830
and we had already taken some
steps to social distance.

24
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:56,800
But when we received
the city recommendation

25
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,559
to shift to remote operations entirely,

26
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:03,170
that was a whole new ballgame,
but we weren't alone.

27
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:05,160
As the country headed
into a lockdown to slow

28
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,820
the spread of COVID-19,

29
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,580
many organizations were
faced with the question,

30
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,760
how can we continue to conduct business

31
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,040
when we can't be in the office?

32
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,440
Well, this is where remote work came in.

33
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,450
The ability for employees
to work from home

34
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:21,330
and do so effectively was substantial

35
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,490
in this time of uncertainty.

36
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:25,339
As remote work environments flourished,

37
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:28,310
so did a new generation
of security concerns.

38
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:31,960
Business could continue but at what cost?

39
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,179
The conversation quickly changed.

40
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,470
From large multinational organizations

41
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:39,400
to small community financial institutions,

42
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,320
the cybersecurity community is now asking,

43
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,570
how can we ensure a high level of security

44
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:48,523
when so much of the data and
technology is out of our hands?

45
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,720
I believe the first step
in answering this question

46
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,413
can be found in a strong
remote work IT risk assessment.

47
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,620
Some of you may be asking, okay,

48
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,150
so what's an IT risk assessment?

49
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,700
For those of you who may not be familiar

50
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,040
with the underlying concept,

51
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,940
here is a 30-second crash course.

52
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:10,160
An IT risk assessment involves the process

53
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,420
of identifying threats
and vulnerabilities,

54
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:16,570
bad things that could happen
to your systems and data.

55
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:18,310
With that information in mind,

56
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,960
controls should be implemented

57
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,540
to reduce the identified risks.

58
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,340
You should then validate the sufficiency

59
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,530
of those controls and use that information

60
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:29,043
to determine ongoing
risk management plans,

61
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,549
which can help you identify
any additional risks

62
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,453
and start the process all over again.

63
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,930
So for a simple example,
you might consider

64
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:40,700
the risk of a fire in your data center.

65
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,980
Those things can get pretty hot.

66
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:45,179
Realizing a fire could
destroy your systems

67
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,900
or data is identifying a risk.

68
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,970
So to manage the risk of a fire,

69
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:54,690
you might have redundant AC,
fire suppression systems,

70
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:57,030
smoke alarms, things of that nature.

71
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:00,090
These are controls you implement.

72
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:03,570
Let's say an auditor found
that your heat detection system

73
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:05,989
was outdated during a control review.

74
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:07,750
You can then use this information

75
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,900
to create an ongoing plan
to mitigate this risk

76
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:14,513
and then assess the risk of a
heat detection system failure.

77
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,850
So how does all of this
apply to remote work

78
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:21,900
and what value is there in conducting

79
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,863
a remote work IT risk assessment?

80
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,220
Well, from my point of view,

81
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,790
there are four primary reasons to conduct

82
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:30,773
a remote work IT risk assessment.

83
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:34,590
Number one, it can help
you comply with laws

84
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:38,530
and regulations about data
privacy and information security.

85
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:40,750
That's the C in GRC.

86
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,500
But since this is the risk
management and governance track,

87
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,833
we are going to focus on these
other three areas for today.

88
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:50,210
A second reason is because it can help you

89
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:51,520
discover vulnerabilities,

90
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,350
which may be facing your systems

91
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:56,320
and data that you may not be aware of.

92
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,440
It can also help you
identify what controls

93
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:02,470
you need to have implemented
in your remote environments.

94
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:05,000
And finally, through a gap
analysis, you can determine

95
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,390
if there are any areas that
need additional protection,

96
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:11,313
which is common for up and
coming remote environments.

97
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:17,019
So our primary topic today is
10 things you should consider

98
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:20,169
including in your remote
work IT risk assessment.

99
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:21,769
As part of that, we are going to look

100
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:24,549
at a variety of risks, vulnerabilities,

101
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,430
controls, and threats.

102
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:28,730
And as a disclaimer, this is going to look

103
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:31,810
a little bit like a countdown,
but it isn't really.

104
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:34,250
Each of these items we
discuss today is important

105
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,820
to consider when securing
your remote work function,

106
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,469
and some may be more applicable

107
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:39,993
to your business than others.

108
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:45,120
The purpose of this conversation
is to expand our horizons,

109
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,760
consider a variety of risks and controls,

110
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,980
and then use that information
to improve our resilience

111
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:53,180
as we move throughout
the rest of this year.

112
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:59,840
So let's go ahead and jump on
into number 10 on our list,

113
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,549
which is what I'm going to call

114
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:04,410
unauthorized data transmission.

115
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:05,540
That name says it all.

116
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:08,210
This is about the risk you
face when data is removed

117
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:12,203
from your systems and transmitted
to unauthorized systems.

118
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,640
When it comes to working remotely,

119
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,300
some unauthorized
transmission of data happens

120
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,500
due to the convenience
over security factor.

121
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,070
To get the job done more quickly,

122
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,670
employees may be tempted
to use personal devices

123
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:27,890
for business purposes.

124
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:31,219
For example, they might use
things like personal email

125
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:35,990
or removable media, or
perhaps the most prevalent,

126
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:39,520
personal cloud storage devices
like Dropbox or Google Drive

127
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,729
as a way to transmit data
from one system to another.

128
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:45,780
Sometimes unauthorized
transmission of data

129
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,179
is not intentional and it can happen

130
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,580
due to proximity of being in
close contact with others,

131
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:55,120
family members, roommates,
hipsters at the coffee house.

132
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,980
I had an interesting conversation
with a security auditor

133
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:01,080
not too long ago about this very topic.

134
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,430
He posed the question,

135
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:04,500
should family members of remote staff

136
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:08,020
be required to sign
non-disclosure agreements?

137
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:10,969
Now, that might be a little extreme.

138
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:14,050
Non-disclosure is typically
addressed in employee contracts.

139
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:16,430
However, sometimes walls are very thin

140
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:18,183
and living rooms are very open.

141
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:24,350
Another form to consider is
unencrypted communications.

142
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,600
Ross from HR and Monica from billing

143
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,410
likely don't have the same
security know-how as you do.

144
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:31,750
And their home networks
probably do not offer

145
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,490
the same levels of security

146
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:35,930
as what is offered in the office.

147
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:39,670
So I'm curious, these are just
a few examples we've seen.

148
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:41,800
What are some other ways
that you've seen data

149
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,930
removed from your organization's network?

150
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:45,940
Feel free to go ahead and leave a comment

151
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,090
in the chat about that.

152
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:50,080
While you're typing those in,

153
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,099
I'm going to ask a rhetorical question.

154
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,290
Why do we care about this?

155
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,530
Well, unauthorized transmission of data,

156
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:00,169
be it intentional or unintentional,

157
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,600
can result in the unauthorized disclosure,

158
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,040
misuse, destruction of your data.

159
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,370
So those are just a few
ways this can happen

160
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:09,710
and are an important factor to consider

161
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:11,969
in your remote work IT risk assessment

162
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,109
Thankfully, each of these
risks we discussed today

163
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:19,520
also comes with compensating controls.

164
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,060
So one of those key
controls you'll want to have

165
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:25,930
in your remote work IT risk
assessment is data encryption.

166
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:28,563
Keep your friends close
and your encryption closer.

167
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,370
In your remote work IT risk assessment,

168
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:34,420
you really should be
asking a few questions.

169
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:37,210
First, is sensitive data
allowed to be stored

170
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:39,219
on remote staff workstations?

171
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:41,583
And if so, is that data encrypted?

172
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,960
Then when remote staff
need to transmit data

173
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,070
to and from outside locations,

174
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:50,400
like your company network
or a cloud service provider,

175
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,532
is that data encrypted in transit?

176
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:56,410
Finally, when the data
reaches its destination,

177
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:59,920
is the data encrypted
effectively there as well?

178
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,030
If you answered no

179
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:03,750
or I'm not sure to any of those questions,

180
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:07,140
those are actionable items
you can begin researching now

181
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:09,823
to you help manage your
remote work IT risk.

182
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,620
If you answered yes to those questions,

183
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,840
well, first, congratulations,

184
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,780
but I have an extra
credit assignment for you.

185
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:21,330
I want you to think about
and answer the question,

186
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:24,359
are you sure and can you prove it?

187
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,040
I had the opportunity to meet

188
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,360
with a group of bank examiners last year.

189
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,130
And one of the concerns they expressed

190
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:33,140
was that in many smaller
organizations they worked with,

191
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,710
there was an apparent disconnect

192
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:37,773
between the org's risk
management and audit functions.

193
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:43,390
I also had the opportunity to
ask a group of risk managers

194
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,560
who work for financial institutions

195
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,869
what their organizations did to ensure

196
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:50,253
their teams securely transmitted data.

197
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,630
Participants were asked to
select all that applied.

198
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:56,830
And what we found was
that the required a VPN

199
00:08:56,830 --> 00:09:00,490
for any business data and/or
they provided training

200
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:02,693
over how to secure home networks.

201
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:05,440
20% went above and beyond

202
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,950
and said that they actually
audited employee home networks,

203
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:12,333
while 11% said they don't
do any of these things.

204
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,900
You se, as risk managers, we really care

205
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:20,310
about ensuring our risk is
reduced to an acceptable level.

206
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:23,609
However, implementing controls
is only half the battle.

207
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:25,360
Controls must also be validated

208
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,850
to ensure they are
functioning as expected.

209
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:31,193
And this is a vital key
to ensuring resilience.

210
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:36,469
So I'm curious to know what are you doing

211
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:39,370
to ensure that your
business data is secure?

212
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,780
As you're thinking about that,

213
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,170
and don't forget to leave
a comment in the chat,

214
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:44,589
let's talk about four ways

215
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:46,993
you can validate the
control of data encryption.

216
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:51,000
Number one, if you have
them, you should review

217
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,520
your data encryption
policy and procedures.

218
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,060
If you don't, now is a good time to start.

219
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,660
These should define what
data should be encrypted

220
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:00,670
and can help you assess

221
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:03,223
whether expectations are being met or not.

222
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:08,180
Number two, check device
configuration settings.

223
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,219
Are devices configured in accordance

224
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,650
with the company's
policies and procedures?

225
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,890
Number three, perform
security assessments,

226
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:20,110
like vulnerability assessments
and penetration tests.

227
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,920
Have someone else look at your systems

228
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,170
and tell you if data is
being adequately encrypted.

229
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:27,110
Then use this information to inform

230
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,893
your risk management practices.

231
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:33,760
And four, oversee
third-party arrangements.

232
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,000
Request security documentation
from them like SOC reports

233
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,330
or other proof of testing that validates

234
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:42,090
they have implemented the
same level of controls

235
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:44,653
that you would implement
for the data they store.

236
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:48,800
Whether this control is
about reducing the risk

237
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,620
of someone eavesdropping on data sent

238
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:53,250
over one of your team
member's home networks

239
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,570
or if it's about ensuring malicious actors

240
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:58,300
can't access data on a workstation,

241
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,930
data encryption is going
to be a valuable control

242
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:04,162
to consider in your remote
work IT risk assessment.

243
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:07,810
Number eight on our list

244
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:11,729
is what I'm going to call
exploitation by cyber attack.

245
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:13,130
When we're talking about this risk,

246
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,230
we're talking about a wide range of events

247
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:18,210
that could disrupt, disable
or maliciously control

248
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:21,350
someone's workstation
or could grant the actor

249
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:23,380
unauthorized access to data,

250
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:26,083
which can result in a
whole lot of problems.

251
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,430
In today's age, I would be surprised

252
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:32,020
if this was not one of your top risks

253
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:34,530
in any kind of technical assessment,

254
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:36,510
but it does take on a unique flavor

255
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:39,500
when it comes to remote
work IT risk management

256
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,793
for a few reasons.

257
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:44,530
First, as we've already briefly discussed,

258
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:47,709
remote work offers a very
different environment.

259
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:49,160
I remember one phone call I had

260
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,839
with an IT specialist
for a community bank.

261
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,800
He was asking about
how to update their BCP

262
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,410
to address remote workstations.

263
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:58,870
I asked about their environment,

264
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:02,570
expecting to hear something
about laptops or VPNs.

265
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:05,330
So you can imagine my
surprise when he answered,

266
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:07,100
well, I'm not sure just yet,

267
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,080
Best Buy is supposed to
be shipping the systems

268
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,453
to their homes this week.

269
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:14,700
Another I visited said that
they didn't have enough

270
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:18,870
remote workstations to send
home with their remote workers,

271
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:21,770
I'm sorry, laptops to send
home with their remote workers.

272
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:24,650
I'm sure there are many
other stories like these.

273
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:26,510
And in any of these kinds of scenarios,

274
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:28,640
there are issues with a lack of controls

275
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,040
and greater structural inconsistencies

276
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,300
that can cause something like exploitation

277
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,622
by cyber attack to be
particularly damaging.

278
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:39,949
From another perspective,

279
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:41,750
there's a different awareness of threats

280
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,900
associated with remote work.

281
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:47,250
Home is or at least
should be a safe space.

282
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,930
When you trade the office for home,

283
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:50,959
you trade security awareness posters

284
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,350
for hang in there cat posters.

285
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:56,320
You trade conversations with
colleagues about security

286
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,050
for conversations with
four-year-olds about grapes.

287
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:02,430
Working from home results
in this Frankenstein

288
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:04,640
kind of problem for risk managers

289
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,750
where the safety of your home collides

290
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:10,280
with the need for security
awareness you are surrounded by

291
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,543
when you work in an office space.

292
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,819
I'll be referring to some
outside sources today.

293
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,940
And for further reading,
all of the sources

294
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:22,320
can be found on the final
references slide in the deck.

295
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,170
That said, two fascinating figures

296
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:29,060
from the IBM Cost of a Data
Breach Report last year

297
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:32,410
indicated that 76% of
their survey respondents

298
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:35,459
said remote work would
increase the time to identify

299
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,410
and contain a data breach.

300
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:39,730
While 70% of those respondents

301
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:41,930
said that it would likewise increase

302
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:44,083
the cost of a data breach.

303
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:47,380
Now, why do you think that is?

304
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:49,350
Malicious actors are sneaky.

305
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:51,730
It can take months and
even years sometimes

306
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,600
to discover certain types of attacks

307
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,880
in our current environments.

308
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,170
The long-term security
effects of remote work

309
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,420
are yet to be seen but to
ensure we can be resilient

310
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,599
when things begin coming to light,

311
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,640
it's imperative that we assess
the risk of exploitation

312
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:10,742
by cyber attack on our
current remote environments.

313
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,310
The cyber attack of ransomware

314
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:17,479
is a particular concern these days.

315
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,850
And if ransomware attacks
have taught us anything,

316
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:22,040
it's that data backup is essential

317
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:26,219
in recovering from many types
of destructive cyber events.

318
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:29,570
The problem is that remote
systems are often overlooked

319
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:32,983
when it comes to data backup
processes and procedures.

320
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,040
So the first thing you'll want to know

321
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:39,260
is what the company data backup policy is

322
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,569
for backing up remote systems.

323
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:43,290
Start by answering the question,

324
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:45,290
do you have a data backup policy?

325
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:47,610
And if so, does it address remote systems

326
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:49,803
or do you address this in another way?

327
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,740
It might be difficult to
back up employee systems

328
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,910
that are remote.

329
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:57,670
So a second question to ask would be,

330
00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:00,349
do you require employees
to store sensitive data

331
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:02,283
on the organization's network?

332
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,600
Another way of looking at it would be

333
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,950
if their local machine became compromised,

334
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:11,873
lost or stolen, would you be
able to get your data back?

335
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,790
One way to verify your data
backup procedures are effective

336
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,740
would be to examine your most recent

337
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:21,600
backup restoration results.

338
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,690
Even if you do backup remote systems,

339
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:25,700
the data is of no use to you

340
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,030
if you cannot successfully restore it.

341
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:30,850
So you should be testing
these items periodically

342
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:33,780
to ensure that this control
would promote resiliency

343
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,230
in your remote work function.

344
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:40,520
One popular gateway attackers like to use

345
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:44,773
to exploit your systems can be
found in social engineering.

346
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,880
Social engineering has a unique effect

347
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,900
related to working from home.

348
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:52,459
One reason, and probably
pertinent to the reason

349
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:55,010
that so many are working
from home right now,

350
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:56,490
our minds are elsewhere.

351
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:59,010
You know, kids, politics, pandemics,

352
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:01,580
just to name a few minor examples.

353
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:04,450
And to make a difficult situation worse,

354
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:07,873
malicious actors are
capitalizing on the distractions.

355
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,000
On July 30th of last year,

356
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,200
the Financial Crimes
Enforcement Network or FinCEN

357
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,710
published an advisory on
COVID related cybercrime.

358
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:21,050
Among other threats,
FinCEN highlights phishing

359
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:22,853
as one of particular concern.

360
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:26,870
In the statement, they say
that since January 2020,

361
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:29,400
tens of thousands of new
domains have been registered

362
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,850
with terms related to
COVID-19 and/or disaster

363
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:35,800
and healthcare response,
such as quarantine,

364
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:40,579
vaccine, CDC, with many
including or mimicking names

365
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,160
of companies that provide

366
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,593
or enable teleworking capabilities.

367
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:50,070
And we've seen those
domains be put into effect.

368
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:51,750
In August, the Cybersecurity

369
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,760
and Infrastructure Security Agency or CISA

370
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,610
published an alert regarding
a particularly prevalent

371
00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:00,370
phishing scam about a
malicious cyber actor,

372
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:04,099
spoofing COVID-19 loan relief web pages.

373
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:06,829
The email had a subject of SBA Application

374
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:09,889
Review and Proceed and ask
recipients to click a link

375
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:12,790
to a mock webpage designed
to steal their credentials.

376
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:15,143
So super friendly stuff
going on right there.

377
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:20,550
While email phishing is by
far the most common form

378
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:23,750
of social engineering,
it isn't the only one.

379
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,810
A recent notification published
by the FBI highlighted

380
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:29,360
a recent trend in vishing attacks

381
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,433
or phishing via phone
calls using VoIP platforms.

382
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,409
You know them, you've received them.

383
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:38,200
I personally have one
about a dozen cruises,

384
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,260
my car's warranty has been about to expire

385
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,260
for three years now,

386
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,580
and apparently my great grandma

387
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:46,139
needs a Home Depot gift card.

388
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,180
What all of this means
is that malicious actors

389
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:50,810
are capitalizing on current environments

390
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:52,730
and are going to try and stop at nothing

391
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:57,010
to try and phish unsuspecting
individuals however they can.

392
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:59,470
And your remote work IT risk assessments

393
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:00,813
should account for that.

394
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:06,780
So how do you prevent things like this?

395
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,139
While you can't stop attackers

396
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:10,200
from trying to compromise your team,

397
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,330
you can teach your team what to look for

398
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:16,090
and how to respond when
they are social engineered.

399
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:18,149
You know the old saying, give a man a fish

400
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:19,480
and he'll eat for a day.

401
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,430
Well, teach a man to watch for phish,

402
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:23,203
and you will thank yourself later.

403
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,790
If you aren't talking about

404
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:27,820
and providing regular
resources to your teams

405
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:31,330
related to remote work, like
the importance of encryption,

406
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:34,389
anti-malware, physical
security, strong passwords,

407
00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:36,740
mobile device security, and recognizing

408
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,350
and responding to security incidents,

409
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:41,709
this is a great way to build resilience,

410
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:44,290
and is something you can start doing today

411
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,562
to reduce your remote work IT risk.

412
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,200
Security awareness
training is often viewed

413
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,160
as a compliance requirement.

414
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,910
And it's not infallible
because of the human element.

415
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:59,220
However, providing helpful
training certainly can't hurt

416
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:01,470
when so much of the data and technology

417
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:03,033
is not in your hands.

418
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,930
If you aren't quite sure
where to get started

419
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:08,990
with training on remote work practices,

420
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:10,700
I have five great resources

421
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,150
I would like to recommend for you.

422
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:16,420
First, CISA has been on
point with their resources

423
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,720
in the last year.

424
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,690
Whether you need ideas on topics

425
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:22,420
to include in your training
or just a solid resource

426
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,800
to share with your team,

427
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,310
I would recommend Security Tip 15-002

428
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:30,040
over home network security.

429
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,480
This resource goes over
why securing home networks

430
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,720
is important, as well as
provide several recommendations

431
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:39,090
or practical steps your teams can take

432
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:40,659
to secure their home environments,

433
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:44,010
such as patching software,
adjusting default configurations

434
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:46,873
and using anti-malware
on their home devices.

435
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:51,200
A second resource I want to recommend

436
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,820
is the CIS Controls Telework

437
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:56,800
and Small Office Network Security Guide.

438
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:00,169
This resource is longer and
gets a little more technical

439
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:04,650
but it offers great insights
on how networks function.

440
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:06,840
It goes over types of
devices that might be part

441
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,220
of an employee's home network.

442
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:11,150
And it provides a checklist
for employees to follow

443
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:13,923
to make sure that their
home networks are secure.

444
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:19,450
Last year, the National
Credit Union Association,

445
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:22,070
or NCUA, published a risk alert

446
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:26,020
called Cybersecurity
Considerations for Remote Work.

447
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:28,800
This guidance, while
intended for credit unions,

448
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,889
really applies to all of us.

449
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:33,330
It addresses risks facing remote workers

450
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:35,590
and provides actionable steps you can take

451
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:37,800
to prepare employees for preventing

452
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,133
and responding to security incidents.

453
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,910
Another resource is the
Federal News Network

454
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:48,160
executive briefing over
securing the remote workforce,

455
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,350
sponsored by RSA.

456
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:52,250
Designed to be shared
with senior management

457
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,790
and the board of directors,

458
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:56,460
this resource is an
excellent brief summary,

459
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,420
describing the challenges of remote work

460
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:01,193
and security needs as
we move into the future.

461
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,230
And finally, if you're
not sharing one already,

462
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:07,660
I would encourage you to subscribe

463
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:10,250
to a security awareness
software application.

464
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:12,680
There are a number of good
solutions on the market

465
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,070
designed to help educate
and test your employees

466
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:18,373
on their preparedness for
social engineering attacks.

467
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,000
So these are just a
few available resources

468
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,080
I found particularly
helpful, but I'm curious,

469
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,040
what resources have you found helpful

470
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:30,360
when it comes to training
staff on remote work practices?

471
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,110
Go ahead and leave a comment in the chat

472
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:33,602
and feel free to let us know.

473
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,880
When it comes to determining

474
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,960
if your security awareness
training program is effective,

475
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,930
there are four things
you'll want to look at.

476
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:46,260
Number one, what do your training policy

477
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:50,040
and procedures say about
training on remote work?

478
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,170
Number two, how frequently
are you conducting training?

479
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:56,193
Is it an annual thing or
is it part of your culture?

480
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:00,330
Number three, are you
training on the right topics?

481
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:02,733
So is it timely and is it relevant?

482
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:07,180
And four, and what I'd
say is the most important,

483
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,950
are your employees learning?

484
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:12,760
With an effective security
awareness training program,

485
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,110
everyone can feel a
sense of responsibility

486
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:17,572
for securing their remote environments.

487
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:23,110
Number four on our list
of things to include

488
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:25,120
in your remote work IT risk assessment

489
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,399
is unauthorized use of information assets.

490
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,170
This is basically a fancy
way of saying your team

491
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:33,883
using work things for non-work purposes.

492
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:38,290
When we, and more
importantly our workstations,

493
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:40,000
are in the office,

494
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,960
yes, there is some risk
of unauthorized use.

495
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,700
But when we take our laptops home

496
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,550
and set up shop in the living room,

497
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:48,550
it can be challenging to have the system

498
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:50,580
and the data so easily accessible

499
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:53,370
by spouses, roommates, or children

500
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:56,959
who want to binge-watch the
latest Marvel installments,

501
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,580
pets who think the keyboard
keys look like snacks.

502
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,679
And yes, this happened
to one of my team members

503
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,793
during quarantine.

504
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,480
Or even ourselves when
all of the other devices

505
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,903
in the house are booked.

506
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,600
I say all of this to drive home the point

507
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,550
that the risk of unauthorized
use does increase

508
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:14,923
in a remote environment.

509
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:20,180
Last year, one ISO I know sent
a company-wide notification

510
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:23,290
to remind staff about their
acceptable use policy.

511
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:25,790
He encouraged everyone to
not use company systems

512
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:30,700
to run personal software for
gaming, streaming and trading.

513
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,440
Unauthorized use happens

514
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,220
but it's important to account for that

515
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:37,920
in a remote work IT risk
assessment because it could result

516
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:41,230
in the unauthorized
access, misuse, disclosure,

517
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:44,063
or destruction of your
company systems and data.

518
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:50,030
So besides an acceptable use policy,

519
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:53,470
since we all know how much
everyone loves to read those,

520
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:55,370
how do you stop it?

521
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:57,320
Well, one way would be to implement

522
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,710
secure access restrictions.

523
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:02,460
If your employees aren't
running as local administrators,

524
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,810
this significantly limits their ability

525
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:06,540
to perform certain actions

526
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:08,562
like installing unauthorized software.

527
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:11,580
And it can reduce the potential damage

528
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:14,453
if some kind of malware is
introduced to the environment.

529
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,160
When it comes to limiting
local administrator access,

530
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,780
there are four things you'll want to do

531
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:23,863
to make sure that you have
this implemented correctly.

532
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:26,510
First, if you have one,

533
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:30,140
review your user access
control policy and procedures.

534
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,740
Are you seeing a trend yet?

535
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:35,070
Define who is authorized to
run as a local administrator

536
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:36,490
and keep it to a minimum,

537
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:38,783
especially for those working from home.

538
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,020
Two, regularly review user access

539
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:46,053
to make sure the right
people have the right access.

540
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:49,350
Three, check your configuration settings

541
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:51,350
to make sure that for new systems,

542
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:54,429
especially those just being
shipped to the employee's house,

543
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:57,543
employees don't accidentally
get elevated privileges.

544
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:02,260
And four, finally, perform
security assessments

545
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:03,830
like vulnerability assessments

546
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,270
to you have someone else tell you

547
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:08,110
if any users are running
as local administrators

548
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:09,260
when they shouldn't be.

549
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:14,270
Going hand in hand with
our previous control,

550
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:15,530
our second thing to include

551
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:17,470
in a remote work IT risk assessment

552
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:21,690
is the potential use of
unauthorized applications.

553
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:24,460
In a remote work environment,
an increased likelihood

554
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:27,360
of unauthorized applications
like video conferencing,

555
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,659
messaging, file sharing,

556
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:33,430
may occur for business
or personal purposes.

557
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:35,000
If it happens, it could result

558
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,340
in things like unauthorized disclosure

559
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:41,260
to third parties, for those third parties

560
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:44,360
that may not be authorized
to see that type of data

561
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:48,142
or vulnerable applications
being installed on your systems.

562
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:53,880
I'm going to pick on one
application in particular.

563
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,540
As a result of the pandemic,

564
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:57,860
Zoom reached the Kleenex gold status

565
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:00,439
every software developer hopes to reach.

566
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:03,200
The moment that your company
name becomes synonymous

567
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,690
with the product, I mean,
that's the dream, right?

568
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,980
Zoom became a household name overnight.

569
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:12,300
And since we were all working
from home, authorized or not,

570
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:15,750
it became a business
name overnight as well.

571
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,520
Unauthorized video conferencing apps

572
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,180
may seem like a small thing.

573
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:22,250
However, widespread use
of freeware applications

574
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:24,190
can expose a number of security issues

575
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:26,920
and vulnerabilities as we've seen.

576
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:30,010
Some companies like Zoom
have worked diligently

577
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:32,500
to amend the vulnerabilities
and have published pages

578
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:35,060
on their websites about
their security practices

579
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:37,389
to be overly clear about their stance

580
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:38,913
on protecting your data.

581
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,160
But it's still a risk.

582
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:46,600
According to a CISA
alert, due to COVID-19,

583
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,250
an increasing number of
individuals and organizations

584
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:52,490
are turning to online
communication platforms,

585
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:56,540
such as Zoom and Microsoft
Teams for online meetings.

586
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:59,230
In turn, malicious cyber
actors are hijacking

587
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:01,440
these online meetings that aren't secured

588
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,223
with passwords or that
use unpatched software.

589
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:07,850
I asked the same group of risk managers

590
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:10,909
about their use of video
conferencing platforms.

591
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:13,930
What we found was that 47% were rock stars

592
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:16,700
and said that they had
performed due diligence.

593
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:19,820
Surprisingly though, more
than half responded somewhat,

594
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,483
no or I don't know.

595
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,610
Trust but verify is the mantra
of the security community.

596
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:29,040
What this shows though, is
that we are very trusting

597
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,610
of software applications, which is good

598
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:33,760
as long as we have done
appropriate due diligence

599
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,640
to ensure our third
party service providers

600
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,713
care about our data as much as we do.

601
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:43,340
So what can you do?

602
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:45,929
When it comes to the risk of
unauthorized applications,

603
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:49,660
you should be asking and
answering three questions.

604
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:51,580
First, you should ask the question,

605
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:54,110
what applications are being used?

606
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:56,163
You can't protect what you don't know.

607
00:27:57,290 --> 00:27:59,070
You should also ask the question,

608
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:02,100
what data is being stored
in the applications?

609
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,300
If sensitive or confidential information

610
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:07,260
is being transmitted or
stored by the application,

611
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,960
you definitely want to know that.

612
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,860
So that, three, you can ask the question,

613
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:15,610
have we performed adequate
third-party risk management?

614
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,510
Do you know what data they store

615
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:19,550
and how they protect your data?

616
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:21,379
Who can access your data?

617
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:23,380
What does your agreement with them say?

618
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:26,143
What happens if their
services become unavailable?

619
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,530
Well, these are timeless principles

620
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:32,090
that apply regardless of
where your team works.

621
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:34,679
The risks presented by
unauthorized applications

622
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:38,420
is definitely increased
in remote environment

623
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:41,660
as we look to tools that can
increase our productivity

624
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:43,283
outside of the office.

625
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:48,260
The last topic we're
going to discuss today

626
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,550
is effective patch management,

627
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:52,000
perhaps one of the biggest hurdles

628
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,643
when it comes to remote work.

629
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:58,020
RSA discussed this very topic
in one of their recent eBooks

630
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:00,860
over cyber risk and the remote workforce.

631
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:03,320
The booklet talks about how
it can be more challenging

632
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:06,000
to harden employee devices
when they are outside

633
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,750
of the workplace perimeter.

634
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:10,200
And that security teams
may not be as easily able

635
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,460
to ensure employees keep
their systems patched.

636
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,653
So what can you do?

637
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:18,380
Some questions to ask and answer

638
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:20,550
regarding patch management include,

639
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,639
does your patch management program

640
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,240
outline how you plan to
ensure remote systems

641
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:28,380
connecting to the network are protected?

642
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:31,190
How are you planning to
update those systems?

643
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:33,570
And besides operating system patches,

644
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:36,330
how are you ensuring things
like applications installed

645
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:39,893
on employee systems and
firmware are also being updated?

646
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,030
Over the last few months,

647
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:44,800
we have received several questions

648
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,180
about how to patch remote systems.

649
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:48,960
What we've found is that
it really comes down

650
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,323
to three methods.

651
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,120
Method one is to install updates

652
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:57,689
when a device is connected to
the organization's network.

653
00:29:57,690 --> 00:29:59,930
A pro of this method is that the company

654
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:02,800
has more control over
when patches are installed

655
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,370
on the device.

656
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:07,270
A con would be that
devices may not always have

657
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:08,840
the most recent patches,

658
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:12,213
which could open up certain
systems to vulnerabilities.

659
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:15,979
Method two is to configure devices

660
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,420
to automatically install updates.

661
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,830
A pro of this method would be

662
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:22,179
that the device will always
have the latest patches,

663
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:24,500
assuming your employees
restart their systems

664
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,410
every once in a while.

665
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:28,850
A con would be that you
can't test how it works

666
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:31,939
or how it integrates with other
applications on the system

667
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:33,730
before it's installed.

668
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:36,600
The question would be is
the risk worth the benefit

669
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:40,112
of being able to patch the
already vulnerable areas?

670
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:44,960
Method number three is to install updates

671
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:49,420
when your team presents devices
for physical inspection.

672
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:52,440
While this wasn't entirely
an option during COVID,

673
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,140
it is something to consider going forward.

674
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,980
A pro is that a physical inspection

675
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:00,470
allows your team to assess
the device's physical state

676
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:02,963
in addition to its logical state.

677
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:05,820
A con would be finding the right balance

678
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:08,820
with regard to frequency
and inspection methods

679
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:11,110
since employees may live across the city

680
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:12,582
or around the world.

681
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:17,240
There are a lot of ways to make
sure patches are installed,

682
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:21,060
and even some applications to
help you with this process.

683
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:24,080
Ultimately, it's about finding
the best solution for you

684
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,179
and making sure that
your systems are patched.

685
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:29,720
If you have found a great
way to manage patches,

686
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,120
feel free to go ahead and
leave a comment in the chat.

687
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,693
I would love to hear
from you on this topic.

688
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:40,580
And with that, we have covered
our 10 things to include

689
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:43,810
in a remote work IT risk assessments.

690
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:45,220
So as we wrap up today,

691
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:48,273
I have some key takeaways
and action steps for you.

692
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:54,230
According to Presidential
Policy Directive, PPD-21,

693
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:56,350
resilience is the ability to prepare for

694
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:59,449
and adapt to changing
conditions and withstand

695
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:02,140
and recover rapidly from disruptions.

696
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:04,440
In other words, resilience is the ability

697
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:07,410
to identify the risks
facing your organization

698
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:10,830
and implement controls
to manage that risk.

699
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:14,189
Remote work is one small
part of a bigger picture

700
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:17,410
but it is one with pressing
and long-term consequences

701
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:20,580
if steps aren't taken now
to successfully govern

702
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,689
and manage that risk.

703
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:24,103
So what can you do?

704
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:26,780
Well, the first thing you should do

705
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:28,820
some time in the next week is determine

706
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:31,120
what your remote workforce looks like.

707
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,889
You can do this by asking a few questions.

708
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:36,750
Number one, who works remotely?

709
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:38,850
Do all of your staff work remotely

710
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:42,352
or it just a subset like
maybe only certain positions?

711
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:47,100
Number two, do you expect
that number to change?

712
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,459
Does your organization
expect to have team members

713
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:51,190
working remotely in the future

714
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:53,363
or will that number be decreasing?

715
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,030
And on a very related note,
how much longer do you plan

716
00:32:58,030 --> 00:33:00,460
to have staff working remotely?

717
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:03,430
Is your team remote
only due to the pandemic

718
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:06,503
or is this a strategic
direction you want to go?

719
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:09,490
Having answers to these
questions can provide

720
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:12,240
valuable objective data
for you to consider

721
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,490
when you are conducting
your risk assessment.

722
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:19,020
So your next step is
to identify key risks.

723
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:21,343
And here's how I would
recommend you do that.

724
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,760
First, block off an hour
or two on your calendar

725
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,879
some time in the next month to create

726
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,523
some focus time for yourself.

727
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,030
Then create a list of the
key risks you are facing.

728
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:34,820
Start with the ones we covered today.

729
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:36,679
And I have a more extensive resource

730
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,153
for you at the very end.

731
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,960
Then prioritize your risks

732
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,100
by asking how likely is
it that this could occur

733
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:46,500
and how much damage could it cause.

734
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,430
This will help you get a clear picture

735
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:50,543
of the areas of highest need.

736
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:54,879
With your risks in mind,
you can then take steps

737
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,110
to assess your control environment.

738
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:59,750
Start by asking what remote work controls

739
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:01,410
do you have in place?

740
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:04,090
Again, begin with the ones
that we started with today.

741
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:06,540
And ask the questions, do we encrypt data?

742
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,400
Is our remote work training adequate?

743
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,283
Things like that.

744
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:13,009
Once you know if the controls are in place

745
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:15,710
and how they reduce risk, you can then ask

746
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:18,483
if the controls reduce risk
to an acceptable level.

747
00:34:19,851 --> 00:34:21,510
And if not ask the question,

748
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:23,800
what do we need to do to improve?

749
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:27,020
Another term for this is
performing a gap analysis.

750
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:30,050
It's about finding the difference
between where you are now

751
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:31,600
and where you would like to be.

752
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:36,449
And finally, communicate with management.

753
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:38,520
First, use the results of your assessment

754
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,750
to inform management.

755
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:42,190
As much as I'm sure your managers

756
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:44,449
would love another
spreadsheet on their desks,

757
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:46,889
I would encourage you to
use your risk assessment

758
00:34:46,889 --> 00:34:49,100
to tell a story.

759
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,759
Let them know of some of the challenges

760
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,300
that are facing your organization

761
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:55,230
because of remote work and consequences

762
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:57,480
should the risks occur.

763
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:00,120
All hope is not lost because
there are some good things

764
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:03,450
you're doing now to protect
your data and manage that risk

765
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:04,903
but it could be better.

766
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:07,650
So you should also use the results

767
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:10,390
to request their assistance.

768
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:12,569
Find out what the long-term strategy is

769
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:15,550
for remote work and
potentially use your knowledge

770
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:18,520
and your information on the risks

771
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,893
to help influence this conversation.

772
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,700
With the strategy in mind, you can ask

773
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,960
for resources needed to close those gaps

774
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,270
in your control maturity
and encourage their support

775
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:32,533
as you work to implement new controls.

776
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,880
So let's walk through an example together

777
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,650
of what this might look like.

778
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:40,580
To set our stage, we're going
to say we have team members

779
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:43,170
working from home longterm.

780
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:45,560
Starting with exploitation
by cyber attack,

781
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,390
we know this is a key risk
because it has an extreme

782
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:51,223
inherent likelihood and potential damage.

783
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:53,860
I know we don't allow team members

784
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,650
to run as local administrators.

785
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:57,640
I also know we use anti-malware.

786
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,589
We encrypt data.

787
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:01,510
And security awareness
is part of our culture.

788
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:03,180
So now we ask the question,

789
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:06,859
do these controls reduce
risks to an acceptable level?

790
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,210
I would say no.

791
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:10,630
While they offer good benefits,
there's still room to grow.

792
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:12,820
So in an upcoming report to management,

793
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:15,990
I might say something like
in recent evaluations,

794
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:18,950
we have discovered an
extreme risk of exploitation

795
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:22,279
by cyber attack on our remote operations.

796
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,920
This could expose our organization

797
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,450
to heightened operational, financial,

798
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:29,143
reputation and legal consequences.

799
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:32,060
Certain controls are in place,

800
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,900
but we are missing some key controls,

801
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:37,850
which could reduce the risk
to an acceptable level.

802
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:41,549
I recommend we implement new
patch management processes

803
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:44,910
and request that we tune our
intrusion detection systems

804
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:48,473
to increase alerts while we
adjust to this new environment.

805
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:53,020
What I hope this shows you is
that by investing a few hours

806
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:55,660
into a remote work IT risk assessment,

807
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:57,623
you can build a strong foundation,

808
00:36:59,889 --> 00:37:02,220
