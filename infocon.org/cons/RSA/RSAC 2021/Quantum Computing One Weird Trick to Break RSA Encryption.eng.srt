1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,160
- Hello, I'm Anastasia Marchenkova.

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:04,960
And today I'm gonna talk to you about

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,590
quantum computing and the one weird trick

4
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:11,410
to breaking RSA cryptography
called Shor's algorithm.

5
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:12,861
So I'm gonna cover Quantum 101,

6
00:00:12,861 --> 00:00:15,810
the current status of quantum computers,

7
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:18,760
the roadmap that we have
to 10 million qubits,

8
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,860
Shor's algorithm and how it works.

9
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,849
And the risk to the current
encryption standards

10
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:25,020
that we have now and how we mitigate them

11
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:27,660
with post-quantum and
quantum cryptography.

12
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,260
And even a little bit about
the skillsets that you need

13
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:32,960
to get involved with quantum
computing in the future.

14
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,480
And please ask questions while
I'm doing this presentation

15
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,970
so I can cover them at the end.

16
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:39,839
And just any questions that you have,

17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,240
just toss them in, and we
will get to them at the end.

18
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,890
So I'm a Quantum Researcher at Bleximo,

19
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,500
and we are building application
specific quantum chips

20
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,190
or quantum ASIC accelerators
as we call them.

21
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,339
So I've been in the
quantum computing field

22
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:57,310
for over 12 years now.

23
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:59,310
And I started my work in 2009,

24
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:02,260
researching quantum
telecommunication at Georgia Tech.

25
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:05,280
And my work was in
increasing the coherence time

26
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,410
or the length of time that
quantum information can be stored

27
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:09,520
in neutral rubidium atoms,

28
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,610
and we even proved that
quantum entanglement

29
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,290
could be preserved when
transitioning these photons

30
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:15,710
to different wavelengths.

31
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,320
And that was a research

32
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:22,320
that helped other quantum
computing modalities

33
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,410
or hardware expand,

34
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:29,410
and work my research into into
their own research as well.

35
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:32,520
So then I went to the University
of Maryland for my PhD

36
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,240
and I really got really excited

37
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,179
about quantum computing's
move into the industry

38
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,310
because when I started that
wasn't really happening.

39
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,180
Since then, I worked in two
quantum computing companies

40
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,270
using superconducting qubits.

41
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,720
And now I'm also a YouTuber

42
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,640
doing quantum computing with the vision

43
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,320
of getting more people actually excited

44
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,639
for and using quantum computing

45
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,200
now that this has all
moved beyond the lab.

46
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,880
So take for example, Shor's algorithm,

47
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,970
which we're gonna cover here,

48
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:58,060
which is often the first algorithm

49
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:00,930
that people hear about
when learning about quantum

50
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,770
and Shor's algorithm is kind of the key

51
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:04,589
to the future of cybersecurity.

52
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:05,730
And it really shows

53
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:07,830
and leverages the
differences between quantum

54
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:10,823
and classical computing's
approaches to factoring numbers.

55
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,960
So quantum isn't new.

56
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,160
So even though the industry,

57
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,340
and there's a lot of
hype going on right now,

58
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,080
quantum is actually not new.

59
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,440
And a hundred years ago,

60
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,700
we started seeing that
the world was quantum.

61
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,200
We started seeing weird effects

62
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,299
and some experiments that
could not be explained

63
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,770
by natural laws.

64
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:29,900
And these are non-classical correlations.

65
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,100
So meaning that quantum physics

66
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,250
violates the classical laws of nature.

67
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:37,390
And let me tell you, Einstein hated this,

68
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:39,070
and he did not believe it

69
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:41,239
because it was kind of inconvenient

70
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,550
and it disproved the laws
that we thought we knew

71
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,800
about the world, the classical world.

72
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,170
So Einstein incorrectly believed

73
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:50,190
that quantum physics was predetermined,

74
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:52,350
which made him more consistent

75
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:55,060
with the world of classical computing.

76
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:57,340
But quantum is it's own thing.

77
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:01,610
So about 40 years, we decided
we need to harness this power.

78
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:03,740
And quantum computing was really proposed

79
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:06,130
in the early 1980s,

80
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:08,609
and they proposed this
quantum mechanical model

81
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:10,250
of the turing machine,

82
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,410
and Feinman and others later suggested

83
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:14,377
that the quantum computer
could actually simulate things

84
00:03:14,377 --> 00:03:18,300
that a classical computer
could not do, and faster.

85
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,500
About 30 years ago,

86
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,370
we actually discovered the
first quantum algorithms.

87
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:26,840
So there's one in 1992 called
the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm.

88
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,433
And it's one of the first
examples of quantum algorithms.

89
00:03:29,433 --> 00:03:31,320
And it showed that quantum computers

90
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,459
could actually be much faster

91
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:36,690
and outstrip classical
computers for certain problems.

92
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:39,609
And in 1994, Peter Shor
developed this quantum algorithm

93
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:42,000
for factoring integers
that had the potential

94
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,740
to decrypt RSA encrypted communication

95
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,023
called Shor's algorithm.

96
00:03:48,713 --> 00:03:49,730
Okay, so five years ago

97
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,030
is really when the
quantum computing industry

98
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,550
really took off.

99
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:56,420
So we realized we can
build quantum processors

100
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:59,450
that actually harness
quantum computing power.

101
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:00,489
So we built this new system

102
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,380
of computing using quantum bits or qubits.

103
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,710
And the last few years

104
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:07,550
in the industry have been
really exciting because of this.

105
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:10,720
So while the technology is
still in the early stage

106
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,970
we do really understand
the fundamental physics

107
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:14,690
behind quantum computing now,

108
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:17,240
because we discovered
this a hundred years ago.

109
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,519
So a lot of the work right now

110
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:21,180
is going into exploring
hardware implementations,

111
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,650
processes, scaling,

112
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:24,130
and understanding how to better control

113
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:25,263
these quantum states.

114
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:30,870
So this new system of quantum computing,

115
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,730
what are quantum computers?

116
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,210
What do they actually do?

117
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:36,049
So a quantum computer is a system

118
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:38,500
that uses the quantum
properties of its qubits,

119
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:42,490
like superposition and entanglement
to perform computations.

120
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,360
So not only does the qubit itself

121
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,290
have to be a quantum mechanical system

122
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:48,160
and quantum mechanical in nature,

123
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,680
we also have to be able to
take these quantum properties

124
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,633
and utilize them to
perform these calculations.

125
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,510
So let's first start talking
about the qubits themselves.

126
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:01,920
So in the traditional binary
approach to computing,

127
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,740
you have the zeros, the ones on and off,

128
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:05,790
and information stored

129
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:08,490
in the bits that are
presented by that logic.

130
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:10,070
But in quantum computers,

131
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:12,250
we're based on qubits, quantum bits

132
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,220
that exist in a probability

133
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,700
or superposition of zero and one.

134
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,870
So you can have a 50%
chance of it collapsing

135
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:22,860
into a zero, 50% chance
in collapsing into one,

136
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,590
and you don't know which one it will be

137
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:28,070
until you actually measure
and break that superposition.

138
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:30,650
So, but what can we do here?

139
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:32,150
A qubit is a two level system

140
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:34,017
that's based on the 0 and 1 states,

141
00:05:34,017 --> 00:05:36,620
but it can exist in the superposition,

142
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:39,550
but you can't really think
of it like a regular bit

143
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:42,930
when we can assign a value
of 1/2 and call it a day.

144
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:45,850
So it's special feature
is the superposition,

145
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:50,080
meaning it can exist in
both states simultaneously.

146
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,000
And there's really a lot of
possible ways to make a qubit.

147
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,970
So as long as you have something quantum

148
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:57,300
that has two states that
you can control well,

149
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,860
it can probably be a qubit.

150
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,580
So everything from polarized light

151
00:06:02,564 --> 00:06:04,490
to especially prepared to
imperfections in diamonds

152
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:06,350
and other systems that we have right now

153
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:09,860
are superconducting in qubits
or trapped ions or photonics.

154
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:14,143
So all of these hardware
implementations can be qubits.

155
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:17,970
So entanglement is another
fundamental quantum property

156
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:20,090
we need to harness to
do quantum computing.

157
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:22,710
So when we say the
particles are entangled,

158
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:25,770
it means that the quantum
states are linked to each other.

159
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:28,330
So the state of one can't be described

160
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:30,000
without the state of the other.

161
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,570
So that means they're not separable.

162
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:34,040
So this is a very purely
quantum phenomena,

163
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,959
and it doesn't exist
in the classical world

164
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:38,540
because it's almost like
information is spread

165
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,660
across the particles,

166
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,570
and they're not separated from each other.

167
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:44,960
So if you take two
particles that are entangled

168
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,349
with each other and measure one of them,

169
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:47,880
the state of the second changes,

170
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,123
even at a distance.

171
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:52,647
And yeah, this violates
the laws of nature,

172
00:06:52,647 --> 00:06:54,280
and it's just not very intuitive.

173
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:59,280
And again, this seems very, very strange

174
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:02,010
to someone who's very used
to the classical world.

175
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,170
So since classical computing emerged

176
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:06,830
in the mid 20th century,

177
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:09,590
we've had a lot of progress
in the computer design

178
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:12,549
and processing power has
roughly doubled every few years

179
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:14,360
and that's called Moore's law.

180
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,780
But even if Moore's law keeps holding,

181
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,520
there's a lot of classical of problems

182
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,799
that actually classical
computers can't solve efficiently

183
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,880
no matter how large supercomputers get

184
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,100
because the way that we solve them

185
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,730
on classical computers is different

186
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:29,410
than the way we'd solve
them on quantum computers.

187
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:31,600
So a theoretically
perfect quantum computer

188
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,700
can handle two to the N states.

189
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,380
So it's a superposition of all

190
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,239
and bit numbers with N equaling

191
00:07:37,239 --> 00:07:39,239
the number of qubits that we have.

192
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,930
So that means that 100 qubits

193
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:43,730
can have the same computational power

194
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,070
as about 10 to the 30 bits.

195
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:48,909
So if we look at this in
terms of classical memory,

196
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:51,100
and how long how much it
would take to describe

197
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,770
a quantum computer state,

198
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:55,080
it really shows how powerful this is.

199
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,490
So if we assume that
each number is one bite,

200
00:07:58,490 --> 00:07:59,470
and N equals 30,

201
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:02,210
it's a gigabyte of memory at N equals 40.

202
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:03,969
So 40 qubits is a terabyte,

203
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:06,400
and N equals 50 is already a petabyte.

204
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,810
So you see that,

205
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:10,820
even though we can simulate
small quantum systems,

206
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:13,120
we can't really simulate
large qubit systems

207
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,330
because that's how quickly

208
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:16,483
the power of a quantum computer scales.

209
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,250
So when we control these qubits,

210
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,480
we do them with gates,

211
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,620
and these universal gate quantum computers

212
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,420
have really broad applications.

213
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:30,120
And these systems work on
building really performing qubits

214
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,136
where we can do these basic
circuit operations in gates.

215
00:08:33,136 --> 00:08:35,859
And we can put them
together to do any sequence

216
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:38,190
and run more and more complex algorithms.

217
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:40,090
But quantum computers have
their own set of gates

218
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:40,950
that are very different

219
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:43,400
from the set of classical computing gates.

220
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,760
So in classical computers,

221
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:49,450
we have gates like AND,
NOT, OR, NAND, FANOUT

222
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:51,430
to perform any of these computations

223
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,949
but these are irreversible gates

224
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,170
because information is lost in the process

225
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:57,949
of applying some of these gates.

226
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:01,550
So when we do an OR gate on two bits

227
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:04,209
and we output a one, we can't reverse it

228
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,900
because we don't know, in this case,

229
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:08,449
if the first bit was a one
or the second bit was a one

230
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:09,600
or both bits were one

231
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,300
because of the OR gate that we applied.

232
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,599
And FANOUT requires cloning of a state.

233
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,560
So we FANOUT the bit
to a lot of other bits,

234
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,020
but in quantum computing

235
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,069
we have something called
the no-cloning theorem,

236
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:23,442
which says it's not
possible to exactly copy

237
00:09:23,442 --> 00:09:25,040
an unknown quantum state.

238
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,730
So we can't do that either.

239
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:28,350
So for quantum computing,

240
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:29,910
instead of using classical operators,

241
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:32,709
we use quantum operators or quantum gates.

242
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:36,223
And these are used to evolve
the state of the qubits.

243
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,720
So, as I mentioned,

244
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,580
quantum computing gates
have to be reversible

245
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,010
because irreversible operations

246
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:44,680
actually destroy the entanglement

247
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,370
and superposition of the qubit.

248
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:47,370
And we can't do that

249
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:48,640
until the end of the algorithm

250
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,470
when we actually wanna measure the system.

251
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:54,580
So there's a whole set of
these common unary, binary,

252
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:58,780
and ternary gates that
operate on quantum states.

253
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:02,690
These gates like the
XYZ and rotation gates,

254
00:10:02,691 --> 00:10:04,370
the Hadamard gate,

255
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:05,920
they can change the state of one qubit.

256
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,420
And the Hadamard is the gate
that actually puts the qubit

257
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,892
in equal superposition of zero and one.

258
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,310
There's also two qubit gates like CNOT

259
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:15,969
and they can entangle two qubits.

260
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:17,620
And what the CNOT really does,

261
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,060
it's a Controlled NOT gate,

262
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:21,550
and it flips a state of the target qubit

263
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:24,229
if the state of the
control qubit is a one.

264
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:25,810
There's also a CZ gate

265
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:27,449
which does the same thing as CNOT,

266
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:30,040
but instead of bit
flipping, it does a Z gate.

267
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,209
And there's also SWAP gates

268
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:33,250
where we wanna swap the
state of two qubits,

269
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,250
which is important because it plays a role

270
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,900
in efficient hardware
implementation of quantum computing,

271
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:41,002
even if it's not directly
used to create algorithms.

272
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:43,400
And there's also some three qubit gates,

273
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,890
the Fredkin and the Toffoli gates.

274
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:50,132
So those are controlled SWAP
gates or the control NOT gates,

275
00:10:50,132 --> 00:10:52,449
which also gives us additional flexibility

276
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:55,100
in applying these gates to
quantum computing systems.

277
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,040
So in traditional computer
science terminology,

278
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,020
the algorithm means set of instructions.

279
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:03,280
But when we actually talk
about quantum algorithms,

280
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,300
we mean instructions

281
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,819
that actually harness
these quantum properties

282
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,530
of superposition entanglement,

283
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:12,430
and can potentially solve these
mathematical problems faster

284
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:14,160
than a classical machine.

285
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,276
So right now, there's
actually only a few dozen

286
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:18,900
or so well studied quantum algorithms,

287
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,090
but we're still in the early
days for quantum computing,

288
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:23,640
and a lot more being discovered every day.

289
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,170
So the ones that we do know though,

290
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:27,829
the well understood quantum algorithms

291
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:31,170
can have a huge impact on
very important problems.

292
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:34,810
So for example, optimization,
chemistry, machine learning,

293
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:37,689
quantum computers are really good at that.

294
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:41,850
So, for example, for properties
of atoms and molecules

295
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:45,040
which is really necessary
for materials research,

296
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,089
drug discovery, and other
applications like that.

297
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:51,090
They can be found by solving
the Schrodinger equation.

298
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:53,840
So the problem is the problem gets harder

299
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,670
than more components and atoms you add.

300
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:58,439
So exact calculations
are actually really hard

301
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,700
above just a few atoms

302
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,490
and even approximate solutions are hard

303
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:02,730
above a few dozen atoms.

304
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:06,290
So you can't model these large atoms.

305
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:07,880
And when I'm saying
large, I'm talking about

306
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:11,890
like caffeine or aspirin that
has just a few dozen atoms.

307
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:14,620
Like we can't actually classically

308
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,150
simulate those systems anymore.

309
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,273
They're too large.

310
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,970
So Shor's algorithm is also just one

311
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:22,538
of these dozens of quantum algorithms.

312
00:12:22,538 --> 00:12:25,650
Other algorithms like Grover's algorithm,

313
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:28,500
they can actually speed up
search on an unsorted database,

314
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,010
which can be really impactful

315
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:32,550
because the amount of data that
we need to process right now

316
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:34,839
in the world is growing really fast.

317
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,680
So it could be useful

318
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,239
for internet search
companies, telecom data.

319
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,210
There's also algorithms

320
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:42,930
like quantum approximate
optimization algorithms

321
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:46,069
and quantum unconstrained
binary optimization.

322
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:48,270
They can really do really good job

323
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:51,540
solving optimization problems
like traveling salesmen

324
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:54,260
and tenant placement
problems and graph coloring.

325
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:56,380
So these problems become really quickly

326
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,652
classically intractable

327
00:12:57,652 --> 00:13:01,040
or unable to be solving
these classical systems,

328
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,829
but they have a ton of applications

329
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:05,014
ranging from logistics, manufacturing,

330
00:13:05,014 --> 00:13:09,313
drug development, new materials even.

331
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:14,699
So algorithms like Variational
Quantum Eigensolver or VQV

332
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,002
have major impacts in quantum chemistry

333
00:13:17,002 --> 00:13:18,699
and beyond chemistry.

334
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,180
The solution of these
large eigenvalue problems

335
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,290
that have more applications

336
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:24,140
that really affect our day to day life

337
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:26,280
like designing new materials,

338
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:29,500
whether that's new materials
that help maybe airplanes

339
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,413
stand up to higher heat or strain,

340
00:13:32,292 --> 00:13:35,270
so maybe we could fly faster
or create new batteries.

341
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:38,210
So there's a lot of algorithms.

342
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:39,539
Well, there's not a lot of algorithms.

343
00:13:39,539 --> 00:13:41,740
There are a few sets of algorithms,

344
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,880
but they have a really broad application.

345
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,880
And so that's why people are so interested

346
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,513
in quantum computing as a field.

347
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:51,300
So let's then talk about Shor's algorithms

348
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,689
since this is the first algorithm

349
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:53,860
a lot of people hear about,

350
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,610
and it demonstrates this difference

351
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:57,960
between classical and quantum systems.

352
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:01,520
The two common crypto systems
that we have right now

353
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,220
that can be affected by quantum computers

354
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:06,050
are RSA and elliptic curve cryptography.

355
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:07,010
So when you're online,

356
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:08,620
any information that you exchange

357
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:12,470
will be encrypted, hopefully,
often with one of these,

358
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:14,090
and both of these are really vulnerable

359
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:16,090
to attacks by quantum computers.

360
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:20,610
So RSA relies on the hard
problem of factoring numbers.

361
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:24,080
And multiplying two prime
numbers together is easy,

362
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,990
but taking a very large number

363
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:29,620
and factoring it to get two
prime numbers is very difficult.

364
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,300
So it would take longer than the age

365
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:34,849
of the universe to factor a 4,000 bit key

366
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:36,540
with a classical computer.

367
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,740
But we're seeing that a
quantum computer could do it

368
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,220
maybe in a hundred seconds.

369
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:44,050
And that's how fast and how
dangerous this Shor's algorithm

370
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,163
could potentially be.

371
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,189
So we have our hardware,
we have our gates,

372
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:50,970
how do we actually apply these gates

373
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:53,010
and write quantum algorithms?

374
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:55,230
So we have to find the prime factors

375
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:57,470
of a number that can undo
this factoring problem

376
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:59,710
much more easily than
a classical computer.

377
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:02,040
And again, this algorithm
was created in 1994.

378
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,610
So we already knew that we could harness

379
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:05,692
these quantum properties to do this.

380
00:15:05,692 --> 00:15:08,130
How Shor's algorithm actually works

381
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:11,060
is by finding the period of a function.

382
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:15,180
And this finds the non-trivial
prime factor of a key.

383
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,829
And there's five steps
to Shor's algorithm,

384
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:18,700
but only one of them, actually step 2,

385
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:19,900
is the quantum part.

386
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,520
The rest are classical.

387
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,750
So there's five steps
to this algorithm here,

388
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,010
Shor's algorithm.

389
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:27,430
And a lot of the other steps
are just checking steps

390
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:30,101
and doing greatest common divisor steps.

391
00:15:30,101 --> 00:15:32,330
But step 2 is the important one.

392
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:34,520
Step 2 is the quantum part.

393
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,020
And what we're doing is finding the period

394
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:40,630
of this function and mod N,
squared mod N, et cetera.

395
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:42,760
So what's the period of a function

396
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,990
is when you apply some operation,

397
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:48,053
and the results go back up and
down like a frequency wave.

398
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:54,090
So we can do this actually,
and look at this as a key here.

399
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:56,550
So say we wanna factor 25.

400
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:59,390
And I know that's a very,
very trivial example here,

401
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:00,900
but it shows you what we're doing.

402
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,310
So we wanna factor 25

403
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:06,229
and we choose a random, positive integer

404
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:08,490
that's less than N and we choose seven,

405
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:09,680
and we do this equation,

406
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,760
this M mod N, M squared mod N, and go on.

407
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,740
And we see that since it's a modulus,

408
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,170
the remainder one is divided by 25.

409
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:21,918
The answer can vary between 0 and 25,

410
00:16:21,918 --> 00:16:26,918
or 0 and 24, but the
answer can't be above that.

411
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,460
So even as the numbers get bigger,

412
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:31,340
we can fit more 25s,

413
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,870
and the remainder oscillates.

414
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:35,680
So this function, as we see on the right,

415
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,540
as we do this,

416
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:39,230
actually has a period
associated with it's four,

417
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:41,640
because once we get 7 to the 4th mod 25,

418
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,213
the remainder is 1 again.

419
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:46,840
So when we put this
back into the equation,

420
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:50,500
we can actually get the
factors out of this.

421
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:55,500
So the key to this algorithm
really is to find the period

422
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,570
of this function,,

423
00:16:56,570 --> 00:17:00,400
and then go through and do the
greatest common divisor step

424
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,170
in the last step.

425
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:05,280
So what known classical
function do we have

426
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,839
that relates to frequency and time.

427
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,389
It's the Fourier transform.

428
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:10,760
So we have a quantum version

429
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,900
called the Quantum Fourier transform.

430
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,230
And what it does is it
maps the time domain

431
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:17,017
to the frequency or the Fourier domain.

432
00:17:17,017 --> 00:17:20,390
And frequency is exactly
what we wanna know here.

433
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:21,920
And we wanna do this really quickly,

434
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:26,920
because of the oscillation
here of this period,

435
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:28,889
of this function.

436
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:32,660
So again, this is a
trivial example using 25

437
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,290
or a number like that,

438
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:36,149
but it shows the proof of concept

439
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:37,630
to understand why an algorithm

440
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:41,620
that uses these quantum steps
is a lot faster classically

441
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,189
and how a quantum computer doesn't

442
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:45,250
just brute force factoring.

443
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,990
It's not parallelizing.

444
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:49,370
It's not trying every possibility at once

445
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:51,239
and just going through a list of numbers.

446
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,380
We're actually doing
something very different

447
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:55,343
in the quantum step here.

448
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:58,889
So now that sounds super exciting.

449
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:00,780
So we're harnessing the quantum world.

450
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,270
We have these algorithms
with a big impact,

451
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:05,370
but when can we actually run

452
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:07,149
large quantum algorithms on them

453
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:09,870
and get the results that outstrip
these classical machines,

454
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:12,132
and when should we
really worry about this?

455
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:17,030
So in the end, we need about 2,500 qubits

456
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:19,100
to break elliptic curve encryption,

457
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:22,600
and about 4,000 to break RSA encryption.

458
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,520
But these are logical qubits
and not physical qubits.

459
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,280
And the difference between
this is that quantum computers

460
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,940
in real life have a lot of errors in them.

461
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:33,420
Managing errors is
important in quantum systems

462
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:36,150
because quantum states
are really delicate.

463
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:40,090
We're really right now in the
NISQ era of quantum computing,

464
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:43,409
which is the noisy intermediate
scale quantum device era.

465
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:45,320
So our chips really have a dozen

466
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,198
to a few hundred physical qubits,

467
00:18:47,199 --> 00:18:49,910
have a high error rate,
a low coherence rate,

468
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:53,090
and they may need a lot
of error correction.

469
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,000
So quantum information can be stored

470
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,820
for short amount of time
called the coherence time.

471
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,510
And we need to apply all the gates

472
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:02,350
and read out the data before
the quantum bits decohere.

473
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,949
So you'll often hear
that the quantum states

474
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:06,960
lose superposition when observed.

475
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,530
Well, what observation
really means is measurement,

476
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:11,521
and a measurement can
be a controlled readout,

477
00:19:11,521 --> 00:19:14,370
or it could be even interaction
from the environment

478
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:16,429
with a particle that
interferes with the qubits.

479
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:19,010
So from my work in superconducting qubits,

480
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:23,170
we have cryogenics that
cool the qubits down

481
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:25,820
to a very, very low
millikelvin temperature,

482
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,950
and RF shielding to
stop this interference,

483
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:30,013
and lengthen the coherence time.

484
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,050
And the problem is that quantum computers

485
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:34,340
can't do the error correction

486
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:37,020
in the same way that
classical computers do.

487
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,160
In classical computers, a simplified view

488
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,763
is that we can copy the string of bits

489
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:42,730
that we wanna send a few times,

490
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:44,310
and then if the bits disagree,

491
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:47,540
we can look into the copies
and see what's the majority.

492
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:49,300
But due to the no-cloning theorem,

493
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,770
the states that we have,
the quantum states,

494
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:55,470
we can't exactly copy these
unknown quantum states.

495
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:57,180
So we can't do the same thing,

496
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:59,050
but we do have an error
correction techniques

497
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:01,159
known as quantum error correction.

498
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:04,890
And what it really does
is it takes these states

499
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:07,940
and encodes them into a
larger quantum system.

500
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,990
But that means the more
complex a circuit gets,

501
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:11,410
the more error correction we need,

502
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:13,993
the more qubits we have to use.

503
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,070
So, as I mentioned for
algorithms like Shor's algorithm,

504
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:21,350
it would take about 4,000
qubits to break an RSA heap,

505
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:24,389
but these are perfectly logical qubits.

506
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:27,470
And Shor's algorithm is actually
a very complex algorithm

507
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:29,760
and circuit with a lot
of sequential gates.

508
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,129
So you have to do them in a certain order,

509
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:34,680
and that's called a deep
circuit versus a shell circuit,

510
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,120
where you can do maybe gates in parallel

511
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,060
and they don't have a lot of steps.

512
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,639
So because of this error correction,

513
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,050
we have to spread the information out.

514
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:43,850
We have to keep the states coherent

515
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:46,189
for very long amount of time.

516
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:48,430
We actually need a lot
more error correction

517
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:50,090
than for shallow circuits.

518
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:52,929
So John Preskill noted in his
lecture on quantum information

519
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:56,200
that 10 million physical
qubits would be needed,

520
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,560
and maybe 10,000 logical
qubits would be needed

521
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,790
to break RSA encryption.

522
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:04,790
So we're still pretty far
away from that milestone,

523
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:06,030
but a lot of people,

524
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:09,560
and this is a chart from
talking about the research

525
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,620
and how the field is going,

526
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:13,570
and what quantum information
scientists think that,

527
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:16,600
when can we actually get to the point,

528
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,399
get to this point to
have millions of qubits.

529
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,770
And it seems like around 15 to 20 years

530
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:24,270
is something that people are
thinking to get to the scale

531
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:26,910
to actually have a threat to encryption.

532
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,900
The great part about it is that

533
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:31,220
there's a lot of really cool algorithms

534
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:33,410
that need just a few
dozen, a few hundred qubits

535
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:35,410
that can help with these drug discovery,

536
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:37,350
with machine learning, even before that.

537
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:39,389
So we can get a lot of value

538
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:41,090
from the quantum computing systems first

539
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:44,303
before worrying about
running Shor's algorithm.

540
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:50,023
But even as I'm talking
about the qubit counts,

541
00:21:50,023 --> 00:21:52,350
the number of qubits
really isn't everything.

542
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:54,649
So it just one factor for power.

543
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:56,660
And I've already mentioned coherence time.

544
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:59,030
So these qubit counts
don't really mean anything

545
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:00,518
if they're poorly constructed.

546
00:22:00,518 --> 00:22:03,690
And we have something called
the DiVincenzo's criteria

547
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:07,160
that tell us what a good
quantum computer should have.

548
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,950
So we need well-defined qubit,

549
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:11,090
so well characterized qubits.

550
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:13,070
We have to be able to
initialize the qubits

551
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,120
to an initial state.

552
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:17,562
So we have to be able to set
them to a good zero, one state,

553
00:22:17,563 --> 00:22:20,800
and we need a set of universal
gates to apply to the qubits

554
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:24,800
so we can do any sequence,
any set of complex algorithms.

555
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,480
And we need long decoherence times

556
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,970
to preserve the quantum
information for longer.

557
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:31,980
So, as I mentioned,

558
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:34,330
we need enough time to apply the gates,

559
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:35,460
to do our algorithm,

560
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:38,320
and actually read out the data after that.

561
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,850
And we have to have the ability

562
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:41,709
to reliably measure these qubits,

563
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:43,750
because if we can't get
the data at the end,

564
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,250
that's also kind of worthless.

565
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,590
So a few super fault tolerant quantum bits

566
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:51,070
with long coherence times

567
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:55,129
where every qubit is
connected to every other one,

568
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:56,570
ones that have good gate fidelity,

569
00:22:56,570 --> 00:23:00,649
which means, low error
rates in applying the gates.

570
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:02,030
There's so much more valuable

571
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:03,494
than hundreds of poorly connected,

572
00:23:03,494 --> 00:23:06,862
fast decoherence qubits
with a lot of crosstalk.

573
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,770
So trapped ions and superconducting qubits

574
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:11,530
are some of the leading
candidates right now

575
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:13,580
that do really well on these five factors

576
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,429
of the DiVincenzo's criteria.

577
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:18,180
So a lot of companies
are focusing on them,

578
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:20,500
but there's a lot of other contenders.

579
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:24,350
And some of them like NMR are
well known to not be suitable

580
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:25,830
for scalable quantum computing

581
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:28,010
but nuclear magnetic resonance was one

582
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:29,900
of the first initial proof of concepts

583
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,200
for quantum physics.

584
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,790
But there's other qubit types

585
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:35,780
that may not fit the criteria now

586
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,840
only because we haven't done
enough research on them.

587
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,790
And there's some physics problems

588
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:42,093
still to be discovered there.

589
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,290
So besides just looking
at the qubits themselves,

590
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:48,440
there's also criteria

591
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,273
for how the whole quantum
system has to behave

592
00:23:49,273 --> 00:23:52,730
to make a good quantum computer.

593
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:56,130
So IBM introduced this
quantum volumemetric

594
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:58,420
because this classical
computers, transistor account

595
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:01,790
and quantum computers, quantum
big counts, aren't the same.

596
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:03,990
So the quantum bits decohere

597
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:06,740
and loses quantum
information very quickly.

598
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:10,220
And what the single
number this quantum volume

599
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,500
does is being more mindful

600
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,690
about calculating performance
of a quantum system.

601
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:18,560
So it takes into account
features like number of qubits.

602
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,649
That's still important,

603
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:22,000
but also gate and measurement errors,

604
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,550
crosstalk, the topology
or the connectedness

605
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:25,383
of the chip.

606
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:29,160
So we actually see here in the chart below

607
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:32,810
the latest stats are that
Honeywell 10 qubit system

608
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:34,480
actually has a higher quantum volume

609
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,820
than IBM's 27 qubit machine.

610
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:39,669
And so this really shows that
the number of qubit counts

611
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:41,523
is really not everything.

612
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:46,120
So where are we at
forgetting the qubit ranges

613
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,330
to actually destroy encryption?

614
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:51,830
And note this huge range in the roadmap

615
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:52,800
that I've shown right now.

616
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,180
And I've already talked about
needing millions of qubits

617
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:57,230
to rake RSA encryption.

618
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:58,640
And we are still looking

619
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,700
at different hardware
implementations here.

620
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,470
So IBM is doing superconducting qubits,

621
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:06,540
which are Cooper pairs or electron pairs

622
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:10,850
or any other fermion with
the superconducting qubits.

623
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:12,679
PsiQuantum is using a different approach.

624
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,370
It's doing photonics.

625
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:17,179
So they're claiming 1
million qubits in five years,

626
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:19,600
and they work differently.

627
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,949
So the thing is every
hardware implementation

628
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:23,930
has its own challenges and weaknesses.

629
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:25,270
So the important thing is

630
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,950
when you're reading these articles,

631
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:28,570
keep in mind that a lot
of these wont tell you

632
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:30,300
the weaknesses of their systems

633
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,713
and how there can be
problems with scaling.

634
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,439
So even though this is far away,

635
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,760
we already know that security
actually takes a while

636
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,593
to upgrade.

637
00:25:38,593 --> 00:25:40,070
And let's think ahead

638
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:42,629
how we mitigate the
quantum computing threat

639
00:25:42,629 --> 00:25:44,152
to our security.

640
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:50,060
So NIST has actually
released this competition

641
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:52,656
for Post-Quantum
Cryptography Standardization

642
00:25:52,656 --> 00:25:55,419
a while back in 2016.

643
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,026
And in July, 2020,

644
00:25:57,026 --> 00:25:59,260
the selection criteria began.

645
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:01,840
And there were about
26 algorithms submitted

646
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,240
and a few weren't viable after
we had some public review.

647
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,930
There's 15 left in this round.

648
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:09,940
And they're part of
pretty much three families

649
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:14,300
that are lattice based,
error correcting code based,

650
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:16,480
and multi-variate based crypto systems.

651
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,360
So NIST does think that
the eventual standard

652
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,590
will have multiple
recommendations for encryption.

653
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:25,155
So in case someone manages
to break this down the road,

654
00:26:25,155 --> 00:26:26,420
like I mentioned,

655
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:29,410
there's only a few dozen
quantum algorithms right now,

656
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:33,210
and we're still working on and
discovering more over time.

657
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:34,980
So maybe there's something here

658
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:38,010
where these crypto systems
could be broken later on,

659
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:39,879
and they'll probably
recommend more than that.

660
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,840
But the timeline for
that is the new standard

661
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,689
to be announced around 2022

662
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:47,450
to give people enough
time to upgrade security,

663
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:51,050
because even though we
talk about 15, 20 years

664
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:51,883
to get to the point

665
00:26:51,883 --> 00:26:56,050
of breaking RSA elliptic
curve encryption, there's,

666
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:58,675
because of all the money being
poured into the industry,

667
00:26:58,675 --> 00:27:00,520
maybe the scaling,

668
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,510
the scaling will go much
faster than we think.

669
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:03,730
And we'd rather be prepared

670
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:06,670
because in previous changes,

671
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:08,620
an encryption has taken 10 years

672
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:09,840
and a lot of money to upgrade.

673
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,304
So we really wanna get these standards

674
00:27:11,305 --> 00:27:13,803
going as quickly as possible.

675
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:19,460
So what are the properties
of this winning standard?

676
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:22,690
So one, it must stand up to
quantum computing attacks,

677
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:25,610
obviously, but it also has to
stand up to classical attacks

678
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:28,100
because classical
computers are also better

679
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,179
at some other things

680
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:32,100
and better at things in quantum computers.

681
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,250
And it has to be fast.

682
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:36,071
So we don't really wanna
slow down communication.

683
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:40,290
This encryption needs to run
everywhere, and on the web,

684
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:42,610
on smartphone sensors, a lot of devices.

685
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:45,209
So if we have the limited compute power,

686
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:48,463
we don't really wanna
slow down the encryption.

687
00:27:51,411 --> 00:27:53,690
So a way of mitigating the threat

688
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:55,790
also is using quantum cryptography.

689
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:58,370
So as opposed to post-quantum cryptography

690
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:03,296
which uses classical techniques,
it uses math techniques.

691
00:28:03,297 --> 00:28:06,060
This quantum cryptography actually

692
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,799
uses quantum mechanical principles

693
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:11,690
of the superposition entanglement
to create the shared key.

694
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:12,960
And the positive here

695
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,270
is that since it uses the laws of physics,

696
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:16,830
instead of our knowledge of math

697
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:19,389
and our understanding of
mathematical algorithms,

698
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:21,640
it can't fundamentally be broken

699
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:24,873
because we're using the
laws of quantum mechanics.

700
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,500
So one of these ways

701
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,690
is the BB84 Quantum Key exchange protocol

702
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:33,540
that creates the shared keys.

703
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:36,649
So physically, we can think
of this being coded in photons

704
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:39,050
and the polarization of
the photon is the state.

705
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:42,870
So what we wanna do here is Alice prepares

706
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:44,409
a bit string that she wants to send

707
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:47,360
and randomly selects
the polarization basis.

708
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,740
So she can select either
horizontal or vertical

709
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,640
or a diagonal one.

710
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:55,130
And for horizontal, that's the zero state,

711
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:56,480
the vertical is a one,

712
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,244
or if you select the diagonal,

713
00:28:58,244 --> 00:29:03,244
up into the right is zero and
down and to the right is one.

714
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,939
So physically we can think
of these bits being encoded

715
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:10,910
in photons and the polarization
of the photon is a state.

716
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:12,070
And you can see that here

717
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:14,053
in the angle of the wave traveling.

718
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:18,044
So Alice prepares this sequence of photons

719
00:29:18,044 --> 00:29:20,130
sending the polarization.

720
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:24,090
So let's say she selects
the bit string 01,

721
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:26,919
and chooses a horizontal
vertical polarization,

722
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,160
then the first photon she sends

723
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,920
will be horizontally polarized.

724
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,873
And the second one will
be vertically polarized.

725
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,880
So then Bob chooses whether to measure

726
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,940
in the diagonal basis or
horizontal or vertical basis,

727
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:43,690
and doesn't know what Alice
has done at that point.

728
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:46,240
But the problem is that
means he loses information

729
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,160
when he randomly chooses the wrong basis.

730
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:51,670
So if you choose to measure
a diagonal polarized photon

731
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:54,550
in the horizontal vertical detector,

732
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:58,970
he's gonna get a random answer
and destroys the original.

733
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:00,220
If you choose the correct basis,

734
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:02,480
we'll be sure that the readout
result is the correct one.

735
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,223
So we detect and record the results here.

736
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:07,672
And this can really be imagined

737
00:30:07,672 --> 00:30:11,620
with a polarizing filter
and fancy sunglasses.

738
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,709
So works by only letting certain photons

739
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:16,110
through the correct polarization.

740
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:19,090
And the lack of a photon
means the polarizing filter

741
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:20,540
blocked it from transmitting.

742
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,870
So then Alice and Bob publicly compare

743
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:25,120
their encoding basis.

744
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,239
So using the chart above,

745
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,890
Alice says that for photon one,

746
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:30,880
I used the horizontal basis.

747
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,330
If Bob used the wrong
basis and reads this out,

748
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:34,790
the results he got was random,

749
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:37,810
and they discard that bit in the sequence.

750
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:40,659
So they keep only the
bits where they match

751
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:43,471
the measurement basis and
they prepared the photon

752
00:30:43,471 --> 00:30:46,590
in the same basis as a measurement basis.

753
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:50,000
And the shared key is
that remaining sequence.

754
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,110
So the cool thing about
this is that you can come in

755
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:55,360
and listen to it on the
photons if she wants to,

756
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,010
but she's kind of in the same position

757
00:30:57,010 --> 00:30:59,440
as Bob is to choose a random basis.

758
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,135
But however, as soon as she
interferes with those photons,

759
00:31:02,135 --> 00:31:05,780
Eve introduces additional
errors into the measurements.

760
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,990
And so Alice and Bob can check for errors

761
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:10,890
by choosing a subset of the
key and publicly pairing it.

762
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:12,640
And if there's more errors than expected

763
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,750
and more than expected
losses on the channel,

764
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:15,823
they discard the key.

765
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:19,480
So this has already been going on.

766
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:23,470
We have these quantum key
distribution networks.

767
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:26,580
And why don't we always use them

768
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:29,159
if it's so secure and it's
using the laws of physics?

769
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,320
But it requires specialized equipment.

770
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,990
So for example, for
these photon detectors,

771
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:35,650
you need that, you need beam splitters

772
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:37,070
and other equipment to make it work.

773
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:40,493
So we can't put that all into
a device like your phone.

774
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:43,330
And just because the encryption itself

775
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:45,699
is fundamentally secure
by the law of nature,

776
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:48,950
it doesn't mean that no
attacks can ever occur.

777
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:50,650
So that's even seen in our system.

778
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:53,710
So right now these encryption
techniques are secure,

779
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:56,740
but there's side channel
attacks and there's weaknesses

780
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:57,573
in the implementation

781
00:31:57,573 --> 00:31:59,560
of the crypto system instead weaknesses

782
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,980
in the algorithm itself.

783
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,950
So even though you can be sure

784
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:05,290
that nobody has directly
intercepted the photons

785
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:06,970
in the process of creating the key,

786
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:09,560
and these quantum key
distribution protocols,

787
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:12,909
these attacks still do
exist on quantum systems.

788
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:14,620
So NASA has been doing research on this

789
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:17,169
because they want to use
these provably secure systems

790
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:19,600
between earth and low orbit satellites.

791
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,340
DARPA Los Alamos National Lab

792
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:23,590
has created a small
quantum networks as well.

793
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:29,240
So even though those two
are fundamentally different,

794
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,430
both will have their place

795
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:32,540
in strengthening security in a future,

796
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:36,330
this post-quantum, large
quantum computing future.

797
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:39,889
But 90% of enterprise quantum investments

798
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:41,920
will start hiring quantum
computing consultants

799
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,950
to figure out what problems
that they can solve

800
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:46,730
with quantum computers
that would bring value.

801
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:48,810
So it's worth noting
that quantum algorithms

802
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:50,960
are not the solution to every problem.

803
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,450
So a big misconception
is that quantum computers

804
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:55,330
work by trying every possibility

805
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:58,060
at once or that they
speed up every problem.

806
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,139
And that's not the case.

807
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:00,870
So quantum algorithms are faster

808
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:03,010
for certain set of problems.

809
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:05,270
And even though we only have
these dozens of algorithms,

810
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:06,979
the impact they can have is huge

811
00:33:06,979 --> 00:33:09,500
since optimization
problems are everywhere,

812
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,827
and the differential
between quantum computing

813
00:33:11,827 --> 00:33:14,263
and classical computing is massive.

814
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,490
So if you wanna participate
in the quantum revolution,

815
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:19,890
what skills do you need

816
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:22,470
to move from programming
classical machines

817
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:23,550
to quantum software?

818
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:26,220
And actually it's not
as much as you think.

819
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:28,210
I personally believe you should need a PhD

820
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:29,839
to actually use a quantum computer.

821
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:32,310
And if quantum computers
become mainstream,

822
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,950
there just aren't enough
quantum physicists

823
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:37,240
in the world to run and manage
all these quantum computers.

824
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,220
So of course this is
isn't a list of skills.

825
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:40,930
You need to become a PhD researcher,

826
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:42,770
but it can get you started.

827
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:44,660
So linear algebra is key.

828
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:47,130
Quantum gates are just matrix operations,

829
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:48,900
and you need complex numbers.

830
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,234
And because imaginary

831
00:33:50,234 --> 00:33:52,960
and complex numbers are
the core mathematical base

832
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:57,130
of quantum mechanics,
they appear explicitly

833
00:33:57,130 --> 00:34:00,270
in fundamental equations like
the Schrodinger equation.

834
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:02,660
You need a little bit of set
theory, but not too much.

835
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:04,790
And there's some quantum
specific notations

836
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:05,623
that you need to learn.

837
00:34:05,623 --> 00:34:08,580
So Dirac notation or bra-ket notation

838
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,255
is just a simpler representation

839
00:34:10,255 --> 00:34:14,049
of vectors and matrices of the
state of the quantum system.

840
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:15,090
You have the Hilbert space,

841
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:17,833
which is a special kind of vector space

842
00:34:17,833 --> 00:34:20,389
that has some other special properties

843
00:34:20,389 --> 00:34:22,234
like preserving the inner product.

844
00:34:22,234 --> 00:34:23,650
It takes the inner product

845
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:25,870
of two vectors and outputs a scaler.

846
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:27,580
And that's important in quantum computing

847
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:29,290
in that it describes the systems

848
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:30,962
containing the wave functions.

849
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:33,650
And you'll need to learn the symbolism

850
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:35,380
for quantum operators and gates.

851
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:37,610
So that's not something you
need to do for getting started,

852
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:40,710
but when you look at the
linear algebra and the gates,

853
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:43,223
you'll see how that all connects.

854
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:45,070
So you'll be surprised

855
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:46,489
that just for running quantum programs,

856
00:34:46,489 --> 00:34:49,959
you actually don't need that
much quantum mechanics itself.

857
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,139
So on the software side,

858
00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:53,730
let's take a look at the quantum
computing cloud landscape.

859
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:56,679
So today's cloud quantum
platforms are mainly hosted

860
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:59,480
by large tech companies
like Amazon, Microsoft,

861
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,830
IBM and Google.

862
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:03,270
And actually many of
these are Python-based.

863
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:06,009
There's also languages,
higher level languages,

864
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:07,567
like Q# and Silq.

865
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:11,440
And then there's OpenQASM,
kind of quantum assembly

866
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:15,380
that's being integrated into
the IBM cloud platforms.

867
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,970
And I think Microsoft also has a connector

868
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:20,683
to be able to do OpenQASM code as well.

869
00:35:21,708 --> 00:35:24,380
So Amazon's AWS bracket provides access

870
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:26,940
to three different quantum
computing platforms,

871
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:29,220
and they also have
simulators for prototyping,

872
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,950
and it makes it pretty easy to prototype

873
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:31,783
and then put them

874
00:35:31,783 --> 00:35:34,430
on these universal
gateway quantum computers.

875
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:36,600
And Amazon has just started getting

876
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,240
into the quantum computing race,

877
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,917
but so far their chip is not
available on their own system.

878
00:35:41,918 --> 00:35:44,920
Azure has recently launched
their own quantum platform

879
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:47,760
with a goal of having the
hardware and the software

880
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,790
all under their quantum
development kit solutions.

881
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:51,820
And they provide access

882
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:55,030
to the Honeywell and
IonQ trapped ion systems.

883
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:57,470
And IBM has access to their own chips

884
00:35:57,470 --> 00:36:02,470
up to 15 qubit chips available
for the public to access.

885
00:36:04,011 --> 00:36:07,290
And Google is also building
out their own superconducting

886
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,259
quantum computing chips,

887
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:10,810
and they've released Cirq
and TensorFlow quantum

888
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:14,250
to allow the public to start
coding with quantum computers,

889
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:16,200
but they've not actually
released public access

890
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,542
to their chip, just the simulators.

891
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,550
So to apply what you've learned today,

892
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:25,370
next week you should debunk the myth

893
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:27,140
that quantum computers paralyze

894
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:29,740
or brute force solutions to problems.

895
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:31,149
I've mentioned this multiple times

896
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:35,120
because this is a big
misconception in the quantum space.

897
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,900
And I hope I covered enough
interesting algorithms

898
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:39,330
for you to actually look into them

899
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:42,240
and see what might be
interesting to your business.

900
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,410
So in a year, you should
start working on a skills plan

901
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:46,279
to be able to program quantum computers

902
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,840
in your language of choice.

903
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,920
It's great that we have a lot

904
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,430
of these Python-based frameworks

905
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:51,919
and you can start learning the gates,

906
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,870
and have this minimum skill set

907
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:56,249
to actually start getting business value

908
00:36:56,249 --> 00:36:57,470
from quantum computers,

909
00:36:57,470 --> 00:37:00,009
and thinking about how
you can take problems

910
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:01,890
and make them quantum.

911
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:03,890
And in three years, you
should identify problems

912
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:07,373
that quantum computers can
use to extract business value.

913
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:11,070
Thank you very much.
