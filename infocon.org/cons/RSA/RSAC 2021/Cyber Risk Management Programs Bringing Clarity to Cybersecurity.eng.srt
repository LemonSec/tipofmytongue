1
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:05,210
- Hello, cyber security risk enthusiasts.

2
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:06,430
My name is Boyden Rohner

3
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:08,930
and I'm the Associate Director
for Vulnerability Management

4
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:12,500
at the Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Security Agency.

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,920
C-I-S-A or CISA.

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,680
For those of you who
aren't familiar with CISA,

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,040
we are the nation's risk advisor.

8
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,750
As the nation's risk advisor,

9
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,530
we endeavor to understand
cyber and physical risks

10
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:28,050
to the nation's critical infrastructure,

11
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,223
and help partners strengthen
their own capabilities.

12
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,310
So naturally, we are very
interested in the topic

13
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:40,490
of cyber risk and cyber
risk management programs.

14
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:44,220
Therefore, it's my pleasure
to bring to you the insights

15
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:48,290
of three highly regarded leaders
in the cybersecurity field

16
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:51,260
who are experts at cyber risk management

17
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,422
and cyber risk management programs.

18
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,020
Our first panelists is Lisa Donnan,

19
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,860
partner at Option3Ventures,

20
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:05,500
a mission-driven cybersecurity
private equity fund.

21
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,390
She is widely recognized
in the information

22
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:11,280
and telecommunication security circles

23
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,773
as a new business whisperer.

24
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:17,170
And when it comes to cyber warfare,

25
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:18,610
Lisa has been at the forefront

26
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:21,410
of successfully commercializing innovative

27
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:23,710
and disruptive technologies.

28
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:25,320
She's launched new businesses

29
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,479
and been credited for creating new markets

30
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,890
in both the public and private sectors.

31
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:34,300
With over 25 years of experience,

32
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,960
Lisa is recognized as a thought
leader in cybersecurity,

33
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:42,622
artificial intelligence,
social media data analytics,

34
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,880
and through the course of
preparing for this panel

35
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,320
with Lisa, I learned that
we are practically neighbors

36
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,839
living just a couple miles apart

37
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,660
in Loudoun County, Virginia.

38
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:55,140
And that she has ridden in an elevator

39
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,400
with Paul Newman and Tom Cruise.

40
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,620
Of course, this is before
COVID when we did things

41
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,330
like riding elevators with other people.

42
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,850
And like other panelists
today, she is a parent,

43
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:08,070
which means she deserves
a gold medal for this year

44
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:10,039
leading a family through a pandemic

45
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:14,510
and she has two college
bound twin children.

46
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:17,690
Congratulations on all those
things. (chuckles) Lisa.

47
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:18,690
- Thank you, Boyden.

48
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:23,330
- Our second panelist is Alma Cole,

49
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:25,610
Chief Information Security Officer

50
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:27,860
for the US Customs and Border Protection

51
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:30,790
within the department
of Homeland Security.

52
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:33,340
With more than 60,000 employees,

53
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,240
US Customs and Border Protection

54
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:39,200
is one of the world's largest
law enforcement organizations

55
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,030
and operates and maintains

56
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:44,290
an astounding amount
of diverse technology.

57
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:49,290
Think, biometric readers,
those kiosks at the airports

58
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,010
and fixed and mobile surveillance systems

59
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:55,739
such as towers and even aerostats,

60
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:58,550
which is a fancy word for
blimps if you weren't familiar.

61
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:02,030
He's responsible for all aspects of CBP's

62
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:05,710
cybersecurity program to
include security architecture,

63
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:08,640
risk management, policy compliance,

64
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,142
and defensive operations.

65
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:13,720
If Alma's background didn't convince you

66
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,109
that he's got one of the
coolest jobs in cybersecurity,

67
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:19,446
I'd like to let you know (chuckles)

68
00:03:19,446 --> 00:03:21,843
that he's exactly the one

69
00:03:21,843 --> 00:03:24,732
that you want covering your security six.

70
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,770
For example, if you head on
over to YouTube or Instagram,

71
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:31,550
you'll find out that Alma
has a very avid following

72
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:32,530
of Instagram followers

73
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:34,973
for his sports shooting
award-winning career.

74
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,740
Welcome Alma.

75
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:38,890
- Thanks for having me.

76
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,590
- Lastly, our third
panelist is Shaun Khalfan

77
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:47,720
Senior Vice President and Chief
Information Security Officer

78
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,730
at Discover Financial.

79
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,480
Fun fact, Shaun proceeded Alma

80
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,829
as the chief information security officer

81
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:56,480
at Customs and Border Protection.

82
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,500
Shaun is a risk reduction expert

83
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,230
who has led company-wide
risk reduction efforts

84
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:06,649
for companies at our pillars
of the global economy

85
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:09,280
such as Freddie Mac and Barclays.

86
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,420
If you've ever had a mortgage,
there's a good chance

87
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:15,369
Shawn's been responsible
for keeping it safe

88
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:18,200
and when not busy keeping your money safe.

89
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,380
Shaun finds time

90
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,530
to be on the board of
the financial services

91
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:24,650
information sharing analysis center

92
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:28,799
to be an adjunct professor at
Carnegie Mellon University.

93
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,920
And he also happens to be
an army combat veteran.

94
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,623
So whoa to you, Shaun?

95
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,070
We are lucky to have
Shaun here today, not just

96
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,980
because of his cybersecurity
risk management expertise

97
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:45,083
but he's days away from being
a father for the second time.

98
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:48,050
So when I asked Shaun
what his fun fact was

99
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:48,883
for the panel today,

100
00:04:48,883 --> 00:04:51,159
he mentioned that he
used to be a fast runner

101
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,490
which is totally understandable

102
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:54,110
with all that you have going on today.

103
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:55,980
So welcome, Shaun.

104
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,830
- Thank you, Boyden. Glad to be here.

105
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:00,463
- All right.

106
00:05:00,463 --> 00:05:02,580
So to those of you in the
audience, we're looking forward

107
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:05,250
to responding to some questions
that you might have for us.

108
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,420
So head on over to the
chat and post a question

109
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,850
and we'll be responding
those into real in real time

110
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:12,533
as we work through our
recorded questions today.

111
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:18,469
So we can all agree with the premise

112
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:20,560
that effective cybersecurity depends

113
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,993
on a mature approach to risk management.

114
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:28,420
In fact, cybersecurity
effectiveness is bounded

115
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:31,943
by an organization's
ability to manage risk.

116
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:35,650
So let's get our panelists perspective

117
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:37,390
on what's working and what's not

118
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:40,200
when it comes to
cybersecurity risk management.

119
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,793
Lisa, I want to start with you,

120
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:45,490
in your role as a venture capitalist

121
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:47,820
you have a unique opportunity

122
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:51,240
to roll up your sleeves and
get up close and personal

123
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,450
with companies trying to bring
their technologies to market.

124
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:55,570
I'm going to hazard a guess,

125
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:58,623
there's probably companies like
here in the audience today.

126
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,100
I wanna know,

127
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,480
are you talking to these companies

128
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,070
about cyber risk managements,

129
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:07,003
and if so, what are some of
the themes that you're hearing?

130
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,340
- Thank you, Boyden,
with nearly $40 billion

131
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:14,780
of investment going into
cybersecurity just this year

132
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,700
from private equity and venture capital,

133
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,340
you know, obviously we
see cyber risk management

134
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:22,130
as a business issue versus an IT issue.

135
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:24,880
And cybersecurity is all we do at Option 3

136
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,640
and so our portfolio companies

137
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,860
understand cyber risk management.

138
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,530
You know, these are software companies

139
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:32,880
that are solving for complex issues

140
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,219
whether that be an industrial
controls, automotive.

141
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:40,710
And so they design and
develop with security in mind

142
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:43,099
they're using zero trust architectures,

143
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:46,630
they're leveraging the NIST
cybersecurity framework.

144
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:48,200
And at the end of the day

145
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,370
it comes down to people process and tech

146
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:51,730
and so they know the actions

147
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:54,310
that they need for each of these.

148
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:56,640
Interesting though, the
themes I see correlate

149
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:00,227
to the rise in attacks on
private equity, venture capital

150
00:07:00,227 --> 00:07:02,679
and our portfolio companies

151
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,840
they see us is a target
range, the adversaries.

152
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,440
And if you are investments

153
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,960
as confirmation that there's value.

154
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,070
And off course, we verify
this with the press release

155
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:15,238
highlighting the fact that
we just invested in these

156
00:07:15,238 --> 00:07:17,000
for the obvious reasons

157
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,790
and so it's pretty easy
to follow the breadcrumbs.

158
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:22,130
So you are definitely seeing cyber risk

159
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:25,810
more in M and A due diligence
of possible investments

160
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:27,790
and then an ongoing portfolio management.

161
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:30,330
And as we all know these cyber attacks

162
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:31,960
are not going away anytime soon.

163
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,469
So you're gonna see more,

164
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:35,500
you know, cyber risks, cyber controls,

165
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,033
resiliency are gonna
be even more prevalent.

166
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:40,420
- Great.

167
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:43,190
So Shaun, in contrast to Lisa,

168
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:47,670
you've worked with companies
that are very well resourced

169
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:51,330
and are large not getting a startup,

170
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:52,479
not being there to start.

171
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,090
And so I'd like to know

172
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:56,150
what's your view on what's working

173
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:58,385
and what's not when it comes
to cyber risk management

174
00:07:58,386 --> 00:07:59,823
from your perspective?

175
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,200
- Great, thanks Boyden.

176
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,030
I think part of the challenge is,

177
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:07,119
appropriately, contextualizing cyber risk

178
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,870
with financial risks such as
credit, market and liquidity.

179
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,240
It's a binary discussion

180
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,320
when determining your risk appetite,

181
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,610
risk tolerance and thresholds.

182
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:19,210
And when losses start to approach

183
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:20,539
your level of risk tolerance,

184
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:23,880
you can take actions to move
back in within your appetite.

185
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,750
This is much more complex

186
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,770
within operational risk
domains such as cyber,

187
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:31,169
where it's much more qualitative.

188
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:33,990
Now, there are models, as Lisa mentioned

189
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:36,679
which can be leveraged
to better quantify risks

190
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:39,169
along with approaches
to aggregate controls

191
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:42,419
in order to develop
your key risk indicators

192
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:45,479
whether it aligns with your
vulnerability management program

193
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,360
your MITRE ATT&CK
framework and kill chains.

194
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,400
There is work we need to do as an industry

195
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,260
to make this more of
a science than an art.

196
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:56,050
Currently, anchoring on best practices

197
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:57,439
and best practice frameworks,

198
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,110
such as the NIST cybersecurity framework

199
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:03,050
and maturity models such as the FFIEC

200
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:06,370
or Federal Financial
Institutions Examination Council,

201
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:07,860
cyber assessment tool,

202
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,750
they can help you determine
your inherent risk profile

203
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,110
such as what are your delivery channels,

204
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:15,260
what are the external
threats to your firm?

205
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:17,110
Technologies and connection types

206
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,760
what actions that need to be taken

207
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,760
in order to get to an acceptable
level of residual risk

208
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,480
such as risk governance,
threat intelligence,

209
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,090
preventative and detective
controls and third-party risk.

210
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:32,010
So it's a polarity that we see

211
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:35,180
as we balanced the right
investments to reduce risk

212
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:38,000
and have taking an aggregation

213
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,150
of a couple of different
approaches and models

214
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:42,773
to calibrate residual risk for your firm.

215
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:46,939
- Great, super.

216
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:50,970
Now, Alma, I wanted to shift

217
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:54,250
to you to talk about the federal
perspective for a second.

218
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,200
You know, the FISMA

219
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,860
the Federal Information
Security Modernization Act

220
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,470
requires an agencies
implement cybersecurity

221
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:04,320
based on assessments of impact and risk.

222
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,430
So, you know,

223
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:08,839
technically valid cybersecurity
control implementations

224
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,120
could be entirely or
partially inappropriate

225
00:10:12,383 --> 00:10:14,600
if not aligned to risk identification.

226
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,950
Especially, when you look at,

227
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:18,470
you know multiple layers of organization

228
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:21,570
or mission process or
information system levels.

229
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:24,980
Have you seen this play
out in your agency,

230
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:28,490
and if so, do you have some suggestions?

231
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:30,520
- Yeah, there is definitely pitfalls there

232
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,020
like everyone else it's
really, really critical

233
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:35,270
for us to be able to
establish our risk tolerance

234
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,520
for our organization.

235
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,290
And then sometimes even a
system by system risk tolerance

236
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:41,930
because obviously we
have high value assets

237
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:43,709
not every system needs to be protected

238
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,110
to the same level as others,

239
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:48,140
but at the same time we
have the weakest link issue

240
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:50,600
where if we let our defenses down too much

241
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,490
in any one particular area

242
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:54,640
that can cause an avenue

243
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,480
for an attacker to be able to get in

244
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,500
and to be able to gain a
foothold in our environment

245
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,630
and potentially pivot to
a more high value system.

246
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:03,210
So even when we look across,

247
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:05,650
let's say DHS, an organization like that,

248
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:09,459
CVP where we're the largest
law enforcement agency

249
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:13,283
in the federal civilian large
40 States in the country.

250
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:19,390
We have a lot greater risk
tolerance than like a FEMA might.

251
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:21,240
And what's interesting is as we're talking

252
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,120
to our partners out in the field

253
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:26,680
for most organizations confidentiality

254
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,099
is the biggest thing
that they'll emphasize

255
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,140
when it comes to
confidentiality, availability

256
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,970
or integrity for their data.

257
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:36,060
And certainly we have a lot
of extremely sensitive data

258
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,489
that we are very, very
concerned protecting.

259
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:40,170
But when we get out into the field

260
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:42,880
actually we talk a lot about availability

261
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,650
about being able to build
in resiliency and ensuring

262
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:49,000
that when we actually, you
know, mitigate our systems

263
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,910
when we apply appropriate
security controls

264
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,069
we apply appropriate operating procedures

265
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:55,130
that we're doing something
we're laying a foundation

266
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:57,500
to ensure that those systems are available

267
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,430
when they need them to be there

268
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:01,160
from officer safety perspective

269
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,630
but also that they're available
for the traveling public.

270
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:06,720
So we're not holding up people
who are trying to, you know

271
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,750
enter or leave the country or
all of the trade and travel

272
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,760
that we're doing for supporting everything

273
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,030
their national products
coming into the ports

274
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,310
and everything else that we do.

275
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:17,920
So we definitely have a lot of efforts

276
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,599
that we put towards assuring

277
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,640
that those systems will
be there to be operational

278
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,600
and also the integrity aspect

279
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,590
that they will be able to trust the data

280
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:28,180
that's coming off of those systems.

281
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:31,849
When it comes to again how we
establish that risk tolerance,

282
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:36,850
the one big pitfall that
I think FISMA has seen

283
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:41,090
is we apply controls in
a system by system basis.

284
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:43,310
Now, we've come a long way

285
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:45,849
with actually assuring that we are looking

286
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:49,890
at inherited controls and
that's an efficiency gain for us

287
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:52,590
because we can inherit like controls

288
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:56,730
for a larger GSS system, a
Global Security Patrol System.

289
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:59,310
We can inherit from the
cloud, from FedRAMP systems

290
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:00,310
and things like that.

291
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:01,920
And that can help us to reach

292
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,459
actual formal authorization
to operate faster.

293
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,830
But more importantly

294
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:10,800
we need to be able to have an
overall enterprise wide view

295
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,530
of our complete security
posture instead of getting stuck

296
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:16,470
and looking at sort of the trees

297
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:19,340
of the system by system controls

298
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,040
versus like missing the forest

299
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,770
of how are we actually
securing our enterprise

300
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,410
at that highest level.

301
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:27,390
So I do think that right now

302
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,760
while all the right elements are there

303
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,250
to assure we're applying controls

304
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,170
at that most granular level

305
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:33,099
we just have to make sure

306
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,480
that we're also sticking
our head up above the trees

307
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,383
and seeing that whole enterprise
view at the same time.

308
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,190
- That's interesting Alma.

309
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:44,460
How do you measure if you're
making progress or not,

310
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:47,653
or how do you measure your
organization's maturity on this?

311
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,200
- Yeah, so we actually have to...

312
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,650
Again, I think we augment
FISMA with what we do.

313
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:58,170
So I am a big fan also of the
NIST risk management framework

314
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,199
when it comes to laying out
your cybersecurity program

315
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,840
in the form of identify, protect,
detect, respond, recover.

316
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,820
I think that shows you a different view

317
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,600
of how your controls are applied.

318
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,540
We're also doing things
like Shaun mentioned

319
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,790
the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

320
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:13,520
So we're constantly doing gap analysis

321
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,380
against MITRE ATT&CK framework.

322
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:18,500
But also when it comes to
having an overall risk register,

323
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,830
we built up, we take feeds and inputs

324
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:24,560
from all over our cybersecurity
program, and that can be

325
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,359
all the formal certification
accreditation work,

326
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,100
our ongoing vulnerability management work,

327
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,510
our penetration testing.

328
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:34,030
Now we also support
our penetration testing

329
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:36,189
with several public Bug Bounty Program

330
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:37,480
that we've had in the last two years,

331
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,010
which have been a real benefit
and something that, you know,

332
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:42,850
obviously scales really, really well

333
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:46,054
where we can bring in a
huge high level of expertise

334
00:14:46,054 --> 00:14:49,209
that that's laser focused
on a particular problem

335
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:51,323
that can come in and give
us, you know, very targeted,

336
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:56,323
high quality results for
really a very good benefit.

337
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,880
Also anything that we're
learning from our incidents

338
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:03,110
as we go back and assess what went wrong

339
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,340
and what do we need to do

340
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,330
to make sure we don't have
those same instances again.

341
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:09,000
We have a very active cyber
threat intelligence program now

342
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,970
that that takes input
from both classified,

343
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:13,520
unclassified information,

344
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,660
partners across the federal span space.

345
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:18,170
Cisco obviously is a
huge, huge partner for us

346
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:20,500
and feeding us lots of high quality,

347
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,780
actual intelligence information.

348
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:24,180
Also anything that we're getting

349
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:27,180
from our overall security
architecture initiatives

350
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,880
and gaps we identified there

351
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,380
and basically any place else

352
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,970
where we actually find those gaps.

353
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:34,370
We want to take them, bring them

354
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:37,260
into that overall risk register
for the enterprise level.

355
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,470
And we have a methodology
to then rack and stack

356
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:41,130
all those various items.

357
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:42,930
So we can assure that we know

358
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:45,500
what the biggest enterprise
things that risks are

359
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,663
and that we're addressing those
in the appropriate manner.

360
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,130
- That was super, Alma.

361
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:52,681
Shaun, do you have
anything to add to that,

362
00:15:52,681 --> 00:15:57,681
that you do at Discover
now to help measure your,

363
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:00,875
to help discover if you are maturing

364
00:16:00,875 --> 00:16:03,970
in your efforts to manage risk?

365
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:07,380
- Absolutely, and Alma really hit on many

366
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:11,330
if not all of the key
best practice components

367
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:13,960
that we see across the industry.

368
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:18,220
And I would submit that cyber
defense risk management,

369
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:22,950
it's cyber, it's really
industry sector agnostic

370
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:25,200
where the same principles apply.

371
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,330
I would submit how do we move toward

372
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:31,920
a more of an assured risk state?

373
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,680
In a sense, when we think about zero trust

374
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:39,239
we think about taking advantage
of cloud native activities

375
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,620
with immutable and ephemeral assets

376
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,070
with known configurations,

377
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:45,330
and you restored back to default

378
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:47,570
or known good configuration.

379
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:49,700
There are a lot of,
we're seeing an evolution

380
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,270
in the environment to where,

381
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:54,810
we can move from this position
of playing whack-a-mole

382
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:56,800
as we detect respond.

383
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,579
But then we still need to ensure that

384
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:02,040
we're doing the basics
and that whether it's the,

385
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,599
these exchange zero
days, we've seen recently

386
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:07,129
and we're seeing more advanced
attacks such as SolarWinds

387
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:10,020
where supply chain issues, identity issues

388
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,670
how do we continue to move
toward an assured state

389
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:16,690
on an environment which has
such an expansive posture

390
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:18,930
some of those capabilities,
as Alma mentioned

391
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:20,069
and continue to build there

392
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:22,354
which I'm sure we all are moving toward

393
00:17:22,354 --> 00:17:26,920
this more of an assured
state to the extent possible

394
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,660
but it's a continuous calibration

395
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:32,443
as we evaluate in a rapidly
evolving threat environment.

396
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,490
- Great, thank you, Shaun.

397
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:39,990
And Lisa, are any of
these topics resonating

398
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:43,020
with the group that you speak with,

399
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,693
do you have any comments to add?

400
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:48,730
- I agree with both Shaun and Alma.

401
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:50,460
Obviously, scale-wise,

402
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:53,777
you know, when you're dealing
with a seed all the way up to,

403
00:17:53,777 --> 00:17:56,460
you know, we categorize series A series B.

404
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:59,453
So, you know, the earlier stage companies,

405
00:18:00,609 --> 00:18:03,919
you know, they have their
own maturation of frameworks

406
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,870
that they can adopt and how
fast they can adopt them.

407
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:08,179
But again, as I shared,

408
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,520
you know, we're only
investing in cybersecurity.

409
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:14,110
So these folks are already pretty expert

410
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:18,070
in understanding how
to leverage the MITRE,

411
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:21,760
the NIST framework, and are dealing with,

412
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,350
you know, basically designing

413
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:25,122
from the start security in mind.

414
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,393
- Awesome, great.

415
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:32,950
Well, I want to shift gears for a minute.

416
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:35,180
You know, it wouldn't be a
cybersecurity risk discussion

417
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:39,300
if we didn't talk about cyber insurance.

418
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,680
And so I wanna bring this question

419
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:47,110
to start with you, Lisa again,
you know, what are your views

420
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:52,110
on cyber insurance as part of
the risk management equation?

421
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:54,133
- Well, thanks Boyden.

422
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,270
I think it's really a reflective

423
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:59,930
of the state of the cyber
environment right now.

424
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:04,040
I mean, the cyber insurance
market was 7 billion last year

425
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:08,037
and is projected to go
to 2025 with 20 billion

426
00:19:08,037 --> 00:19:10,830
and some analysts are saying 50 billion.

427
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:12,230
I mean, that's astronomical.

428
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:16,200
Almost 10 times the number of claims

429
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,320
were written in the last three years

430
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,939
and there's over 500 insurers now writing

431
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:24,000
specifically cyber insurance claims.

432
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,230
But as you can imagine

433
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:28,900
this is all being driven
by board level awareness,

434
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,630
the SolarWinds hack reputational risk.

435
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:35,720
And, you know, all of these
things are quite interesting

436
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,220
from a venture capital standpoint,

437
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,280
because if we look at the companies

438
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,710
that have been invested in

439
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:43,260
we've seen that maybe 200
million has been invested

440
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:47,470
in this market and we have
already seen several uniforms.

441
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:49,860
And so uniforms are
those startup companies

442
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,909
those companies that are valued

443
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:54,623
at over a billion dollars
already in this market.

444
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:00,130
So I think, you know, again,
the challenges for insurers

445
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:04,570
or new insurance companies
greatest concerns include,

446
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:08,500
you know, how do they define
appropriate pricing mechanisms?

447
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,340
How do they get agreement
of policies across States,

448
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:16,129
countries, and the areas of
cyber risk being invested in

449
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:19,860
for insurers or it's like
intelligence, education,

450
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,280
artificial intelligence,

451
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,920
so that they can do better underwriting

452
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,690
data protection monitoring,

453
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:27,290
and then for the enterprises,

454
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:29,570
for those who want cyber insurance,

455
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:31,310
you know, they've got to show

456
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:33,950
that they have a cyber
risk management framework

457
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:35,340
that they're adhering to it

458
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:38,050
that they're practicing
and executing against it.

459
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:39,889
They're going to have to do that annually

460
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:41,990
if they want to keep the policy.

461
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:46,170
And if they show any, you
know, hygiene risk weakness,

462
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:49,460
they're going to have fix it
to keep the policy in place.

463
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,570
So it's really interesting
because it's an emerging market

464
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:55,320
but it's a market that's almost showing

465
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,750
that there's more demand than capacity

466
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,380
for the insurers to fill in.

467
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:03,352
- That's really interesting, Lisa.

468
00:21:03,353 --> 00:21:08,290
Shaun, how do you see
cyber risk cyber insurance

469
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:10,780
fitting into the cyber risk equation?

470
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:12,370
- Thank you, Boyden.

471
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:16,493
Cyber insurance, I believe
it's important to have.

472
00:21:16,493 --> 00:21:20,083
I think bottom line, as we
think about it from a control,

473
00:21:20,084 --> 00:21:22,650
it's a risk transfer activity

474
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:26,360
and it can be perceived as that
in the event of an incident

475
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:29,590
but I would submit it is not a panacea

476
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:32,490
in protecting the firm
from such secondary losses

477
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:36,170
whether that's reputational
risks, whether it's legal risk

478
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:40,890
it does a great job of covering
a lot of your primary losses

479
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:43,230
in the event you had an incident,

480
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:46,349
but when we think about cyber attacks

481
00:21:46,349 --> 00:21:49,820
it's almost like it follows
a pattern of epidemiology

482
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:52,379
where if not contained early

483
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:56,590
it can spread and become
very expensive, very massive.

484
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:58,800
And there are limits to insurance.

485
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,520
I think it's an important
tool in your broader,

486
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,800
in your risk reduction,
risk transfer a toolkit

487
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,730
but certainly not a panacea.

488
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:09,360
And is not a replacement

489
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,610
for investing in your cyber
program, managing your control

490
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:16,142
and an exposure posture across your firm.

491
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,920
- And Alma, not something that, you know

492
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,180
the Federal Government or as an agency,

493
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:26,357
so that you're able to get cyber risk

494
00:22:26,357 --> 00:22:28,510
and cyber insurance for your agency.

495
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:33,110
But I'm curious if you have
other ideas of transferring risk

496
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:34,449
or if it has a role

497
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:37,600
for the organizations
that are your vendors

498
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,730
who might be getting it it.

499
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:43,303
- I thought you were my cyber
insurance, if I'm not wrong.

500
00:22:43,303 --> 00:22:45,140
(Boyden laughs)

501
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:47,160
- It's perfect. (laughing)

502
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,688
- No, I mean, it is actually different.

503
00:22:49,688 --> 00:22:54,688
We have a different role to
play and obviously loss is also,

504
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:56,620
you know, different for
us and we not looking at,

505
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,389
you know, market share
and things like that.

506
00:22:58,389 --> 00:23:03,062
So no, I'm not aware of any
federal agencies having it.

507
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,149
You know, it'll be interesting to see

508
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:07,117
if that is something
that develops because,

509
00:23:07,117 --> 00:23:10,260
you know, I won't use
SolarWinds as an example.

510
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:14,350
And so I'm sure like the buzz
words that the drinking game

511
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:18,120
for this conference has gotta
be zero trust and SolarWinds

512
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,540
and I'm not sure what other
buzzwords are going to be there

513
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:22,399
but those two are definitely
going to be there.

514
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,390
But, you know, even with, with CISA,

515
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:28,550
you know, I think you've
seen a lot of organizations

516
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:30,129
that have had to pick up the phone

517
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:31,760
and call external entities

518
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,400
to assist with that breach response.

519
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,950
And so I think that does beg the question

520
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:39,010
that probably needs to happen at,

521
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:42,230
you know, the CISA level and above that

522
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:44,840
about what should the role be about,

523
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:49,090
you know, do we scale something
Federal Government wide

524
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:51,810
where if CISA needs to
augment a lot of it's support

525
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:53,810
or if agencies need more support

526
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:56,500
is there a good, you
know, pipeline or contract

527
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,070
or something else through
like, for example,

528
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,540
that CISA is setting up

529
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,040
to be able to get some of that support.

530
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,460
I think it is on QSMO, isn't it,

531
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:05,450
for some of the response initiatives?

532
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:06,730
- Yeah, let me just pause there

533
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:10,050
for the folks in the audience
that QSMO acronym stands for,

534
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:11,970
Quality Service Management Office

535
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:15,200
of a part of the cyber
security infrastructure

536
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,803
security agencies offerings to basically,

537
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:21,939
you know, make available

538
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:24,910
the Federal Government's buying power

539
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:28,800
in shared services and other standardizing

540
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,300
on a quality standard

541
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,020
for different services across
the Federal Government.

542
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:34,080
That's a good point

543
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,210
but we are exploring a cyber response fund

544
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:39,260
similar to FEMA has via the Stafford Act.

545
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:41,790
So that it's something that's
being conceived of right now.

546
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:42,623
Back to you, Alma

547
00:24:42,623 --> 00:24:45,040
- Yeah, I know definitely
a lot of discussion about,

548
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,040
you know, a lot of different
parts of DHS like FEMA

549
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,159
and how they should play
when you have these major

550
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:52,653
you know, cyber response requirements.

551
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:56,720
So I guess you'd mentioned other parties

552
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,000
it's probably a good time.

553
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,100
I mentioned SolarWinds

554
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,590
probably a good time to
bring up third party risk.

555
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:04,620
That's definitely something
that we absolutely

556
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:05,830
have as a concern.

557
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:08,360
And so it, it could be a factor

558
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:11,639
of someone's overall risk
score when we're dealing with

559
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,030
whether we're dealing with

560
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:15,990
you know, suppliers, something,
someone owns a supply chain

561
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:17,450
like a SolarWinds

562
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:20,550
or contractors who are
providing us personnel,

563
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:24,100
or, you know, we tend to
not want to do a whole lot

564
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,240
of offsite processing of our data out

565
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,380
on systems that aren't,
let's say our own systems

566
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:31,520
but that's a scenario
that a lot of agencies do.

567
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,610
And so I think would think that
they would have to make sure

568
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:36,399
that within their contracts

569
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,310
that might be something
that they would look for

570
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:41,760
to ensure that they have
adequate security to start with

571
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,060
those requirements are all
built with their contracts.

572
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,950
And perhaps that they have, you know

573
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:48,600
clauses in there where they can reach out

574
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:51,669
and quickly grab additional
support to surge.

575
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:54,623
If it's required in
response to an incident.

576
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,470
You know, we are looking at a lot

577
00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:01,500
of those challenges with
how we actually measure risk

578
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,750
for all these entities that
we are now doing business

579
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:04,800
with connecting.

580
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:08,850
So I've been with DHS in one
form or another, you know

581
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:11,030
for the last 15 years or so.

582
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:14,149
And when we first came in
from an attack perspective

583
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:19,150
I can say that we saw a lot
more direct attacks on us.

584
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:22,910
We still see obviously direct
attacks, but I think a lot

585
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:25,080
of the attacks, all the
volume that we have seen

586
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,899
I believe it's shifted to the
people we do business with

587
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:30,540
because I think that's
often a softer target.

588
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:34,139
So now again, now they're
seeing that as a way to get

589
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:36,650
into us or to get to the
same data that we might hold.

590
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:37,990
Now we have this big concern

591
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:40,560
about how do we raise everyone else up

592
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:44,522
to a higher standard and how
do we validate whether or not

593
00:26:44,522 --> 00:26:47,929
they are properly
mitigating their cyber risk

594
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:50,390
before we do business with
them in some instances.

595
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:53,110
And the thing is we have
some teams that can go out

596
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:56,580
and assess key partners
for high value assets

597
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:59,210
or where we have a, you know, a really

598
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:01,290
a lot of sensitive data
that might be out there.

599
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:04,120
The third part does have to
handle, but that doesn't scale

600
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,000
towards everyone that
we need to talk with.

601
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,990
So we are looking at,

602
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:10,370
we brought in some third-party entities

603
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:14,169
to be able to do some of the
risk scoring for third parties.

604
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:16,110
Shaun's actually referred
some companies to us.

605
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:18,050
We found some other companies as well

606
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:19,830
so we can get that sort of credit score

607
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:22,419
for cyber risk when
these companies certainly

608
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:25,070
whether or not they have cyber
insurance could be, you know

609
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:27,149
an element of that risk.

610
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:30,500
But we're looking now again,
how we grow that program

611
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:33,730
for third party risk and
without having to, you know

612
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:36,220
be everywhere and assess
everyone directly have more

613
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,650
of that attestation,

614
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:39,530
similar to what the department of defense

615
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:43,420
is talking about with the CMMC standard.

616
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:45,120
DHS is very interested in that overall,

617
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,659
we've already had some discussions

618
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:49,820
with DOD about how we
could potentially adopt

619
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:52,800
that into our contracts.

620
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,270
We're obviously not there like today

621
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:58,700
but it's something that I
could see coming very soon

622
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:01,320
as a way to, you know, I think ensure

623
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:05,000
that we're all meeting some
sort of a high standard

624
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,600
and can really have some sort
of attestation and validation

625
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,610
of that we aren't having
to necessarily do ourselves

626
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:12,443
all the time.

627
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:14,740
- Yeah, absolutely.

628
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:15,850
Please, Shaun.

629
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:18,040
Okay. On, on the insurance piece.

630
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:21,080
Yeah, I'm not sure if I
could imagine a company

631
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,500
underwriting the U S government

632
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:27,120
and that's going to be more of
a, in an appropriations bill

633
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,020
or going back to the treasury,

634
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:33,129
but the third party risks
that Alma highlights

635
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:35,500
it's exactly the same
in the industry as well

636
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,930
where you have a lot of the larger firms

637
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:42,020
that have built up a robust
control posture is a perfect,

638
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:42,853
nothing's perfect

639
00:28:42,853 --> 00:28:45,610
but you really it's going
through the weakest link.

640
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:47,340
Why should I burn a zero day

641
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:50,689
if I can go get him through
the neighbor's house to you.

642
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:53,320
And how do we ensure we
have that have a view

643
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,260
whether it's an external
exposure footprint

644
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:57,080
that's an indicator of
what they're, you know

645
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,570
if the outside of the house is dirty

646
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:02,560
pretty it's you have a
high level of confidence

647
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:05,490
that the inside of the house
has some challenges as well.

648
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:08,570
And then how do you ensure
that you have rapid mechanisms

649
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:10,710
to either ensure your data's protected

650
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:13,440
whether that's tokenization,
you manage the access.

651
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,000
You can look at behavioral,

652
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,960
any type of basion type models

653
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,298
to look at behavior
within your environment

654
00:29:19,298 --> 00:29:22,590
to mitigate those risks
as soon as possible

655
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:26,193
but similar challenges that
Alma is facing as well.

656
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,250
- Yes, in one of the other,

657
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:34,420
one of the sort of in delicate phrases

658
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:36,840
I like to refer to when we're
talking about cybersecurity

659
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,129
is that sort of proverbial, you know

660
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:42,140
if you encounter a bear in
the woods with your friend

661
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,670
you don't need to run
faster than the bear.

662
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:45,780
You just need to run
faster than your friend.

663
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:50,300
And I think that is sort of
appropriate when it comes

664
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,360
to cybersecurity a little bit

665
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,790
because you want to be not
the lowest hanging fruit

666
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:57,149
for the adversary to your
point about, you know

667
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:58,677
getting into the department, not directly

668
00:29:58,677 --> 00:30:00,879
but going through third
parties and things like that.

669
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,140
So I'm curious, any thoughts on, you know

670
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:07,210
knowing your status relative to your peers

671
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:10,550
yet also there are so many
interdependencies you do want all

672
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,375
all tie the tide to rise all ships.

673
00:30:14,375 --> 00:30:15,963
Any comments?

674
00:30:17,108 --> 00:30:19,700
(group chatter)

675
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:20,533
- Go on Shaun.

676
00:30:21,753 --> 00:30:25,139
- It certainly is a
collective defense environment

677
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:28,120
which is what excites me about
the work with the FSI sec

678
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,290
at least for the financial services sector

679
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:32,500
how do we ensure rapid
intelligence sharing?

680
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:35,506
And that's a lot of the work
you do at CISA, you know,

681
00:30:35,506 --> 00:30:38,300
for the DHS and Federal Government,

682
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:41,690
but how do we ensure a broader
collective defense approach

683
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:44,160
where we can have rapid
sharing of indicators

684
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,470
of compromises of hashes,

685
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:48,220
of other threat intelligence and tippers.

686
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:51,560
So if we see anybody
walking the fence line

687
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:54,810
in our perimeter, we can start to raise up

688
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:57,010
and highlight that type of activity.

689
00:30:57,010 --> 00:31:00,280
So our other colleagues and partners

690
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:03,100
while we compete against each
other in financial markets,

691
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:07,590
we still work together to ensure
we have collective defense

692
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:08,820
and we can share information,

693
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:12,263
have rapid response across the sector.

694
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,450
- Great Alma.

695
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:16,570
- Yeah, I can't imagine doing this job

696
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:19,679
without having the
input of my fellow CISOs

697
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,990
from across the Federal Government

698
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:23,686
and especially of course inside DHS

699
00:31:23,686 --> 00:31:27,389
and the other major components, you know

700
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:29,130
we've had a really,
really good partnership

701
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:33,340
to be able to, you know, one,
we do have a common scorecard

702
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:35,379
so we can see like relatively speaking

703
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:38,210
wherever one is sitting with
a lot of the key metrics

704
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:39,980
especially around vulnerability management

705
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:41,400
and configuration management

706
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,210
and our status with authorizing systems

707
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:46,260
and how my systems were running.

708
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:48,839
But obviously we have a lot
of ongoing dialogue too,

709
00:31:48,839 --> 00:31:51,639
amongst each other about,
well, how are we doing this?

710
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,880
What tools are you using?

711
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,380
How can we improve the
way that our security

712
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,290
operations centers share information?

713
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,641
What's the real, even
discussions about risks.

714
00:31:59,641 --> 00:32:01,420
And when we have things like SolarWinds

715
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,160
or we have, you know, a collective group

716
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,430
where we can actually ask each other,

717
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:06,130
okay, what is the risk of doing this,

718
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:07,700
and what are the best alternatives

719
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,530
for actually dealing with that?

720
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:11,103
Yeah, you have to have a
community and somebody else

721
00:32:11,103 --> 00:32:13,150
that you can hold yourself up against,

722
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:15,550
otherwise, you would
just really have no way

723
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:18,080
to even say whether or not you're good.

724
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,580
And, you know, and may that
lead to the false insecurity

725
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:25,970
or just as bad, I think could
be, you know, overspending,

726
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:28,730
overdoing some of your security, you know

727
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:30,560
where you're locking down systems,

728
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:34,690
spending a lot of money
that you don't need to spend

729
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:37,394
making life more difficult from your users

730
00:32:37,394 --> 00:32:38,930
it needs to be, it's
definitely a balancing act

731
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:40,960
and without that feeler.

732
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,860
I don't think you gotta be
able to get that exactly right.

733
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:47,250
Yeah, we'll leave it at that.

734
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:48,083
- Super.

735
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,570
Well, I wanted to get us thinking

736
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:54,810
about the future a little bit now,

737
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:55,720
we've, we've talked a lot

738
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,220
about the things that we've done so far

739
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:01,970
that have worked some areas
that we we've learned lessons

740
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:03,530
that we have recommendations
for the future.

741
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:06,210
And I want to sort of pivot us to wrap up

742
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:09,910
with some projections on where we think

743
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:13,330
the cyber risk discussion is
gonna be going in the future.

744
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:15,290
And I want to give the first word to Lisa

745
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:17,040
because of all of us,
I think she's probably

746
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:21,760
got the best aptitude for
betting on winners here.

747
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,850
And so I wanted to take advantage

748
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:27,399
of your ability to look
in the crystal ball.

749
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,980
Lisa, any projections

750
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:31,663
for where the risk discussion
is going for cyber?

751
00:33:32,797 --> 00:33:34,430
- Well, I'll start with this, right?

752
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:38,470
And as we will know, that
digitization of business

753
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:41,870
has just accelerated
through pandemic, right?

754
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:44,050
And we're not going to be going back.

755
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:47,879
And so, you know, which in turn
has put additional pressure

756
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,570
on every single company

757
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:54,570
from their cyber risk posture
to their resiliency plans.

758
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:59,580
And frankly, my prediction
is that customers, consumers,

759
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:04,080
and citizens, expect that
companies and government

760
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,580
are going to view cyber

761
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:08,723
as important part of
their value proposition.

762
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:13,610
And companies and governments
should leverage that.

763
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:17,320
And if folks, you know,
don't feel that way

764
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,880
and citizens don't feel that way

765
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,929
they're going to vote not
only with their wallets

766
00:34:20,929 --> 00:34:23,580
but they're going to vote
literally with their votes.

767
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:28,090
- Excellent. Thank you, Lisa.

768
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:30,389
Alma to you.

769
00:34:30,389 --> 00:34:32,239
- Yeah, so we're going to be doing

770
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:36,209
lots and lots of outsourcing,
lots more managed services,

771
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:37,469
software as a services.

772
00:34:37,469 --> 00:34:40,500
So we're going to be
spreading our risk out a lot

773
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,870
amongst other third-parties

774
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:45,040
that whereas normally we'd
want to do that all ourselves

775
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,000
but that doesn't scale
and we can't be experts

776
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:48,980
in all of those things.

777
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:51,480
So, you know, our attitude towards risk

778
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,179
in Federal Government has to shift

779
00:34:53,179 --> 00:34:54,909
to adapt to those new models.

780
00:34:54,909 --> 00:34:58,009
There are huge, huge benefits for doing it

781
00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:00,530
and it makes life a lot better,

782
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:03,620
but again we can't go
and hug servers anymore

783
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:06,839
and have sort of the same
know a sense of ownership

784
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:09,157
of every single thing that we do.

785
00:35:09,157 --> 00:35:11,670
You know, going beyond that automation

786
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:13,480
obviously we're going to
continue to lean on that.

787
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,110
That is hugely transformative

788
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:17,240
how we do security operations.

789
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,100
Part of that automation is obviously

790
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,910
the implementation of zero trust,

791
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:24,720
which again, I've spoken on like

792
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,669
I think five zero trust panels last month

793
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:28,610
everyone wants to talk about zero trust.

794
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:30,660
And it's an old concept really

795
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,200
because it's really just least privileged

796
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,850
but it's actually executing
that to the nth degree

797
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:36,069
and doing it correctly.

798
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:37,950
And now we have the and the capabilities

799
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:39,480
to actually do that right.

800
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:42,021
And then finally, as Shaun said, you know,

801
00:35:42,021 --> 00:35:44,120
moving from some of the security models

802
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:47,400
of protecting confidentiality,
integrity, availability

803
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,780
to where we're doing the DIE model, right.

804
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:52,010
Which is another thing that comes from RSA

805
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:55,080
distributed immutable and
ephemeral for all services.

806
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:58,200
So we're creating services
that we can sacrifice

807
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,569
that we know can get blown away

808
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:01,260
and can come up in a pristine state

809
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,240
that we have distributed.

810
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,464
So, you know, they're load
balanced, they're resilient,

811
00:36:05,465 --> 00:36:07,103
they are fault tolerant.

812
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:11,730
Building systems where
it doesn't really matter

813
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:13,060
if a compromise happens

814
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:16,370
because that's just
something that goes away

815
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:17,400
essentially in an instant.

816
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,750
And we keep going without
being slowed down at all.

817
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:23,400
So between those models and, you know

818
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,720
the full braces, zero trust,

819
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,810
I mean, I think we're really on the edge

820
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:28,790
of something really,
really big in security

821
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:31,440
that will be a game
changing for all of us.

822
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,250
- For those of you who aren't familiar

823
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:36,320
with to what Alma referring D-I-E,

824
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:40,000
just Google Sounil Yu's
talk at RSA from last year.

825
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,300
You want to have more cattle, less pets.

826
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,970
I'll leave it at that
and pass it over to Shaun

827
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:46,319
to give us your prediction.

828
00:36:47,361 --> 00:36:51,069
- Really my teammates Lisa
and Alma hit it on the head.

829
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:53,830
I think this environment

830
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:55,860
it's going to get a lot
worse before it gets better.

831
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:58,630
And while we may have better models

832
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:02,040
to have improved risk quantification,

833
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,012
we take advantage of
some of the principles

834
00:37:04,012 --> 00:37:07,230
that Alma and Lisa have highlighted.

835
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:09,220
It's we're going to see more challenges.

836
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:12,200
We see a rapid evolving environment.

837
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,314
When you think about your typical domains,

838
00:37:14,314 --> 00:37:17,600
air-war fighting domains,
air, sea space, and land,

839
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,819
they're really finite, it's
finite physics can constrain it.

840
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:22,730
You can only turn a fighter jet

841
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:27,480
so many Gs before the craft
starts to break apart.

842
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:30,340
And so when you think about
cyber at the intersection

843
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:32,830
of all of these domains,
it's a man-made domain.

844
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:35,509
It's malleable, the
dimensions are changing.

845
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:38,010
As soon as we iterate and
continue to lock down.

846
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:41,300
I think we're going to see a new evolution

847
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:44,080
of these types of attacks,
but how do we ensure

848
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,150
that we anchor on the core principles

849
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:49,250
mentioned by my teammates and
continue to push that forward

850
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:52,940
and ensure that we have immediate response

851
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:55,210
again, the immutability automation,

852
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:57,320
simplification which is critical

853
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:01,270
as we continue along
this exciting environment

854
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:02,910
that's going to become more complex.

855
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:06,359
And how do we continue to
maintain those principles

856
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:10,300
and prevent and reduce risk to our firms,

857
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:12,450
organizations and our government.

858
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:13,500
Thank you.

859
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,920
- I love that Shaun.

860
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,883
Think of Occam's razor, you
know, keeping it simple,

861
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:20,343
excellent phrase.

862
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:25,230
Well, folks, thank you for tuning in today
