1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:04,820
- Hi, welcome to the
municipal cyber security

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:08,330
building the last mile
of resiliency panel.

3
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:10,629
I'm Stephanie Helm and I'm the director

4
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:13,123
of the Massachusetts Cybersecurity Center.

5
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:16,190
Joining me today are three distinguished

6
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:18,030
public servants who are serving

7
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:20,960
as part of the Baker-Polito administration

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,120
for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

9
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,000
And they'll be talking

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,170
with us today about
cybersecurity for municipalities.

11
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:30,390
I will be joined by Mike Kennealy.

12
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:32,610
Who's the secretary of
the Executive Office

13
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:34,990
of Housing and Economic Development.

14
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:36,820
Curtis M. Wood the secretary

15
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:40,930
of the Executive Office of
Technology Services and Security

16
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:43,870
and undersecretary,
Jeanne Benincasa Thorpe

17
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:46,900
who is the undersecretary
for Homeland Security

18
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:50,610
of the Executive Office of
Public Safety and Security.

19
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,940
Their full biographies are available

20
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:55,489
on the RSA conference platform.

21
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:58,730
And you'll be able to find
more information about them

22
00:00:58,730 --> 00:00:59,943
if you are interested.

23
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:02,070
Today, I'd like to talk

24
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:05,750
to you a little bit about
cyber security in Massachusetts

25
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:10,170
and our role in improving
municipal cybersecurity.

26
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,370
I'm at the MassCyberCenter

27
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:15,270
which is a division of the
mass tech collaborative

28
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:17,149
which is a quasi state agency

29
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:21,070
which focuses on tech and
innovation in Massachusetts.

30
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:23,100
Part of the MassCyberCenter's mission

31
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,500
is to work with the
cybersecurity ecosystem

32
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,570
to support cybersecurity
initiatives in the state.

33
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:31,119
But we also have a role

34
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:34,420
in looking at resiliency
and how cybersecurity

35
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:37,860
is affecting the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts.

36
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,550
The topic that we have today

37
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:42,170
building that last mile of resiliency

38
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:45,200
reaching out to the local
communities is very challenging.

39
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,170
And there are probably many

40
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:48,870
of you on this panel
watching this panel today

41
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:52,230
that can probably feel the challenges

42
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:55,633
of reaching out to every
local city and town.

43
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:00,450
In the context of of what the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts

44
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:05,450
is dealing with, we have 351
separate cities and towns.

45
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,300
We don't have a County
system that organizes

46
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,640
the IT architecture.

47
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,820
Each town sets up its own it architecture

48
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:18,420
and therefore owns its
cybersecurity problem.

49
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:21,299
Cybersecurity is a priority for our state.

50
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:25,870
The creation of the
MassCyberCenter was one effort.

51
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:30,210
And part of that to build the
resiliency was the creation

52
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:33,470
of the cyber resilient
Massachusetts working group.

53
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,710
The MassCyberCenter

54
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:36,900
convenes this working group once a month.

55
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,910
And we talk about issues
relating to resiliency.

56
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:43,240
One priority that has come up frequently

57
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,380
has been the challenges

58
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:48,310
facing municipalities for cybersecurity.

59
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:51,180
So we have been looking at cybersecurity

60
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,890
at municipalities for quite a while.

61
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:58,890
And in 2019 the state of
Massachusetts was selected

62
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:02,510
for a national governor's association

63
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:05,200
cybersecurity policy workshop.

64
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,679
In that workshop, we brought
together state agencies

65
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,770
representatives from local communities

66
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:15,070
to examine how we can improve

67
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:19,140
what we have for cybersecurity
to support municipal efforts

68
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:22,260
and as an outcome of that,

69
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:26,429
I have the three secretaries
represented here today

70
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:30,940
because they're the
substantial leads in many

71
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:35,940
of the efforts that we have
facing municipal cybersecurity.

72
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:39,329
So first I'm going to
turn to secretary Wood.

73
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:42,180
Who's the secretary for
the executive office

74
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,170
of technology services and security.

75
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:48,549
Secretary Wood as the state CIO,

76
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:50,050
what are your responsibilities

77
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:52,500
for cybersecurity at the state level

78
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,323
and how do you interact
with municipalities?

79
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,710
- Well, thank you Stephanie and a good day

80
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:02,263
to all you folks out there,
hope everybody as well.

81
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,420
So our executive office

82
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:07,420
of technology services
security was created in 2017

83
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:10,799
by governor Baker in order
to put a primary focus

84
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,470
on investment in our
enterprise technology services

85
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:16,810
modernization and cybersecurity.

86
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:17,800
So over the last several years

87
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:22,500
our organization has moved
forward to its center

88
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,850
essentially managing our
enterprise security services

89
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:28,940
for our nine executive branch
agencies, our nine cabinets

90
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:33,080
and our 125 plus
executive branch agencies.

91
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:38,080
Each organization works
within our main office

92
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,590
of our executive office of security.

93
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:43,539
We have a chief information
security officer

94
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,290
who has responsibility to ensure

95
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:48,400
that we have the enterprise
information security policies

96
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,659
and standards established

97
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,930
across the executive branch of government.

98
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:54,390
Other state agencies who also participate

99
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:56,870
within our network and
infrastructure also are bound

100
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:59,800
by our policies and procedures as well.

101
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,480
So the last several years
we've really focused

102
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:05,780
on several areas, including
certainly security operations,

103
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:08,580
vulnerability management
programs, threat monitoring

104
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,349
threat hunting, things of that nature

105
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:11,653
at the enterprise level.

106
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,520
Working on an enterprise
security awareness,

107
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,780
education program for
our employee workforce

108
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:19,919
and really working to strengthen our DNA

109
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:23,070
our fabric Australia fabric
across the executive branch

110
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,180
of government, working with
our public safety partners

111
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,620
our national federal partners,

112
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,170
as well as to really kind
of build out the capacity

113
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:33,380
the monitoring capabilities,
and to protect the data

114
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,900
and the assets of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts

115
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,893
specific to our municipal partners.

116
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,300
We work routinely with these folks

117
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:44,840
day-to-day certainly they
have their own responsibility

118
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,729
as we do as well.

119
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:47,780
How will we work in area to collaborate

120
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:50,159
with these folks for information sharing

121
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,370
providing resources as
needed in our office?

122
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:56,110
We do actually have a full-time office

123
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:58,640
of municipal school technology

124
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,550
that was created several
years ago that focused

125
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:02,780
on providing services and grant funding

126
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:05,960
to our municipal partners
through our program

127
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,870
through our Lieutenant governor's office

128
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,890
we've worked very closely
with secretary Kennealy

129
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:13,289
his team, and others public
safety and Homeland Security

130
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,720
to make sure that we have the right focus

131
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,870
for our municipal partners.

132
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:19,520
We're working on programs,
such as health check

133
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,250
where we've provided some
services by a vendor who works

134
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,080
with us to be able to
provide security awareness

135
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,650
and training and phishing campaigns

136
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:29,440
for many of our municipalities and schools

137
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,450
we've also heavily invested
in technology planning

138
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:34,740
and modernization through
our state grant programs

139
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:38,300
in our state capital programs
to work with municipalities

140
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,800
to ensure that they have
the appropriate resiliency

141
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,998
and then of course working
with your office as well.

142
00:06:44,998 --> 00:06:46,620
And what we really believe
at the end of the day

143
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,740
is very very important here

144
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,380
is really all of us be working together.

145
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:52,100
We believe our cybersecurity
of the Commonwealth

146
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:55,240
as a collective responsibility
from a state government,

147
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,650
from County systems as well.

148
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:58,890
Although we don't have County government

149
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,909
we do have sheriffs and
district attorney's offices

150
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:03,420
that are County based
that are elected officials

151
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,320
that we work with our independent agencies

152
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:08,030
and constitutionals, and of
course, I mean a small practice.

153
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:10,859
So, we're all in this together to make

154
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,350
a more secure Commonwealth.

155
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:13,970
So that's what our responsibility

156
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:17,290
and what we've been focusing
on the last several years.

157
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:20,630
- That's great so it's a
combination of services as well

158
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:23,400
as grant programs that you have available

159
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,960
to work with the municipalities.

160
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,020
So that's great.

161
00:07:27,021 --> 00:07:28,700
- That's correct.

162
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,580
- undersecretary, Benincasa Thorpe

163
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:33,950
you're in the executive
office of the public safety

164
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:38,170
and security and you're the
Homeland Security director.

165
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:39,700
In your role how do you support

166
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,430
the municipals cybersecurity?

167
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,170
- Oh, well, good afternoon, everyone.

168
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:47,120
And it's fine to give a
bank's out to Stephanie Helms

169
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,470
and her incredible team
to pull all this together

170
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,130
over the last several years.

171
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:54,460
I think it's been with that effort

172
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,320
that executive office of public safety

173
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,180
and the agencies that are
under us, which is about 13

174
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:02,740
are able to come together,
work with stakeholders, public

175
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:05,930
and private to share best practices

176
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:09,300
and also understand the
gaps within our state

177
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:13,610
and what we need to do as
an agency to address those.

178
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:17,570
Cybersecurity is in
itself a fundamental part

179
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:20,450
of Homeland Security
especially for our agency.

180
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:23,050
It's very similar to
the sharing intelligence

181
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:25,960
and hardening the potential infrastructure

182
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,400
for the target's
cybersecurity takes a very

183
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,507
very important role in that with that.

184
00:08:31,507 --> 00:08:32,909
And I know that you've mentioned

185
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:36,549
and secretary Wood has been
a champion at rolling out

186
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:39,159
these cybersecurity resilience plans,

187
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:44,159
but I know as if you said
Stephanie, that it is a priority

188
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:48,120
for the Baker-Polito administration
and how they have done

189
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,660
gone out and created a system

190
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,930
of the cybersecurity
working group like you have

191
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:59,359
and then the organization and
the mass tech collaborative

192
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,060
that secretary Kennealy has all shows

193
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,359
that we are working together.

194
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,930
We're working as a group

195
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:08,130
so there's not one stop failure here.

196
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:13,130
And under EOPS we have
13 public safety agencies

197
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,460
and some that are constantly

198
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,380
within the communities
that are always talking

199
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,600
to the municipal, whether they're leaders

200
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,690
fire police, are department
of fire services,

201
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:27,060
Massachusetts emergency management agency,

202
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,250
the national guard, the fusion center

203
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,720
which is the Intel
heartbeat of Massachusetts

204
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,400
when it comes to cybersecurity
and criminal activity.

205
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,900
And we also have an
agency called the office

206
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,870
of grants and research, which
pulls all of the funding

207
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,510
coming from Homeland Security and FEMA

208
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:44,450
that I'm allowed in my agency.

209
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:45,970
They're allowed to go and apply

210
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:49,740
for where we can really take a
good look at what's out there

211
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:52,540
in the communities and what
is needed through programs.

212
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,620
So that's been a very good asset

213
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:58,730
for municipalities, both public

214
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:00,520
and private sectors is to apply

215
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,970
to some of these grants that are coming

216
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:05,640
through and then working with
our partners, our stakeholders

217
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,110
on the Homeland Security
strategy plan that's being rolled

218
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:10,930
out has been extremely
helpful to understand

219
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:12,479
what that roadmap is.

220
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,170
So we hit those programs.

221
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:16,250
We hit those municipalities
that are needing

222
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:19,260
that support and resources
through the grant funding.

223
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:24,030
So that's been very,
for us, very successful.

224
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:27,089
We also with the grant money coming in

225
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:31,270
from Homeland Security and
FEMA and some other entities

226
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:33,740
out in Washington, we've
been able to fund things

227
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:36,710
like we've hired a cybersecurity director

228
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:39,060
that goes out to the
communities that meets

229
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,849
with some of these municipalities.

230
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:43,910
We've created a cyber incident
coordination policy working

231
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:47,180
with our partners or at
EOS to help us understand

232
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,260
what is needed through our agencies.

233
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,340
Our 13 agencies what's needed

234
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:53,380
if there's a cyber event, how do we help?

235
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,230
How do we mitigate?

236
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:55,707
How do we prepare for it?

237
00:10:55,707 --> 00:10:58,210
EOS has been a champion at that with us.

238
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:00,570
We've been able to start

239
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:04,380
an Academy to start training the state

240
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:07,560
and local law enforcement
on cyber security forensics

241
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:12,000
and investigations that partner
with our federal partners

242
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,020
both FBI and secret service to
help put folks on the bench.

243
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:19,860
If there is a big cyber
event, how do we go and out

244
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:23,210
and respond and mitigate and restore?

245
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:25,430
We're hoping that this
training Academy helps

246
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:29,609
those municipal leaders
out there that can help

247
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:31,120
when we do have to restore that.

248
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,670
So that's been very,
very, very successful.

249
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:35,599
The other thing is like we talked about

250
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,260
is the grant monies again, you really

251
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:42,140
need the grants monies to
do develop these programs

252
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,699
to have the policies roll out.

253
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:47,770
And we're fortunate enough to be working

254
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:48,930
with great secretariat

255
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:51,010
that we sometimes share
the funding coming in

256
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:53,480
for cybersecurity, tabletops

257
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:57,320
and programs and full-scale exercises.

258
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,100
The grant money that comes in
is working through the office

259
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,870
of grants and research where
we will receive the funds

260
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:04,840
from Washington, DC, DHS.

261
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,860
And then we have a state share of money.

262
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,530
And I roll that state share money

263
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:11,520
over to the Homeland
Security advisory councils.

264
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,860
And as you mentioned earlier, Stephanie

265
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,990
that our state is a Commonwealth

266
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:20,990
and we have 351 independent
municipalities cities

267
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:25,130
and towns that are operating
independent of each other.

268
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:27,790
These Homeland Security
councils are regional

269
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:30,099
and they pulled together adjacent towns

270
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,180
and cities that can work together

271
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,750
share resources and grants

272
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,900
and address problems collectively.

273
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,490
We are able to send the money's

274
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:40,300
up to the Homeland Security councils.

275
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:44,459
They in turn are in embedded
into the communities.

276
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:47,730
They understand what's going
on and know how to address it

277
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:49,560
working with the municipal leaders.

278
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,180
That's one way in which we can farm out

279
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:55,020
the monies to the right
people for the right reasons.

280
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,390
And it's been successful.

281
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:59,330
They've been in play, I believe since 2003

282
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:01,250
and their collective group of people

283
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:04,630
representing all different
agencies and disciplines.

284
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:08,300
So they've been able to
really help define along

285
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,589
with your group and your
meetings of where the gaps are

286
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,520
how can we address them in what is needed?

287
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,640
So we've been able to use
that funding from that.

288
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,410
And again, we funded

289
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:22,209
the cyber security
centers statewide summit

290
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:23,760
for the municipal leaderships.

291
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,620
Again, something that's a resource

292
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,970
that those municipal
leaders will really take

293
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:30,040
in and enjoy and really learn from.

294
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,920
So unfortunately COVID has kept us apart.

295
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,689
I haven't seen too many of us in person,

296
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:41,580
but I think that I applaud
the RSA to do this conference

297
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:45,340
and have these panels together
because this is what we have

298
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:48,680
to learn, to mitigate,
to share best practices.

299
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,109
It's a great way to get out there

300
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:52,730
when we're not able to do it in person.

301
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:56,830
- Thank you, yes, the federal
funding is really helpful

302
00:13:56,830 --> 00:14:00,540
in terms of being able to
provide some opportunities

303
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,800
for us to have additional activity.

304
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,359
So that's a good match
with the state funding

305
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,263
that we've had.

306
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:11,230
For secretary Kennealy,
from your perspective

307
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:13,390
in housing and economic development.

308
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:18,300
I know that you've been a
supporter of MassCyberCenter

309
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,310
along the way, because I
get my funding through you.

310
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:23,900
So some of the things
that we've been able to do

311
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:24,900
has been very helpful

312
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,430
but how would you
describe the relationship

313
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:30,430
of cyber security in our communities

314
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:34,180
and its impact on our economic posture?

315
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,957
- Yeah, it's a great question, Stephanie

316
00:14:35,957 --> 00:14:37,710
and great to be with you all today.

317
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,100
My colleagues here and the administration

318
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,640
and Stephanie, thanks
for all the work you do

319
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,500
at the cyber center.

320
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,580
It's really been, I think, an
enormously important effort

321
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:48,210
over the years now, and really
helping to both position us

322
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:49,910
as a leader in the sector, but also help

323
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:52,002
our cities and towns stay safe.

324
00:14:52,876 --> 00:14:56,290
And so in that question,
it's absolutely critical,

325
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:58,689
in our office here we
were very much partners

326
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:01,540
whether individual 351 cities and towns

327
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,920
helping them to realize
their development objectives.

328
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,719
We work in close coordination

329
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,220
with all of our municipal
leaders on a variety of things.

330
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:11,360
And so it's absolutely
essential that they are safe

331
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,940
from a cyber security standpoint

332
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,730
that the communities are protected.

333
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:15,890
You think about how much more

334
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:18,350
we're all doing online these days

335
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:21,330
telework, tele-health other
other technology offerings,

336
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:23,260
it's becomes even more important now

337
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:28,170
in this post COVID-19 economy
that those networks are safe.

338
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:30,319
We can do more things safely online

339
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,910
and obviously the threats are rising.

340
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,920
So we gotta be more
sophisticated in our view

341
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,449
of what cyber safety
means and work in close

342
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:39,382
partnership with our
cities and towns to help

343
00:15:39,382 --> 00:15:40,750
them out in that regard.

344
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,100
It's also cybersecurity is really critical

345
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,410
for our our innovation economy.

346
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:48,430
Generally we are one of the
top States renovation model

347
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:50,819
top placed for innovation
anywhere in the world.

348
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:55,030
We are in my account where the world's

349
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:57,360
leading life sciences
ecosystem or a global

350
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,760
leader in software and
advanced manufacturing

351
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,670
and digital health and
lots of exciting areas.

352
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:05,740
And we're leader in cybersecurity as well.

353
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:10,270
And so not only is this a
strategy we have to make sure

354
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:13,430
we employ across our municipalities
to help them stay safe.

355
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:17,270
We also think about this
as an important part

356
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:18,819
of our innovation economy as a sector

357
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:21,400
we wanna grow and maintain
the leadership position.

358
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,380
And it's also critical
to our economic recovery.

359
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,840
I'll give you an example.

360
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,330
We rolled out a comprehensive
economic recovery

361
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:32,060
strategy last October called
partnerships to recovery.

362
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:34,250
And that the thought is
to have a kind of focus

363
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,200
on five main areas.

364
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,860
And one of those simply is
getting people back to work.

365
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:41,330
We had unemployment pre COVID-19,

366
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:44,450
that was less than 3%, that number get up

367
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:46,560
to well over 17% over the summer.

368
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,839
It's happily back down
in single digits today

369
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,760
but still there's a lot of
folks that are unemployed.

370
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,920
And we got to get back to work.

371
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,209
Well we're deploying various
tools now to help them do that.

372
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:59,500
And so through our Mass
Broadband Institute, for example

373
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,630
working in close
collaboration with our labor

374
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:05,770
and workforce development
colleagues, we launched something

375
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:07,490
called Mass internet connect.

376
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:09,210
And it's a program that offers internet

377
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:12,000
and device subsidies, as well as a variety

378
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,650
of digital literacy
supports to job seekers

379
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:17,540
to help them stay connected
to online resources

380
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,379
and job search tools
and training programs,

381
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,859
what we need robust cyber
security to make sure

382
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:23,760
they have access to those tools.

383
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,940
And it's gonna be very
important to help help people

384
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,230
get back to work.

385
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:31,050
Now, in terms of our efforts
in workforce, generally

386
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,970
around cyber, we're very focused on trying

387
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:33,970
to grow our workforce here

388
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:36,900
in the Commonwealth in cybersecurity

389
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,020
and make that workforce even more diverse.

390
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:41,139
And so we've been so
proud to support the mass

391
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:43,070
cyber centers offerings in that regard

392
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:45,820
the cybersecurity training,
education, working groups

393
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,520
the cybersecurity mentorship program

394
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,810
this is an exciting
place to build a career.

395
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:53,310
And if we get more people
ready for those careers

396
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:56,600
and make sure the talent pipeline
is as diverse as possible

397
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:00,050
such that those careers are
open to really everybody

398
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:02,169
in the Commonwealth that
wants to embark on that.

399
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:03,480
I think that's gonna serve as well,

400
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:07,060
both in terms of a cyber
safety standpoint, if you will,

401
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,980
but also in terms of
growing this exciting part

402
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:09,990
of the innovation economy.

403
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:12,410
- That really is an important component.

404
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:15,660
I know that we often are
invited to participate

405
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:18,060
with healthcare organizations

406
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:21,700
and financial technology organizations

407
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,630
to help think about how cybersecurity

408
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:26,630
can be better integrated
to some of the efforts

409
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:27,930
that they're making.

410
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:30,070
And that's just gonna
continue as part of that.

411
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:32,629
And the citizens of Massachusetts

412
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:33,900
the more that they are aware

413
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,760
of cybersecurity are
they're able to make it

414
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,940
that they can operate the
economy online safely.

415
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:43,300
So that's an important component.

416
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:47,290
So I'm gonna ask the general
question to all of you

417
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:49,822
and I'll start with
secretary Wood on this one.

418
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:55,210
There are so many activities
that we have ongoing

419
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:56,790
in the state.

420
00:18:56,790 --> 00:19:00,520
What's some of the ways
secretary would that you're able

421
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:04,030
to synchronize efforts that you wanna do

422
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:06,053
from your executive office?

423
00:19:07,292 --> 00:19:09,206
- Well, and that's a great question.

424
00:19:09,207 --> 00:19:12,380
And I think what I would
say in Massachusetts

425
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,570
we're a relatively small state

426
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,429
from a geographic perspective,

427
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:18,070
population is significant.

428
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:22,230
However, we have a long standing community

429
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:23,517
of interest here in cybersecurity.

430
00:19:23,517 --> 00:19:25,060
And I think in technology overall

431
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:27,060
secretary Kennealy has mentioned,

432
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:29,440
and on a secretary Benincasa
thought this talked

433
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,980
about this relationships and the regional,

434
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:34,260
I think where our office
comes in is really

435
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,870
we've been an executive
branch agency, of course.

436
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:39,280
And our organization is
starting to focus more

437
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:43,200
and more about collaboration
and information sharing.

438
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,020
And I think communications is
really the essential component

439
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,013
of what we're really talking about here.

440
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:51,740
And I would say from a
cybersecurity perspective

441
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,750
it's no longer about the IT aspect of it.

442
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,990
I think when I first
took this organization

443
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:59,900
over several years ago,
and even my experience

444
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,568
in the past IT security, was security

445
00:20:02,568 --> 00:20:05,480
all had been focused more
on the IT aspect of things.

446
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,620
And I think we've really matured

447
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:07,590
over the past several years

448
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:10,030
especially to think about
security in a different way.

449
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:12,379
We need to think about security
from a business perspective.

450
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,830
We need to think about
education awareness.

451
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:17,870
It really is a core competency
of an executive today.

452
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:21,379
I look at an agency head
within state government

453
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,550
or a business.

454
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:24,120
those folks today need to be able

455
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,409
to make sure they understand the finances.

456
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:30,250
They need to understand
certainly social awareness

457
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:33,670
in data and in cybersecurity or security

458
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:35,300
we cannot conduct government business.

459
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:38,600
We cannot conduct business
as a whole without

460
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,610
understanding that security aspect.

461
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:42,840
And the more we go down this road,

462
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,080
the more and more we learn, the more

463
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,070
and more we challenge ourselves.

464
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:49,409
And I think our organization
to start to really think about

465
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:51,580
more about collaborating and more about

466
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:54,420
focusing on the business side of things

467
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,000
the technology is the
technology security framework

468
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,100
that we have in place in
the the technology services

469
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,590
that we have is certainly a critical,

470
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:05,169
but it's really about people
processing things as well.

471
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:07,090
And we're also blessed in Massachusetts

472
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:09,010
that we're really in a hub

473
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:12,920
of a really bright people,
technology innovation.

474
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,600
And I think within our administration

475
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,129
we have a committed governor

476
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:19,830
when governor Baker came in in 2015

477
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:22,870
he really turned the IT and
the cybersecurity on its head.

478
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:23,959
I think he's the first governor

479
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,870
and I've served through nine
governors, just so you know.

480
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:27,419
So I've been around a few years

481
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:30,590
and this is the first administration
that actually invested

482
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:33,709
in this, not from a technology
perspective and from a focus

483
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:36,630
on security and more
important about collaboration.

484
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:39,910
I think we have a great
commitment to our municipalities.

485
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:43,430
We don't get caught up in
the us versus them mentality.

486
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:46,560
our entire administration all
of our nine cabinet members

487
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,830
our secretaries are all on the ground

488
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:50,147
all meeting routinely with our folks

489
00:21:50,147 --> 00:21:52,500
and our partners at the municipal level

490
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,070
our state agencies talk with each other.

491
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:55,870
If we have an issue, we work it out.

492
00:21:56,782 --> 00:21:58,255
We're all in this for the common good.

493
00:21:58,256 --> 00:22:00,640
So I think our organization
is super focused

494
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,060
on that to make sure that

495
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:05,149
we have the right understanding
of what's going on.

496
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:06,550
We have a right path forward

497
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:08,980
and we start to build out

498
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,230
and continue to build out

499
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:14,189
this social fabric of
security and awareness.

500
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:16,710
And certainly from a technology roadmap

501
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,240
I think over the past year

502
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,530
from a COVID perspective,
we've also learned

503
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:23,440
to prioritize certain things

504
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,890
understanding technology and the mobility.

505
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:27,250
Our administration has focused

506
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:30,380
on digital to make sure that
the services that we provide

507
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,220
our citizens, our residents, our visitors

508
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,690
and our businesses, the Commonwealth

509
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:35,080
we wanna make sure that our systems

510
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,669
and services are made available

511
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:39,570
to people in the way
they conduct their lives

512
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:42,200
and their personal business and
their professional business.

513
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,560
And with that shortly challenges us

514
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,679
from a security perspective.

515
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:48,421
So we want to make sure
that we focus on that.

516
00:22:48,421 --> 00:22:49,749
We want to make sure that we understand

517
00:22:49,749 --> 00:22:53,530
that we provide the most secure
infrastructure and services

518
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:56,760
and awareness to all of our landscapes.

519
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,120
So again, meetings like
this are very critical.

520
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,469
I think we talk quite a bit

521
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:03,710
about things with each
other at the cabinet level

522
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:06,490
and our AGS collaborate.

523
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:07,720
Jeanne mentioned the regional

524
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,930
with our Homeland Security
advisory councils and working

525
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:13,000
with the functional, I think
overall in Massachusetts

526
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,240
we're a very small
state and a lot of ways.

527
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,010
And I think we have that
ability to kind of talk

528
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:20,690
to the folks and we have
good business relationships.

529
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:23,253
And more importantly, we
have personal relationships

530
00:23:23,253 --> 00:23:24,820
with all of our folks
at the municipal level.

531
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,470
I think there's a level of trust.

532
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:28,640
Certainly not everybody gets
along with each other every day

533
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,473
of the week.

534
00:23:29,473 --> 00:23:31,129
We all get that people
have different priorities.

535
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:34,240
We all understand that, but
I think I can say proudly

536
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,260
in a Massachusetts, that
we have a really good,

537
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:40,230
strong working relationship
with our legislature,

538
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:42,690
with our municipal government
and with our state government.

539
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:45,420
And overall I think it shows Massachusett

540
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:47,590
is a leader in many areas

541
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:49,260
and I'm very proud to be part of that.

542
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:52,043
So we look forward to
this continue success.

543
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:55,879
- Thank you and secretary Kennealy,

544
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,860
you talked about many verticals

545
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:02,379
and many initiatives
the economic recovery.

546
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:04,110
How does that get synchronized

547
00:24:05,004 --> 00:24:06,850
with a lot of the efforts that we're doing

548
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:10,879
in the cybersecurity continuum?

549
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,850
- I think Curtis said it
well we're very, excuse me

550
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:14,280
very collaborative place.

551
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,877
And the fact that we
have this working group

552
00:24:16,877 --> 00:24:20,060
I think it's 40 participating agencies

553
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:22,679
municipalities folks in
the business community.

554
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,700
That that's really how we get things

555
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,790
done here in Massachusetts.

556
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:28,629
We collaborate state and
local government, academia,

557
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:30,550
private industry coming together

558
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:32,899
to identify important challenges

559
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,640
and opportunities and
working on those together.

560
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,030
So it's really, it's very much

561
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:37,930
in our DNA in terms of how we operate.

562
00:24:38,806 --> 00:24:40,920
And Curtis was exactly
right in terms of our view

563
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,200
of our partnership with municipalities,

564
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,740
where pre COVID, we
traveled all the time out

565
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:49,020
always in our cities and
towns starting to get back

566
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,485
to doing some of that now, and I miss it,

567
00:24:51,485 --> 00:24:54,129
but there's no substitute for
being there on the ground.

568
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:56,500
Meeting with municipal leaders,
understanding the challenges

569
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,870
and opportunities they
face and having that spirit

570
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:01,889
of collaboration and really
does start at the top.

571
00:25:01,889 --> 00:25:03,399
I mean like governor Baker, both in terms

572
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:07,770
of identifying a cyber as
a strategic area of focus

573
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:09,010
but also setting the tone

574
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:11,710
around partnership and collaboration.

575
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:14,900
There's no question that
that's where it comes from.

576
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,450
Think about the things, the resources

577
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:19,110
we've compiled to help our municipalities

578
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:20,669
and citizens for that matter.

579
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:23,010
This municipal toolkit we have

580
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:25,650
it helps me to civil leaders understand

581
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:27,870
their individual cyber
security posture and figure

582
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:29,989
out next steps to protect
their infrastructure.

583
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:32,570
It's a really, I think
very valuable toolkit.

584
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:34,210
In 2020, we held a series

585
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:38,570
of incident response planning
workshops for municipalities

586
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:40,939
helping them to build
their response plans.

587
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:43,100
We have a public service
awareness campaign

588
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,699
called life's work at home

589
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,820
provide citizens with
the tools to collaborate

590
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,090
to secure their information

591
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:51,040
and cyber security recommendations.

592
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,159
So there's a lot going on

593
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,770
but trying to get all these
diverse stakeholders together

594
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:56,260
and talk about the issues.

595
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:58,347
I think that's where it begins.

596
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:01,280
- That's a good point.

597
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:04,690
And undersecretary Benincasa
Thorpe and public safety

598
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:06,270
you mentioned all the different agencies

599
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:08,490
that you have between the fusion center

600
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:10,000
and the national guard.

601
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,520
And me and my who have been all very busy

602
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,629
during COVID how are you able

603
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:17,923
to synchronize all the
efforts for cybersecurity?

604
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:21,970
- Great question and
my two colleagues here

605
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:24,683
are absolutely correct with collaboration.

606
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:27,480
I really make it a best practice

607
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:30,420
to contact secretarial Woods at all levels

608
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,890
when it comes to cyber security,

609
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:35,150
whether it's even interviewing
the cyber security director

610
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:37,550
down to the coordination policy we put out

611
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:39,870
just ensure that we're
in sync with each other

612
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:42,800
that we are coordinating
efforts moving out

613
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,450
and responding to the
needs of the communities,

614
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:49,160
municipalities and
stakeholders, state entities.

615
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,600
The other thing that I being

616
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:54,740
under the public safety network,
we were always in the code.

617
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:57,360
We were always in the
communities for COVID

618
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:02,360
whether we was delivering PPE,
tents, vaccines, or testing

619
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,937
we were always in touch with them

620
00:27:03,937 --> 00:27:06,250
and what was needed when it was needed

621
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,950
and how it was needed.

622
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:11,540
So for our communications,
it's never ended.

623
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:13,990
In fact, it's intensified over COVID

624
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:16,520
because of the needs of the communities.

625
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,620
We've put together a COVID task force

626
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:23,514
that the governor ran and not
only were they asking for help

627
00:27:23,515 --> 00:27:26,470
for the testing for the municipalities

628
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:29,930
or the vaccines they were
asking for cybersecurity help

629
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:32,350
their school systems could be hit there.

630
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:34,959
Their healthcare centers were compromised.

631
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,083
This was an ongoing conversation
because we are, as I said

632
00:27:38,083 --> 00:27:39,870
embedded with the community.

633
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:42,739
So it isn't that we have the 13 agencies

634
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:45,640
and we're sort of isolated in a box.

635
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,600
Executives public safety,

636
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,209
they are boots on the ground

637
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:53,140
first responders in all
aspects, whether it's a disaster

638
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:55,979
the COVID pandemic or
it's a cybersecurity event

639
00:27:55,979 --> 00:27:59,210
we have to be in touch with
our communities at all times

640
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:02,430
because when it's a compromised,
it affects a community.

641
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:05,210
So we've been able to work
with the fusion center

642
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:08,910
that puts out disseminate
information, daily practices

643
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:11,460
resources to all of the law enforcements.

644
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:16,170
We worked with the secretary
of state on the elections

645
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:17,810
when it came to cybersecurity

646
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:21,330
we had DFS talking to folks
about what their needs were.

647
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:24,530
There were many opportunities,
and we will continue speaking

648
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:27,710
about cybersecurity because it is going

649
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:29,950
to impact our communities, our citizens,

650
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:31,270
and our stakeholders.

651
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:35,180
I've also been able to step
aside from the municipalities

652
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:38,600
but also reach the large venues

653
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,909
like the large venue task force.

654
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:42,150
The governor put together a few years ago

655
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:43,610
what we had to use

656
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:47,973
and talk and meet together
was about cybersecurity.

657
00:28:47,973 --> 00:28:50,770
Cybersecurity is a potential threat

658
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:55,770
for all of our large venues
who house our citizens

659
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,659
who will go to all these events.

660
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:00,300
And if there's a breach or a vulnerability

661
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:03,510
or a cyber attack, it's going
to hit those large venues.

662
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:05,200
We need to know what's going on.

663
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,330
We need them to understand

664
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:09,439
that they have to hit certain levels

665
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:14,030
of their cyber posture
in order for to ensure

666
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:17,530
that our citizens are safe,
going to their large venues.

667
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:21,180
And with the pause of
COVID that a year ago

668
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:23,820
was a very high priority
for us is to ensure

669
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,500
that that isn't a single target.

670
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,470
And if it is, what are we doing about it?

671
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:29,380
What assessments are we working on?

672
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:32,890
And again, bringing them
together with your working group

673
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:35,200
having these tabletops and cybersecurity

674
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,150
large full-scale exercises brings

675
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:40,550
the whole component together to practice

676
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:42,770
going through a cyber event

677
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:46,629
which we'll touch upon someone
somewhere at one point.

678
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:49,340
So for us, public safety
needs to stay ahead of it.

679
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:53,350
That is where we need to
be, not behind a disaster

680
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:55,000
or a response, but ahead of it.

681
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,960
So as much as we can do
is sending out information

682
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:01,560
through our 13 agencies,
through ER agencies

683
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:04,450
and his stakeholders,
through our large venues

684
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:07,750
and private sectors, we're
constantly communications

685
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:09,084
and that's where we need to be.

686
00:30:09,084 --> 00:30:10,140
And that's where we will be

687
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:12,263
because cybersecurity is a big threat.

688
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:17,743
- Yeah, it is a very top of mind issue.

689
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:22,420
For that reason, we did
make the application

690
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:26,210
and were selected for the
national governor's association

691
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:28,290
policy workshop in 2019.

692
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:32,240
I'm gonna start with secretary
Wood, if you think back

693
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,940
to the preparation that
we did for that workshop

694
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:41,830
and then the event itself where
we kind of did a deep dive

695
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:44,470
on the cybersecurity
issues for municipalities

696
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:48,920
for the other States that
are potentially thinking

697
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,970
about doing an NGA workshop

698
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:54,720
what would you say is some feedback

699
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,960
from that whole process
that we went through?

700
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:03,433
- That's a great question and
I'll try to keep it simple.

701
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:09,159
Any time that you have an
opportunity to sit down in a room

702
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,780
with folks from different sectors

703
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:14,230
and different perspectives,
I think is important.

704
00:31:16,417 --> 00:31:19,590
Like I said, I've been a
career government employee

705
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:22,669
45 years all at state government level.

706
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:25,080
And I've had the distinct honor of working

707
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,240
partnering with federal
government agencies

708
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,870
and state agencies on the States

709
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:31,949
and municipals and County government.

710
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:33,840
And I think what we need to remember

711
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,320
is that we really are all in this together

712
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,800
and at the state level, what I can say

713
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,550
is that we've been
fortunate over the past four

714
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:43,690
or five years six, seven years

715
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:46,630
that we've had an
administration that has focused

716
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:49,840
on this that they recognize the threat

717
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,879
they've made the significant investments

718
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:54,330
that I think, unfortunately

719
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:57,020
I don't think that's the case
yet at the municipal level.

720
00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:00,350
So I think what I would strongly focus

721
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:02,149
on is making sure that
there's an awareness

722
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:04,650
making sure that the state

723
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:07,990
and our municipal partners
continue to work together.

724
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:10,280
As a state, we should as an administration

725
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:15,280
in any state, I think we should
leverage state government

726
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,650
to help we're needed where wanted

727
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:20,720
'cause it's not always that way.

728
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,130
So we need to be respectful of that.

729
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:24,140
We need to be respectful

730
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:26,330
of and municipality
there's a big difference

731
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:29,970
between a tiny municipality
in a large metropolitan area,

732
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:32,720
no from a financial perspective,
a skillset perspective

733
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,709
talent level of threat

734
00:32:35,709 --> 00:32:37,920
but at the end of the day,
we're all in this together.

735
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:41,510
So I think my biggest recommendation

736
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:43,682
is to do something about it.

737
00:32:43,682 --> 00:32:45,470
You don't need to wait
for an NGA policy Academy.

738
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:47,510
You don't need to wait for a grant.

739
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:49,070
I think there are other ways to do this.

740
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:51,547
And I do think that
the more communications

741
00:32:51,547 --> 00:32:55,440
and the more handout shake hand

742
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,260
kind of in-person meeting, listen

743
00:32:57,260 --> 00:33:00,690
pick up a phone understand
what this is all about

744
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:03,630
and be there and be willing
to help, be willing to listen,

745
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:05,311
be willing to kinda part

746
00:33:05,311 --> 00:33:07,970
with some wisdom part with some funding

747
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:10,300
to get us to a better place.

748
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:13,710
So I think that would be
my biggest recommendation.

749
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:16,320
I think we've been together
now for a year and a half.

750
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,350
So a couple of years now kind
of working on this, right

751
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:20,510
I think we've built some
really great relationships.

752
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:22,160
we've advanced some relationships

753
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:25,840
I think we've benefited each other

754
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,159
from a strategy perspective

755
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,989
and from a discussion perspective.

756
00:33:28,989 --> 00:33:32,130
And I think those are
those are meaningful areas

757
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:34,700
that I think are long
lasting and long standing.

758
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,700
So I think it's the commitment.

759
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,500
It's the understanding.

760
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,780
It's not an afterthought here.

761
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:43,100
We really should focus and
I think one final thought

762
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:45,629
I would say in my
perspective, there is that

763
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:47,810
we need to make sure that
our political leadership

764
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:49,879
at the local level understands this too.

765
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:52,490
It's just not the IT guy or IT gal

766
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:54,590
at the local municipality that should bear

767
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:56,290
all this responsibility to make sure

768
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:58,300
that their cybersecurity systems

769
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:00,020
or their systems are secure.

770
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:01,660
It's really about ownership.

771
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:04,560
And we need to teach and
educate our local leadership

772
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,567
whether it be the town manager

773
00:34:06,567 --> 00:34:10,570
or the town selectmen or all
the men or whomever, it may be

774
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:12,659
that it's everybody's responsibility

775
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:14,940
at a municipal and a state level.

776
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:17,800
And I urge people to
consider that when they go

777
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,503
into talk this make it about education,

778
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:23,146
make it about something that's critical

779
00:34:23,146 --> 00:34:24,739
and try to bring it home

780
00:34:24,739 --> 00:34:28,279
to what the impact is to them
when we don't pay attention

781
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,650
to these most important things.

782
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:30,550
That's what I would recommend.

783
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:32,063
I think that's what we're able to do.

784
00:34:32,063 --> 00:34:33,909
Well the past year or
so, or year and a half

785
00:34:33,909 --> 00:34:37,163
two years with this great
effort by the group.

786
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:42,300
- Yeah, I thought the NGA
workshop was kind of helpful

787
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:45,420
in that having somebody
who was on our side

788
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:48,280
but it was outside asking tough questions

789
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,199
about how do you do these things was kind

790
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:55,199
of helpful to get us kind
of focused on the issue.

791
00:34:56,382 --> 00:34:57,510
- Sometimes we miss the obvious,

792
00:34:57,510 --> 00:35:00,712
I think we just kind of, we're
so deep in the weeds at times

793
00:35:00,712 --> 00:35:02,730
it's nice to have a facilitator
that can help you out there.

794
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:04,160
I agree with you.

795
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,830
- The last question I
am gonna pose to you all

796
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:09,330
because we're closing in, on
the, at the end of our time

797
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:13,360
and I'll start with
undersecretary Benincasa Thorpe.

798
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:16,240
We talked a lot about the importance

799
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,790
and the value of communication.

800
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:21,820
If you could just briefly say

801
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:26,060
in terms of communicating from
a public safety perspective

802
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:28,759
about cybersecurity to municipalities,

803
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:31,050
what do you think is
the most important tool

804
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:32,780
that you have available to you now

805
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:36,670
that you're using to engage municipalities

806
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:39,100
on the of cybersecurity?

807
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,720
- I think that it's a combination.

808
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,339
I actually I don't after
going through COVID

809
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:46,910
I don't rely on just one
tool for communications,

810
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:50,399
because again there's always
that point of failure.

811
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,260
I think COVID has really brought

812
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:55,940
out the whole opportunity
to do the Zoom calls

813
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:59,300
or are these panels right
now where you don't actually

814
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,730
need to leave and you can attend as many

815
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:03,830
as you are able to, right.

816
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:05,430
And I feel that at this point

817
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:07,589
there are no excuses not to get involved

818
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:08,870
not to hear what's going on

819
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:13,150
not to stay active because
you have this opportunity now.

820
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:15,020
I think that that's a really big thing.

821
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:17,570
I think constantly pushing out information

822
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:20,680
through MEMA, Massachusetts
Emergency Management Agency

823
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,906
whether it's a dashboard on
what's going on in the state

824
00:36:22,907 --> 00:36:24,880
and the situational awareness,

825
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,010
we are now gonna start
putting cyber events

826
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:28,140
in there as well.

827
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:33,140
The fusion center, creating
distributions of resources

828
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,960
and information and cyber
events that have happened out

829
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,531
throughout the country
and with our own state

830
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:43,750
and giving the reader of this information

831
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:47,480
whether it's law enforcement,
municipalities, fire police

832
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:50,620
it gives them a sense
that, yes, this is real.

833
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:52,609
These events are
happening in other States.

834
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:53,890
This is what they're doing about it.

835
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:57,230
So the newsletter, the
information dissemination

836
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:59,600
that's going out through fusion center,

837
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,069
again that is the heartbeat of our state.

838
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:04,660
It receives all of the criminal activities

839
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:07,089
and it pushes out what
we're doing about it.

840
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:09,700
We have now capitalized on that feature

841
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:13,600
of their sort of brains
into the community.

842
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,420
Their reach into the
communities is far better

843
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:18,050
than any of our agencies that work

844
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:20,140
with us because they have
been doing this for years.

845
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:22,220
It is their job to inform

846
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:24,750
and it's their job to
retrieve information.

847
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:28,080
So between the brick,
which is the Boston area

848
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:31,170
for the fusion and our
statewide fusion center

849
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:33,000
they're capturing information

850
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,380
throughout the country
that they can disseminate

851
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:37,770
through our own communities
on what's happening.

852
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:39,420
So communication's a big thing.

853
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:41,960
And I have to kind of
give a shout out to NGA.

854
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:45,820
I think the NGA has been a
source of my communications

855
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:48,180
where I've reached out
to them multiple times

856
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:50,740
to find out best practices, benchmarks,

857
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:52,649
other state activities what's happening,

858
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:54,620
what are they hearing and what can we do?

859
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:56,620
They have been resilient with that.

860
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:59,089
They've been giving us
as much as they can.

861
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:02,080
They have partnered me
up with other state HHS.

862
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,620
They have given us that workshop

863
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:06,390
that I thought was a great
launching pad for Massachusetts

864
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:09,470
in order to start our
cybersecurity resiliency plan.

865
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:11,850
It provided us some gaps where our plans

866
00:38:13,108 --> 00:38:14,200
were not working.

867
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,779
It was really a great opportunity.

868
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:18,560
Again, it's those opportunities

869
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,930
like our resources, our stakeholders

870
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:24,230
that are federal our
stakeholders that are local

871
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:26,880
and then using the existing resources

872
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,860
we have within the state
that already embedded

873
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:32,340
to the communities like
your fusion centers

874
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:34,590
your emergency management agencies

875
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:38,020
your national guards that are
constantly with the community.

876
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:39,870
So it's reaching out to them.

877
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:42,490
They're reaching out it's
constant communications.

878
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:45,509
Like when you don't hear
something you need to call in

879
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:48,283
because there is enough
information to be out there.

880
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:50,920
Secretary Kennealy

881
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,450
I'm gonna give you the last word,

882
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:54,480
I think because we're
just about out of time,

883
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,840
but the important role

884
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:59,680
of how do you communicate with
municipalities at this time?

885
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,120
- Well, it's a good question, Stephanie.

886
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,819
And first of all, I just
want to highlight the fact

887
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:05,470
that the fact that we
have a MassCyberCenter

888
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:06,529
I think is really important

889
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:08,480
to highlights our
commitment to the sector.

890
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,140
And the fact that we
have the cyber resilient

891
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:12,279
Massachusetts working
group is also important.

892
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,260
When you put these groups together

893
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:17,680
I think it's a statement of
importance and collaboration.

894
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,879
We work closely with our cities

895
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,120
and towns on so many matters.

896
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,069
I imagined that the cyber
center will continue

897
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:25,580
to have webinars and
workshops looking forward

898
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:29,290
to many more in-person
meetings to at some point soon.

899
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:31,700
And, but we'll keep up the communication.

900
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:33,069
secretary Wood brought up a great point.

901
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:35,730
We have 351 cities and towns.

902
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:38,320
So you said a few times, and
they're all very different.

903
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,240
And I think people outside the state

904
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,299
when they think Massachusetts

905
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:43,490
they might first think of
Boston or greater Boston.

906
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:46,359
We have many, many cities and towns

907
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:50,170
small towns, rural towns smaller cities.

908
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:51,370
We get a great diversity

909
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:53,520
of communities sustain
in close touch with them.

910
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,810
And understanding of their unique needs

911
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:56,860
is really important for us.

912
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:58,710
And it's so many aspects of our work.
