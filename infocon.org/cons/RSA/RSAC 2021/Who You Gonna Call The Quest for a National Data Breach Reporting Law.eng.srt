1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:02,920
- So Congress has tried on and off

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:06,500
for years now to enact some
kind of a national data breach

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,730
reporting standard and
have not had much luck

4
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:11,400
in getting that across the finish line.

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,160
That momentum seems to have shifted a bit

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,110
in the past few months,

7
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:17,460
given the massive SolarWinds breach,

8
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,640
the range of companies that affected

9
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,570
and federal government
agencies that affected,

10
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:24,630
and it seems to have really re-energized

11
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:28,700
this effort to reach
some kind of legislation

12
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,730
that can get passed in Congress.

13
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:33,410
Even in February at a Senate hearing

14
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:34,569
on the SolarWinds breach,

15
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:38,187
you had Microsoft president
Brad Smith saying and I quote,

16
00:00:38,187 --> 00:00:40,067
"It is time not only to talk about

17
00:00:40,067 --> 00:00:43,417
"but to find a way to impose
in an appropriate manner

18
00:00:43,417 --> 00:00:45,487
"some kind of notification obligation

19
00:00:45,487 --> 00:00:47,390
"on entities in the private sector."

20
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:48,827
He went on to say,

21
00:00:48,827 --> 00:00:52,177
"It's not a typical step
when somebody comes and says,

22
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:55,117
"place a new law on me,
put it on ourselves,

23
00:00:55,117 --> 00:00:57,099
"put it on our customers."

24
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:57,933
But he said,

25
00:00:57,933 --> 00:00:58,957
"But I think it's the only way

26
00:00:58,957 --> 00:01:01,160
"we're gonna protect the
country and the world."

27
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,080
And as he pointed out,

28
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,179
you don't usually have a
company coming and saying,

29
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:07,330
yes, give me more government requirements

30
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:09,890
that I'm obligated to follow.

31
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:14,890
But some of the things that maybe limited

32
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:18,000
the ability for this legislation
to get passed in the past

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,960
may have shifted a bit.

34
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,240
And the concerns that companies had

35
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,470
about reporting something that would then

36
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:29,150
trigger an investor lawsuit
or trigger bad publicity,

37
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:31,510
that calculus may be
shifting a little bit.

38
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:34,460
And so we're gonna spend
the next 45 minutes

39
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:37,050
talking a little bit more
about how we got here

40
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:39,880
and what you all see as the path forward.

41
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,820
We're joined today by three panelists

42
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,119
at the very center of this conversation

43
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,050
from the Justice Department, Adam Hickey,

44
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:48,670
who's the deputy
assistant attorney general

45
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:49,720
for national security.

46
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,230
From the FBI, we have Tonya Ugoretz

47
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:54,740
who runs the FBI's Cyber Division,

48
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,179
and from the private
sector, Luke Dembosky,

49
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,280
a partner at Debevoise & Plimpton

50
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,480
who counsels companies
dealing with breaches

51
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,120
and is also a former Justice Department

52
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,920
senior Justice Department
official who oversaw

53
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,810
the government's national
security cyber prosecutions.

54
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:12,653
So great to be with you today.

55
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,210
So maybe to start,

56
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:18,920
let's sort of set the scene a little bit.

57
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,119
Luke, maybe can you walk us through

58
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,790
what the reporting landscape
looks like right now?

59
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:27,530
When a company does
experience a hack of some sort

60
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:30,280
and the theft of personal
consumer information,

61
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,590
who do they have to report to?

62
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,140
What kind of information
do they have to share?

63
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:36,450
What is the calculation
that they go through?

64
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:37,593
What's the analysis?

65
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,700
- Absolutely, Aruna, and
thank you for moderating

66
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,393
and thanks to RSA for the
chance to be on the panel.

67
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,690
It is quite a patchwork that we have

68
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:49,790
of breach notification laws.

69
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:53,880
I'm glad that you specified
consumer or personal data

70
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,870
because that's the major
part of the equation,

71
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,293
but it's only part of it.

72
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:00,760
In the United States,

73
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:05,760
we have a 50 state and four territorial

74
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,470
separate breach notification laws.

75
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:11,160
And so each one of these

76
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:15,770
sets ground rules on when
a party doing business

77
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:19,420
in the state has to make
a report to individuals

78
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:22,700
and perhaps a second
report to state authorities

79
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:27,359
based on a suspected act,
unauthorized access to

80
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,490
or acquisition of personal
data of an individual.

81
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:36,250
And so it's very challenging
for companies that do business

82
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,980
across state lines often
to figure out what are

83
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:44,609
all the various potential
breach notification obligations.

84
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:48,750
It's very intensive on legal analysis.

85
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:52,923
It involves identifying what
states people are residing in,

86
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:56,230
whether they have a second
residence somewhere else

87
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:58,670
that should be taken into consideration.

88
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:02,773
And all of that is only just
within the United States alone.

89
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:08,390
Europe stepped into the
fray in very big way

90
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:13,390
by passing the General Data
Protection Regulation, GDPR,

91
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:16,529
that went into effect in May of 2018.

92
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:19,989
And the one positive thing about it

93
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:21,450
or one of the positive things

94
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:25,650
is that it does set a uniform
breach notification standard

95
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:29,289
as to personal data across
the EU member states.

96
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:32,780
And now with a UK post-Brexit,

97
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:36,030
they followed the same regime as GDPR,

98
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:37,989
at least for the time being.

99
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:41,460
And so really just two
jurisdictions in the United States

100
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,760
in Europe can lead to a lot of complexity

101
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,573
in the notification decision process.

102
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:51,300
- Adam, what does that look
like from your perspective,

103
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,290
from the federal government perspective,

104
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:54,690
given this patchwork,

105
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:56,840
do you just not hear about...

106
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:00,489
Are there breaches you hear
about way after the fact

107
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:03,060
that you wish you had
learned about sooner?

108
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,630
- I think that's right.

109
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:07,110
I think these laws come from a good place,

110
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:11,390
which is a desire to protect
certain consumer rights,

111
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:14,719
an impulse that if data relating to you,

112
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,540
particularly sensitive data is lost,

113
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,840
that you are to know about it

114
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,460
perhaps so you can
protect yourself better,

115
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:24,870
perhaps in that an enforcement
action can be brought

116
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:29,220
because somehow that loss
is a result of negligence.

117
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,140
But over the last few years,

118
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,669
from the federal government perspective,

119
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:35,650
we've seen a number of circumstances

120
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:40,210
where critical infrastructure
has been impacted by a breach

121
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:44,849
or the impact of the breach is so sweeping

122
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:47,020
that it's impacting multiple sectors,

123
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,490
potentially thousands of victims.

124
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:53,590
And we are challenged in getting
a handle on the visibility

125
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:55,080
of what's happening,

126
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:59,159
how widespread is a
particular form of ransomware?

127
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,860
How many companies or
entities have been impacted

128
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:05,320
by the exploitation of a
particular vulnerability

129
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,710
and a very commonly used product?

130
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:12,090
And so, in addition to the
challenges that Luke's raised,

131
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:13,869
which I think are very real ones

132
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:16,210
from the standpoint of the private sector,

133
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:19,640
which is complying with a
patchwork of obligations,

134
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,940
there's a second reason
to think about this issue,

135
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:26,550
which is is there another value
we should be concerned with

136
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:30,010
or other equities like
protecting national security

137
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:33,890
that could be served by
a national data breach

138
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:35,930
reporting requirement of some sort?

139
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,250
And obviously, this administration

140
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,360
hasn't yet taken a position,

141
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,860
at least at the time of taping

142
00:06:42,179 --> 00:06:45,179
on whether and how that
should look, but certainly,

143
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,610
the federal government
has periodically advocated

144
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:50,340
for that kind of reform in the past,

145
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:53,070
and so that's why I think this
conversation is relevant now,

146
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,393
increasingly relevant now.

147
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:56,163
- Sure.

148
00:06:56,163 --> 00:06:57,111
And you bring up

149
00:06:57,111 --> 00:06:59,820
the increasing national
security reasons for this.

150
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:04,270
I think the SolarWinds
breach did underscore

151
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:07,370
that incentive behind this legislation.

152
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:11,570
Luke, you were involved in
helping the company respond

153
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:14,870
to that breach and interface
with the government.

154
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,110
Can you talk to us

155
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:19,730
about how the existing
reporting requirement landscape

156
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:22,070
may have influenced what they did

157
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:25,280
or what they do have very little to do

158
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,022
with the existing requirements?

159
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:32,580
- Yeah, I think it had
very little to do with it

160
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,940
because it was obviously,
an urgent matter.

161
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:39,640
The company made a decision
to come out very quickly,

162
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,610
very proactively.

163
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:46,610
And I think, beyond that has
been by most all accounts

164
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,150
or all accounts that I'm
aware of, very transparent.

165
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:55,280
And so the company has put
out a lot of things publicly

166
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,479
about exactly what happened,

167
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,790
exactly the threat indicators involved.

168
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:04,440
That's been shared
thoroughly across the board

169
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,830
broadly with the government
and the public sector.

170
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,789
And also, it's a global event,

171
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:14,790
so the transparency's not
been limited just to the U.S.,

172
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:18,590
but to stakeholders around the world

173
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:20,859
to try to react proactively.

174
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:25,540
I think it raises that
sort of thing Aruna raises,

175
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,960
an interesting distinction
from where we started

176
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:31,770
because that incidence's
really not so much

177
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:36,260
about personal information
or personal data.

178
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:41,010
The laws that Adam and I
started out commenting on

179
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:44,319
really are about consumer personal data

180
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,090
and were originally driven
largely by privacy concerns

181
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:50,840
and identity theft concerns of individuals

182
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,910
mainly in the U.S., identity theft.

183
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:57,240
And then it expanded as European concepts

184
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,770
and other concepts of data privacy

185
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:01,660
have worked their way in.

186
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:05,390
I think these larger issues,

187
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:07,819
including the Microsoft matter,

188
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,140
they address things involving,

189
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,680
for example, critical infrastructure.

190
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,620
And that's a different type of reporting

191
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:18,343
than reports about personal data.

192
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,069
In the EU, there was a
law passed alongside GDPR

193
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:27,110
but no one really has talked
much about it publicly,

194
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:31,680
certainly in the U.S.,
called the NIS Directive.

195
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,890
This sets a very short time window

196
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:40,520
for critical infrastructure
companies in Europe

197
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,860
to report any potentially
significant incident

198
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:47,230
to regulators and that one is really not

199
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:49,880
about privacy or identity theft.

200
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,810
It's about effects on
critical infrastructure

201
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:55,859
and national security, much more broadly.

202
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:58,730
- I do wanna come back

203
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:00,700
and talk more about the European regime,

204
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,840
and we'll ask you if
you've counseled companies

205
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:07,340
responding to that
infrastructure piece of things.

206
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,570
But Tonya, let me come to you first.

207
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:12,450
And from the FBI perspective,
can you talk about...

208
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,620
You, obviously, are dealing

209
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:17,980
with a lot of different
companies that do face breaches

210
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,500
and have to come talk to the FBI about it.

211
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,650
How would you compare SolarWinds'

212
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:28,960
very quick public response
to the other companies

213
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,963
that you're dealing with
just as a general matter?

214
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:33,892
- Thanks.

215
00:10:33,893 --> 00:10:36,670
I think the SolarWinds
incident is really interesting

216
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:40,329
because a lot of times
when we see a groundswell

217
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:43,360
for legislation or to
close a particular gap,

218
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,620
like we're starting to see

219
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:47,690
with the national data
breach reporting law,

220
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:49,300
that groundswell is prompted

221
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,949
by something that didn't happen.

222
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,760
Someone who didn't take an action

223
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:56,580
or didn't tie information
together or report something.

224
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,760
And here we have the opposite case.

225
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,330
We actually have an incident where

226
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:05,930
from the standpoint of the
actions of FireEye in particular

227
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:10,930
in reporting the intrusion,
all the stars aligned.

228
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:15,990
They did the right thing from
the government's perspective.

229
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:19,840
Almost immediately upon noticing
that they were the victim

230
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,450
of this very sophisticated intrusion,

231
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:24,560
they reached out to the government.

232
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:29,026
And I think that was extraordinary

233
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:31,670
in how they did that.

234
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:33,490
And I think it highlights

235
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:36,640
what we often, unfortunately, don't see.

236
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,650
And when I say that the stars aligned,

237
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:41,770
I mean this is a case
where the victim is itself

238
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:45,030
a sophisticated cybersecurity company

239
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:49,350
who is more accustomed than
many private sector victims

240
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:53,230
to being able to recognize intrusions

241
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:55,730
and recognize when
they're seeing something

242
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:57,800
that looks like it's going to have impact

243
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,020
not only on them as an individual victim,

244
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:04,230
but as likely part of
a much larger campaign,

245
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:09,230
meaning that the national
security interest was high.

246
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,900
And so it was very important

247
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,920
that they come to the government quickly,

248
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,810
but we can't count on that
happening in all cases.

249
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:22,810
And so I think that really
has highlighted for many

250
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:27,320
the need for this type of
national data breach reporting.

251
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,210
I think it also shows the importance

252
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,580
of some of proactive relationship building

253
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:36,500
that the government does with
members of the private sector,

254
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:40,200
whether that's members of
the cybersecurity community

255
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:45,200
like a FireEye, or the
rest of the private sector,

256
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:47,540
both small and large businesses

257
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:50,939
and the whole range of the sector.

258
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,560
It's that proactive relationship building

259
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,719
that raises the likelihood

260
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,300
that a victim of a cyber intrusion

261
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,709
is going to report that to the government

262
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:05,710
and that takes many forms from
routine information sharing

263
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:10,210
to some of the hubs, such
as the FBI has established,

264
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:14,260
where members of the private
sector and certain industries

265
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:18,290
are sitting side by
side with FBI employees,

266
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:23,290
looking at logs and threat-related data

267
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:25,540
and trying to increase the speed

268
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:29,560
with which we can act on what
members of the private sector

269
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,563
are seeing from a threat perspective.

270
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:34,730
- Tonya, I think there's
a point worth emphasizing

271
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:38,990
in what you said, which
is FireEye's reporting

272
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:41,820
of this mattered not
just because it was good

273
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,970
for the government to do its job, right?

274
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:46,930
Our job is to investigate
breaches and figure them out.

275
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:51,930
It's that, in an apparent
likely espionage campaign,

276
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,010
in which something

277
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:58,740
in the vicinity of 18,000
or so systems were exposed,

278
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:03,060
we think far fewer were
actually exploited, right?

279
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,910
That data was stolen from them.

280
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,533
Far, far fewer than that.

281
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,760
And part of the reason for that is perhaps

282
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:14,180
that we caught this earlier
than we otherwise would've

283
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:18,219
thanks in part to one victim,
one very sophisticated victim

284
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,800
raising their hand and saying

285
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,689
this is happening on my network.

286
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:25,600
And had they not done that, I
can't say for certain I know

287
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,760
when we would have
otherwise unraveled this.

288
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,880
And so the kind of reporting requirement

289
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,870
we're talking about here
doesn't just make us feel better

290
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:37,530
as agents and prosecutors, 'cause oh,

291
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:39,760
now we can open a case now
versus six months from now,

292
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,150
it's that knowing what's
happening nationwide

293
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:45,410
is critical to our ability
to push out the information

294
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:47,010
that helps people protect themselves,

295
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:48,781
other potential victims,

296
00:14:48,781 --> 00:14:50,270
other folks who have been victimized

297
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:52,002
who also don't even know about it.

298
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:55,510
- So it sounds like
what you all are saying

299
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:59,450
is that in a new national
data breach reporting law,

300
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:01,860
you almost want to incentivize
every other company

301
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:05,060
to do exactly what FireEye
did in this instance.

302
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:05,892
Is that right?

303
00:15:05,893 --> 00:15:09,137
Or do you think legislation
would have changed at all

304
00:15:09,137 --> 00:15:10,792
tow they responded here?

305
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,150
- I think what Tonya and I are saying

306
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:15,780
is that that was modeled behavior

307
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:19,329
and it was entirely voluntary
and it's in the public good.

308
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:22,040
And sometimes you want legislation

309
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,120
that creates those incentives,

310
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,750
so that what was purely voluntary today

311
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,960
is encouraged in the future
or potentially required.

312
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,990
And that's a choice, obviously,

313
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:33,050
for the administration
and Congress to make.

314
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:34,170
But that's what we're saying.

315
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:35,750
We're saying this anecdote demonstrates

316
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,830
why that kind of
reporting is so important.

317
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:38,890
So let's make it easier.

318
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:39,810
Let's make it mandatory.

319
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:40,642
Let's encourage it.

320
00:15:40,643 --> 00:15:42,840
Whatever combination of carrots and sticks

321
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,130
comes out of the policy process.

322
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:46,230
It's helpful.

323
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:47,380
- Right.

324
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,300
Adam, you had mentioned this sort of shift

325
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:52,329
in even reasoning behind this law

326
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:55,230
in the growing national security concerns.

327
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:57,130
Are you seeing any shift

328
00:15:57,130 --> 00:16:02,130
in how receptive companies
are to coming to talk to you

329
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,390
if they are concerned that
the actor they're dealing with

330
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:07,770
is a potential nation state

331
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:11,699
versus just maybe just
a general ransomware

332
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,770
or a criminal type attack?

333
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:16,560
- Yeah, that's a good
distinction you're making

334
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,392
and a great question.

335
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:18,970
And I wanna hear what Luke has to say too

336
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:20,860
in response to that,
because he represents folks

337
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:23,100
who are making exactly that decision.

338
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:26,690
My sense is, as a general rule,

339
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:29,800
companies are more willing
to contact the government

340
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,359
and work with law enforcement now

341
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,010
than they were ever
before, for a few reasons.

342
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:39,780
One is that having a data breach alone

343
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,850
used to be a kind of a Scarlet letter

344
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:44,140
and there was a shame factor,

345
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:46,380
and so you kind of didn't
want it to get out.

346
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,420
Now, there's sort of a sad understanding

347
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:53,420
that this is a part of the
mortality of computer networks,

348
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,080
that this happens.

349
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:58,140
And so then the attention
turns not just to defense

350
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:00,670
but resilience and reputation.

351
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:03,030
And part of the way you demonstrate,

352
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:05,099
you are taking something seriously

353
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:06,810
and doing everything you can as a business

354
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:09,720
is saying I'm working with
law enforcement to address it.

355
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,650
I do think there's a potential distinction

356
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:15,359
between the breaches that are
ultimately gonna become public

357
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,449
because of these very state

358
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:20,040
data breach reporting requirements, right,

359
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,579
or something that is
too big to go unnoticed,

360
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:24,939
versus the kind of
intrusion that the company,

361
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:28,340
like ransomware potentially
might be tempted

362
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:30,790
to hope never sees the light of day.

363
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:33,780
And so I do think companies think harder

364
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:34,960
about coming to law enforcement

365
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,250
if they think there's a chance

366
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,520
no one will ever know about it.

367
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,960
The argument we make
in addition to the fact

368
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,740
that we think you'll wanna
say you're working with us,

369
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:48,260
is that by working with
us, you do get the benefit

370
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:51,350
of some context information from the FBI

371
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:53,879
and the FBI's partners
across the government.

372
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,580
So that's a nuanced argument, right?

373
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:59,439
After the breach has happened,

374
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,210
Tonya and I can't come in and say,

375
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:03,520
we can make everything better
like it never happened.

376
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,510
What we're offering is a bit more insight,

377
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:10,020
potentially a bit more context,
another partner in this.

378
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:13,800
But some council have said to me,

379
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,409
listen, I don't really care

380
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:18,290
whether it's a state actor or a criminal.

381
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:19,470
The network's been breached,

382
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:21,870
so attribution doesn't
really matter to me.

383
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:23,780
I think that's short-sighted.

384
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:26,790
I think nation states generally
have different objectives,

385
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:30,270
and even if criminal groups
are very sophisticated,

386
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:32,610
there's still a different framework

387
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:34,260
that most state actors are operating with.

388
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,670
And even if you know
it's one or the other,

389
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:38,950
don't you wanna have more
information about them?

390
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:41,550
I think the other factor
that that's helped us

391
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:44,330
is I think we've disabused
people the notion

392
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:48,250
that by reporting to us there's
a one-size-fits-all solution

393
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:51,280
or that we're gonna walk in,
take over the investigation,

394
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,649
making positions on you and your staff.

395
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:56,190
We're gonna be really sensitive

396
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:58,400
to what is public, what is not public,

397
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,800
what your timeframe is
for reporting things.

398
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,340
We're not your regulator.

399
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:05,330
We're not there to go tattling
on you to your regulator.

400
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:06,889
So I think we've gone a long way

401
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:09,250
in softening the image of law enforcement,

402
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,810
if I can use that term.

403
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:12,840
But there are still folks who say,

404
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,240
listen, what's in it for me?

405
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,070
- Luke, how do you see
it from your perspective?

406
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:23,070
Is there some increased desire
to talk to law enforcement?

407
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:27,350
Or is it still pretty much
only if we have to, we'll go?

408
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:29,112
- No, I think it's changing.

409
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,990
As Adam said, it's less now

410
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:35,210
about the fact that you had a breach.

411
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:37,250
As we talked to many companies,

412
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:41,230
most all of them have had
some breach in their history,

413
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:43,190
sometimes recent history.

414
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:47,850
And so they're aware of how
painfully challenging it can be

415
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:51,090
to avoid a compromise.

416
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:53,909
And if it's a sophisticated
enough adversary

417
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:55,860
like a nation state and they're determined

418
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:59,173
and they have basically
unlimited resources and time,

419
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:02,540
they've proven time and time again

420
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:05,546
that they can get into
the hardest of targets,

421
00:20:05,546 --> 00:20:09,130
including in the intelligence community

422
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:10,840
of the U.S. Government, for example.

423
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:15,193
So no one really is impervious to attack.

424
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,830
And so there's a level of humility

425
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:21,340
about all of this that has crept in.

426
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:25,370
And so it's devolved more
to what I think is a better,

427
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:29,709
healthier way to look at this,
which is how did you respond?

428
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:30,710
How did you respond?

429
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:34,000
And there's the initial coming forward

430
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,390
when you've discovered
something, as you've noted,

431
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:38,170
that FireEye did.

432
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:43,170
There's also what a victim
like SolarWinds does

433
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,160
in terms of the quality of
the information they share

434
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:50,230
and transparency to where
customers and the government

435
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:53,770
and so forth, because
you could check a box

436
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:58,000
and make a notification from
a compliance standpoint,

437
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,670
but unless you're
proactive and transparent

438
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:03,650
and the cards are willing
to put onto the table

439
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:08,053
showing the world, taking
ownership of the issue,

440
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,220
then the ability of the government

441
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:14,563
and the ability of other
would-be victims to prevent this,

442
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,240
is really limited.

443
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,060
They're gonna have to start from scratch,

444
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,399
unless you lay it out for them.

445
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,580
And so I'm finding refreshingly,

446
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:27,510
that when we have a client, for example,

447
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:30,780
that has an incident and increasingly

448
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:33,210
it's been something like ransomware

449
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:36,980
where it's people know about
your problem pretty quickly.

450
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:40,150
It's not something that's
low and slow, as we say.

451
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:45,110
I find myself with the client
on the phone or on the video

452
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:49,209
with their largest
clients, corporate clients,

453
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:53,600
who are very sophisticated
and it is they're not staying

454
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,719
why did this happen?

455
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,553
How did this happen?

456
00:21:55,553 --> 00:21:59,300
They wanna know what happened,
how it can be prevented,

457
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,940
what you're doing going forward,

458
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:03,650
whether their data, of course, is safe.

459
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:06,290
And we often find that
that transparency's leading

460
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:09,250
to very a lot of
goodwill, which is to say.

461
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:11,720
I mean, we all wish
that it hadn't happened,

462
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:16,100
but if we're gonna be here,
we've shown who we are

463
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:19,280
by coming forward and
putting cards on the table

464
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,663
with a lot of transparency
to the fullest extent we can.

465
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:28,630
- So there have been several
congressional offices

466
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:32,290
that have started thinking
about what new legislation

467
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:34,310
in this area might look like.

468
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:39,010
We've seen some reports
of more general laws

469
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:43,970
about having a broad range of
companies reporting incidents.

470
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:47,210
We've seen some more specifically tailored

471
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:51,610
to companies that are in
infrastructure that is deemed to be

472
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:53,139
of national security importance,

473
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:56,280
reporting more specific information

474
00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:00,370
about their data breaches.

475
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:01,969
Tonya, from the FBI perspective,

476
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:02,960
can you talk to us a bit

477
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,120
about what the FBI would like to see

478
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:09,652
in some legislation that
ends up coming together?

479
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:14,740
- Well, I think the important thing is

480
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:19,070
that we wanna make the
reporting requirements

481
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:22,750
as clear as possible, as clear and easy.

482
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:25,780
So I think you heard Luke
described at the outset

483
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:28,590
why that's not currently the case.

484
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:32,240
So I think that's idea of standardization

485
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,950
and giving companies kind
of less to figure out

486
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:39,330
at the moment that they're
suffering an intrusion

487
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:41,990
to making it as easy as possible

488
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:44,750
is really the key first part.

489
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:47,520
I think it's also important to say that

490
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,290
in the sense that some folks are worried

491
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:53,470
that this might be a
burdensome requirements,

492
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:56,430
either on the private
sector or on the government

493
00:23:56,430 --> 00:24:00,700
to manage what might be inbound

494
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:04,840
from this increased reporting,
as Adam articulated,

495
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:08,250
I don't think we're looking at a threshold

496
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:11,980
where every single incident and intrusion

497
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:13,480
would need to be reported.

498
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,910
What we're most concerned about

499
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:16,960
from the federal government perspective

500
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,580
are incidents where
there's a national security

501
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,540
or public safety concern.

502
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:26,860
So things like U.S. Government information

503
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:31,240
that's been threatened or
U.S. critical infrastructure.

504
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:36,240
And I think, we have ways
and established procedures

505
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:41,130
and processes here where we
can take that information in,

506
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:44,490
triage it, analyze it,
find the connections.

507
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:48,730
And as Luke described, be able
to provide information back.

508
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:51,880
That's not only gonna help
answer those questions

509
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:55,750
of how do I keep this from
happening to me again,

510
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:58,640
but it's also providing us information

511
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,210
that we're gonna be able
to provide it to others

512
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:03,573
to help keep them from being victimized.

513
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:09,130
- Luke, how about from the
private sector perspective,

514
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:12,633
what do you think is most
important to see in legislation?

515
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:17,830
- I think, Tonya's hit
hit the nail on the head

516
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:21,350
in terms of clear lines.

517
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:26,350
I think if it's seen as just
another compliance layer

518
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:31,939
and not so meaningful
in the scheme of things,

519
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:34,300
people of course, will do what's required,

520
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:37,373
but it won't be viewed as favorably.

521
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:41,110
One of the things that
I think has played out

522
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:43,169
well in Europe, on the NIS Directive

523
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:49,260
is that it sets a pretty clear high bar.

524
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,980
It defines the sectors,

525
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:53,590
although that's been a
little bit hard to tell

526
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:56,010
who's in and who's out of scope,

527
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:57,510
there's been some guidance on that

528
00:25:57,510 --> 00:26:02,370
that's been very helpful
from European regulators,

529
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:06,620
but it creates that channel.

530
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:10,312
It establishes a rapport of trust.

531
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:14,120
What's been happening in the U.S.

532
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,760
that's been very favorable,

533
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:20,210
going back to what Adam said early on,

534
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:24,330
is there's been a huge effort by the FBI

535
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:28,860
the Secret Service, DOJ to
change the whole dynamic

536
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:32,929
with victims, to treat them as victims.

537
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:36,740
And I think as long as that
message carries through

538
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:41,260
with what's being done, it
will be viewed very favorably.

539
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:44,053
I think if, to the extent,

540
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:49,710
the law helps others in the community

541
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:52,110
more broadly avert harm,

542
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,669
it will be viewed very positively

543
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:56,840
to the extent that information reported

544
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:59,253
goes into a black hole or a vacuum

545
00:26:59,253 --> 00:27:03,763
and nothing comes out of it
that anyone can perceive anyway,

546
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:07,870
it will be viewed as another
check the box exercise,

547
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:11,020
and I think that's what
we're all hoping to avoid.

548
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:14,520
- Do you think there are
lessons from the European model

549
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,793
that Congress should
take into account now?

550
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:20,440
- Yeah, it's got a simplicity to it.

551
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,763
So I like that.

552
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:26,707
It's just like your
incident response plan.

553
00:27:26,707 --> 00:27:29,560
If it's a 200-page doorstopper,

554
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:32,110
it's gonna be a great
doorstopper in the crisis,

555
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:34,033
but no one's really gonna read it.

556
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:38,763
It's the same sometimes with these laws.

557
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,180
Your lawyers may read it,

558
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:44,590
but the people who are your
operators and seeing things,

559
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:47,060
it becomes challenging to enforce it.

560
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:51,500
So I think bright lines,
clear communications pathways,

561
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:55,830
clear returns on
information, in other words,

562
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:58,460
clear benefits not only
to the reporting victim,

563
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:01,840
but to others, say, in
sector or more broadly

564
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:06,850
will make it very effective
in the scheme of things.

565
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:10,879
- I think Luke makes a great
point about that need to show

566
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,010
that this reporting isn't
just going into a black hole,

567
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:16,730
or it's not just coming into some database

568
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:19,270
that the federal
government is pouring over

569
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:23,570
for its own purposes
and then not acting on.

570
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:26,889
As we envision what this would look like,

571
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:28,500
having that reporting come in

572
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:32,170
would be the start of the
process, not the end of it,

573
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:35,380
because from the FBI's perspective,

574
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:39,450
we would be looking at it in
terms of how do we act on it?

575
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:44,450
How do we tie it together
to other adversary activity

576
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,810
we might be seeing?

577
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:48,520
How do we set leads to our field offices

578
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:52,170
to go respond to the
entity that's reported it?

579
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:54,060
How do we take what we're learning

580
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:57,770
and then share it out with others?

581
00:28:57,770 --> 00:29:00,860
We think of this is gonna sound morbid,

582
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:02,310
to pick up on Adam's word,

583
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:05,010
but we think of each of these intrusions

584
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:10,010
as if it were a murder
conducted by a serial killer.

585
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:13,120
Whoever's behind it will strike again,

586
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,790
and they're leaving clues
at each crime scene.

587
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:21,240
So this reporting will
help us pick up those clues

588
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,610
and share it with others

589
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:26,379
before they then become
a subsequent victim.

590
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:29,020
So I think it's really that action

591
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:32,260
that's going to occur after
the reporting comes in.

592
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:36,520
That would make this such a game changer.

593
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,421
- Yeah.

594
00:29:37,421 --> 00:29:40,690
I mean, Aruna, I don't
wanna presume anything,

595
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:43,210
but I that there are some
private sector reports

596
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:44,600
that come out every year

597
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:48,189
that are essentially
surveys of data breaches,

598
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:52,140
means and methods, trends over time.

599
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:54,220
I read them because it's
critically important

600
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:57,910
that we know what the
landscape looks like.

601
00:29:57,910 --> 00:30:02,550
I think if this reporting
led to public reports

602
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:06,470
by the government that
were aggregated data,

603
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:08,730
that alone would be
very helpful to industry

604
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:11,680
to the security providers
who see a segment, right?

605
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:15,250
They see their customer
base, they see their clients,

606
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:16,420
but that's one way the government

607
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:17,630
could contribute from this.

608
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:19,430
The other thing that being told

609
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:20,920
what to report and when does,

610
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:24,310
is it helps remove some of the...

611
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:30,350
I think, call it ethical, call
it strategic considerations

612
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:31,810
that companies have to make now

613
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:35,030
about I would like to report this,

614
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:37,889
but maybe there are
disadvantages or advantages,

615
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:40,080
and there may be a competitive
disadvantage, right,

616
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,460
in their mind, to doing it.

617
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,450
Luke, tell me what do you think.

618
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:44,760
But I think that if there's
a standard that's clear

619
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,260
that everyone's following as a business,

620
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,300
it makes it easier for you

621
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:51,778
'cause you know you're not
following one set of rules

622
00:30:51,778 --> 00:30:54,080
that your competitors or others

623
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,649
that seek to be competitors
in the marketplace

624
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:58,000
aren't necessarily gonna
follow the same opportunity

625
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,003
or a better position or at
least at a level playing field.

626
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:04,582
- Yeah, I think that's right.

627
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,600
If those goals could be accomplished,

628
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,760
I think people will embrace it.

629
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,030
There's also been some innovative thinking

630
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:13,720
in this general area.

631
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:18,160
One is the SISA Act from 2015

632
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:23,160
where you had things like
protection from liability,

633
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,760
from privilege waiver.

634
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:27,513
Those sorts of things are
important to companies.

635
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:31,500
We've seen other examples
at the state level,

636
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,920
just switching over momentarily,

637
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:37,720
to the personal data
breach reporting regimes.

638
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,950
Ohio, for example, came
up with a Safe Harbor

639
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,129
around their breach reporting,

640
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:48,490
whereby if you can show certain
reasonable security measures

641
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:52,280
were in place, you've got a
protection from liability.

642
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:55,070
I don't know that any of
these things is perfect

643
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:57,960
or has worked out perfectly in practice,

644
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,310
but that's the kind of thing

645
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:04,129
that I think would really
incentivize industry

646
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:07,040
not only just to tell you what happened,

647
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:10,450
but to invest even more

648
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:12,893
in preventing it from happening again.

649
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:16,370
- How would you envision enforcement

650
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:18,969
of a new federal standard working?

651
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:21,910
Right now, obviously, we've got state laws

652
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:25,580
enforced by state attorneys general.

653
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:29,760
Would you envision a new federal
law preempting all of that

654
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,540
and then being enforced by the FTC?

655
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:34,853
Or how do you envision that?

656
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:39,830
I don't know, Luke, if you
wanna weigh in on that.

657
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:42,129
- Sure, I can start briefly.

658
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:43,430
So I think it's a challenge

659
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:47,050
because we tried to do something like this

660
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:48,690
in the Obama administration,

661
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:50,840
as we said at the
beginning of the program.

662
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:55,920
And it was challenging enough then,

663
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:58,883
that's going back seven or so years ago,

664
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,520
when that was percolating.

665
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,840
And I know there've
been efforts since then.

666
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,730
But each year that goes by,

667
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:10,200
the state laws get build out even further,

668
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:15,000
the state enforcement
apparatuses get more robust.

669
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,980
The cyber and privacy
issues rise even higher

670
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:23,690
up the priority scale within
those state and local agencies.

671
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:27,810
And so it becomes harder
to think about preemption

672
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:29,363
and unwinding that,

673
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:35,200
I almost think you have
to decouple the standard.

674
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:39,990
Maybe you would have a
standard reporting timeframe,

675
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:43,010
standard definition for personal data,

676
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:45,010
standard set of exceptions,

677
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:47,330
all the patchwork that we deal with now,

678
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:50,699
where lawyers sit there
with beads on an abacus,

679
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:51,780
as I sometimes say,

680
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:55,470
and slide them around to
great expense for their client

681
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:58,720
because that's what we have to deal with.

682
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,900
If there were one standard,

683
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:03,660
you can think about that being
the preemption component,

684
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:07,683
but that the enforcement would
remain at the state level.

685
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:11,130
Because I think taking
that away from the states

686
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:13,723
at this point is gonna
be very challenging.

687
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:17,800
- That does definitely
make a lot of sense.

688
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:22,639
Tonya, how would you envision
the reporting coming in?

689
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:23,909
Would you even envision

690
00:34:23,909 --> 00:34:28,580
like a new joint FBI DHS kind
of office to take all this in

691
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:31,190
and then farm out the tips and leads?

692
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:34,092
Or what would you like to see there?

693
00:34:34,929 --> 00:34:36,989
- Yeah, I think there's
a few different ways

694
00:34:36,989 --> 00:34:37,822
that could work.

695
00:34:37,822 --> 00:34:38,920
As I mentioned earlier,

696
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:42,920
I mean, we certainly have
the structure in place

697
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:47,920
just in terms of how we
take in tips and reports,

698
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:51,889
whether that's through
phone lines or websites

699
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:53,929
or internet crime complaint center.

700
00:34:53,929 --> 00:34:58,160
I mean, for many different
types of threats and crimes,

701
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:02,190
there's many ways that we
ingest that type of reporting

702
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:06,880
and are able, as I mentioned,
to triage it and act on it.

703
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,810
I think we're less concerned

704
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:12,820
about who would own that and
who the initial recipient

705
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:15,440
in the federal government would be

706
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:20,163
than we are about who can
view it simultaneously,

707
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,580
so that there's no delay
in being able to act on it.

708
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:28,670
So when I think of the
primary federal agencies

709
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:32,420
who would need to have that
type of kind of real time,

710
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:36,170
unfiltered visibility to what's coming in,

711
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:39,260
I think those agencies are the two

712
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:43,520
that have the lead responsibility
for incident response

713
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,120
when it comes to cyber incidents,

714
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:47,910
which is the FBI SISA.

715
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:50,540
Our roles are very complimentary

716
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:54,470
and we work together really
closer now than we ever have

717
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:57,720
in terms of our threat response,

718
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:02,720
responding to the national
security and investigative needs

719
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:06,950
of an incident and SISA's
asset response role

720
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:09,680
of mitigation and recovery.

721
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:13,470
And so I think if we're both
able to look at the data,

722
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:16,160
coordinate and act quickly,

723
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,960
that's really the primary concern

724
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:21,840
and we can work out the
details of where it's housed

725
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:25,280
and who's responsible for managing it.

726
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,870
- Would you potentially be concerned

727
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:31,377
that you'd be getting hundreds
of reports every week,

728
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:35,460
every almost potentially even every day?

729
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:37,990
Is this potentially a case

730
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:39,540
where the government is
just gonna be flooded

731
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:41,740
with almost too much information?

732
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:44,209
- Well, first I'd say it's
a problem we'd love to have.

733
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:47,200
I think if we can compare the
current situation we're in,

734
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,933
where we can't even quantify
really what we're missing.

735
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:54,060
So I'll say that first.

736
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,640
I don't think we're concerned about that

737
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:58,140
for the reasons I mentioned earlier.

738
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:01,629
Every kind of discussion
and draft legislation

739
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:06,630
I've seen on this is
careful to set a threshold

740
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,370
I think for the types of reporting

741
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:10,870
that the federal government
would be most interested in

742
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:14,680
in terms of the types of
entities being affected,

743
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:17,940
going beyond the personally
identifiable information,

744
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,720
those types of data breaches,

745
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,740
to those potentially impacting

746
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:24,459
the security of U.S.
Government information

747
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:26,940
or the security of
critical infrastructure.

748
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:30,270
Those are still very large categories,

749
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:32,560
but I'm confident that the government

750
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,020
would be able to handle that reporting

751
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:38,350
where I would have a resource concern,

752
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:40,819
but one that I think could be addressed

753
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:45,080
certainly through the
normal budget process

754
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:48,340
is making sure our
incident response agencies

755
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:52,160
and our incident response teams
and our investigative teams

756
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,680
in our field offices have
the resources necessary

757
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:59,580
to be able to act on
that level of reporting.

758
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:02,640
So it's not so much the ingest,

759
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:06,580
but we wanna make sure that
once we're in receipt of that,

760
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:10,620
and we're pushing out those
leads to our 56 field offices,

761
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:13,950
we have, for example,
for us the cyber squads

762
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:16,370
and the cyber task forces in place

763
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:19,470
that are gonna be able to
do that immediate response

764
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:21,433
that we're all aiming for.

765
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:26,260
- There is also reportedly an
executive order in the works

766
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:30,290
that may be out by the
time this actually airs

767
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:33,759
that would require software vendors

768
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,040
that have government clients
to report data breaches

769
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:40,200
to their government customers.

770
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:44,883
And since we're talking about
large software companies,

771
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:48,060
almost all of them are
government customers.

772
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:51,370
To what extent do you
think something like that

773
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:55,339
would cover 80 to 90%
of the kind of reporting

774
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:58,863
you were really looking to see, Adam?

775
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,615
I know just speaking hypothetically.

776
00:39:01,615 --> 00:39:02,448
- Yeah.

777
00:39:02,448 --> 00:39:05,180
I think that helps, but the government...

778
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:08,799
I don't know that we consume every

779
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,023
or nearly enough of the products to know,

780
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:15,100
forcing it through
procurement contracting,

781
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:17,089
I think, is the model we're using.

782
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:18,390
That is a powerful tool.

783
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:21,629
And it always amazes me
whenever we have an incident.

784
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:24,800
We check the files and
we're like, ah! (laughs)

785
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,230
We might be able to do
something with this.

786
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:27,430
And we tweak that.

787
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:30,040
And so the one job I think
I probably don't want

788
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,350
is a government
procurement contract lawyer

789
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:35,910
'cause I feel like you're
constantly updating those forms.

790
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:37,560
I think it helps.

791
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,299
I don't know, though, that
it gets at everything.

792
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:42,520
So another category of information,

793
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:45,430
Tonya mentioned critical infrastructure.

794
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:48,830
I think bottom line, you
want the government to know,

795
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:52,080
I think, if there's
something that threatens

796
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,360
pieces of critical infrastructure,

797
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:57,740
because even if it's not our
responsibility as a regulator,

798
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:59,959
as DOJ and FBI in a
particular state, right?

799
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:02,620
A lot of critical infrastructure
things we think about,

800
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:03,580
power plants and the like,

801
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:06,220
they're under state regulation

802
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:11,029
or a mixture of public
and private and the like.

803
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:12,300
You still wanna know about it

804
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,440
because you wanna warn the sector.

805
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,273
So that's one thing.

806
00:40:15,273 --> 00:40:17,440
Another example's export
controlled information, right?

807
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,580
You don't want technical data

808
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:22,700
that has a military
application to go out the door

809
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:23,859
without us knowing about it,

810
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:27,603
because you want the military
to know what's been exposed.

811
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:32,460
There are other examples
where there's a public benefit

812
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:33,510
for us knowing about it,

813
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:38,159
even if it seems like a purely
private event, but yeah.

814
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:40,750
That's why I think this
sort of sausage making

815
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:43,220
that has to happen in the policy process

816
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:45,220
to figure out exactly how to scope that.

817
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:47,423
- Right.

818
00:40:47,423 --> 00:40:48,256
No, that makes sense.

819
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:53,090
Let's talk a little bit
about some of the concerns

820
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:56,740
that people have raised about
this potential legislation.

821
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:59,910
You do hear from civil liberties
advocates saying that, oh,

822
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:04,060
will this open up a new
avenue for the government

823
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:07,633
to access personal consumer
information from companies?

824
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:11,723
Personal messages, things like that.

825
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:13,813
Either Adam or Tonya,

826
00:41:15,512 --> 00:41:17,460
what would you say to people

827
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:20,010
who raise those kinds of concerns?

828
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:21,850
- Yeah, I think to be clear,

829
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:23,620
the kind of reporting we're talking about

830
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:27,380
isn't of that kind of sensitive
personal data or the like.

831
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:30,210
We're looking essentially
for the fact of an incident

832
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:31,550
and the basic parameters

833
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:34,780
to understand what our
response posture should be.

834
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:36,760
And then for that kind of information

835
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:39,410
that you'd worry about
from a privacy perspective,

836
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:42,200
that could very easily
require legal process, right?

837
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:45,299
So this would not make it
any easier for the government

838
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,770
to get that kind of information.

839
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:49,830
In fact, if I could,

840
00:41:49,830 --> 00:41:51,750
there's a conversation happening right now

841
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:55,480
about how do you not have a SolarWinds

842
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,910
type event happen again?

843
00:41:56,910 --> 00:41:59,339
Does the government
have enough information?

844
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:02,230
I think everyone who
works in cybersecurity

845
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:07,230
agrees that the government
needs some more insight

846
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:10,370
into what's happening on private networks

847
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:13,870
because that's the
majority of the internet.

848
00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:17,057
So if you want us to
respond, we can't respond

849
00:42:18,078 --> 00:42:19,400
to what we don't know about.

850
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:22,040
There are a couple ways you
could give us that visibility.

851
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,460
One option that I've heard called for

852
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:29,460
is more monitoring by
components of the government

853
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,500
like the intelligence community.

854
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:34,459
One alternative to that,
if you don't like the idea

855
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:36,410
of more surveillance is reporting.

856
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:38,470
Reporting that is voluntary in the sense

857
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:41,120
that you choose what you put
on the form that you fill out.

858
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:43,430
Now that the regulation may require it,

859
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:44,810
but the point is you're filling it out.

860
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:46,610
Someone's not watching your network.

861
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:49,750
And so, if you don't like
warrantless surveillance,

862
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:51,300
I've got a bill you might like.

863
00:42:54,830 --> 00:42:59,040
- Luke, what about on the liability side?

864
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:03,130
You had mentioned the Ohio
model as a potential way forward

865
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:05,750
in terms of the kind of
liability protections

866
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:07,110
that you'd like to see.

867
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:10,010
Can you talk a little bit more
about that side of things?

868
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:13,833
How important is a
liability from lawsuits?

869
00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:17,390
- Yeah, it's a very big issue, Aruna.

870
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:19,560
And this is the other side of the coin.

871
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:21,590
For most of our clients,

872
00:43:21,590 --> 00:43:24,050
it really isn't certainly in the U.S.,

873
00:43:24,050 --> 00:43:28,580
there isn't a concern about DOJ or FBI

874
00:43:30,310 --> 00:43:32,920
viewing them in the wrong
light, by and large.

875
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,073
It's very rare.

876
00:43:35,504 --> 00:43:39,589
It is on the regulatory side
and the civil litigation side,

877
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:40,663
to your question.

878
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:45,629
The regulators, they
have a different agenda

879
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:49,400
and sometimes a victim coming
forward to report something

880
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:54,400
to law enforcement feels
like they're pointed out

881
00:43:54,690 --> 00:43:57,720
as the perpetrator by a regulator.

882
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,669
I think things are evolving

883
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:02,470
and the more sophisticated
regulatory agencies

884
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:06,169
in the cyberspace are coming to realize

885
00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:09,460
how complex some of these issues are.

886
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:11,910
I can tell you, I don't think we're there

887
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:14,210
in other parts of the world.

888
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:17,690
Much of the rest of the
world has been very focused,

889
00:44:17,690 --> 00:44:20,540
rightly so, on privacy issues,

890
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:22,920
much less on cybersecurity issues.

891
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:27,920
And so regulations like
GDPR, they have one phrase

892
00:44:28,490 --> 00:44:31,470
on cybersecurity, that
it has to be reasonable.

893
00:44:31,470 --> 00:44:33,939
Well, that's very speculative

894
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:37,340
and beauty's in the eye
of the beholder there.

895
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:42,340
So the regulatory exposure is an issue.

896
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,670
Civil liability is an issue.

897
00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:47,930
We've seen erosion of
attorney-client privilege

898
00:44:47,930 --> 00:44:49,790
in the courts.

899
00:44:49,790 --> 00:44:53,680
We've seen courts basically,

900
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:56,629
they've taught the
plaintiff's bar how to get

901
00:44:56,630 --> 00:45:00,520
past the motion to
dismiss, how to plead harm,

902
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:03,100
even when no one can show

903
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:05,810
that their data was misused, for example.

904
00:45:05,810 --> 00:45:08,230
Those cases used to be thrown out.

905
00:45:08,230 --> 00:45:11,210
And now it means that you're
past the motion to dismiss

906
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:13,120
and you're into discovery.

907
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:15,940
And that means, they're asking
not only about this incident,

908
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:17,730
but they're asking you
about the risk assessment

909
00:45:17,730 --> 00:45:21,413
and the pen tests that you
did last year, what you knew.

910
00:45:23,110 --> 00:45:26,310
So there's a lot of
consequences to these things.

911
00:45:26,310 --> 00:45:30,190
And I think if we could
get a little more nuanced

912
00:45:30,190 --> 00:45:34,960
in our regulation and
our laws about incentives

913
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,900
for good investment and good behavior,

914
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:40,420
understanding that everyone can't control

915
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:43,173
everything in the cyberspace,

916
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,419
that would be a healthy step forward

917
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:49,283
for this type of regulation.

918
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,360
- So I think we have
only a few minutes left.

919
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:56,920
And so maybe we'll just go down the line

920
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,820
and everyone can offer
their kind of final thoughts

921
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:03,930
and what is the takeaway that you think

922
00:46:03,930 --> 00:46:05,200
from your agency perspective

923
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,549
or from the private sector perspective,

924
00:46:06,550 --> 00:46:09,460
what is it that you want
Congress to keep in mind

925
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:12,893
as they think about trying
to craft this legislation.

926
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:16,530
Tonya, maybe do you wanna start that?

927
00:46:16,530 --> 00:46:17,363
- Sure.

928
00:46:17,363 --> 00:46:21,410
So I think we've seen a lot
of positive developments

929
00:46:21,410 --> 00:46:25,440
recently in terms of the
conversation around this.

930
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,620
We've seen some really helpful thoughts

931
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:30,210
from the Cyberspace Solarium Commission,

932
00:46:30,210 --> 00:46:31,920
which has been successful

933
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:34,890
in getting many of their recommendations

934
00:46:34,890 --> 00:46:39,009
taken up in legislation and
they continue to advocate

935
00:46:39,010 --> 00:46:40,890
for other of their recommendations,

936
00:46:40,890 --> 00:46:45,160
including the national
data breach reporting law,

937
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:48,920
as well as the type of incident
reporting we've discussed

938
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:51,240
related to critical infrastructure.

939
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:52,970
And, of course, since SolarWinds,

940
00:46:52,970 --> 00:46:54,830
we're seeing this greater conversation.

941
00:46:54,830 --> 00:46:57,569
So I think it's an important moment

942
00:46:57,570 --> 00:46:59,960
where an effort like this might succeed

943
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:02,110
where others have failed.

944
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:04,000
I think the important thing to emphasize

945
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,160
or an important thing to emphasize

946
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:09,470
is I think some may look at
this and say, well, that's great

947
00:47:09,470 --> 00:47:13,109
that this increased reporting
would tell you about things

948
00:47:13,110 --> 00:47:14,970
that happened after the fact.

949
00:47:14,970 --> 00:47:18,009
That's great for data collection
and looking at trends,

950
00:47:18,010 --> 00:47:20,950
but we really need to be
getting ahead of threats.

951
00:47:20,950 --> 00:47:22,790
I don't think it's an either/or.

952
00:47:22,790 --> 00:47:25,170
I think for a lot of the
reasons we've discussed

953
00:47:25,170 --> 00:47:26,810
on this panel today,

954
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:29,590
having this type of greater visibility

955
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:32,490
would not only enable
us to better understand

956
00:47:32,490 --> 00:47:36,149
what's happened, but would give
us clues that would help us

957
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:39,730
prevent additional harm from happening.

958
00:47:39,730 --> 00:47:42,930
These cyber incidents,
they're not one and done.

959
00:47:42,930 --> 00:47:46,370
They're often a series
with a series of victims

960
00:47:46,370 --> 00:47:49,690
and ongoing campaigns that
can last months and years,

961
00:47:49,690 --> 00:47:51,330
if they're not stopped.

962
00:47:51,330 --> 00:47:53,630
And so I don't think this should be looked

963
00:47:53,630 --> 00:47:57,180
at solely as an after the fact.

964
00:47:57,180 --> 00:48:00,330
Reporting this type of
information is really critical

965
00:48:00,330 --> 00:48:02,553
to helping us get ahead
of threats as well.

966
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:08,350
- Luke, do you wanna go next?

967
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:10,670
- Sure.

968
00:48:10,670 --> 00:48:12,430
I think we're at a...

969
00:48:12,430 --> 00:48:15,440
I agree with Tonya,
we've got some momentum.

970
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:20,440
People didn't really view
law enforcement, DOJ, FBI

971
00:48:21,390 --> 00:48:25,319
as terribly helpful when they
came to them some years ago

972
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:27,880
because information wasn't coming back,

973
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:30,710
threat intelligence wasn't coming out

974
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:33,550
and people really didn't understand

975
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:35,460
how they were viewed
when they came forward

976
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:37,763
to law enforcement and that's changed.

977
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:43,640
And it really is DOJ and FBI
Secret Service leadership

978
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:47,690
and now DHS playing a huge role as well

979
00:48:47,690 --> 00:48:50,010
that have spent a lot of time and effort

980
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:51,750
educating the private sector

981
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:54,200
on the value of coming forward.

982
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:56,520
I think not only is it beneficial

983
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:58,500
in the vast majority of cases

984
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:00,450
because of what you learn

985
00:49:00,450 --> 00:49:02,770
back in terms of foreign intelligence,

986
00:49:02,770 --> 00:49:07,130
but I think it's increasingly
expected by your stakeholders,

987
00:49:07,130 --> 00:49:11,063
your shareholders, your
board, your customers,

988
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:16,040
legislators, that they
expect that you try to do

989
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:19,830
everything you could by your
customers and came forward.

990
00:49:19,830 --> 00:49:22,799
The question is, how do
we go to the next step?

991
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:26,290
How do we deal with this
patchwork of state laws?

992
00:49:26,290 --> 00:49:27,860
Can we simplify that?

993
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:30,710
Can a federal structure or law do that?

994
00:49:30,710 --> 00:49:33,250
And how can we create incentives

995
00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:35,783
for even better investment
in cybersecurity?

996
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:42,670
- I think, yeah, the two
takeaways I'm getting

997
00:49:42,670 --> 00:49:46,360
are one from Tonya, which is this sells

998
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:48,410
if it feels like it has a preventative

999
00:49:48,410 --> 00:49:50,319
or prophylactic benefit.

1000
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:53,160
That if it's only about historical trends

1001
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:55,440
or understanding what's
happening on the internet,

1002
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,410
that's not gonna necessarily
be the value add.

1003
00:49:57,410 --> 00:50:00,509
But I think what you get
from this kind of reporting

1004
00:50:00,510 --> 00:50:03,830
that you may not get
from a broader program

1005
00:50:03,830 --> 00:50:06,790
of data collection by an
agency, like surveillance,

1006
00:50:06,790 --> 00:50:10,070
is you've got someone
raising their hand and saying

1007
00:50:10,070 --> 00:50:11,350
this is abnormal.

1008
00:50:11,350 --> 00:50:12,680
When you're collecting data

1009
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:14,549
and you're trying to hunt
for what the threat is,

1010
00:50:14,550 --> 00:50:15,870
you've got to filter that

1011
00:50:15,870 --> 00:50:18,200
and it's like an intrusion
detection system, right?

1012
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:20,609
It really only tells you
what you already know is bad,

1013
00:50:20,610 --> 00:50:23,930
whereas this kind of
reporting focuses you on,

1014
00:50:23,930 --> 00:50:24,870
makes it easier to find

1015
00:50:24,870 --> 00:50:26,980
when there's actually been
a breach that matters.

1016
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:30,240
And from Luke, there's
gotta be a way to make this

1017
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:33,060
so that you're not worse off
by sending the report in.

1018
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:33,893
Right?

1019
00:50:33,893 --> 00:50:35,033
It doesn't hurt you.

1020
00:50:36,110 --> 00:50:40,570
And that I think, in terms
of whatever regulation

1021
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:42,690
or whatever regulators
are gonna do in response,

1022
00:50:42,690 --> 00:50:45,080
this kind of report that we're asking for,

1023
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:46,860
you don't want it to be something

1024
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:48,650
that leaves you in a worse
position than you were.

1025
00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:50,620
That's the first rule of law enforcement

1026
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:53,020
when we report to a breach
is first, do no harm.

1027
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:54,150
And I think this kind of reporting

1028
00:50:54,150 --> 00:50:55,913
has to follow the same rule.

1029
00:50:58,220 --> 00:51:01,040
- Well, I think that takes us
to the end of our panel today.

1030
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:03,660
Thanks everyone for joining us.

1031
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:04,580
Great conversation.

1032
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:05,743
Thanks a lot.

1033
00:51:05,743 --> 00:51:07,660
- Thanks, Aruna.
- Thank you.

1034
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:08,660
- Thank you.
