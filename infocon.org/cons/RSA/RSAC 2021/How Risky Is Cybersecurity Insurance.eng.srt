1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:02,073
- Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:02,073 --> 00:00:03,040
Welcome to our

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,590
How Risky Is Cybersecurity
Insurance? briefing.

4
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:07,560
We're gonna do here today.

5
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,834
I'm John Pescatore with
the SANS Institute.

6
00:00:10,835 --> 00:00:14,260
- And I'm Ben Wright,
I'm a lawyer in Texas

7
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:19,200
and I teach LEG523 law of data security

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,753
and investigations course at SANS.

9
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:24,759
- So cybersecurity
insurance has certainly been

10
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,860
in the news recently.

11
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:27,970
A lot of ransomware attacks you see

12
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:30,299
on your screen have tended to drag it in,

13
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,900
but cybersecurity
insurance has been an issue

14
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:33,760
for a long time.

15
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,260
I've been at SANS eight years
before that, at Gartner,

16
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:38,519
I think it was as far back as 2005,

17
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,050
when I was working in things related

18
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:43,489
to cyber insurance in the major carriers.

19
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:46,670
So our goal here, Ben and
my goal for this session,

20
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:50,260
like all of SANS training is
to give you some information

21
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,330
and some background and
some things you can do.

22
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:55,000
So when you get back to work,
you can be an informed player.

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,720
You can work with your
company, making the decisions

24
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,820
on when cybersecurity does
or does not make sense

25
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:03,340
and how it relates to
the cybersecurity program

26
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:06,430
and what you can do to
sort of minimize the risk

27
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:08,410
to your company, overall, both the risk

28
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:10,899
of attackers causing
impact to your business,

29
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:11,760
but also the risk

30
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,042
of cyber insurance being
prohibitively expensive, based

31
00:01:15,042 --> 00:01:17,790
on the status of your security program.

32
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,403
So with that, let's get started.

33
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:25,083
- So one of the key stakeholders,

34
00:01:26,124 --> 00:01:27,490
who is interested

35
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:30,729
in cyber insurance at an enterprise

36
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:34,020
like a business is the
financial community.

37
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:37,259
When I say financial community
with respect to a business,

38
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:40,630
I mean investors like
shareholders, I mean lenders

39
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:45,630
like banks, and I mean, board
of directors and the ease

40
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:50,860
of stakeholders are not very
capable of evaluating security.

41
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:54,050
However, they understand insurance.

42
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:57,530
With insurance and institution
do some kind of a review,

43
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:01,410
which equals underwriting, it
evaluates the cyber hygiene

44
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:04,320
at the business and it makes a decision.

45
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,410
Okay, I'm going to take this risk.

46
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:10,669
I'm going to put money on
the table to take that risk.

47
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:12,791
From the point of view of
the financial community

48
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:15,433
as impactful that the
insurance company would say

49
00:02:15,433 --> 00:02:18,820
that it will put its own money
on the table to take the risk

50
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:21,709
with respect to some
kind of a cyber event.

51
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:25,452
And so, cyber insurance can
cover many different kinds

52
00:02:25,452 --> 00:02:28,820
of losses or expenses.

53
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,359
Cyber insurance often covers losses

54
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,470
like business interruption.

55
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:37,550
Oftentimes, cyber insurance
comes with services.

56
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:40,010
So those services can include forensics,

57
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:42,480
it can include incident response.

58
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,852
And today, increasingly,

59
00:02:45,808 --> 00:02:49,780
cyber insurance covers
ransomware explicitly

60
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,909
and provides for the negotiation

61
00:02:51,909 --> 00:02:56,662
of ransomware as well
as payment of the rants.

62
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:04,430
The kinds of coverages known

63
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:07,910
in insurance include what's
called first party coverage

64
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,280
and third party coverage.

65
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,280
The first party coverage
means the kinds of expenses

66
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,753
or losses that the insured
enterprise incurs directly

67
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,660
such as business interruption.

68
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:24,670
Third party losses
means covering some kind

69
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:28,530
of an expense that comes
from a third party.

70
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:32,900
An example would be a
regulator imposing a fine

71
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:37,070
on a business who has suffered
some kind of cyber crisis.

72
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:41,250
An important kind of
insurance in this field

73
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:46,020
as we think about ransomware
is traditional property

74
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:49,290
and casualty insurance

75
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:52,179
that's sold to businesses and enterprises.

76
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:55,410
So property and casualty
insurance traditionally

77
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:58,870
covers a lot of different property losses

78
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:01,230
as well as extortion.

79
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:03,239
And up until recently,

80
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:06,722
a lot of the insurance
companies were interpreting

81
00:04:06,722 --> 00:04:08,750
their traditional property

82
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:12,890
and casualty policies to cover ransomware.

83
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:17,890
However, NotPetya was so damaging
to the insurance industry

84
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,990
that the insurance industry
has changed its mind.

85
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:25,150
So the insurance industry says

86
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:29,789
that it lost globally, $2.7 billion

87
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:31,430
because of NotPetya.

88
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:35,130
And they decided that NotPetya
has demonstrated to us

89
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:37,980
that ransomware is a whole new ball game

90
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:42,850
and it's not traditional
damaged property and extortion.

91
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:46,790
So increasingly, insurance companies are

92
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:50,600
changing their policies and
they're changing the policy

93
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,720
as they renew an existing policy

94
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,470
to explicitly part out ransomware

95
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:58,410
and say ransomware is not covered

96
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:00,350
by traditional property and casualty.

97
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:01,993
If you want ransomware coverage,

98
00:05:01,993 --> 00:05:04,890
they have to buy it
specifically as a special rider

99
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:07,893
or a special bond policy
and pay for it special.

100
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:12,400
- So Ben just talked a lot
about the sort of benefits

101
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,859
that come with cyber insurance.

102
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,250
We want you also to be aware of the cost

103
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,570
and there's two types of cost.

104
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:19,370
One is what you pay for the policy.

105
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:20,590
So if you ever gone to a restaurant

106
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:22,760
and felt like having
a nice lobster dinner,

107
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,940
you probably saw the
menu saying market priced

108
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:28,144
because who knows how many
lobsters they caught that day

109
00:05:28,144 --> 00:05:30,150
or that time of month or that year,

110
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:32,890
you can see the pricing is really variable

111
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:35,270
in what lobsters cost and
on a day-to-day basis,

112
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:38,142
it can fluctuate wildly
that's market pricing.

113
00:05:38,142 --> 00:05:40,960
When there's not stable
dynamics in a market,

114
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,659
we have market pricing and
the prices change everyday.

115
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:47,039
That's sort of what the
case is for cyber insurance.

116
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,670
It's essentially market price.

117
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:51,040
I tried to pull together some data points

118
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,125
in late 2020 and the
first quarter of 2021.

119
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:55,623
And the 5 you see on there,

120
00:05:55,623 --> 00:05:57,830
the documented public ones I could find,

121
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,620
I've got to walk through a
couple of case studies later,

122
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:02,970
we'll do a little drill down
in sort of similar space.

123
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:05,290
But you see here, this
has two smaller companies,

124
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:08,680
sort of the lower left of this
curve that had a $1 million

125
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,260
and $2 million policies that were only

126
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:13,813
in the fifteen to thirty
thousand dollar range

127
00:06:13,814 --> 00:06:15,580
for that amount of coverage.

128
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:18,789
And then, you see to the
far right, larger companies

129
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:21,420
that had bigger policy
coverages of 10 million

130
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,050
and you see the dots are spaced out.

131
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,000
You see the one dot in the middle,

132
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,970
which was sort of a medium-sized company

133
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:28,920
and using my advanced
machine learning skills

134
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,460
and doing curve fitting.

135
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,200
I drew that red line,

136
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,060
which if you take that red
line is one of two things.

137
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,430
If you take that red line where it is,

138
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:41,640
we end up with on the
range of 12.5K per million.

139
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,950
But if you see that arrow,
that's where the prices have gone

140
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,580
at the high-end here more recently.

141
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,099
And you'll see in one of
the examples I use later,

142
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,015
much higher for large companies is,

143
00:06:51,015 --> 00:06:54,580
as Ben mentioned, NotPetya hit
some really large companies

144
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:58,219
with $300 million plus
exposures of several,

145
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,130
at least two of them that were made public

146
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:02,803
and larger companies
generally have more computers

147
00:07:02,803 --> 00:07:05,440
that get hit, it's more
expensive to remediate.

148
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,870
They have larger customer counts,

149
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,750
so the costs are astronomical

150
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,630
for these incidents that really
sweep across a big company

151
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:14,560
either disrupting its
revenue or impacting tens

152
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,070
of millions of customers or in real cases,

153
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:19,040
hundreds of millions of customers.

154
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:23,580
So the out-of-pocket cost
in two things is kind

155
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,200
of unpredictable stabilizing
a little bit here

156
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,880
over the past couple of years,
but it's not insignificant

157
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,740
for large companies.

158
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,860
For small companies, it
may be sort of simple.

159
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:33,693
Let's do it.

160
00:07:33,693 --> 00:07:35,430
Let's hope it's like
backing up our hard drive.

161
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,050
If we back up the hard drive,

162
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:38,220
the computer never crashes.

163
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,940
If we're getting insurance,
we'll never need it,

164
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:40,780
that's small companies.

165
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:43,066
With large companies, it's
a significant expense.

166
00:07:43,066 --> 00:07:46,020
And it's a decision to
divert company resources

167
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,940
towards paying the bill for insurance.

168
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,120
And you're going to see
Ben and I harp on a couple

169
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:50,953
of things here

170
00:07:50,953 --> 00:07:53,700
throughout this one key thing
I always bring up is spending

171
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:54,860
on cyber insurance

172
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:58,410
doesn't reduce anything the
security program has to do.

173
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:01,170
We still have to do all
the same security things

174
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:02,790
to protect the company.

175
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:03,623
The spending

176
00:08:03,623 --> 00:08:07,140
on cybersecurity insurance
does not replace any of that.

177
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,940
So that's sort of the out-of-pocket cost.

178
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:09,773
Let Ben drill down.

179
00:08:09,773 --> 00:08:13,003
And so sort of the impacts and
costs of the security team.

180
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,940
- So one of the really important things

181
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:21,030
for a security team to bear in mind

182
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:25,840
as it's working with
insurance is tell the truth.

183
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,330
Now that's kind of odd.

184
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:28,659
The lawyer says, "Tell the truth."

185
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:31,750
That's so obvious, but telling the truth

186
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,799
to an insurance company with respect

187
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:36,640
to a very complex technical topic

188
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,610
like cybersecurity can be a challenge.

189
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:43,090
And so, during the review process,

190
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:48,090
before issuing the policy,
the insurance company goes

191
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,400
through what it calls underwriting

192
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,560
and it may give you a questionnaire,

193
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,150
it may send someone to come

194
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:57,350
and talk to you and audit you and so on.

195
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:00,940
And if the insurance
company believes later,

196
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:05,700
after you have a crisis like ransomware

197
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,420
that you didn't tell the truth,

198
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,020
during the underwriting process,

199
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:11,520
then the insurance
company may deny coverage,

200
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,480
or it may reduce coverage.

201
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,420
Another place where this need

202
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,025
for telling the truth happens is

203
00:09:17,025 --> 00:09:18,870
during the incident itself.

204
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:21,010
As you're interacting, you're interfacing

205
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:22,520
with the insurance company

206
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,870
with its people and its investigators.

207
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,610
You want to be making sure,

208
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:30,520
I really am telling the full details here

209
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,610
rather than just a cursory overview

210
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:35,110
or something that we didn't
review very carefully.

211
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:40,110
And then, so it can be easy
in the heat of the moment not

212
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:42,050
to be really careful

213
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:44,780
about what you say to the
cyber insurance company

214
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:47,860
about what we were doing
or what was breached

215
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:50,360
or how the breach
happened to work or so on.

216
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:54,500
And therefore, the security team needs

217
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,080
to be thinking carefully about

218
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,400
how do we choose our words
when we answer questions

219
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,930
from the insurance company?

220
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:04,390
So for example, the insurance company

221
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:05,577
may say something like,

222
00:10:05,577 --> 00:10:09,200
"Do you install patches
normally in 30 days?"

223
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,270
And it might be easy 'cause
you're busy, you just say yes,

224
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,103
but the truth is

225
00:10:13,103 --> 00:10:15,680
maybe it's a really a
lot more complex process

226
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,859
in your organization.

227
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:20,800
And maybe a more accurate statement is

228
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,719
that you have a professional
team that reviews patches

229
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,950
and then, goes through a risk assessment

230
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:30,960
and then, makes decisions based

231
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,410
on a responsible review
of a risk assessment.

232
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:37,660
Maybe something like that
is a more accurate statement

233
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,390
than just quickly say, "Guess what?

234
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:42,280
We normally install
patches within 30 days."

235
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:47,280
Another practical aspect of
involving a cyber insurer

236
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,830
in a ransomware event is

237
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:56,220
that the insurance
company cones with people.

238
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,610
People start getting
involved with your incident.

239
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:03,800
And particularly in ransomware event,

240
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:08,650
the insurer's staff gets directly involved

241
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:11,329
in answering a technical problem.

242
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:14,720
The technical problem is,
are we gonna pay ransom

243
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,990
or are we not gonna pay ransom?

244
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:20,690
And so there's a hinge point there,

245
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:24,472
a pivot point for the
enterprise and therefore,

246
00:11:24,472 --> 00:11:29,069
the security game and
executive management has

247
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:31,580
to be working with these different people,

248
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:35,350
who are helping the insurance
company make decisions.

249
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:37,180
And so other people that might be involved

250
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:40,060
from the insurance company's team

251
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,770
could include the insurance company

252
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:43,410
to own investigators,

253
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:47,730
as well as a payment compliance expert.

254
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:48,830
We'll talk in a couple of minutes

255
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:52,120
about why this payment
compliance expert needs

256
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,080
to be involved,

257
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,030
but the rich wider number of people,

258
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:58,030
who might be new and extra

259
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:01,339
that you have to deal with
in an incident response.

260
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,350
And actually the fact

261
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:04,850
that so many new people
have to participate

262
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:07,930
in incident response
could actually detract

263
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:10,239
from the value of having that insurance

264
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,020
because it's just incident
response just becomes more

265
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:16,244
of a bureaucratic process that it would be

266
00:12:16,244 --> 00:12:20,533
without the insurance company
there in a ransomware event.

267
00:12:22,161 --> 00:12:24,040
- I think Ben brought out
an important point here.

268
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:27,079
Many mature security
programs have playbooks

269
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,440
for incident response
to be able to do things

270
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,750
in a repeatable way and keep them updated.

271
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,780
And many security programs learn

272
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:37,160
to have a communications playbook,

273
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,410
how to deal with the press?

274
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:40,338
how to deal with corporate
marketing and communications

275
00:12:40,338 --> 00:12:42,770
and who needs to make decisions

276
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:44,920
along the way about
communicating an incident?

277
00:12:44,921 --> 00:12:46,180
I think it's almost

278
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:48,020
like you need to have a playbook like this

279
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,829
for dealing with the
insurance companies each year,

280
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:50,740
when they're doing these type

281
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,890
of audits to make sure
you're doing the right thing.

282
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:56,069
'Cause if you think about
it, an inaccurate answer may

283
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:59,001
or may not cause them
to deny you insurance,

284
00:12:59,001 --> 00:13:02,069
but it could cause them to
deny you payment afterwards,

285
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:06,260
if they find out this is
not accurate response.

286
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,990
So playbooks for this or
incident response playbooks

287
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:11,730
including this, I think is a great point.

288
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:13,090
So let's do a little drill down

289
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:14,980
on ransomware in particular now.

290
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,010
So it certainly seemed really different

291
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:18,140
when ransomware broke in,

292
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:21,060
it was really just a back
almost 10 years ago now,

293
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,209
when we first started to see them,

294
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:25,420
it was pretty much a denial
of service attack, right?

295
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:28,267
They would capture your files
and maybe your executables

296
00:13:28,268 --> 00:13:30,823
and essentially you could not do business.

297
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:34,050
But it also included this very sexy thing

298
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:36,160
of ransom and extortion demand,

299
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,310
which immediately caused
chief legal counsels

300
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:39,142
and others to say,

301
00:13:39,143 --> 00:13:40,290
"Wait a minute, we have coverage,

302
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:42,380
if one of our executives is kidnapped,

303
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:44,620
we have ransom coverage."

304
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:47,540
Also denial of service, we
may be one of the companies.

305
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,060
We know what our downtime costs.

306
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:51,000
When the manufacturing lines down,

307
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,260
when we can't deliver the
packages or ship the goods,

308
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,460
we have a good handle

309
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:57,520
on cost of downtime versus
breaches, which were-

310
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,790
Well, what is the real cost,

311
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,731
if our customer information gets out?

312
00:14:00,731 --> 00:14:02,860
So since ransomware was kind of exciting

313
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:05,760
and included the sexy stuff about ransom

314
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,689
and encryption and Bitcoin
was floating around in there,

315
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:09,940
got a lot of press coverage

316
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:12,580
and sort of caused a
lot of interest in this.

317
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,960
Well, insurance will pay for all that.

318
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,793
And as Ben said,

319
00:14:14,793 --> 00:14:15,803
that's already starting to change.

320
00:14:15,803 --> 00:14:19,930
One key thing, one of the
compliance regimes, HIPAA,

321
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:22,170
the Healthcare Information Portability

322
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:24,949
and Accountability Act in the US,

323
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:28,520
early on said, ransomware
counts as a breach

324
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,949
because if you lost control

325
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:32,050
of people's personal health information,

326
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:34,819
such that the attackers could
encrypt it, it was breached.

327
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:37,790
You lost control of it
just because they chose not

328
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:40,010
to expose it, doesn't change the fact

329
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:41,300
that you lost control of it.

330
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,050
And that's what the regulations say.

331
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:45,130
Now, many more compliance
regimes are starting

332
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:46,680
to have that same interpretation.

333
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:50,390
Basically, if the attackers
could get the critical data

334
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,360
and encrypt it,

335
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,820
they could also breach it
and increasingly today,

336
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,180
we're seeing them do both in the past six

337
00:14:56,180 --> 00:15:00,847
to nine months, really
most of 2020 and 2021, most

338
00:15:00,847 --> 00:15:03,819
of the ransomware attacks, if
you said, we're not paying,

339
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,870
they started exposing your information

340
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:06,927
or you might've paid for it

341
00:15:06,927 --> 00:15:08,180
and they got them running again.

342
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,260
Then they said, "Well,
now you need to pay,

343
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:11,160
so we don't expose the information."

344
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,410
So the bottom line is ransomware
attacks are just the same

345
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:17,199
as breaches from how
expensive they can be,

346
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,030
how complicated they can be

347
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:21,350
and how they really need to be avoided

348
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:24,150
versus hope that something's
going to pay for it all.

349
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:24,983
So that's just the

350
00:15:24,983 --> 00:15:27,756
sorta ransomware did
bring some unique aspects,

351
00:15:27,756 --> 00:15:28,939
but in reality,

352
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:31,943
it's just another malware
or a security incident.

353
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,268
- So a common comment I hear

354
00:15:37,268 --> 00:15:42,268
from a professional incident
responders on ransomware is

355
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:46,760
that the insured enterprise
oftentimes is surprised,

356
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:49,920
once they get into the incident.

357
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,839
Exactly, what does their insurance cover

358
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,270
and what does it not cover?

359
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:57,900
And that motivates the
security team, as well

360
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,920
as the executives to
think about all of this

361
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:04,189
in advance and try to
understand what coverage

362
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:07,789
do we actually have, so
that we're not surprised,

363
00:16:07,789 --> 00:16:11,800
when we're in the heat of the incident.

364
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:15,660
There are stories where the negotiations

365
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,540
between the insurance company

366
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:22,540
and the insured enterprise
can be kind of surprising

367
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:26,700
and testing over whether to pay ransom

368
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,980
or whether not to pay a ransom.

369
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:32,150
So the insurance company
oftentimes has a policy

370
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:34,520
that says we will pay a ransom,

371
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:38,829
but we'll also make them the
cost of business interruption.

372
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:43,830
And the insurance company
can decide a ransom is likely

373
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:47,150
to be lower than the cost
of business interruption,

374
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:49,030
if the enterprise tries to recover

375
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:52,199
from ACA and therefore, there are stories

376
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,710
of insurance companies putting pressure

377
00:16:55,710 --> 00:17:00,050
on the insured enterprise to
go ahead and pay the ransom.

378
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:01,060
Now, the insurance companies

379
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:03,250
will make very clear final decision

380
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:07,730
whether to pay ransom lies
with the insured enterprise.

381
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:12,230
Nevertheless, the insurance
company is looking at all

382
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:14,319
of that ransom pay that
I think I can negotiate

383
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:17,179
that down to something
that's not that large.

384
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,470
And it's gonna be a lot less

385
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:21,066
than all the business
interruption of trying to recover

386
00:17:21,066 --> 00:17:25,430
from a backup or some
other kind of recovery.

387
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:30,060
And so the insurance
company might now gently

388
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:30,893
say something like,

389
00:17:30,893 --> 00:17:32,910
"You know, you got a million dollars

390
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:36,320
of coverage for recovering

391
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,980
business interruption.

392
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,150
Ah, I think you made some mistakes.

393
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:47,660
And I think that's why you
would suffer ransomware."

394
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:50,510
So I'm gonna argue, you're not entitled

395
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:53,790
to so much harborage for
business interruption.

396
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:56,530
And therefore, you better just go ahead

397
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:59,530
and agree to pay the ransomware

398
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:01,610
and let me reimburse you for that.

399
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:03,320
And that might not be

400
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:07,460
in the best interest or desires
of the insured enterprise.

401
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,980
Each insured enterprise
may not want to pay ransom.

402
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:12,080
It may not like the
publicity of paying ransom.

403
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,530
It may not like politics

404
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:16,889
or the morality paying ransom,

405
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:18,050
but the insurance company

406
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:19,655
may have a little different priority

407
00:18:19,655 --> 00:18:23,220
and that may come as a surprise
to the insured enterprise.

408
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:26,425
Another complexity around paying ransom

409
00:18:26,425 --> 00:18:30,450
is the United States Treasury
Department has recently

410
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:33,470
re-emphasized something
that the insurance companies

411
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:37,207
have always known, but there's
now more scrutiny on that.

412
00:18:37,207 --> 00:18:41,550
And that is that there
are many organizations

413
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:43,270
like terrorist organizations

414
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:46,960
and known hacker groups
who have been sanctioned

415
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,700
by the United States government.

416
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:51,420
And when the government
imposes sanctions it says

417
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:54,840
and American business like
the insured enterprise

418
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:58,320
like the insurance company
may not do business

419
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,960
with these sanctioned entities.

420
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:03,740
And therefore, before the
insurance company can participate

421
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:06,130
in the payment of ransom, it has to check

422
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:09,250
with the Office of Foreign Asset Control

423
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,780
of the United States Treasury

424
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:14,490
see if they can figure out who
they're doing business with,

425
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:16,910
who they're trying to get
to try to pay the ransom to.

426
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:18,410
And whether that party is

427
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:23,050
on the disfavored sanctioned parties list.

428
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:24,629
That's like difficult

429
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,080
and challenging type of problem

430
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:31,080
and raises an additional
layer of in effect, red tape

431
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:34,980
for reaching the final conclusion

432
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,840
that we're gonna pay ransomware.

433
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,740
From the security team's
perspective, it means

434
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:41,845
"We need to be working multiple layers

435
00:19:41,845 --> 00:19:45,640
of a resolution to this at the same time."

436
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,950
Maybe we're going to pay ransom,

437
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:48,940
but maybe the insurance company will have

438
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,210
to pull out at the last minute,

439
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:52,020
maybe we will recover

440
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,843
from the backup or something else.

441
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:56,970
- So yeah, some of this reminds me back

442
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:59,900
to lobsters and market pricing,
because less than a year,

443
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:03,250
before that OFAC Advisory,
the FBI had actually come out

444
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,710
and said, "Well, it's up to the business

445
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:07,600
to make the risk decision
about paying off or not."

446
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,350
Whereas for decades, standard
law enforcement advice

447
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:13,399
was do not pay kidnappers,
do not pay them off.

448
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,725
So the guidance at the top

449
00:20:15,725 --> 00:20:17,530
and the law enforcement part is changing

450
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:19,710
about as rapidly as the pricing.

451
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:21,300
So let me do a couple of drill down

452
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,120
on some case studies
here that I picked out

453
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,669
and I tried to do a little
bit of numerical analysis on.

454
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:28,330
So the first one is a small company,

455
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:32,409
less than 500 employees and the
revenue range you see there.

456
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:34,600
They were- had a phishing attack where one

457
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,139
of their users fell for a phishing email,

458
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,230
even though they did
the usual phish training

459
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:40,660
and all that good stuff

460
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:44,190
and that person got their PC compromised.

461
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:45,870
The bad guys had control of it.

462
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:46,703
They were able to go

463
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:50,030
through that person's email
and they found a spreadsheet

464
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:52,570
and that spreadsheet had
the personal information

465
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:55,100
of 28,000 customers, didn't
have credit card numbers

466
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:55,933
or bank numbers,

467
00:20:55,933 --> 00:20:58,850
wasn't really one of those
type of financial incidents,

468
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:01,490
but it had telephone
number company, all kinds

469
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:04,200
of information that could be
used for all kinds of fraud.

470
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,580
And this company took it seriously,

471
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,080
their obligation to their customers.

472
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,429
So they really wanted to go fully

473
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:11,960
in protecting their customers.

474
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,793
Now it turns out

475
00:21:12,793 --> 00:21:15,379
this small company did have
a cyber insurance policy.

476
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:17,973
It was 2 million in coverage
with a $25,000 deductible

477
00:21:17,973 --> 00:21:21,312
that cost them $14,000 when they paid it.

478
00:21:22,321 --> 00:21:25,330
As they cleaned up this
incident and notified customers

479
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:26,163
and did everything,

480
00:21:26,163 --> 00:21:28,267
they had about little under
one and a half million,

481
00:21:28,267 --> 00:21:31,210
1.4 million of invoiceable cost charges

482
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:33,380
from third party consultant firms

483
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,420
or other things where they had hard cost,

484
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,000
where they had to spend money,

485
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,060
but they had roughly equal to that,

486
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:41,129
if not, a little more of internal cost

487
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:42,950
of people's time and other things that had

488
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:45,455
to be done to clean up
and mitigate the cost

489
00:21:45,455 --> 00:21:48,010
to make sure this could not happen again.

490
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:49,720
Now, let me repeat that, part of the cost

491
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:53,220
of an incident is making
sure it doesn't happen again.

492
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,080
It's not, "Oh, good.

493
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,169
The next time it happens,
we'll get paid again."

494
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:58,590
So when you look at this particular choice

495
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:01,020
for this small company, they spent

496
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,450
about 3 million of the-

497
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:04,900
The damage was 3 million.

498
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,640
The deductible was 25,000.

499
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,340
There was a 14K premium.

500
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,756
So they essentially spent 3.039 million

501
00:22:10,757 --> 00:22:13,430
and they could've gotten back 1.4 million.

502
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:16,330
They still would have a cost
exposure of over 1.6 million

503
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:17,163
after this,

504
00:22:17,163 --> 00:22:18,190
even after paying insurance.

505
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:21,023
This company actually
decided not to make a claim.

506
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:22,783
They felt

507
00:22:22,783 --> 00:22:25,370
that they should've protected themselves

508
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:26,770
against this anyway.

509
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:29,020
They also were afraid their
insurance would get canceled.

510
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:31,190
And if something else
happened, they'd be covered.

511
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:33,150
So they actually did not
even make a claim here.

512
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:34,170
Which many of us,

513
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:36,250
I have a daughter who
made me be very friendly

514
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:37,450
with auto repair companies

515
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:39,130
and as many times, I didn't make a claim

516
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:41,150
when she smashed into things.

517
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:42,570
So what I used to do at Gartner

518
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:46,929
and I did here was always,
it was estimate, okay.

519
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:49,530
How much would it have
cost you to avoid this?

520
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:51,300
So in this case, it turns out,

521
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,139
they were using Outlook 365

522
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,740
and there had been a update

523
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,340
in the critical security controls

524
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,780
or what are called the templates

525
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,920
for how to do Outlook 365 securely.

526
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,753
In this case,

527
00:23:00,753 --> 00:23:03,399
what the bad guys did was
insert a forwarding rule

528
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,920
in this person's email.

529
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,180
So in the spreadsheet, once you send it

530
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,730
to the intended recipient,

531
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:10,150
it also sent it to the bad guys

532
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:11,990
and she didn't notice.

533
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:14,530
But there's ways to prevent
external connections

534
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:15,930
from changing those forwarding rules.

535
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:18,400
Basic, as you know, the equivalent
of group policy objects.

536
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,830
If they had done a pen test
that would have found that path

537
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:22,878
and found that they were
behind in the latest guidance,

538
00:23:22,878 --> 00:23:25,949
they would have avoided this
attack and roughly, you know,

539
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:27,250
figure a couple of man month

540
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:30,180
or so and throw the costs in 125K

541
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:33,270
and more than the cost of
the policy for that year.

542
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:35,470
But even with that cost one, one tenth

543
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:37,570
of what it cost them
to have that incident.

544
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:39,327
Now, if they really wanted
to go further and say,

545
00:23:39,327 --> 00:23:40,730
"Well, yeah, that was this incident."

546
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:42,384
But there's other phishing attacks

547
00:23:42,384 --> 00:23:43,934
and ransomware attacks and things

548
00:23:43,934 --> 00:23:47,950
that don't use just voting
rules and Office 365 things,

549
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:51,040
we could easily close the holes around.

550
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,110
But what if we went to
two-factor authentication?

551
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:54,300
So everybody for their email,

552
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,240
it could just be a reusable password.

553
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,300
If somebody got phished

554
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,899
and the attacker know had their password

555
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,850
with two-factor
authentication, we'd be safe.

556
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:03,310
Well, everybody, we all
know that's more expensive.

557
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:05,620
It's not that expensive
for small companies

558
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,939
from a hardware point of
view and installation point

559
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:11,440
of view with cell phones, text
messaging, the cell phones.

560
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,570
There's hardly any cost when
you get right down to it.

561
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:15,139
It's really annoying.

562
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:15,973
We just used to be,

563
00:24:15,973 --> 00:24:18,040
"We can't get users to
stand though, to do that.

564
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,030
They'll never do that.

565
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:20,240
They'll scream at us.

566
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,830
The CEO will tell us to stop."

567
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:23,520
Of course, most people
at home are doing that

568
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,490
for their bank accounts now already

569
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:26,720
and they're doing it for PayPal

570
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,520
and they're doing it for Venmo
two-factor authentication.

571
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,440
So it's not that hard to get done

572
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,550
that would've caused I'm
being a little optimistic

573
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:34,383
in 150K,

574
00:24:34,383 --> 00:24:36,780
but say it would have
been 250K, still cheaper

575
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:39,050
than what they spent
on that first incident.

576
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:42,220
And still let's say, raise
it up to 5 to 10 years

577
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:44,730
of the premium, yet they
were protected forever.

578
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:46,750
So this is small company example

579
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,250
and sometimes it's easier to talk

580
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:51,920
about the solutions cost avoid
and things that don't scale.

581
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,110
Let's look at a public one.

582
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:55,709
This was a very public here in the,

583
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:58,390
where I live, I'm in the
Baltimore, Maryland area.

584
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:01,520
So back in May 19, 2019, the city

585
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,530
of Baltimore had a major ransomware event

586
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:05,420
that shut them down completely.

587
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,911
Schools and other parts across the city,

588
00:25:07,911 --> 00:25:10,410
tax payment and traffic revenue

589
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:13,330
and all that kind of stuff
was over 10,000 computers.

590
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:17,194
And the demand was for 13 Bitcoins,

591
00:25:17,194 --> 00:25:19,389
where'd they get these numbers sometimes?

592
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:23,410
Back then, a Bitcoin was worth
a measly $5,000 (laughs).

593
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:24,500
Now Bitcoin, I don't have any idea,

594
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,730
I meant to check before we did
this, what it's worth today.

595
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:30,993
But when I did the slide,
13 Bitcoins is like $650,000

596
00:25:30,993 --> 00:25:32,750
that was the ransom demand.

597
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:34,870
The city said we don't
pay no stinking ransom.

598
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:36,919
They were not going to pay the ransom.

599
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,400
So they suffered through the incident.

600
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,370
It took weeks, several weeks to recover.

601
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:43,729
Their hard cost estimates were much

602
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:44,720
of it was invoiceable

603
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,990
because they did not have

604
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:48,400
that much internal security expertise

605
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,780
that it cost them 10 million
to get things back up

606
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:52,670
and running and to mitigate the problems

607
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:54,750
that enabled the ransomware demand.

608
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:56,970
And then, they came up with an estimate.

609
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:58,960
Remember, there's a city,

610
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,600
which you know, county/city
in Maryland, Baltimore

611
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:06,159
that there was $8 million
in lost or delayed revenue.

612
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,660
Now that's some of that you
could point to hard cost.

613
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:11,040
Some of it's delayed
revenue, you might end up.

614
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,790
Well, we don't pay for delayed revenue,

615
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:14,889
it was been talked about
there's lots of exclusions

616
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:16,930
and terminology and so on.

617
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:17,830
But basically,

618
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:19,760
they just figured this cost them

619
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,580
about $20 million, this incident.

620
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:25,560
So the decision was made at the CIO level

621
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:29,379
and at the state board of
directors of regents level

622
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,990
and all that kind of stuff
to obtain cyber insurance,

623
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:33,870
in case this was to happen again.

624
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:38,600
So for 2020, for $800,000 or
the $1 million deductible,

625
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:42,639
they got the $20 million
cyber insurance policy

626
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,440
and had no problems that year.

627
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,470
See if you get insurance,

628
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:47,100
it's like backing up
your hard (laughs) drive.

629
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,290
Pay for the insurance,
nothing bad happens.

630
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:50,123
The next year,

631
00:26:50,123 --> 00:26:52,960
even though they had nothing
bad happened the year before,

632
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,434
lots of things that happened in 2020.

633
00:26:55,434 --> 00:26:59,210
So for 2021, the premium
went up to 950,000,

634
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:00,980
almost a 20% increase

635
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:03,560
for the same amount of coverage
and the same deductible.

636
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:06,483
So notice that the deductible,
the $1 million deductible,

637
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:08,980
you'd have to have a major incident

638
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:11,460
for you to break that.

639
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,810
And if you did all that
mitigation beforehand

640
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:16,090
and if you're able to institutionalize,

641
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:17,929
whether we went to
two-factor authentication

642
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:19,677
or we're going to do a pen test every year

643
00:27:19,677 --> 00:27:22,003
and we're going to keep
ourselves more secure.

644
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:24,639
You start looking at,

645
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,260
well, how much would it have
cost to totally avoid this

646
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:31,430
and harden ourselves such
that this particular level

647
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:33,490
of attack, not saying you'd be invincible,

648
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:36,060
but for this level of
sophistication and this sort

649
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:39,210
of phishing-driven attack,
how could we avoid it?

650
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:40,490
In my rough estimate

651
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:43,560
between 3 and 5 million
dollars, not insignificant

652
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:46,659
for an agency this size,
that many computers.

653
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:49,880
So if you look at that, that's
three to five years worth

654
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:53,280
of payment of the premiums they're paying.

655
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,290
So, you know, I don't know about you,

656
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:57,120
but I make a lot of my
decisions on the payback period.

657
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,320
You know, if I make an investment,

658
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,179
how long does it take
to pay back the cost,

659
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,520
whether it's, you know,
replacing a car or whatever.

660
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,510
So in many of these things,

661
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:06,813
you start seeing a five-year
less payback period.

662
00:28:08,309 --> 00:28:09,240
You're going to start to be able

663
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,890
to convince board of directors.

664
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:14,370
Now we can do this, and this
will be cheaper in the long run

665
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:17,169
that obtaining this
level of cyber insurance,

666
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:19,345
maybe can I obtain a
lower level or something,

667
00:28:19,345 --> 00:28:22,220
but a part of what we can do in security

668
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:25,380
to avoid incidents has to
be part of the discussion.

669
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,460
We have to be able to provide that level

670
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,660
of information and be part

671
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:31,823
of the discussion around obtaining
cyber insurance policies.

672
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:36,290
So there's some other
things to think about.

673
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:38,560
These, there's not very good
data out here on any of these.

674
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,720
I've tried to collect this
data for several years.

675
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,553
It's hard.

676
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:43,690
So to kind of think that well, you pay

677
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:46,050
and they can still go ahead
and just keep your money

678
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:49,110
or then do the breach
that seems to occur maybe

679
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:52,149
to 20%, 30% of the time at most.

680
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:54,260
So paying generally in the majority

681
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:57,760
of time does preclude more
damage, but not always,

682
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,800
but you know, the other theory I've seen

683
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:02,230
in other areas is you get
put on the stupid list.

684
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:03,260
Hey, they fell for it.

685
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:04,093
They got attacked.

686
00:29:04,093 --> 00:29:04,926
Then say, let's hit,

687
00:29:04,926 --> 00:29:06,610
let somebody else is gonna hit you later.

688
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:08,699
Really trying to find that out, 10 to 20%,

689
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,710
not that off all that often.

690
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:13,080
So these are things we'd
like to hold down security

691
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,419
that may or may not
really be true factors.

692
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,460
Will your insurance pay for ransom?

693
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,850
Ben's got through most of that.

694
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:20,139
So bottom line, when I want to leave

695
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:22,330
before we start reaching the end

696
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:23,852
with the recommendations,

697
00:29:23,853 --> 00:29:26,360
you will have to fix the problems.

698
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,530
You have to spend the
same in cybersecurity,

699
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:29,660
no matter what.

700
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:32,250
You're not, cybersecurity
does not cap things.

701
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:33,083
It's not like homeowner's insurance,

702
00:29:33,083 --> 00:29:36,190
where you get replacement
value merely reduces the cost

703
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:38,880
of an incident by a fixed amount.

704
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,830
And you will still be liable,

705
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:43,740
if you're doing stupid
things and you get breached,

706
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:47,130
you don't leave the chicken
salad, the egg salad out

707
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:49,070
in the picnic overnight, and
then eat it the next morning.

708
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:51,010
Even if you have
something to help you deal

709
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:53,133
with the food poisoning you're gonna get.

710
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:57,050
So, let me walk through
some sorta get back

711
00:29:57,050 --> 00:29:58,399
to work and then we'll get Ben

712
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,450
to sum up sort of really key point here.

713
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:03,080
SANS is always when you take our course,

714
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,780
what can you do when you get back

715
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:07,830
to work the next day and
RSA has added this sort

716
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:09,750
of next month, six month look as well.

717
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:12,140
So the very first thing is
understand, where's your company?

718
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,980
How does your company make
decisions about insurance?

719
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:16,930
Is it the chief legal
officer, finance officer,

720
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:19,150
CEO, operations officer, be part of that.

721
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,290
Security should be involved

722
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:22,879
in that, understand existing coverages

723
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,540
and be part of any decisions

724
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:25,659
around cybersecurity

725
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:27,420
or any of those other
policies Ben mentioned

726
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:29,050
that might cover things.

727
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:30,440
Get that point across

728
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:33,490
to the people, making those
decisions, cybersecurity,

729
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:37,080
cyber insurance can only
reduce the cost, not cap it.

730
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,587
Then I think equally important is to say,

731
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:41,690
"Are we really capable of self-insurance?"

732
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:44,100
Can I stand up and say, "Here's our gaps,

733
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,429
if we close those gaps and
here's how long it'll take

734
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:47,960
and roughly what it will cost."

735
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:51,180
I believe we can avoid
these common incidents.

736
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:52,370
And then, we only use insurance

737
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:54,719
for what it's meant for, uncommon things,

738
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,420
not everyday occurrences
that might happen to us

739
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:58,810
'cause we were below the level

740
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:01,270
of due diligence or due care.

741
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:02,860
In the long run, you know,

742
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:05,167
it's a jump-starting opportunity to say,

743
00:31:05,167 --> 00:31:06,199
"Boy, you know, I've been looking

744
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,790
for a way to sneak in
two-factor authentication.

745
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:09,623
This is it.

746
00:31:09,623 --> 00:31:10,630
This is how we can get it in."

747
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:13,970
If we can say, getting past ransomware,

748
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:15,630
getting past phishing will enable us

749
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:16,850
to avoid all these costs

750
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:18,790
and incidents in cybersecurity insurance.

751
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:19,947
Here's my chance.

752
00:31:20,911 --> 00:31:21,870
And a great way to do that.

753
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:23,370
To work with senior management boards

754
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:26,223
or CEOs is to do a tabletop exercise.

755
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:32,750
- Tabletop exercise
enables the security team

756
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:36,350
to think through carefully,
how's this all going

757
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:41,060
to play out, when we do have
that ransomware incident?

758
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:46,060
And important part of thinking
things through is come

759
00:31:46,511 --> 00:31:48,629
to know the insurance team.

760
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:49,800
As I've mentioned before,

761
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:53,180
the insurer is gonna bring
a team to participate

762
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:57,970
in your process of resolving
this ransomware event.

763
00:31:57,970 --> 00:32:01,730
So there can be multiple
phases of tabletop exercise.

764
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:03,400
There's tabletop exercise

765
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:07,630
with the security team
and the insurer's team.

766
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:09,930
And then, at different phases,

767
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:11,600
you can involve your executives

768
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,010
and even involve the board of directors.

769
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:15,353
But coming to know,

770
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:19,320
with some surety,

771
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:23,570
what the insurance company
thinks its policy covers.

772
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:25,100
So going through different kinds

773
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:28,347
of scenarios with the insurance
company's team saying,

774
00:32:28,347 --> 00:32:30,830
"Okay, if it looks like
this, you cover that."

775
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:33,570
What are you going to say, insurance team,

776
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:38,570
if we see that the attackers are making

777
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:41,580
this kind of a demand?

778
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:45,929
How do we evaluate insurance
team, the various kinds

779
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:49,450
of risks that are involved
with different scenarios.

780
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:52,980
So how do you evaluate the
risk if we pay the ransom,

781
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:56,800
but we still have that possibility
that we'll be re-attacked

782
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:01,800
or that the data will
still be released anyway.

783
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:06,130
So walking through this
kind of a tabletop exercise

784
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:08,330
with your team, your executives,

785
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:12,560
but also with the insurer's
team can be very enlightening.

786
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:15,190
And you'd much rather
have this enlightenment,

787
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:17,420
before the ransomware happens

788
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:22,290
rather than during that
heat of the moment.

789
00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:26,639
In addition to thinking through

790
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:30,270
how the ransomware will be resolved,

791
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:34,850
this tabletop exercise can
also help to enlighten you

792
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:39,750
and your team on how do
we mitigate the root cause

793
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:41,203
and avoid the root cause

794
00:33:41,203 --> 00:33:46,203
and actually avoid this thing
from actually happening.

795
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:47,740
So all of this leads

796
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:51,823
to a more secure type of
environment in your organization.

797
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:53,543
- Okay, with that,

798
00:33:53,543 --> 00:33:54,889
that's just about the end of presentation

799
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:56,010
and we'll leave you some resources

800
00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:58,150
for additional information
and click on any

801

804
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,969
get more skilled people out there.

805
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:10,199
There's an initiative out there
called CyberStart America,

806
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:11,540
where young kids in high school

807
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:14,520
and early college age
can get free scholarships

808
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:17,259
and get two-year Bachelor
of Applied Security

809
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:20,219
and get high paying jobs
and help fight this fight.

810
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:22,409
So you see the URL there
for CyberStart America.

811
00:34:22,409 --> 00:34:24,100
