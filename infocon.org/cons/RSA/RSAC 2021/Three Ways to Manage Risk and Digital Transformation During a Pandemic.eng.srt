1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,530
- Hi, my name is Michael Jabbara

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:05,650
and I lead the global strategy

3
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:09,313
and operations team for the
risk function within Visa.

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,750
My role really centers around looking

5
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:16,460
at how the payment landscape is evolving,

6
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:18,220
what nutrients are shaping it

7
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:21,500
from a security perspective
and then ensuring that Visa

8
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,680
and its ecosystem partners
have the right technology,

9
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,040
the right analytics
and the right expertise

10
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,259
to navigate the kind of
the changing environment

11
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:31,093
to make sure

12
00:00:31,093 --> 00:00:33,060
that we are continuing to
deliver the most seamless

13
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:35,780
and secure payment experience possible.

14
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:38,270
And as you can imagine, the past 12 months

15
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:41,800
have been an incredibly
exciting, transformative

16
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,900
and disruptive time when thinking

17
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:47,750
about how to deliver that
optimal disguised experience

18
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:50,963
while managing risk in a
robust and holistic way.

19
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:55,129
So I'll walk you through
into some of my thoughts

20
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:57,410
on the pandemic, ways to manage

21
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:00,349
that and a potential framework

22
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:02,520
for you to leverage in your
respective organizations

23
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,950
to think about managing
the digital experience

24
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:08,710
in these very unprecedented times,

25
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:11,193
to over the use the word one more time.

26
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,759
And so COVID-19, I think was a really

27
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,260
a bit of a wake-up call

28
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:22,720
to a lot of the organizations
that we work with

29
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,090
in terms of the importance of
delivering services digitally

30
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:31,950
to consumers whose needs and
expectations rapidly change.

31
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:35,280
Essentially overnight,
digital transformation

32
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,085
became a business imperative

33
00:01:37,085 --> 00:01:42,085
and it was what separated
entities that were able to survive

34
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:44,160
and maybe even thrive in the pandemic

35
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,910
to those who are left behind.

36
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:47,880
And as a result,

37
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,789
we saw in almost a matter of
days, business priorities shift

38
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:56,633
to deal with this rapidly
evolving environment.

39
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:00,920
And one of the most
interesting things was really

40
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:05,380
around the rapid change in
consumer behavior that we saw.

41
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,729
It was kind of this great leap forward

42
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:11,660
in terms of how people made payments

43
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:14,173
and interacted with
their service providers.

44
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,922
If you look at the middle of the pandemic,

45
00:02:17,922 --> 00:02:21,460
we had a situation
where the payment volume

46
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:26,390
and the physical channel had
actually decreased by about 20%

47
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:29,059
while the payment volume and
digital channels had increased

48
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:32,533
by about 40% when you exclude travel.

49
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,200
That was during the pandemic over time,

50
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,000
as we're seeing the signs

51
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,992
of recovery and our return to normal.

52
00:02:40,992 --> 00:02:44,040
Some of that mix has changed a little bit,

53
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,370
but we're still seeing
the digital engagement

54
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:48,060
at historic highs.

55
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,720
So, more recently, we're
seeing a payment volume

56
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,010
in a physical channel about
breakeven year over year

57
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:56,810
while the digital channel
is still experiencing growth

58
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:01,210
of about 30%, again,
when you exclude travel.

59
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:06,010
So these digital interactions
are really becoming the norm

60
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:09,579
and it kind of is imperative
on us to kind of think

61
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,230
about what is that security foundation

62
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:15,410
to ensure that we are
meeting our consumers

63
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:17,543
where they expect us to be.

64
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,620
And so, given these rapidly
changing consumer expectations

65
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:28,130
as well as the increasing sophistication

66
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:31,560
of Forresters that we're
seeing in the landscape today,

67
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,910
it's not really surprising

68
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:37,910
that many organizations
foresee risk management

69
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,660
becoming increasingly complex

70
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,810
over the next couple of years.

71
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:43,960
I, myself personally think that despite

72
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,410
of all the change that we've
seen over the last 12 months,

73
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:49,430
the amount of disruption
and transformation

74
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:53,230
over the next 12 to 18 months
will far outweigh that simply

75
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:57,442
as we manage to navigate kind
of this return to normalcy.

76
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,120
And we've actually seen in a study

77
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,960
that Visa had conducted with
Forrester that about 80%

78
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,710
of companies are gonna
be increasingly focused

79
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:11,380
on risk management over the
next couple of years exactly

80
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,472
just to navigate that change.

81
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,959
Kind of the other 20%, I suppose,
are gonna be taking a bit

82
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:20,719
of a laissez faire approach
and kind of just hoping

83
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,270
for the best, which I
certainly don't recommend

84
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,342
on a personal note.

85
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:28,085
And that's especially true

86
00:04:28,085 --> 00:04:33,085
because we kind of saw how the conditions

87
00:04:33,809 --> 00:04:37,340
of the pandemic created this
really ideal environment

88
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,623
for fraudsters to thrive.

89
00:04:39,624 --> 00:04:43,980
So between kind of the rapid digitization

90
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,400
of everyday interactions

91
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,190
and experiences that
we deliver to consumers

92
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:50,170
and then these social economic

93
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:51,760
and political unrest that coincided

94
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,230
with the pandemic,

95
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:56,530
it really was a kind of an environment

96
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:59,960
that allowed new, organized

97
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:03,549
and innovative fraud schemes
to come to the forefront

98
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:06,550
and in a way kind of almost act

99
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:09,460
as a headwind to this massive
digital transformation

100
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,712
that we had been experiencing.

101
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:17,450
And I wanna spend a little bit

102
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:18,760
of time just kind of talking

103
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:23,690
through some of these new fraud
schemes, or not exactly new,

104
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:26,690
but some of these fraud schemes
that are top of mind for us,

105
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:29,440
I think most of you are pretty familiar

106
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,350
with these but I want to
give you a perspective

107
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:32,960
on what we're seeing from the Visa side

108
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,652
as well some key takeaways in this area.

109
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,880
And the first one is really
around e-commerce skimming.

110
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,313
So during the pandemic,
we saw this increase

111
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:52,313
in the injection of malware
and the websites of commercial

112
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,800
and service providers everywhere

113
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,020
and that led to a significant increase

114
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:01,909
in the number of at-risk
accounts that were compromised

115
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:02,743
through that channel

116
00:06:02,743 --> 00:06:05,010
as you can see are 85%

117
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:07,210
of those alerts come
from the digital channel,

118
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:11,150
kind of showing the focus
shifting for fraudsters as well.

119
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:13,229
And the other interesting takeaway

120
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:15,370
here is that the level of sophistication

121
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:18,960
of these skimming variants
has also increased over time

122
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,960
where now we're seeing their
ability to kind of hide

123
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,969
from detection, from
developer tools or self delete

124
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,670
to prevent that detection once

125
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:35,630
they've successfully exfiltrated
the sensitive payment data.

126
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:38,440
So there's kind of this
arms race that's happening

127
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,933
in this space that we're
always trying to get ahead of.

128
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:45,240
The second is around social engineering,

129
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:49,040
which has been obviously
around for quite a while.

130
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,440
But what I thought was
really interesting is kind

131
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,000
of how it evolved as the pandemic went on.

132
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,150
So what we saw at the beginning

133
00:06:56,150 --> 00:07:00,840
in that February to April
timeframe is this proliferation

134
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,150
of fake merchant websites

135
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:05,409
that popped up selling fake COVID cures,

136
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:07,177
fake tests, respirators

137
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:09,660
and solicited payments for goods

138
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:12,370
and services that were never delivered.

139
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:14,320
And then we saw this transition

140
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:18,210
towards more phishing and vishing attacks

141
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:19,060
that were aiming

142
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:23,709
to solicit sensitive
financial services information

143
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:26,130
by pretending to be the bank

144
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:30,430
that you have a relationship
with and these attacks

145
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:34,390
weren't kind of as generic as
what we had seen previously.

146
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:36,919
The fraudsters had taken
the time to research

147
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,098
the financial institution

148
00:07:38,098 --> 00:07:40,620
that their targeted victims had banked

149
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:43,072
with and manipulated their caller ID

150
00:07:43,072 --> 00:07:44,310
so that they see him

151
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:46,797
as if they were a legitimate institution,

152
00:07:46,797 --> 00:07:50,300
and that could have
resulted in a whole host

153
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:54,810
of fraud losses for some of these clients.

154
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:57,650
And then more recently,
kind of that next iteration

155
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:59,640
of that next phase was really centered

156
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:04,260
around unemployment fraud and
economic disbursement fraud

157
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:09,260
where were seeing fraudsters
compromise sensitive data

158
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:12,060
that they purchase on the dark web

159
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:15,610
and cobble together
identities to siphon off some

160
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:20,160
of these economic funds and
really test out and explore

161
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,880
the vulnerabilities that we see

162
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,770
in state unemployment systems

163
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,563
and in our disbursement systems.

164
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,943
The third is really
around kind of ransomware.

165
00:08:31,943 --> 00:08:34,049
Kind of the interesting takeaway

166
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:36,010
here that we had over the pandemic

167
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:38,539
was the increasing targeting

168
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:42,360
of financial institutions,
especially those that were medium

169
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,159
or in the long tail

170
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,949
and we saw at least a couple of instances

171
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:47,750
in which these ransomware attacks

172
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:51,180
specifically targeted
sensitive card data, data

173
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:55,430
that was then later turning
up in dark web for sale.

174
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:59,489
And so, kind of in our mind
kind of ransomware attacks

175
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:01,590
on financial institutions
are pretty much equivalent

176
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:05,280
to data breaches where that
account information now

177
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,963
has to be regenerated to prevent
further losses downstream.

178
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:12,507
Enumeration attacks are also

179
00:09:12,507 --> 00:09:14,870
a kind of this interesting attack factor

180
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:17,156
that we have been
focused on more recently.

181
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:20,609
As you can see by the graph, in the onset

182
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:23,150
of the pandemic, we had seen
the significant increase

183
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:25,870
in the number of enumerated transactions.

184
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:29,920
It was about 20% year over year or so.

185
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,026
And then over time,
that trend has modulated

186
00:09:32,027 --> 00:09:34,200
or plateaued a bit.

187
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,820
And I think part of the reason

188
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:39,328
for that is that they're
kind of fairly inefficient

189
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:42,910
kind of method of fraud.

190
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:46,380
While these integrates
transactions were increasing,

191
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,180
the fraud that's associated

192
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,530
with the enumerated accounts

193
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:52,890
was actually decreasing over time.

194
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:54,750
And so, the fraudsters were not effective

195
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,340
and actually monetizing these credentials

196
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:58,320
through this attack vector.

197
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,830
Having said that, however,
we're still seeing

198
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:01,740
kind of a tremendous amount

199
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,840
of operational costs
that are being imposed

200
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,650
through these attacks.

201
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:07,069
Our data for instance, shows

202
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:09,180
that for a merchant who suffered

203
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,780
in enumeration attack, their approval rate

204
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:15,000
doesn't return to its pre-attack level

205
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,920
until two months after the
attack had been stopped.

206
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,219
So kind of imagine the revenue

207
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,320
and sales losses that these merchants

208
00:10:24,066 --> 00:10:25,140
kind of endure as a result of this.

209
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:28,370
And this is another reason
why we're continuing

210
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:30,793
to focus on this vector quite a bit.

211
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,240
And then the final one

212
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,970
is really around
nation-backed threat actors.

213
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:42,250
Kind of hostile regimes
have felt the fiscal strain

214
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:45,300
of the COVID pandemic
pretty significantly.

215
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:49,430
And as the pandemic had began,
we had seen increasing alerts

216
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:52,130
that some of these groups

217
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:54,080
were gonna be targeting
financial institutions

218
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,620
through cash out attacks.

219
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:59,494
Fortunately, that hasn't
really come to fruition,

220
00:10:59,494 --> 00:11:02,820
but we posited that the
reason for that is likely

221
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:06,720
due to them targeting
cryptocurrency related schemes

222
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,920
instead as a way of
generating illicit revenues.

223
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:15,390
And so with kind of these
types of threat actors

224
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:16,260
coming to the forefront

225
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:19,950
during the pandemic and
coupled with very dynamic

226
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:23,020
and volatile spending patterns,

227
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,130
that kind of there was this expectation

228
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:27,620
that we're gonna be experiencing

229
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,880
a pretty significant spike

230
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,543
in the overall fraud volume as a result.

231
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:37,560
But thankfully, what we
actually had been witnessing

232
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:42,199
was that the overall fraud
volume actually decreased

233
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,240
by about 4% year over year.

234
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,560
And I think part of that was driven

235
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,720
by our ability to shift a lot

236
00:11:49,721 --> 00:11:52,510
of the merchants that
were primarily focused

237
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:53,982
on the physical channel

238
00:11:53,982 --> 00:11:58,982
like wholesale clubs, and
grocery stores and pharmacies

239
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:02,699
to the card, not (indistinct)
a fairly secure manner

240
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,430
in addition to the expanded adoption

241
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:08,823
of secure technologies like
tokenization and contact list.

242
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,210
Now, at this point,
you're probably thinking,

243
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:14,250
well if we managed to
kind of weather the storm

244
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:17,036
of the pandemic and fight back

245
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:22,022
these fairly sophisticated
innovative fraudsters,

246
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,120
do we really need to be in this session

247
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,000
to learn how to manage risks

248
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,490
during a digital transformation?

249
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:30,581
It seems like we're doing
a really good job already

250
00:12:30,581 --> 00:12:32,270
and that's a totally fair point.

251
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,260
I definitely want you to stay

252
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:35,760
in your seats because the second part

253
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,343
of this story is really
around kind of this component

254
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:42,959
of consumer behavior that we hadn't talked

255
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:46,300
about which is the fraud
rate did decrease overall

256
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,439
and it was certainly driven

257
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,370
by kind of these proactive
changes that we'd made.

258
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,987
But another part was also
really due to the shift

259
00:12:52,987 --> 00:12:54,890
in the channel mix

260
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:59,850
where folks started to spend
a lot more money domestically

261
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:03,360
which tends to be more secure ways to pay

262
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,640
versus going across border

263
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,970
and spending money internationally

264
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:11,060
which tend to be less secure transactions.

265
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:15,160
And so if the transaction
mix between domestic

266
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:19,630
and cross-border returns
to its pre COVID ratio,

267
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:24,200
we would actually expect the
fraud rate to increase by 4%.

268
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:29,117
And given that internationally
there're beginnings

269
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:34,730
of return to normalcy as
vaccinations become more prevalent

270
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,720
and people start to travel internationally

271
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,360
more, that shift will kind of play out.

272
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,030
And on top of that,
you'll have kind of some

273
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,630
of these fraud vectors that
we had discussed really acting

274
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:49,310
as a tailwind for increasing the amount

275
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:52,449
of fraudulent activity that's
occurring to the ecosystem.

276
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:56,240
So we really have to be
very proactive to ensure

277
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,260
that security foundation
that we have are put in place

278
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:02,250
to kind of continue the acceleration

279
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:05,170
of this transformation is there

280
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,890
and it kind maintain the trust

281
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:11,093
of our consumers and the
services that we provide.

282
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:18,250
And, kind of the other factors to consider

283
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:21,213
is that a lot of firms
generally don't feel

284
00:14:21,213 --> 00:14:25,964
like they can execute on their
risk management priorities.

285
00:14:25,964 --> 00:14:28,190
In that same study that
we did with Forrester,

286
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:32,660
you could see that the two most
critical kind of priorities

287
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,300
from a risk management perspective

288
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,800
around protecting sensitive
data and keeping up with some

289
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,209
of these emerging risks
that we had discussed,

290
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:41,590
only about 1/3 of organizations feel

291
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:44,380
like they are very prepared to do so.

292
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:47,840
And, that's somewhat
of a concerning number,

293
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,670
you would want it to be in the 80s, 90s

294
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,620
for you to feel comfortable.

295
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:54,840
And so what we really have here

296
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,420
it's kind of these confluence of events,

297
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:59,370
we have a pandemic led acceleration

298
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:02,840
of digitized consumer
experiences and transactions,

299
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,870
you have increasingly
sophisticated, organized,

300
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:08,254
funded fraudsters that are
gonna take an advantage

301
00:15:08,254 --> 00:15:09,641
of the vulnerabilities

302
00:15:09,641 --> 00:15:13,650
and these newly digitized
consumer interactions,

303
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:16,569
and then you have firms who don't feel

304
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:18,270
like they are prepared to deal

305
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:21,740
with the evolving risk
management landscape

306
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:24,070
and kind of (indistinct)

307
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:27,708
this kind of proactive coordinated action,

308
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:30,600
it's really going to be a bit

309
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,770
of a challenge to kind
of maintaining the space

310
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:34,319
of digital transformation that we had seen

311
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,120
over the last 12 months.

312
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,290
And so the key around that is really

313
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:39,370
how do we can consider risk management

314
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:41,250
on a holistic level and think

315
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:46,250
about these three ways that we
can manage risk holistically

316
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:51,050
through that digital transformation.

317
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,270
And the first one is really
around kind of thinking

318
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:56,750
about what your ultimate end
goal is and really refining

319
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,520
that strategy then kind of pointing

320
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,789
your technology investments

321
00:16:00,789 --> 00:16:04,640
in order for you to promote
and further that strategy,

322
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,240
and then finally coming

323
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,342
with a governance structure

324
00:16:07,342 --> 00:16:12,342
that allows you to kind
of execute on the strategy

325
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:16,050
and realize the benefits of
your technology investments.

326
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:19,963
So I'll go through each one
in a little bit more detail.

327
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,100
And so, the first piece
is around strategy.

328
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,530
Been an incredibly overused word

329
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:33,959
almost as overused as
unprecedented, but at its core

330
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,280
and my mind is really a roadmap

331
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,689
for you to achieve your goal.

332
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:39,266
And the first part

333
00:16:39,266 --> 00:16:41,699
of what I think is important when it comes

334
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,060
to strategy development,
especially within a risk context

335
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:47,000
is that risk organizations
tend to build their strategies

336
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,890
in a fairly solid way.

337
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:50,319
So, the business has a strategy

338
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,220
and then the risk team is
over here kind of doing

339
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,750
their own thing and they don't really meet

340
00:16:55,844 --> 00:16:58,320
in the middle unless
something goes terribly wrong.

341
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,290
So the first part I think

342
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:00,900
is just really thinking

343
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:04,389
what is the overall
organization's approach

344
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:07,300
and goals, and then how
does their risk strategy

345
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,919
that you're building actually help promote

346
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,529
and further those goals?

347
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:13,435
So kind of think about as an example,

348
00:17:13,435 --> 00:17:16,800
the overall company's goal is to deliver

349
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:21,800
a seamless consumer experience
taking a risk lens to it

350
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:24,099
kind of breaks it down to
well, I wanna make sure

351
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:26,514
that every legitimate transaction

352
00:17:26,515 --> 00:17:28,580
for my customer is approved

353
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,699
and I want to make sure that
every fraudulent transaction

354
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,710
from my card holder is the client.

355
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:36,510
And then from there,

356
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:39,460
having that as your
organizational North Star,

357
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:42,100
you have this set of inputs
that have outlined here thinking

358
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,788
about what are your competitors doing?

359
00:17:43,788 --> 00:17:47,750
How are regulators thinking
about kind of these types

360
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,420
of consumer experiences

361
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:51,867
and this example of authentication,

362
00:17:51,867 --> 00:17:55,526
how does something like an
SCA in Europe apply to it?

363
00:17:55,526 --> 00:17:57,340
Looking at your consumers

364
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,020
and how are their behaviors changing,

365
00:17:59,020 --> 00:17:59,982
and some of the ways that we'd outlined

366
00:17:59,982 --> 00:18:02,330
at the beginning of this presentation.

367
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:05,419
And from there, really coming
out with a holistic picture

368
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,950
about what are the key drivers

369
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:10,600
that are going to either
help you meet that objective,

370
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:14,070
or are gonna be an obstacle and which ones

371
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:15,639
are gonna be kind of the most impactful,

372
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,373
either positively or negatively.

373
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,379
Again, the other kind of key things

374
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:22,270
to remember about strategy
is about making choices.

375
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:23,810
You can't kind of have everything,

376
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:25,841
you have to think about
what's the best allocation

377
00:18:25,841 --> 00:18:28,180
of your assets is gonna be.

378
00:18:28,181 --> 00:18:30,000
And then, out of that

379
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,280
let's say kind of prioritization exercise,

380
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,113
you come out

381
00:18:35,113 --> 00:18:38,466
with three to five key
strategic initiatives

382
00:18:38,466 --> 00:18:43,330
that you want to really focus
on and dedicate yourselves

383
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:46,562
to so that you can meet
your objective goal.

384
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:53,680
Once you have those three to
five key objectives in mind,

385
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:56,730
then the next part is really

386
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:59,070
about aligning your
technology transformation

387
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:01,580
to further those objectives along.

388
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:04,399
And I think this piece
here is really important

389
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,430
because kind of what we've noticed

390
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:11,280
is that traditionally, we're very fond

391
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,690
of kind of building these
point solutions to deal

392
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:14,700
with specific problems.

393
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:19,700
So, 18 months ago, ATM
cash-outs were a huge deal,

394
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,120
so we'll build a solution

395
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,610
and then kind of resolve that issue.

396
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:25,610
And today, account enumeration
for instance, is a big deal.

397
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:28,699
So we'll build a point
solution and figure that out.

398
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,280
But 18 months from now,

399
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,670
it's gonna be a different fraud vector.

400
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:35,700
And so the idea is really
how do you enable yourself

401
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:39,280
to have a flexible tech
architecture that allows you

402
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:43,139
to be much more responsive

403
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,371
and much more agile to these
new emerging fraud vectors,

404
00:19:46,371 --> 00:19:50,290
so that you're not always
kind of chasing the rabbit.

405
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:51,230
And I think you do that

406
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:55,113
through these three core
capabilities or pieces.

407
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:59,900
The first part of it
is really foundational.

408
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,120
It's your actual infrastructure,

409
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,912
your technological infrastructure.

410
00:20:05,209 --> 00:20:08,440
And I'm just highlighting
kind of four pieces here

411
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,840
from a computing capacity.

412
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,330
If you're a risk analyst, it runs a query

413
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:13,470
and then they have to come back

414
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:16,660
in the morning to find out
the outcome of that query.

415
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:19,080
It probably means you don't
have enough computing capacity

416
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:19,913
in you to expand

417
00:20:19,913 --> 00:20:23,451
that to handle kind of the
additional data that you have.

418
00:20:23,451 --> 00:20:24,700
You need to kinda take a look

419
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,470
at the data sources that
you have available to you

420
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:30,010
both in-house through
your different systems

421
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:31,370
or through some of the
different acquisitions

422
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:33,659
that you have made and kind of normalize

423
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,400
that so you have a single view

424
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:40,184
of how the transaction hits
throughout the life cycle

425
00:20:40,184 --> 00:20:45,184
as well as think about what
are some third party data

426
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:49,300
that you can use enrich
your existing dataset

427
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:52,490
so that you can further
refine your models.

428
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:54,779
And that's where analysis
velocity comes in

429
00:20:54,779 --> 00:20:57,970
and then your ability to make
really quick decisions based

430
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:02,630
on numerous amounts of experiments

431
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:04,820
to hone in on the key data elements

432
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:07,889
that are gonna give you the
best, most optimized outcome.

433
00:21:07,889 --> 00:21:09,669
And a big part of that of course,

434
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:12,630
is gonna be around the
algorithms that you're running

435
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:16,390
through your AI and machine
learning capability, making sure

436
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:18,570
that you have kind of the right data,

437
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:20,310
that you are training the
models in the right way

438
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:22,479
and getting optimized outcomes

439
00:21:22,479 --> 00:21:27,479
so that you now have the tools
to build the capabilities

440
00:21:28,989 --> 00:21:31,450
that come in that next layer

441
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:34,360
where you're digesting this data

442
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,850
and processing it correctly,

443
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:40,850
you're able to build fairly
flexible rule model engines

444
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,814
so that you're not building
a point solution to solve

445
00:21:43,814 --> 00:21:46,083
for a specific fraud site,

446
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:49,883
but rather you can kind of
relatively deploy these models

447
00:21:49,883 --> 00:21:53,061
in a much more flexible
and much more agile way

448
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:55,570
that would then allow you to prioritize

449
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:58,409
what alerts you want to
be automatically handled

450
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:01,950
either kind of ignored or actioned

451
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:04,330
in which alerts you want
an actual live human being

452
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:07,699
to go and analyze and
determine what actions

453
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,600
should be followed up next

454
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,090
and then see that end-to-end
case management flow,

455
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:15,300
so that based on the
outcome of these alerts

456
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,270
you're feeding that
back into the algorithm

457
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:20,452
to improve it and allow it to learn better

458
00:22:20,452 --> 00:22:22,440
so that your outcomes

459
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:26,870
are becoming much more targeted over time.

460
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:28,489
And then finally, kind of thinking

461
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:32,290
about, well how do you output
that to your ultimate end user

462
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:34,830
in a way that provides them
with the right information

463
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:38,663
at the right time and is
easier for them to digest.

464
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,480
And once you have these capabilities,

465
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,720
you have these building blocks together,

466
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,470
you can start to deploy them

467
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:51,650
in ways to automate your
really core processes.

468
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:55,017
And I've used a kind
of three examples here

469
00:22:55,017 --> 00:22:59,140
of types of risks that I think
every organization manages

470
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,653
on in one way or the other.

471
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:03,150
Where now, for instance,

472
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:05,516
if you're dealing with fraud
risk kind of going back

473
00:23:05,516 --> 00:23:07,210
to the earlier point,

474
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:10,430
you're seeing this new kind
of fraud pattern emerge,

475
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:12,210
you're isolating those transactions,

476
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:15,200
you're seeing the
pattern that they follow,

477
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,460
you're implementing rules that
detect for those transactions

478
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:21,070
in your larger dataset, and
then you're deploying it

479
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:24,710
so that your ability to
manage these new incidents

480
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:26,550
is much more automated
and much more efficient

481
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:30,967
than it would be if you had
actual human beings doing it

482
00:23:30,968 --> 00:23:34,660
and if you were actually had
to build a new capability

483
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:38,620
from the ground up to be able
to action these new vectors.

484
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,510
And so we're seeing

485
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:43,700
that really kind of across
the different risk types

486
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,120
that we are managing.

487
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,870
So, we're thinking about
what are the core outcomes

488
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:48,629
that we're trying to achieve?

489
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:50,820
What are the processes
that are supporting them?

490
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:53,718
And how can we make these
processes more automated

491
00:23:53,719 --> 00:23:55,370
and more efficient

492
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:58,600
because we have built
that technology foundation

493
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,610
to begin with?

494
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,658
And then finally, there's
kind of the third piece

495
00:24:06,658 --> 00:24:09,689
of managing risk and
digital transformation,

496
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:11,653
which is really all around governance.

497
00:24:13,055 --> 00:24:14,919
Kind of one of the interesting findings

498
00:24:14,919 --> 00:24:19,668
that we had in that study with Forrester

499
00:24:19,668 --> 00:24:24,649
is that most organizations

500
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:27,830
are investing more in their technologies

501
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:28,899
when it comes to risk management,

502
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:32,870
whether that's next gen
capabilities, or it's analytics

503
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:35,850
or kind of automation tools.

504
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:36,856
And yet as you saw,

505
00:24:36,856 --> 00:24:38,920
there are still a pretty
significant portion

506
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,970
of them that feel like
they're not able to deliver

507
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:43,610
on their key priorities.

508
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:45,800
And I think a key part

509
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:49,389
of the disconnect is we
tend to overinvest in tools

510
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:51,760
and under-invest in
people, and in processes

511
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,210
and in governance.

512
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:56,680
And I think that's usually
one of the missing pieces.

513
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:59,340
And so what we wanna really emphasize,

514
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:01,100
for me at least, governance

515
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,850
is really around how do
you take a consistent set

516
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:06,281
of standards and processes

517
00:25:06,281 --> 00:25:11,281
that allows you to align people
across different functions

518
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:16,400
across even different organizations
so that you're pursuing

519
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,570
a common goal or a common path?

520
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:22,159
And what I focused on
here is really the ability

521
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,850
to distribute the intelligence

522
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:27,260
and the analytics that
you were able to derive

523
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:29,280
from your technology transformation

524
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:32,500
to the right stakeholders
so that they can action it

525
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:36,010
and turn those insights
into actual performance.

526
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:37,850
And so the way that you work

527
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:40,780
with your clients, share that information,

528
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:43,960
the analytics, the
benchmarking, the best practices

529
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,380
so that they're acting as
a first line of defense.

530
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,570
How do you get together
with ecosystem partners

531
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:53,646
to think through kind of
coordinated efforts to reduce

532
00:25:53,646 --> 00:25:56,080
and mitigate fraud

533
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:59,880
kind of in your shared
marketplace internally

534
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,570
within your own functional teams?

535
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:04,450
How can you provide the
information necessary

536
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:06,020
for them to make business decisions

537
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:09,440
that optimize the trade off
between risk and reward?

538
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,980
And then, within your risk
teams that are distributed

539
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:16,010
around the world, how do you work

540
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:18,671
with them to localize the insights

541
00:26:18,671 --> 00:26:22,340
and the inputs through their
respective market environments

542
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:25,010
so that they are benefiting
from the global scale

543
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:29,350
but they're able to tailor
that to their unique market?

544
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:33,209
So taking this holistic
approach, combining the strategy,

545
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:35,390
the technology and the
governance to make sure

546
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:37,050
you have a solid risk
management foundation

547
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:41,413
is gonna be really critical
during this time of transition

548
00:26:41,413 --> 00:26:43,070
as we're kind of moving

549
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:47,080
from the COVID pandemic to what comes next

550
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:50,280
and seeing how this consumer
behavior that we had seen

551
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,629
during the pandemic stabilizes

552
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:55,033
and reaches a new normal equilibrium.

553
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,139
And I think one of the key highlights

554
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:03,500
here around risk management strategy

555
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:07,280
is that you're not doing for
the sake of checking the box

556
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:09,740
or they're gonna make your auditors happy,

557
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,700
should make your regulators happy.

558
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,350
The ultimate goal

559
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:16,870
of this approach is
positive business outcomes.

560
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:17,860
If you're able

561
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:20,219
to have this holistic
risk management framework

562
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:23,880
in place, you're less likely
to have operational failures

563
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,310
that increase your operating costs,

564
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:30,560
you're more likely to
have a higher loyalty

565
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:33,899
and higher client's
stickiness with your customers

566
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:36,840
and that ultimately will
drive higher profits

567
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:41,199
for you and improve profitability
for your organization.

568
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,710
So the key when designing
these pieces is to always think

569
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:46,570
about the ultimate business outcome

570
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:48,143
that you're driving towards.

571
00:27:50,189 --> 00:27:54,810
And so, for the last
section of the presentation,

572
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:58,028
what I really wanna do is
kind of give you a high level,

573
00:27:58,028 --> 00:28:01,690
let's say checklist of some of the things

574
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:04,200
that you can take back to
your respective organizations

575
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,420
and just measure yourself against and see

576
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,480
on a scale of one to 10

577
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,470
how strong do you believe
you're covered for some

578
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:14,700
of these dimensions I'll go through

579
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,170
and then for areas where you think

580
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:18,090
you could do a double click, kind of think

581
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:23,030
about how do you incorporate
this into your future roadmap.

582
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:24,570
And so the first section I wanna talk

583
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:28,100
about is really thinking through
your customer specifically.

584
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,889
I think a lot of times we think

585
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:34,700
about the customer experience
in a very disjointed manner

586
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,270
versus kind of an end to end manner.

587
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:39,840
You think about the
authentication side is handled

588
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,010
by different side of the house

589
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:44,522
than the folks who are managing risk.

590
00:28:44,522 --> 00:28:46,639
But for me, you really have to think

591
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,890
through kind of what is that risk reward

592
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:51,460
for this customer interaction

593
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:52,840
and make that decision holistically

594
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,899
versus just trying to
optimize for one metric

595
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,253
over the other.

596
00:28:57,290 --> 00:29:00,000
Another is also empowering them with tools

597
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,900
so that they can fight
fraud more proactively.

598
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:07,650
I think customers today
are increasingly getting

599
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:09,804
in a whole host of new
financial relationships

600
00:29:09,804 --> 00:29:12,920
with their providers and
they want a sense of control.

601
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,980
And so if you give them tools like alerts

602
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:20,970
and transaction controls,
they're more likely

603
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:22,987
to remain loyal to you.

604
00:29:22,987 --> 00:29:26,660
And we've actually seen fraud
alerts do significant work

605
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,550
in reducing the overall
fraud amount with some

606
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:32,010
of the customer accounts up
to 30%, in a recent study

607
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:32,843
that we did.

608
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,040
And then finally, kind
of think about ensuring

609
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,649
that trust is a key part

610
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:41,977
of your value proposition externally.

611
00:29:41,977 --> 00:29:46,540
So, Visa itself has
done a kind of campaigns

612
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:48,387
where we just highlighted
the security features

613
00:29:48,387 --> 00:29:49,530
of our products

614
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:51,620
and we actually saw a
sustainable increase,

615
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:53,719
not only with the usage
of our payment products,

616
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,973
but also in the activation
of them as well.

617
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,847
The second is really around investing

618
00:29:59,847 --> 00:30:01,870
in technology and people

619
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:03,530
and we spend a lot of times talking

620
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:05,550
about the technology transformation,

621
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:07,970
but again, as the kind of
the fraud landscape evolves,

622
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:10,470
the way that we tackle it has to evolve.

623
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:12,200
One kind of specific call out,

624
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,440
again is really around continuing

625
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:17,960
to invest in analytics and data.

626
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:21,230
We've been using AI
models to really manage

627
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:23,970
this turbulent time and ensuring

628
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:26,359
that as we've seen kind of these increases

629
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:29,412
in illicit transactions,
we're able to decline

630
00:30:29,412 --> 00:30:33,360
the fraudulent ones, but keep
the legitimate transactions

631
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,169
going through to make sure

632
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:38,650
that we're managing consumer
expectations correctly,

633
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:40,280
as well as investing in your people

634
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,129
so that you have security experts

635
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:44,079
that can help you manage this transition.

636
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:45,585
We did something similar

637
00:30:45,585 --> 00:30:48,172
where we've built a risk operations center

638
00:30:48,172 --> 00:30:51,760
that we refer to as the ROC colloquially

639
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,044
and they combine this deep knowledge

640
00:30:54,044 --> 00:30:57,280
of fairly sophisticated statistical models

641
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,420
with these fraud techniques

642
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:01,530
and they're able to
intervene at the right time

643
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:05,050
with the right tools to minimize fraud

644
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:08,270
before it even impacts our clients.

645
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:10,040
In the last year alone,
they actually stopped

646
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:14,120
about 3 1/2 billion dollars
worth of fraudulent PV

647
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:17,409
that saved our clients
just a tremendous amount

648
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:20,523
in terms of operating and customer costs.

649
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:25,960
The third is really around
kind of, again, going back

650
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,090
to the concept of strong governance

651
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:28,939
and how do you think

652
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:33,940
about processes that
reinforce your strategy

653
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:37,090
and reinforce the ultimate end point

654
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:42,090
that you're trying to get to,
one is kind of dedicating time

655
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:47,850
and resources to make sure
that your people are educated

656
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:50,520
on the latest and greatest
of what's happening

657
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:54,129
in the front landscape
working collaboratively

658
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:57,950
with industry bodies to innovate at scale.

659
00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:00,010
I think the things that we've done

660
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:02,750
through EMV for instance,
are a great example

661
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:05,335
of what can happen when we
collaborate to stamp out fraud

662
00:32:05,335 --> 00:32:06,823
with the adoption

663
00:32:06,823 --> 00:32:11,430
of EMV chip that has significantly
decreased present fraud.

664
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,190
And then finally, just making sure

665
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:16,410
that there are documented
repeatable processes

666
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:19,840
for managing changes to what you enhance

667
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,679
and making sure that your
products are built secure

668
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:25,040
from the start to kind
of reduce the incidents

669
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,850
of vulnerabilities that could be exploited

670
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:30,288
by the ever clever fraudsters.

671
00:32:30,288 --> 00:32:35,288
And then finally, kind of
thinking about that North Star

672
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,220
which is your strategy,
which should be ever evolving

673
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:41,770
and kind of thinking about
those strategic frameworks

674
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:43,180
that you will leverage to make sure

675
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:45,390
that your resources are being allocated

676
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:48,021
in the most efficient way

677
00:32:48,021 --> 00:32:50,129
and kind of how do you address some

678
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:51,140
of the potential gaps

679
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,900
that you have in your
existing capabilities

680
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,760
when you compare them to
the trends that are shaping

681
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:58,820
the landscape where you
operate using these forums,

682
00:32:58,820 --> 00:32:59,820
these industry forums

683
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:04,820
where you can learn, and share
ideas and gather feedback.

684
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:06,950
I'm very much looking
forward to a whole host

685
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:09,120
of other sessions during the conference

686
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,412
that I think will really
inform my strategic thinking.

687
00:33:12,413 --> 00:33:15,204
So, definitely take advantage of that.

688
00:33:15,204 --> 00:33:19,129
And then being able to kind of
distill all that information

689
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:23,100
in a clear to understand
roadmap that shows you,

690
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:26,331
your organization and your
key external stakeholders

691
00:33:26,331 --> 00:33:28,409
where you think the landscape is headed

692
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:30,973
and what you're doing to keep ahead of it.

693
00:33:31,923 --> 00:33:34,620
I think that kind of
builds not only commitment

694
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:36,159
about accountabilities and make sure

695
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,493
that we're all moving
in the right direction.

696
00:33:39,994 --> 00:33:44,209
And then finally, some
even more concrete terms

697
00:33:45,624 --> 00:33:47,650
or some more concrete recommendations

698
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:50,310
that I wanted to share, kind of quick wins

699
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:54,399
that you can do right
after this session is over,

700
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:57,000
I think these are fairly straightforward

701
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,170
and most likely obvious to a lot of us,

702
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:00,600
but it's always a good reminder,

703
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:04,870
it's always a good
hygiene to keep in mind.

704
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:06,669
And the only one that I'll
kind of explicitly call out

705
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:08,760
is just our risk operation
center or the ROC

706
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,530
as we call it.

707
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:12,790
So, always give us a call when you think

708
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:16,840
that there are threats or
attacks that you're facing

709
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,940
and we'll be more

710
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:20,268
than happy to provide
assistance and support.

711
00:34:20,268 --> 00:34:22,023
And so, as we like to say,

712
00:34:22,889 --> 00:34:26,703
let's work together to
ROC the fraud world.

713
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:30,739
And with that, I wanna thank you

714
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:33,639
for your time and for your attention.

715
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:36,150
And please, feel free to
continue sending questions

716
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:38,060
through the chat as I answer them.
