00:00:11,489 --> 00:00:14,072
(music)

3
00:00:15,604 --> 00:00:18,189
- Hello and welcome to this fireside chat

4
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:20,820
with Forcepoint CEO, Manny Rivelo.

5
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,090
My name is Georgie Barrat,

6
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:24,700
I'm a UK tech journalist and broadcaster,

7
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,090
and today we're gonna really
dig in to what the next era

8
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:30,270
of cybersecurity looks like
and how it will require

9
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:32,140
a new way of thinking.

10
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:35,250
We are calling it the unbound
enterprise and Manny is here

11
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,360
to deconstruct exactly what that means

12
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,940
and what it's going to look like.

13
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,379
Manny, a very warm welcome to you.

14
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:42,213
- Good to see you, Georgie.

15
00:00:42,213 --> 00:00:43,780
It's a pleasure being here with you today.

16
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:47,150
- Now this past year has
really been eye-opening

17
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:49,170
when it comes to cybersecurity.

18
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,860
We've been navigating through
such uncharted territory,

19
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,839
but when it comes to cyber
attacks specifically,

20
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,500
some of the scale and aggression of them

21
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,340
has just been unprecedented.

22
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:59,960
I'd love to know from your perspective,

23
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,570
how do you think the
pandemic has really shone

24
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:03,503
a spotlight on cybersecurity?

25
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:06,750
- Well, look, it's a fabulous question

26
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,860
because we've gone through so much change

27
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:11,640
over the course of the
last 15 months or so.

28
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,350
But the change that we're going through

29
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:14,720
is really an acceleration.

30
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,010
If you think about it
over the last decade,

31
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,100
the industry's been going through

32
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,210
this digital transformation.

33
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:22,410
The mobility movement has been afoot.

34
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:24,970
Since the smartphone came
out, more and more users

35
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:27,470
have been untethered to the office, right?

36
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:29,200
As they travel, they have access

37
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,520
to their business applications,
to their email, et cetera.

38
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,860
The movement to applications in the cloud,

39
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,200
whether we're using applications

40
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,760
like salesforce.com or Workday
as an example or SAP HANA

41
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,930
has been afoot for a long time.

42
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:45,830
The pandemic has really
put that into warp speed

43
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:48,399
because not only were we
mobile some of the time,

44
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,560
now we're mobile all the time.

45
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,230
We're just in an environment
where everybody is working

46
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:56,018
from a different place that they work

47
00:01:56,018 --> 00:01:57,760
in the classic environment

48
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,280
and they're accessing
applications still on-prem

49
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,630
or in the cloud or somewhere else.

50
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:05,869
And really what that constitute
is the classic perimeter,

51
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:08,660
that office perimeter
that we had to secure

52
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:10,329
has completely changed.

53
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,300
You could argue it's dead, right?

54
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,810
And there needs to be a new perimeter

55
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:18,030
that needs to get brought
inside of the environment.

56
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:21,240
And the amazing thing is
when you see these changes

57
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,720
in the industries, the
hackers are always trying

58
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,020
to stay one step ahead.

59
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,440
They're always trying to exploit something

60
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,310
in the change of the environment.

61
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:32,270
And boy, have we seen a lot of change

62
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:33,980
from the hacker community over
the course of the last year.

63
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,799
I'll give you some simple stats.

64
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:40,800
Last year, there was about
46,000 phishing sites

65
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,579
that were brought up per week
going after the organization.

66
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,490
That's unbelievable.

67
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:48,410
And you're seeing ransomware attacks,

68
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:52,720
like Acer had a ransomware
attack of $50 million.

69
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,730
But it's not just these big enterprises

70
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:55,915
that are getting attacked.

71
00:02:55,915 --> 00:02:57,470
I'll tell you a personal story.

72
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:00,609
I have a friend who called
me approximately a month ago.

73
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:02,480
They're a plastic surgeon.

74
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,600
They're a very well-renowned
plastic surgeon.

75
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,460
He called me up because he's
panicked that in his industry

76
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:11,050
people are stealing the
before/after pictures,

77
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:12,910
the hackers are going after that

78
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:16,180
and exfiltrating money
out of organizations

79
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,770
by stealing those before/after pictures.

80
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:19,430
So it's not an enterprise problem.

81
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,720
It is a broad problem in the industry.

82
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,800
And the reality is to get
in front of this problem,

83
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,220
we have to think about it differently.

84
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:30,380
We have a new perimeter
that's closer to the edge,

85
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,250
closer to where the user is,

86
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:35,180
that we need to address
as an overall industry.

87
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:37,430
- And while there has
been sort of an increase

88
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,580
in the number of threats,

89
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,660
it also has been a very dynamic time

90
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,760
for the cybersecurity industry, hasn't it?

91
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,990
- It has.

92
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:49,200
I mean, like I said, the world
is now, where's the user?

93
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,200
The user's everywhere.

94
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,560
Where are the applications? The
applications are everywhere.

95
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,940
There's gonna be a new norm.

96
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,030
I think that norm will be a mixed norm.

97
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,880
There's no question that
they'll be individuals

98
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,070
in the office, they'll be
individuals working from home.

99
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:02,709
Corporations have figured out

100
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:06,510
how to be much more dynamic
and productive in this world.

101
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,780
And by the way, users
are demanding it too.

102
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:13,730
So the concept of how we
need to position ourselves

103
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:16,880
to be able to defend that
environment is critical,

104
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,850
and it truly is, because
if we're gonna continue

105
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:21,890
to digitize the world,
the concept of cyber

106
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:23,820
being in that world is key.

107
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,820
We call this new world
the unbound enterprise.

108
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,820
It is the possibility of your
applications being anywhere

109
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:32,430
and your services being anywhere, right?

110
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,340
So it is something that as an industry

111
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,940
we got to wrap our hands around

112
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,790
and be able to provide solutions for.

113
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:42,120
- So you say that this new era awaits,

114
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,870
the era of the unbound enterprise.

115
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:46,250
I think where many organizations

116
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,930
struggle on their security journey

117
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:51,530
is just having that clarity
of their desired endpoint.

118
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:53,330
You know, where do they
actually want to get to?

119
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:56,469
I would love to know sort of
what's your utopian vision

120
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,600
of how security should work?

121
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,903
What transformations are we
really starting to see in cyber?

122
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:04,700
- Yeah, it's a good question.

123
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:09,500
So think about if I was to
paint what's the utopian vision,

124
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,280
it is one where we talk to
our customers where they say

125
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,710
I'm gonna have users on-prem,

126
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:19,280
I'm gonna have users
working from hotels, home,

127
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,150
some are working actually
from customer's environments,

128
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:24,479
their environments, and I
need to be able to provide

129
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,180
the right set of security services.

130
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:29,070
And by the way, a user
is using applications

131
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:30,849
that could be inside
their private data center

132
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:31,900
or inside the cloud.

133
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:35,900
So how do I provide that
framework with unified policy?

134
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,909
So this concept of hybrid
is very real still.

135
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:42,330
I know we all talk about cloud first.

136
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:44,780
There's no question that
the growth is in cloud,

137
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,549
but the concept of being able to provide

138
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:49,780
a security framework
that's hybrid is very real.

139
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:52,640
And how you stitch the right services

140
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,640
at the right place at the right time

141
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,640
for the best user experience
becomes very, very real.

142
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,440
And we sometimes look at that

143
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:04,570
and what we're trying to
do is get left of a breach,

144
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:07,700
left of a data exfiltration situation.

145
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,930
What I mean by left is before it happens,

146
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:11,120
how can we get there?

147
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,760
And by the way, it's not an easy task,

148
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,020
because if you just think about

149
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,710
how fast the industry's moving,

150
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,010
this digital transformation
is being driven,

151
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:23,630
there are over 100 million
lines of new code annually

152
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:26,730
that are being produced by
enterprises and organizations

153
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:27,563
out in the world.

154
00:06:27,563 --> 00:06:29,909
Every one of those can
be a vulnerability breach

155
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:30,810
that's out there.

156
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:34,470
There's over 120 million malware variants

157
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:37,070
that the hackers are bringing
out that the security vendors

158
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:40,120
need to kind of provide protection for it.

159
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:43,810
And if you look at the
stats, it says that by 2023,

160
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:46,150
there'll be three times
the number of endpoints.

161
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:49,280
So that's more endpoints
accessing more applications

162
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,450
with more code, more points of attack.

163
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:55,020
The attack surface is increasing.

164
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,680
We have to get much better at that.

165
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,310
One of the components that
we're very excited about

166
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:01,690
that we think is a critical component

167
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:04,640
is how do you understand
the behavior of a user?

168
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,469
So it's not only how do
I provide these services,

169
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:10,260
these security services,
but the security services

170
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:13,550
classically have been a white
list black list approach.

171
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:14,870
It's either good to do something

172
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,700
or it's bad to do something.

173
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,520
The reality is you also need to understand

174
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,109
the intent of a user,

175
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:21,690
and what I mean by the intent of a user

176
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:23,560
is what is the user doing?

177
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,850
Users could be doing
things unintentionally

178
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:28,140
that could be malicious
inside your environment,

179
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:30,250
that could create a breach of some kind,

180
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,280
that could create data exfiltration,

181
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,200
or they might be actually
trying to do that, right?

182
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,860
So understanding the behavior

183
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:39,470
and the intent of a user is critical,

184
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:42,740
and if you could understand
that and provide that context

185
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:44,700
with the rest of the security services,

186
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:48,469
you have better efficacy to be
able to defend that situation

187
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:53,470
and get left of that breach,
get left of that exfiltration.

188
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:56,530
- And you have already
touched upon the hybrid model,

189
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:59,664
but would the same system be in place

190
00:07:59,665 --> 00:08:02,370
if organizations have a foot in the cloud

191
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:04,650
and have a foot in the
data center environment?

192
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,210
What's the best path forward for them?

193
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:09,020
- We're gonna see this hybrid world.

194
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:12,640
The key is how you orchestrate
around that hybrid world.

195
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,159
And to orchestrate
around that hybrid world,

196
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,510
the most important thing is that

197
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:18,640
you don't have a two-headed policy,

198
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,669
that you don't have a
solution for your on-prem,

199
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:22,590
a set of security
solutions for your on-prem

200
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:25,530
and a set of security
solutions for the cloud.

201
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:27,270
Because what ends up
happening is then you have

202
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:29,750
two management systems
that you need to manage

203
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,670
two different sets of infrastructure

204
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:34,549
and two policies that you
have to keep synchronized.

205
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:37,390
It's important, Georgie,
if you're in the office,

206
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:39,970
that the policies that you're
granted be very similar

207
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:42,340
potentially in the policies
that if you're traveling.

208
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,490
They may vary a little bit,
but they should be similar.

209
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:45,620
It shouldn't be two systems,

210
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,450
two organizations managing that.

211
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:50,340
So the hybrid world
needs the same security,

212
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,640
whether you're on-prem or in the cloud,

213
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,390
but the policy frame has to be integrated

214
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:58,900
to make it simpler to do
that as we move forward.

215
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,560
So it obviously is a
little bit more complex

216
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,864
because we're bringing
the legacy environment

217
00:09:03,865 --> 00:09:05,590
and the new, if you
will, cloud environment

218
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:08,913
and blending them together
through common policy.

219
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,910
- Absolutely, and I mean ultimately,

220
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:14,870
I guess, sort of the vision is using

221
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:18,510
this risk adaptive security
platform to really allow,

222
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:20,340
to get into that proactive security

223
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:24,070
rather than reactive security
that you were speaking about.

224
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:26,150
- Yeah, absolutely. Look,
it's a game changer.

225
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,670
I'll give you a couple of examples.

226
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:30,040
So as the CEO of Forcepoint,

227
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,810
I'm entitled to see a lot of information.

228
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:36,020
Let's say, for example,
that I'm accessing that data

229
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,650
and I'm doing something like I'm doing

230
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:39,600
screen captures of that data.

231
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,080
That may not be that out of the normal

232
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,330
if I did that every day.

233
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:45,040
The system should know you're behaving

234
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,150
or not behaving in a normal pattern.

235
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:50,140
But let's say I capture
the whole customer record,

236
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:54,240
every one of our customers
through 1,000 screen captures,

237
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,520
and my risk score should
probably go up a little bit.

238
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,310
It should raise a flag that this is not

239
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:00,079
a normal behavior for Manny.

240
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,340
And now let's say that
I take that and I put it

241
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:05,840
into a folder and I call it
Manny's Best Hits, right?

242
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,420
That may raise the risk
score a little bit more.

243
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:10,120
And then I take that folder
and I encrypt that folder.

244
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,750
As I'm doing that, the context
of what I'm actually doing

245
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,650
is out of the normal behavior.

246
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:20,010
How do you apply that through
the security policies you have

247
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:21,840
and the security services you have

248
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:26,550
to potentially restrict it or
at minimum notify somebody?

249
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:27,660
And if you could restrict it

250
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,680
and actually automate the action,

251
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,780
like what if I try to move that file now

252
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:34,079
out to my box folder

253
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,770
or my Microsoft folder out there?

254
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,645
I may want to block that information

255
00:10:39,645 --> 00:10:43,110
and pick up a message on the
screen saying not permitted.

256
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,990
So this concept of being proactive

257
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:48,220
and understanding the behavior of a user

258
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:51,235
and the intent of a user
with the security services

259
00:10:51,235 --> 00:10:53,844
allows you to provide more context

260
00:10:53,844 --> 00:10:56,870
and the results of that
provide better policy.

261
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:57,790
- Absolutely.

262
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:00,130
And these changes that you
speak about are really exciting.

263
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:02,820
I guess the bigger question is actually

264
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,350
who is leading this transformation?

265
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:07,100
Do you think there's
actually an opportunity here

266
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,720
for the industry to come
together a little bit more

267
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,610
to sort of forge that path forward?

268
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:13,443
- Yeah.

269
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:16,820
The industry does need to come together,

270
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,020
there's no question about that.

271
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:20,670
Think about the challenges
the customers have.

272
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:22,223
No matter what customer you talk to,

273
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:24,510
they will tell you they had 50,

274
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:27,110
sometimes up to 100 security vendors.

275
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:29,950
And they're trying to stich them together

276
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:32,720
to create a security framework

277
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,520
that's evolving at a very fast pace

278
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,480
because the digital transformation

279
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,930
is changing at a very fast pace

280
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:41,500
and the attack surface is
changing at a very fast pace.

281
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,776
So it's a daunting task.

282
00:11:43,776 --> 00:11:46,010
We've been seeing in the industry

283
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:48,939
for the last five years to a decade

284
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:51,710
is the concept of bringing
in those services,

285
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:55,390
those security services,
more into a unified platform.

286
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:58,870
And obviously as a vendor, you
could create that platform,

287
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:02,670
but open it up through a set
of APIs to let the partnership,

288
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:05,800
the rest of the security
ecosystem work with you

289
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,410
to create a better framework.

290
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:09,490
And we're seeing that.

291
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:13,080
The most recent example
of that is what we call,

292
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,570
or the industry Gartner
has coined as SASE,

293
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:18,360
secure access services edge,

294
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,360
which is predominantly an architecture.

295
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,550
It's not a product, it's an architecture,

296
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,400
how you stitch the services together

297
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,020
in a much more dynamic way

298
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:29,010
and how you can create that architecture

299
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:32,720
to provide security
services for this movement,

300
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,200
this mobility, work
from home cloud movement

301
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,210
and be able to secure that environment

302
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:40,690
and those traffic patterns

303
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:43,950
like you did in the
classic perimeter days.

304
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:46,690
So yeah, it is something that is critical

305
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:49,240
and it is accelerating inside the industry

306
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,250
and something we need to do
a better job all together at.

307
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,070
We're excited about the opportunity.

308
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:56,280
As we look at platforms we're building,

309
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,589
we're trying to make
sure that they're open

310
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:00,691
and enable the ecosystem to thrive.

311
00:13:00,691 --> 00:13:03,178
- Absolutely, so it sort of
fits within this ecosystem

312
00:13:03,178 --> 00:13:05,820
of multiple people working together.

313
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:06,970
Well Manny, that almost brings us

314
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:08,709
to the end of this fireside chat.

315
00:13:08,709 --> 00:13:10,579
Have you any final thoughts

316
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,900
you'd like to leave the
audience at home with?

317
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,209
- Well, the most important thing is that

318
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:17,210
I think we're in a journey here, right?

319
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:20,100
And we refer to this as
the unbound enterprise

320
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,490
because we believe that it's
gonna continue to unravel

321
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:24,500
as we move forward.

322
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,890
The industry is, there's
no question about it,

323
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:29,130
there's this digital
transformation that's occurring.

324
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:31,550
If you don't participate
in it and the enhancements

325
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:33,199
that are happening in that
digital transformation,

326
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,820
with things like machine
learning and AI that are coming

327
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,880
that are gonna continue to
advance the way we do business

328
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,950
and the way we interact among users

329
00:13:41,932 --> 00:13:46,670
and among users to business,
B2B, B2C type of environments.

330
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:48,530
It's important that people

331
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:50,709
bring their security frameworks forward

332
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:54,033
to be able to participate in
this unleashing, if you will,

333
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:55,460
of this unbound enterprise.

334
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,670
Without it, you will get left behind

335
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,550
because you won't have
the technology innovation,

336
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:01,770
and without the security
being coupled to it,

337
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:04,740
the cybersecurity that's
required, you have the possibility

338
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,580
of getting exposed or hacked or attacked,

339
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:09,610
which has equal impact as an organization.

340
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:12,570
So we're super excited at Forcepoint

341
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:14,270
at what we're bringing to market

342
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,819
and how the industry is
developing to be able

343
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:19,210
to really address the needs of the future

344
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:22,234
and address the needs of
this unbound enterprise.

345
00:14:22,234 --> 00:14:25,560
- It really is such an
exciting and dynamic time.

346
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,170
And I think as you rightly said,

347
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:31,660
if the industry can pull
together to create this ecosystem

348
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:35,120
that really empowers businesses
instead of hindering them,

349
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,670
then that's such an exciting thing

350
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:40,550
because ultimately, as you
said, cybersecurity is the key

351
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:43,490
to giving businesses
that competitive edge,

352
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:47,153
that we'll really see they'll
not only survive, but thrive.

353
00:14:47,153 --> 00:14:50,370
