00:00:02,073 --> 00:00:04,740
(music)

2
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:18,130
- Hi, I'm Doug Merritt,
president and CEO of Splunk,

3
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:20,883
the creators of the data
to everything platform.

4
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:24,220
2020 pushed our society to new limits,

5
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:26,430
with the pandemic presenting
challenges that none

6
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,490
of us had seen before.

7
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:30,979
Now that we're well over a year in,

8
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:33,490
we're able to spot a few lessons learned.

9
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:35,640
And one takeaway is clear.

10
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,190
Data is central to solving
the world's toughest problems.

11
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,309
Whether through contact tracing for COVID

12
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:46,300
or unwinding mass scale
cybersecurity attacks data has

13
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,070
been central to providing the answers

14
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:50,053
that we needed this year.

15
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:54,420
And coupled with this
realization as we look ahead,

16
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,020
it has never been more clear

17
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:58,803
that security is a data problem.

18
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:03,010
Before I get into how your
organization is gonna navigate

19
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:05,379
this, I wanna talk about one way

20
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:07,910
this data problem is manifesting itself.

21
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:10,190
If you're like thousands of
leaders and teams that we talked

22
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:14,600
to, I'd imagine that right now
you're feeling the weight of

23
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,479
the anxiety of whether you've gathered

24
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,280
and are working with a complete set

25
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,440
of the facts that describe your landscape.

26
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,500
You recognize that there
is a high potential

27
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,870
for your source data to suffer

28
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:28,050
from poor integrity and authenticity.

29
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:31,380
And frankly, you're
likely feeling exhausted

30
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,789
from trying to keep up with
the ever growing volume

31
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:34,863
of data sources.

32
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,170
Among my fellow CEOs, we're
constantly talking about

33
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:40,960
the climate of misinformation
that we're living in.

34
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,039
But the truth lying in
different areas that need to

35
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,173
be pieced together like a complex puzzle.

36
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:51,300
This complexity is the
number one challenge

37
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,009
your CISOs and SOC teams are addressing.

38
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:56,150
They have so many data
sources and end points

39
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:59,405
and now whole hosts of
other control points that

40
00:01:59,405 --> 00:02:02,420
they're securing usually
with no standard way

41
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:06,840
of understand the efficacy
or integrity of that data.

42
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,440
And again, the impacts are
clear, a high level of what

43
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,109
I call data anxiety and
fear around the integrity

44
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:16,923
of the data itself all
while your people are tired.

45
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:20,150
Some of you have talked with
me over the years about this

46
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:22,410
and you know that I applaud innovations

47
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:25,840
like blockchain to
progress data integrity.

48
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,050
I'm going to continue to
champion those efforts

49
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:31,360
because the search for
truth is important to Splunk

50
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,215
and to me personally.

51
00:02:33,215 --> 00:02:35,352
Data is the foundation of insight

52
00:02:35,352 --> 00:02:39,213
and we must be able to
trust our foundations.

53
00:02:39,213 --> 00:02:41,596
I believe that the search for truth

54
00:02:41,597 --> 00:02:46,350
through data made valuable by
analytics is the only remedy

55
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:48,343
for the anxiety that we're feeling.

56
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,640
With that, I'm here to
talk about what you can

57
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,809
do starting today as your
teams navigate decision-making

58
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:58,453
within such a complex security landscape.

59
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,670
When we experience a cyber
attack whether motivated

60
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:05,429
by politics, money or street cred,

61
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:07,970
the victims always ask themselves what led

62
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:10,840
to our data being accessed, which data

63
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,110
and always when and why?

64
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,140
No attack is ever without fingerprints

65
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,250
to answer such questions.

66
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:21,510
The ability to find fingerprints
and traces of threats

67
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:24,311
within data is what
separates the innovators

68
00:03:24,312 --> 00:03:26,360
from the followers.

69
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,560
If you take the same approach
as we did for contact tracing

70
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,600
for COVID-19, you can
imagine the results that you

71
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,430
could reach for your business.

72
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:36,160
You could shrink dwell times,

73
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,400
you could stamp out major threats.

74
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,383
You could fundamentally change the game.

75
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,980
To achieve this your
organization needs to take

76
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:48,760
a different approach to
security beginning today.

77
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,560
It's not just about having the right data.

78
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,830
You have to marshal the most effective use

79
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:55,810
of your data to help prioritize, analyze

80
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:58,467
and achieve the best security outcomes.

81
00:03:58,467 --> 00:04:00,260
I've witnessed incredible results

82
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:03,692
from organizations going
all in with their data.

83
00:04:03,693 --> 00:04:06,467
For example, when the
pandemic hit the University

84
00:04:06,467 --> 00:04:09,557
of Arizona put its data-driven
philosophy to the test

85
00:04:09,557 --> 00:04:13,390
to securely move 60,000 students, faculty

86
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:15,279
and staff off campus.

87
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,120
To do that the university
unified data from its VPN,

88
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,200
Single sign-on systems, wireless networks

89
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,760
and zoom traffic all on
one analytics platform.

90
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:27,360
It did this for better
security and performance.

91
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,320
This ultimately enabled
the University of Arizona

92
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,053
to take actions based on actual data

93
00:04:32,053 --> 00:04:35,240
rather than relying on assumptions.

94
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,300
Another company has gone all
in with its data is Intel.

95
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,800
Intel's InfoSec team created
a comprehensive defense

96
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:46,210
in depth strategy built on
a unified data foundation.

97
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:49,810
The team leaned on Intel's
data to automate prevention

98
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:51,740
and detection tools across one

99
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:54,560
of the most advanced
enterprises on the planet.

100
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,115
This included perimeter,
network, endpoints, applications

101
00:04:58,115 --> 00:05:00,320
and the data layer itself.

102
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,580
So they could handle 99%

103
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:05,510
of threats targeting Intel's environment.

104
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:09,289
As Brent Conran, Intel's
CISO told us, this was

105
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:12,380
a force multiplier for
their cyberintelligence.

106
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,430
Recent security events like

107
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:16,000
the SolarWind supply
chain attack hammered home

108
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,140
how important it is for you to have access

109
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:20,546
to all the data we needed the most.

110
00:05:20,547 --> 00:05:24,790
And advance analytics capabilities
that deliver intelligence

111
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:27,223
for your teams to prioritize incidents.

112
00:05:27,223 --> 00:05:30,070
In other words, you need
the ability to trace

113
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,429
for answers across a
massive amount of data

114
00:05:32,429 --> 00:05:35,220
while also responding faster.

115
00:05:35,221 --> 00:05:38,526
That rapid response requires
streamlining existing security

116
00:05:38,526 --> 00:05:42,100
operations particularly through automation

117
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,184
and security analytics, of course,

118
00:05:44,184 --> 00:05:47,021
all driven by machine learning.

119
00:05:47,021 --> 00:05:51,620
And finally you need end
to end integration to not

120
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:54,960
only centralize your data for
analysis on the front end,

121
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,789
but to orchestrate a
response on the trailing end.

122
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:00,395
So your teams can act
as quickly as possible.

123
00:06:00,395 --> 00:06:03,895
So let's start with this first
point on access analytics.

124
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:06,520
Executives often ask me, "All right,

125
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,200
what kind of data is
the right data to use?"

126
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,969
And I respond, "All data".

127
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:13,440
I know that sounds self-serving coming

128
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,020
from a big data platform and
security solutions company

129
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,719
but it's actually true.

130
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,450
All data is security relevant.

131
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:22,150
Having access to all of your data

132
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:24,510
and making efficient
use of it is fundamental

133
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:28,440
to prioritizing and solving
your security challenges.

134
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:32,510
Now you might be cringing at
the idea of even more data.

135
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:34,930
I get it, I know that
every one of your SOCs

136
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:36,570
are overwhelmed and most of

137
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:40,420
your security analysts
workflows are fragmented.

138
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,710
Splunk is getting ready to launch

139
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:44,229
our inaugural State of Security Report.

140
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:45,770
And when I read some
of our findings related

141
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:48,460
to this growing complexity,
there are a few stats

142
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:51,000
that would make sense to preview here.

143
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,290
One, 76% of security leaders
say that remote workers

144
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:58,160
are harder to secure, kind of makes sense.

145
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,090
But two, 78% of companies expect

146
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:05,919
another SolarWind style
supply chain attack, 78%.

147
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,410
Your team has already
seen the new challenges

148
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:12,400
that keep emerging that will
only continue from here.

149
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,080
The only way to navigate
this complex threat landscape

150
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,700
is to go all in on your data.

151
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,840
Your SOC teams need to
collect data from across silos

152
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,162
and correlate for true
visibility and insight.

153
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,880
Next, you need streamlined
security operations

154
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,270
particularly through automation
and security analytics.

155
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,530
Let's start by acknowledging

156
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:35,590
that we're all making some progress.

157
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:37,260
The security firm, Mandiant, has found

158
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,500
that the global median dwell time

159
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,850
or the number of days an
attacker remains undetected

160
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:44,320
in the victim's network has been dropping.

161
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:48,500
Some great news, from 78 days
in 2018 to 56 days in 2019

162
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,980
down to 17 days in 2020.

163
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:54,720
Now that progress is good, of
course, but there is no way,

164
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,360
no way that anyone out there can feel good

165
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,800
about 17 days of dwell time.

166
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:04,800
17 days, that's more than
24,000 minutes, 24,000 minutes

167
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:07,429
where an adversary sits undetected.

168
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:09,280
When we all know that
it takes fewer than five

169
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,652
of those minutes for an adversary to act.

170
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:15,230
Your organization can do better.

171
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:16,420
Data fueled automation

172
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,880
and security analytics
driven machine learning help

173
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,830
your teams automate as much as possible.

174
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:25,140
So those teams can then act
on the bigger priorities

175
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:29,113
that matter while detecting
threats far more rapidly.

176
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:32,440
That's why the majority
of conversations I have

177
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,549
with customers today start with questions

178
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:38,193
about further implementing
automation or machine learning.

179
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:41,490
I know that establishing a framework

180
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:44,810
around this works because
I've seen it in action.

181
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:47,709
Splunk's own CISO and our
global security team have taken

182
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:51,220
this approach to look at
all of our data from across

183
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:54,910
the organization, nearly 7,000
Splunkers around the world,

184
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:57,719
to identify our priority
areas for security.

185
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,730
We went all in on our own data

186
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:02,393
and then we identify where to prioritize.

187
00:09:03,379 --> 00:09:06,610
What Splunk's own security
team has also proven is

188
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:08,810
that implementing zero
trust does not have to

189
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:11,670
be a build from scratch exercise.

190
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:14,290
It can actually start as a remodel.

191
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:16,000
There are so many learnings sitting

192
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,280
in your current environment
and that's exactly

193
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,410
why you wanna go all in
to capture your data.

194
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:23,360
Rebuilding a zero trust framework from

195
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,090
the ground up might sound
great but the majority

196
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:30,750
of these clean sheet
exercises fail to deliver.

197
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,740
While your current
environment can be messy

198
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:36,080
there are years of lessons
learned and all of those u-turns

199
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,710
and dead ends that cyber teams have had

200
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:40,820
to make to get the job done.

201
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:43,680
Unearthing that wisdom
comes from bringing data

202
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,575
from the dark into the light.

203
00:09:46,576 --> 00:09:48,230
Splunk's development team by

204
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:50,810
the way also follow this philosophy.

205
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:51,839
For the past four years,

206
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,750
we've been rearchitecting our platform

207
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:56,310
and solutions to be cloud first.

208
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:59,319
To do this we've been driving continual,

209
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,029
deconstruct-reconstruct exercises

210
00:10:02,029 --> 00:10:03,963
versus building from scratch.

211
00:10:05,057 --> 00:10:08,270
Our own biology and billions
of years of evolution

212
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:11,590
have shown us that our world
is emergent, always evolving.

213
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:15,070
Mother nature runs infinite,
simultaneous experiments

214
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:17,590
with really strong feedback loops.

215
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:20,019
Partner with a company
and a set of technologies

216
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:23,430
that understands and
follows this framework.

217
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:25,650
Take the time to play with and learn

218
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:29,150
from the past and then
remodel your SOC rather

219
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,750
than tearing it down completely.

220
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:34,700
Last, with the right
technologies and techniques

221
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,780
you can improve the trajectory

222
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:39,250
of your teams' security insights

223
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:42,320
and those incredibly valuable aha moments.

224
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,510
How?

225
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,610
Like so many things in
life, we're all better

226
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:47,960
when we work together.

227
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:51,330
Look around the virtual
floor of this RSA conference

228
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:53,450
and you'll see so many innovative tools

229
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:56,810
and solutions to solve distinct problems.

230
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:59,199
None of that matters if
there's no integration

231
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,000
or sharing of data across
these on-prem cloud

232
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,140
and hybrid cloud tools.

233
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,629
Closed ecosystems have failed

234
00:11:06,629 --> 00:11:09,300
the industry time and time again.

235
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,990
They're simply not the answer.

236
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:14,260
You need to tap a thriving
and open ecosystem of partners

237
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:17,840
and community members to
reduce integration complexity

238
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,400
and get more value from your data.

239
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,650
Now I know who I'm
talking to, you're like me

240
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:25,670
and you're always looking
for the best of breed.

241
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:28,060
Best of breed security
tools are important.

242
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:30,469
Given the complexity of
our cyber environment,

243
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:34,110
we by default use lots of tools.

244
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,670
Splunk is right there with them

245
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:39,760
as the best of breed data layer, period.

246
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,720
We have a strong product
and technology team

247
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:46,440
of more than 2000 people who
focus 24/7 on data tools,

248
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,800
data solutions and the machine learning

249
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,520
that bring them all to life.

250
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,260
An ecosystem of hundreds
of thousands of people

251
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:56,710
who compliment what the
full-time Splunk team is driving.

252
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:58,220
When we define what we wanted to see in

253
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:01,890
an inclusive environment, our
mantra from day one focused

254
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:04,490
on building a broad and open platform.

255
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,430
Unlike the deep and narrow solutions

256
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:08,329
that we saw in the market.

257
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:11,010
Organizations like yours
have put their trust

258
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:15,720
in point solutions that as
by-product leave you as silos

259
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,680
of data and subsequently
less than desirable outcomes.

260
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,632
Compliment that activity with
a best of breed data layer.

261
00:12:25,267 --> 00:12:27,810
Whether it's addressing a global pandemic

262
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:31,510
or attacking the latest cyber
crime data holds the answers

263
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:33,740
to life's most challenging moments.

264
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:36,470
And again, data based decision making is

265
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:39,894
what separates the innovators
from the followers.

266
00:12:39,894 --> 00:12:42,850
So let me leave you with an example

267
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:45,690
that brings these best practices together.

268
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:48,660
Collaboration tightened
Slack creates an environment

269
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,900
where remote workers
can organize information

270
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,640
and conversations around data.

271
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,380
Every day more than 12
million active users

272
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:59,500
within 750,000 organizations rely

273
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,680
on Slack as our collaboration hub

274
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,160
to bring people information
and tools together.

275
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,689
When the pandemic hit
Slack needed to transition

276
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:10,930
its own employees to remote
work while also continuing

277
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:13,664
to provide a secure
enterprise grade service

278
00:13:13,664 --> 00:13:16,210
to its booming user base.

279
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:17,710
Using one unified platform

280
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:19,940
to power did driven decision-making,

281
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:23,410
Slack has seamlessly transition
to remote work operating

282
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:25,550
under a zero trust network.

283
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:27,609
And because we're living
in the area of hybrid

284
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:29,210
and multi-cloud environments,

285
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:32,040
Slack verifies it
security using visibility

286
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,913
into all activity across all
of its many cloud services.

287
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:39,898
To wrap things up, I'd like to applaud

288
00:13:39,898 --> 00:13:41,380
the global community's work

289
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:44,410
on contact tracing for COVID 19 and more.

290
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:47,469
It's been a long year but the healthcare

291
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:50,920
and broader community showed
that the more data we have,

292
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:54,382
the better decisions
and actions we deliver.

293
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:57,630
Time is a precious commodity,

294
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:00,890
maximize it by bringing
data and analytics,

295
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:05,210
streamlined operations and
an open ecosystem together

296
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:09,053
to drive faster more informed
results for your business.
