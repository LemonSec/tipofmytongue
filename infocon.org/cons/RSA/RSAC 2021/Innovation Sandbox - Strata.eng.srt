- [Announer] Please welcome Co-Founder

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,070
and Chief Product Officer of Strata,

4
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:18,060
Eric Leach.

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,430
- We live in a multi-cloud world

6
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,560
where infrastructure, and data,

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,140
and apps are all distributed.

8
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,470
Most enterprises have
at least three clouds,

9
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,090
all with their own identity systems.

10
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:33,440
Identity silos are proliferating.

11
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,269
APIs and capabilities are fragmenting.

12
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:37,830
And rewriting your apps

13
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,949
to work with an identity system

14
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:42,060
is expensive and complex.

15
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,040
It's really easy for
an app to get locked in

16
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,573
to that identity system.

17
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:51,910
So, how do you make
identity work seamlessly

18
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:54,193
across multiple clouds
and identity systems?

19
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,610
The Strata team is uniquely suited

20
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:00,810
to solve this problem.

21
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,210
We've been innovating
in the identity space

22
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:04,970
since the beginning, helping to build

23
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:07,289
the products and develop the standards

24
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,113
that made the identity
market what it is today.

25
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:13,580
Knowing that old thinking

26
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,770
wouldn't solve new problems,

27
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:19,100
we set out to build the
world's first-distributed

28
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:23,309
identity orchestration
platform called Maverics.

29
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:28,310
Using Maverics makes many
identity systems work as one

30
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,410
and helps to break the lock-in

31
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:35,823
of apps working with identity systems.

32
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:41,560
So how does it work?

33
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,450
You deploy Maverics.

34
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:47,090
The Maverics platform has
a unique and patented way

35
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:50,730
of discovering and integrating
with any identity system

36
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:52,960
and then abstracting all of those APIs,

37
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,080
creating an identity fabric.

38
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,670
Our connector catalog

39
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,360
makes this work through
simple configuration,

40
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,620
and you can use service extensions

41
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:04,623
to integrate with virtually
any identity system.

42
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:08,060
Through a simple declarative model,

43
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:11,009
you can create your own
identity orchestrations.

44
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:13,299
Policies let you
orchestrate authentication

45
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,170
from a cloud identity system,

46
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:16,530
look up user attributes

47
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:19,140
from on-prem directories or databases,

48
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,359
add second factor to an
app with an MFA provider,

49
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,400
or get complex policy decisions

50
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,083
from an authorization provider.

51
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,910
Maverics acts as a control plane

52
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:30,930
that delivers identity to apps

53
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:33,370
exactly as they need it.

54
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:36,010
You can swap in or out identity systems,

55
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:39,190
add new capabilities such
as MFA or risk scoring,

56
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:41,720
and layer on advanced
identity capabilities

57
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,943
without changing or rewriting your apps.

58
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,010
Using Maverics, you build
identity orchestrations.

59
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:52,700
This example shows assembling
various identity systems

60
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:56,709
so a user can request
access to an app safely.

61
00:02:56,710 --> 00:03:00,840
Other recipes allow you to
migrate user identities and apps,

62
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,530
or do secure hybrid
access to on-prem apps,

63
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:09,520
or swap out identity systems
in case of an outage.

64
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,320
For the largest enterprises with the most

65
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,150
complex distributed
environments like Kroger,

66
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,600
Maverics solves a problem

67
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,570
of proliferating identity silos,

68
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:20,459
fragmented APIs, and app lock-in.
