1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,600
- Hello everyone, I'm a researcher at,

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:07,830
the Center for Long at CLTC UC Berkeley.

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:09,050
and a cybersecurity profession

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:10,540
with over seven years experience

5
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,620
focusing on penetration testing

6
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:15,520
and developing Secure System Architecture,

7
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,160
and we're going to discuss
the MITRE Framework

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,190
for Cloud Threat Investigation,

9
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:21,980
this is my colleague Tanu.

10
00:00:22,824 --> 00:00:25,420
- Hello, I'm a graduate student researcher

11
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:28,597
at CLTC UC Berkeley, with
12 years of experience

12
00:00:28,597 --> 00:00:31,830
in security cloud, IT operations,

13
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:34,250
and user services in I specialized in

14
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:37,053
Identity Access Management
and Cloud Security.

15
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:41,048
- Here's our agenda,

16
00:00:41,048 --> 00:00:44,130
we'll provide an overview of
your MITRE ATT&CK framework,

17
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:46,521
and then discuss the
current security landscape

18
00:00:46,521 --> 00:00:48,830
for cloud security before discussing

19
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:51,269
how we can apply the
MITRE ATT&CK framework

20
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:56,270
as well as any challenges
that arise from implementation

21
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,260
and go over the survey that we conducted.

22
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,559
Then we'll wrap up with our
recommendations and a Q&A.

23
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:08,890
So MITRE is a nonprofit
cybersecurity think tank,

24
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:10,908
that developed the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

25
00:01:10,908 --> 00:01:14,370
They describe it as a globally
accessible knowledge base

26
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:15,203
of adversary tactics and techniques,

27
00:01:15,203 --> 00:01:17,490
based on real-world observations.

28
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:20,056
Technology-based is used as a foundation

29
00:01:20,057 --> 00:01:22,800
for a development of
specific threat models

30
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,130
and methodologies in the
private sector, government,

31
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:27,982
and in the cybersecurity
product and service community.

32
00:01:27,982 --> 00:01:32,982
Within the framework, we
examined two matrices.

33
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,071
The general enterprise matrix

34
00:01:34,071 --> 00:01:35,048
and the cloud-based matrix

35
00:01:35,048 --> 00:01:40,048
for describing cloud-based techniques.

36
00:01:40,383 --> 00:01:45,383
The ATT&CK framework consists of matrices,

37
00:01:46,033 --> 00:01:50,140
and each of these matrices
contains 12 categories

38
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,733
kind of which are shared
across all matrices.

39
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:58,580
The categories include initial
access, privilege escalation,

40
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:02,810
methods of persistence, how
to evade defenses and so on.

41
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:05,282
various techniques that attackers can use

42
00:02:05,282 --> 00:02:09,079
in attack scenarios.

43
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,990
We encourage all our viewers to check out

44
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:13,210
the MITRE ATT&CK website,

45
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:15,340
to get more of the details.

46
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:18,520
Here we will highlight the
common cloud native threats

47
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,620
and discuss how companies
are investigating

48
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:25,753
cloud threats today, which
colleague Tanu will go over.

49
00:02:26,985 --> 00:02:29,680
- To answer this question
as part of our research,

50
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,800
we conducted a survey.

51
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,590
Our research was focused
on analyzing the challenges

52
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:38,030
that enterprise currently
face in cloud security

53
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,980
and for a comprehensive assessment,

54
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:42,980
we conducted a survey of
security leaders including

55
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:47,980
CISO, CIO, CTO and
Security Operation Analysts

56
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:53,220
across 325 large and
medium-sized enterprises

57
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:56,500
in UK, U.S, and Australia.

58
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:01,500
57% of our global survey
respondents are large enterprises

59
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:06,770
and 62% have an in-house
Security Operation Center.

60
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:10,781
We categorize enterprises
with 5,000 employees as large

61
00:03:10,781 --> 00:03:14,073
and 1000 plus is medium-sized.

62
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:18,048
We targeted diverse sectors of our survey

63
00:03:18,048 --> 00:03:23,048
including IT, technology,
telecom, retail, transport

64
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:26,673
financial services,
manufacturing and production

65
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:29,113
and other sectors.

66
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,590
We investigated the challenges faced by

67
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:36,800
security operations teams and
evaluated the use and impact

68
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,790
of standardized frameworks
for threat investigation.

69
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:45,290
We hypothesized that MITRE
ATT&CK would be the most

70
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:47,530
widely adopted framework

71
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:51,360
and the survey results
validated the assumption.

72
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,720
We interviewed 10 leading
cybersecurity experts

73
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,083
to further validate our study.

74
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:02,740
Cloud computing enables
any organization to be

75
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,650
to use hardware and software resources

76
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:09,140
housed in cloud service
providers data center.

77
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:12,079
Our survey indicates
that across the industry

78
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,910
protocols we surveyed, Hybrid cloud

79
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:17,274
is the most popular
deployment architecture

80
00:04:17,274 --> 00:04:20,320
across all major providers.

81
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,570
Among our survey respondents
Azure was more popular

82
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:28,630
than expected, about 64% used Azure

83
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,540
and Azure was also most popular

84
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,960
in all three market
segments by a great margin.

85
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,810
We hypothesized this is
due to service sampling

86
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:41,223
in a large enterprises and
government agencies that we had.

87
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:47,150
Currently, three service
models represent the fastest

88
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:50,810
growing sector of the
cloud computing market.

89
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:55,810
Although SaaS, the largest
or most widely adopted still.

90
00:04:59,554 --> 00:05:03,030
Still, Saas is the largest
and the most widely adopted

91
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:06,092
out of all three cloud
service options available.

92
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:10,530
While cloud computing
provides the flexibility,

93
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:12,549
to choose from various service models

94
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:14,610
and deployment architectures,

95
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:18,580
it also presents serious security issues.

96
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:22,070
These service models requires
varying responsibilities

97
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:26,733
to be shared between the cloud
provider and the customer.

98
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:31,330
The Iaas model assigns the
responsibility for the security

99
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:35,085
of the lower layers like
storage, networking, server

100
00:05:35,086 --> 00:05:39,270
and virtualization do the cloud provider.

101
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:41,950
The customer is responsible
for the security

102
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:44,870
of the operating system and everything

103
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:47,210
that runs on top of it.

104
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:49,640
In the IaaS Model, the
cloud service provider

105
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:53,723
has the responsibility,
which is basically minimum

106
00:05:53,723 --> 00:05:56,360
or least responsibility.

107
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,577
In the Paas Model, the cloud provider

108
00:05:58,577 --> 00:06:01,990
is responsible for everything

109
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:05,446
but the data and application,
including networking

110
00:06:05,446 --> 00:06:09,939
storage, servers,
virtualization, operating system

111
00:06:09,939 --> 00:06:12,880
middleware and runtime.

112
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,650
In the SaaS Model, the
cloud service provider

113
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:19,429
is responsible for everything
related to security

114
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:21,930
off the service that they operate.

115
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:24,600
The greater the cloud
service providers control

116
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,810
of the service model, the
more security responsibilities

117
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:31,040
the cloud provider has.

118
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:35,290
However, in every service
model, the customer

119
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:38,640
is responsible for
configuring the service,

120
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,599
managing user accounts,

121
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,253
and critically protecting its own data.

122
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:49,870
How is the SOC handling
cloud threats? Jasdeep

123
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:54,000
- Thank you Tanu, for that overview.

124
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,238
When it comes to the Security
Operations Center or SOC,

125
00:06:57,238 --> 00:07:02,238
cloud is still a relatively
new field of investigation.

126
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:06,880
And there's significant issues
with having a large team

127
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,117
of dedicated cloud threat investigators

128
00:07:09,117 --> 00:07:11,893
and a lot of manning issues as a result.

129
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,295
We've then reviewed
how these organizations

130
00:07:15,295 --> 00:07:18,786
investigated the threats in the SOC

131
00:07:18,786 --> 00:07:22,300
and due to distributed
nature of cloud computing,

132
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:26,380
now globally accessible, it
is for users in the internet.

133
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:29,270
There's a complexity in
identifying and investigating

134
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:31,358
cloud threats across networks, endpoints

135
00:07:31,358 --> 00:07:35,373
and cloud components
used by the enterprise.

136
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:39,740
We asked survey respondents to
identify which events sources

137
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:45,210
that they use the cloud
network or endpoint

138
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:48,183
to correlate data during
threat investigation.

139
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:52,870
Based on our interviews and
qualitative assessments,

140
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:55,710
we identified that the best
practice is to correlate data

141
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:59,700
from all three sources
instead of trying to isolate

142
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,503
and investigate threats separately.

143
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:05,740
However, we only found that two in five

144
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:09,170
about 39% of respondents
actually incorporate events

145
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:11,790
from all three environments

146
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:14,223
when they're investigating a threat.

147
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:16,860
This presents a problem.

148
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:20,170
According to a Red team
engineer they interviewed,

149
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:22,950
one technique that is used is to

150
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:27,599
go after cloud administrators by phishing

151
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:31,410
their on-prem workstations and using that

152
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:35,210
to then compromise the cloud environment.

153
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:39,250
So due to the popularity
of the hybrid deployment,

154
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:42,613
it's very difficult to
separate these environments.

155
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:46,450
Which is why we recommend that

156
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:48,710
all of it should be taken into account

157
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:50,660
when conducting a threat investigation.

158
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:57,450
Our survey respondents also
observed all 10 tactics

159
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:01,720
in the cloud matrix were
used from initial access

160
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:06,540
to cloud data exfiltration
on a consistent basis

161
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,300
either monthly or daily.

162
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,020
Organizations struggle

163
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,550
with the multiple threat
types concurrently.

164
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:16,010
Each one poses high risk.

165
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:19,860
Security operations teams
function to triage and remediate

166
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:23,330
this wide range of threats is difficult

167
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,834
when they don't have a
framework to prioritize

168
00:09:25,834 --> 00:09:30,660
and organize the threats that
are on a constant barrage.

169
00:09:34,178 --> 00:09:38,900
We further investigated how
security operations centers

170
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:42,350
could integrate the ATT&CK framework

171
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:43,883
and the value it provides.

172
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:49,080
What we found is 81%
of surveys respondents

173
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:54,653
currently use the ATT&CK
framework in general

174
00:09:56,390 --> 00:10:00,050
with 63% using the enterprise framework

175
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:04,473
and another 63% saying they're
using the cloud matrix.

176
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:07,930
Among those respondents we surveyed,

177
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:10,540
83% find that there is
comprehensively represents

178
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:15,579
the adversity and techniques they face.

179
00:10:15,579 --> 00:10:18,530
Among the (indistinct)
use the cloud matrix,

180
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:22,180
We found that 86 confirmed
that it comprehensively

181
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:25,363
represented the threats
they face on their end.

182
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:31,510
We also investigated how
well the level of adoption

183
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:35,870
each enterprise is with
adopting the ATT&CK framework

184
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,751
and cloud matrix specifically.

185
00:10:37,751 --> 00:10:42,751
We divided the respondents into six stages

186
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:45,390
with some having no plans to adopt

187
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:49,000
within pre-planning
stages, planning stages,

188
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,300
early implementation
where the ATT&CK framework

189
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:55,680
is just used for knowledge
management and references

190
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,900
intermediate stage, where it's used for

191
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:02,000
informed decision-making and
automate some of the responses

192
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,980
and the most advanced stage

193
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,773
which is proactive threat hunting.

194
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,220
From our investigation we found
that 44% of our respondents

195
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:13,260
have successfully implemented
the ATT&CK for cloud matrix

196
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:16,980
at the intermediate to
advanced stage and another 44%

197
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,793
were in the planning and
early implementation stages.

198
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,363
Due to this widespread adoption,

199
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:28,890
we also looked at what purpose it serves

200
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:32,720
for each organization
that's driving this adoption

201
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:35,540
which is different.

202
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:40,890
57% of respondents cited
that it was to help

203
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,730
determine gaps in currently
deployed security tools.

204
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:49,730
Another 55% used it to
implement security policies

205
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:54,770
and 54% cited threat modeling
as one of the main uses

206
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:56,020
for the ATT&CK framework.

207
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:01,173
With all these implementation,

208
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,970
with how well it's been implemented

209
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:07,380
there's still some
challenges that are faced

210
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,443
which my colleague Tanu will go over.

211
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:12,660
- Thanks Jas.

212
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:15,500
So we asked survey respondents to identify

213
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:19,270
the challenges they observed
while using the framework.

214
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:23,920
45% of organizations identified
the lack of interoperability

215
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,238
with security products
while using the attack.

216
00:12:27,239 --> 00:12:32,239
43% cited the difficulty
of mapping of events data

217
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,020
to tactics and techniques and 36% said

218
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:39,980
they received way too
many false positives.

219
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:42,570
Some of these challenges could be solved

220
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:46,020
by using security
products to tag the events

221
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:48,050
based on the ATT&CK framework.

222
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:51,130
According to the security
leaders we interviewed,

223
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:54,600
there is a need for more
products that tag events

224
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,250
based on the framework.

225
00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:00,570
However, they also
caution that near tagging

226
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:03,780
of events is not the sole requirement.

227
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:07,829
Tagging of events with
attack tactics and techniques

228
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:11,410
helps identify which events
should be prioritized

229
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:12,670
by the SOC.

230
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:15,620
For instance, exfiltration tactics

231
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:18,483
should be prioritized over initial access.

232
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,720
Based on our interviews
with the security leaders

233
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,350
we found it's critical that
individual organizations

234
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:30,370
should conduct continuous
testing to identify

235
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:34,890
the efficiency of all the
security products they use

236
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:38,130
in order to identify all
the techniques and tactics

237
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:41,489
sub techniques associated
with the attack tactics

238
00:13:41,489 --> 00:13:45,280
such as Initial Access Technique contains

239
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,257
three sub-techniques.

240
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:50,820
Continuous testing ensures
that their products tag

241
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:54,860
and alert techniques, and
also the sub techniques.

242
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:57,290
With these implementation recommendations,

243
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:00,270
we further inquired our respondents

244
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:04,093
about the future prospect
of using ATT&CK framework.

245
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:07,878
And based on our finding of the large

246
00:14:07,878 --> 00:14:11,400
and medium size enterprises we surveyed

247
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:16,400
63% use both ATT&CK for
cloud and enterprise matrices

248
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,360
in their current security
operations center.

249
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,533
87% of survey respondents agree

250
00:14:24,533 --> 00:14:28,810
that adopting and
responding using the ATT&CK

251
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:32,780
for cloud matrix will
improve cloud security

252
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,670
in their organizations.

253
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:38,723
79% say it would make
them more comfortable

254
00:14:38,724 --> 00:14:41,300
with cloud adoption.

255
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:45,560
Further 69% agree that they
would be more comfortable

256
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:49,310
outsourcing their
Security Operation Center

257
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:52,742
to a third party provider that
uses the ATT&CK framework.

258
00:14:52,742 --> 00:14:57,069
Therefore service providers
that use the ATT&CK framework

259
00:14:57,070 --> 00:15:02,070
in their security teams and
products maybe perceived

260
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,780
as better meeting their responsibility

261
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:07,670
to secure the use of cloud services.

262
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:11,870
ATT&CK is widely used by
defenders across industries

263
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:15,381
and in government to
find gaps in visibility,

264
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:18,233
security tools and processes.

265
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:21,800
Cloud Security still remains

266
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,613
a continuously evolving landscape.

267
00:15:23,613 --> 00:15:28,613
However, most threats can
be detected and prevented.

268
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:32,680
We recommend that cloud
threat investigation

269
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:35,460
should be assessed holistically

270
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:38,040
with the following building blocks.

271
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,877
First being adopting the ATT&CK framework

272
00:15:40,878 --> 00:15:43,680
for threat investigation.

273
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,900
Our survey highlights the importance

274
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:48,540
of adopting a comprehensive framework

275
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:51,540
that can be used to identify the tactics

276
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,530
and techniques used by the adversaries.

277
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:57,391
Most organizations use
the ATT&CK framework

278
00:15:57,392 --> 00:16:00,003
to standardize a common lexicon

279
00:16:00,003 --> 00:16:03,259
in taxonomy across the organization.

280
00:16:03,259 --> 00:16:08,259
In addition, the framework
is most used to identify gaps

281
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:12,630
in currently deployed
security products or tools,

282
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:16,760
guide security policy
implementation, model threats

283
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,770
and assess the risks associated

284
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:22,303
with adopting new technologies
such as cloud services.

285
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:28,110
Second would be investigate
threats from all data sources.

286
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:30,510
An important takeaway from our interviews

287
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:32,829
is the importance of
maintaining visibility

288
00:16:32,829 --> 00:16:36,075
into events to detect threat patterns.

289
00:16:36,076 --> 00:16:39,540
Investigating threats comprehensively

290
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:44,099
and correlating events
from all sources, network,

291
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:47,488
endpoint and cloud are critical steps

292
00:16:47,488 --> 00:16:51,760
for successful threat
detection and prevention.

293
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,319
Only two in five survey respondents

294
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,700
are currently incorporating
all three environments together

295
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,910
when investigating threats.

296
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:05,909
A majority of those who have
adopted the ATT&CK framework

297
00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:10,532
investigate both endpoint
and cloud security events

298
00:17:10,532 --> 00:17:12,002
and threats together.

299
00:17:13,051 --> 00:17:15,639
Third would be to automate.

300
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:19,400
Our research also found that
security operations team

301
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,920
face overwhelming number
of investigations.

302
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,640
All the security leaders we interviewed

303
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:29,000
emphasized the need for automation,

304
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,820
and they agree that
automatic tagging of events

305
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:35,884
using a security framework
would be beneficial.

306
00:17:35,884 --> 00:17:40,884
We identify ATT&CK framework
is most comprehensive

307
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,990
for this purpose.

308
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:45,930
Thank you, we are here for questions.

309
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:46,920
- Yes, thank you so much

310
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,440
and We'll be here for
the rest of the session

311
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,640
to answer any questions
you have about our talk.
