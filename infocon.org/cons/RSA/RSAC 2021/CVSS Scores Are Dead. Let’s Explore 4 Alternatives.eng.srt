00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:05,343
- Thank you all today for
coming to this presentation,

2
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:09,020
we're gonna talk about CVSS Scores

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:10,700
and the title of the presentation,

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:14,660
CVVS Scores Are Dead: Let's
Explore 4 Alternatives.

5
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:15,780
My name's Allan Liska.

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,780
I'm part of the CSIRT
team at Recorded Future.

7
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:21,730
My Twitter handle's there if
you wanna follow me on Twitter

8
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:24,610
and I will let you know that

9
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:27,400
even though this
presentation is prerecorded,

10
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,169
I will be here answering questions

11
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:30,400
throughout the presentation.

12
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,680
So please hit me up.

13
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,330
I'm happy to answer anything I can for you

14
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:38,083
and really looking forward to
having a deeper conversation.

15
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:41,160
So again, my name's Allan Liska

16
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,029
I'm part of the Recorded Future team,

17
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:45,180
the CSIRT team at Recorded Future.

18
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,660
I've got about 20 years
experience in cybersecurity

19
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,319
both as a blue teamer and a
red teamer in the public sector

20
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,670
and private sector, kind
of all over the place.

21
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,960
My job primarily before joining CSIRT

22
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,370
was helping helping
organizations integrate

23
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:02,550
threat intelligence
directly into the workflow.

24
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:05,030
And I've written a few
books about network security

25
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:06,830
and ransomware and some other things

26
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:10,203
and just been around for awhile.

27
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,713
So I wanna start by talking
about vulnerabilities.

28
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:21,120
I've joked for probably a dozen years

29
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,840
when I've given other
talks that if you run

30
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,920
a really good vulnerability
management program,

31
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,610
no one's going to invite you
to speak at RSA or Black Hat,

32
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:32,090
it turns out that was wrong.

33
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:35,710
So it's kinda nice that vulnerability

34
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:38,160
and vulnerability management
are getting attention

35
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:43,110
because there's sort of the
unsexy part of cybersecurity

36
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:46,360
but you have to do vulnerability
management really well

37
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,270
in order to do everything else.

38
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,600
In order to do what's
traditionally considered

39
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:54,619
the cool stuff because without
good vulnerability management

40
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,560
without good asset management

41
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,460
the next layers of security don't work.

42
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:03,820
And vulnerability management
is getting a lot harder.

43
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,839
So if you look at the total number

44
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,690
of vulnerabilities released
between 2016 and 2020 according

45
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:15,320
to the United States National
Vulnerability Database

46
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,489
and every national vulnerability database

47
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:21,400
is a little bit different, but
just going by these numbers,

48
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,413
the numbers have almost tripled.

49
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:29,320
And so the number of vulnerabilities
that have been released

50
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,700
have almost tripled each year.

51
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,040
So we've gone from about 6,000 a year

52
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,530
to almost 18,000 a year.

53
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,610
And as you can see in there,

54
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:44,090
the number of critical
vulnerabilities has also increased

55
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:47,900
not just the total number,
but as a percentage

56
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,980
of the total amount of vulnerabilities.

57
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,750
So just in general,

58
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,930
we're seeing not only
more vulnerabilities,

59
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:58,800
but more what are, according to CVSS Score

60
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,620
is labeled a high vulnerability.

61
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:03,253
So high scoring
vulnerabilities, which is bad.

62
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:07,690
And, looking specifically at Microsoft

63
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:09,710
since Microsoft does their Patch Tuesday

64
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:12,440
which is a really nice way
to kind of track over time.

65
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:16,030
You can see that again in 2016,

66
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:20,450
the total of 2016 there were
about 400 vulnerabilities

67
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:24,760
and in 2020 and we think
this will continue into 2021,

68
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,190
they're almost 1,500 total vulnerabilities

69
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:30,340
that were released just from Microsoft.

70
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:33,870
So that's a whole lot of
stuff that needs to be patched

71
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,983
and not a whole lot of time to do it.

72
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,220
I mean the problem is, there
are too many vulnerabilities.

73
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,053
We get that.

74
00:03:42,053 --> 00:03:44,772
Now, it's great.

75
00:03:44,772 --> 00:03:45,605
Please don't get me wrong.

76
00:03:45,605 --> 00:03:50,390
It's great that more people
are finding vulnerabilities

77
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:53,059
more vulnerabilities are being reported

78
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:55,800
and they're being reported
in a more timely fashion.

79
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,220
All of that is really good.

80
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:00,590
That's a sign of a maturing
and growing industry.

81
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:03,780
The problem is it's just
too much to keep up with.

82
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:08,780
So it becomes almost impossible
for most organizations

83
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,910
to track and patch all
of the vulnerabilities

84
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:14,570
in their organization in a timely fashion.

85
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:19,103
So what most organizations
do, is they prioritize,

86
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:21,750
the most organizations

87
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,680
their vulnerability management team rely

88
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:29,420
on the Common Vulnerability
Scoring System or CVSS

89
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:33,320
which in theory allows teams to focus

90
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,650
on the highest priority
vulnerabilities based

91
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:38,549
on the CVSS Score.

92
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:39,840
So you can at least start with

93
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,840
the highest priority
vulnerabilities patch those

94
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:49,483
and then have more time to get
to the other vulnerabilities.

95
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,250
Obviously, that doesn't work.

96
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,550
And we're gonna get to why in a minute

97
00:04:55,550 --> 00:05:00,220
but let's start with what CVSS is.

98
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,680
I think most of us here have

99
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,977
at least some tangential
experience with vulnerability

100
00:05:05,977 --> 00:05:09,929
and vulnerability management,
but most of y'all don't know

101
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:11,780
how long CVSS has been around.

102
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:16,719
Version one of CVSS
was introduced in 2005,

103
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,760
which means that in most States,

104
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,520
it's now old enough to drive a car.

105
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,323
So congratulations to it.

106
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,440
The current version, which was released

107
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,763
in 2019 is version 3.1.

108
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:32,060
CVS what it does is it
creates a common framework

109
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:34,410
for describing vulnerabilities.

110
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:36,820
So the base score looks at three metrics;

111
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,420
the exploitability of the vulnerability,

112
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:42,300
the impact of exploiting the vulnerability

113
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,540
and the scope of the vulnerability.

114
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:49,500
And what it does, it then
it puts together a score

115
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:54,500
between zero and 10 and a severity level.

116
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,833
So no severity is zero, low is one to 3.9,

117
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:04,110
medium is four to 6.9,
a high is a seven to 8.9

118
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:08,683
and a critical is a nine or 10.

119
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:13,630
So that's how it determines
the severity level.

120
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:18,630
And the idea is that allows you

121
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:21,710
to basically take two very
different vulnerabilities

122
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:24,060
and two very different
types of software and say,

123
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:27,040
Oh, okay, these are both equally bad.

124
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,490
So now we know how, in theory,

125
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,453
now we know how to patch them.

126
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,660
But, CVSS is not a risk score.

127
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:40,660
We use it in security and
in vulnerability management,

128
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,683
we use it as a risk score.

129
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,469
This is a critical, or this is a high

130
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:48,910
so it needs to be patched immediately.

131
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:50,690
We're treating it like a risk score

132
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:52,580
but it's not a risk score.

133
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:57,580
What CVSS is, is it's
a snapshot in time of

134
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:04,300
how vulnerability is,
and how important it is

135
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,610
to that particular piece of software

136
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:12,523
which means that if you
have a CVSS Score of 10,

137
00:07:12,523 --> 00:07:15,820
a vulnerability with a CVSS Score of 10

138
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:18,320
but it's impacting SquirrelMail

139
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,700
that still gets that CVSS Score of 10

140
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,820
even though a Microsoft
Exchange vulnerability

141
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:29,159
with a CVSS Score of 10,
obviously has a much bigger impact

142
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,950
or a vulnerability in Solar
Winds as we saw recently

143
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:35,652
has a much bigger impact.

144
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,210
And just as an aside,

145
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:40,020
I'm not picking one SquirrelMail here.

146
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,969
SquirrelMail is a great program.

147
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:44,300
And I know there are a
lot of people that use it

148
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,930
but it doesn't have the
penetration that Exchange does.

149
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:51,540
And so, a remote code
execution vulnerability

150
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:55,060
in Microsoft Exchange
is much more impactful

151
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,850
on the global internet

152
00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:01,160
than a remote code execution
vulnerability in SquirrelMail

153
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,913
but just as an example.

154
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:09,300
So we have this problem
so far that we've defined

155
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:12,260
the number of vulnerabilities
is overwhelming.

156
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,090
I think we can all agree with that.

157
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:17,750
Vulnerability management
teams can't patch everything.

158
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:21,580
So they have to prioritize what to patch.

159
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,840
And even that can be hard when 16%

160
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,960
of the vulnerabilities
have a critical CVSS Score.

161
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,560
In other words, if all
vulnerabilities are critical

162
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:33,580
then none are, but still the primary score

163
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:37,299
that most VMTs use, vulnerability
management teams use

164
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:41,750
to prioritize patching is CVSS

165
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:46,650
but CVSS does not adequately
convey the risk associated

166
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:48,510
with the vulnerability.

167
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:50,660
And we'll see this all the time.

168
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:53,040
We'll see things that are labeled

169
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,020
by a vendor as an important
risk score, or a medium,

170
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:59,560
or, excuse me, a medium risk score.

171
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:03,280
But, because it's being
actively exploited in the wild

172
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:08,090
it becomes much more
critical to an organization

173
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:11,860
to patch sooner rather than later.

174
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:15,630
But if all you have to
go by is the CVSS Score,

175
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:18,180
then you're not necessarily
gonna patch it right away.

176
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:21,223
So what a lot of vulnerability
management teams do,

177
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:27,920
because they're so reliant on
CVSS as a scoring mechanism

178
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,329
what a lot of these
vulnerability management teams do

179
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:32,310
is they'll set goals.

180
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:37,219
So anything that is critical
gets passed within 30 days.

181
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:40,910
Anything that's a high gets
patched within 60 days.

182
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:45,230
Mediums are six months and low are,

183
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:49,130
low could be eight months to
a year before it gets patched.

184
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,770
Well, a low scoring vulnerability

185
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:56,250
could still provide something
like privilege escalation.

186
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,100
Again, we see this all
the time in Microsoft

187
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:01,630
where a relatively low vulnerability,

188
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:06,630
low scoring vulnerability
still could give you

189
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,650
administrative access to a
machine if it's exploited.

190
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:14,650
So what we'll see is, we'll see
that these ransomware actors

191
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:20,210
or other malicious actors will incorporate

192
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:24,320
those low scoring vulnerabilities
into their exploit kits.

193
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,290
So once they gain access to the system

194
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:28,120
and they're actually hands on keyboard,

195
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,040
they'll use these low
scoring vulnerabilities

196
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,099
'cause they're pretty confident

197
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,680
they haven't been patched yet.

198
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,870
And they'll have a bunch
of them changed at first

199
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:36,150
when this doesn't work,
they try the second

200
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,242
and third and so on.

201
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:43,750
So again, what CVSS Score is looking at

202
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:47,140
isn't adequately conveying
the risk associated

203
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,069
with a particular vulnerability.

204
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:51,270
It's just a snapshot in time

205
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:53,423
of what that vulnerability looks like.

206
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:00,320
Now, there are alternatives
to CVSS that are out there.

207
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:05,790
And most of them focus on looking,

208
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,819
not just at the severity
of the vulnerability,

209
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,780
but a lot of other functions.

210
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:13,760
So for example, the Exploit
Prediction Scoring System

211
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,120
which is actually maintained

212
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,490
by the same people that maintain CVSS.

213
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:22,433
So this is sort of their
evolution of what CVS should be.

214
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,560
It looks not just at the
severity of the vulnerability

215
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,420
but how complex the
vulnerability is to exploit

216
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:33,160
and whether or not it's
being exploited in the wild.

217
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,323
So it's sort of taking the,

218
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:41,240
it's taking one of the components
that CVSS doesn't measure

219
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:46,210
and it looks at, basically
how easy it is to exploit,

220
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:48,390
but then also who is exploiting it.

221
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:50,630
There are some vulnerabilities
that are just easier

222
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:51,750
to exploit than others.

223
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:55,770
And part of that has to do
with the exploit ecosystem

224
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:58,090
that is developed in
the underground market.

225
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:00,920
There's a lot of turnaround
in some of these,

226
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,829
quick turnaround in some
of these vulnerabilities

227
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:05,960
because the threat actors either have

228
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:10,120
a lot of experience with them,
or because they've, excuse me

229
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:13,460
because the threat
actors need to have a lot

230
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,970
of experience with them, or
because they know there's

231
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:19,320
a lot of value in being
able to exploit them.

232
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,610
So for example, we see this with exploits

233
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:25,190
against Microsoft Office documents.

234
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:26,950
Microsoft Office documents tend

235
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:29,330
to have a very quick turnaround time

236
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:33,070
from the vulnerability being
announced to being exploited

237
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:37,000
and being incorporated into
threat actor exploit kits

238
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,730
because there's a huge market for that.

239
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:41,742
And threat actors know

240
00:12:41,742 --> 00:12:45,510
that they'll be able to use these widely.

241
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:50,380
Same thing with anything
that is even if it's complex

242
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:53,300
that is gonna give an attacker easy access

243
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,530
to the systems they need.

244
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:57,150
So we saw this with the recent
exchange vulnerabilities

245
00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:00,390
that Microsoft announced
where they announced,

246
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:03,550
we already knew that nation
state actors were exploiting

247
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:06,319
the vulnerabilities before
the announcement happened

248
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,083
within a couple of weeks
after the announcement

249
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,780
from Microsoft, we already had ransomware

250
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:17,870
after us exploiting these
in order to gain access.

251
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:22,470
So for example, there's reporting that

252
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:25,820
the ransomware attack
against Acer initiated

253
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:28,530
from a vulnerable
Microsoft Exchange server

254
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:32,420
that was exploited and the
attackers gained access.

255
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:37,420
So, it's not just a matter of

256
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:40,069
whether or not something
can easily be exploited,

257
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,950
it's, will it also be exploited

258
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:44,550
because there's a huge
market for using that.

259
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:48,892
And EPSS takes a look at
some of these variables

260
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:52,790
and then assigns a score based on that.

261
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:57,790
So you don't just get a score,
that is of a picture in time

262
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:03,350
that is equal across all software
in all types of software.

263
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:06,230
Some software is just much
more likely to be exploited

264
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:08,270
and there's a much bigger impact

265
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:10,433
if that software is exploited.

266
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:13,260
Similar to that, we have the

267
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:18,260
Stakeholder Specific Vulnerability
Categorization or SSVC.

268
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:22,340
This takes a decision tree
approach that is applicable

269
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:25,130
to both developers and
vulnerability management teams.

270
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,700
So one of the things that I like

271
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:31,700
about the SSVC as a model for scoring

272
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:34,569
is that it can be used externally.

273
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:36,290
So if you're getting information

274
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:38,240
about a vulnerability that's coming in

275
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,110
on software that you're using,

276
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:43,030
it can be used to score
it, but it can also be used

277
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:45,280
to score your own
vulnerabilities internally.

278
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:48,209
So it helps you better decide

279
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:50,260
how you're gonna score vulnerabilities,

280
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,860
whether they're discovered internally

281
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:54,110
or the reported through
a bug bounty program.

282
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,520
So it takes a decision tree
approach that is applicable

283
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,400
to both developers and
vulnerability management team.

284
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,490
So both sides of the coin.

285
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:05,040
It avoids assigning numerical values

286
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,829
to vulnerabilities instead of relies

287
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:08,683
on a cost benefit analysis.

288
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:11,710
It's developed by and maintained

289
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:13,940
by the Software Engineering Institute

290
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,350
at Carnegie Mellon University.

291
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:16,380
And the link is there.

292
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,680
I'm not gonna read the
whole thing out to you,

293
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,829
but it's a very interesting approach

294
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:25,800
'cause it gets away from
the numerical value.

295
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,670
And instead looks at what it's gonna cost

296
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:32,530
to patch versus not patch
each of these vulnerabilities.

297
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:37,339
What the potential damage
is and how you can,

298
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,580
and it allows you to take

299
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:42,343
a truly risk-based approach to this.

300
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,240
And in theory, this is fine.

301
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:49,550
I think one of the
shortcomings of the SSVC is

302
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,670
that works great in an organization

303
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:54,699
when you're running 10 pieces of software.

304
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,820
Most organizations now have hundreds

305
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,640
if not thousands of pieces of software

306
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,060
in different versions
and so on and so forth.

307
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,770
So trying to do a cost benefit analysis

308
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:05,730
for every new vulnerability that comes out

309
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:09,210
just isn't feasible
for most organizations.

310
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:10,620
You'd spend so much time doing that

311
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:13,220
you'd never get around to
actually patching anything

312
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:17,150
but I liked the approach because
it truly does rely on risk.

313
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:19,319
It just needs to be
codified a little bit more

314
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,010
so it's easier to come
up with those numbers.

315
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:24,450
That being said, I do like this approach

316
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:28,010
if you're developing
your software in-house,

317
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:31,780
because as these vulnerabilities
get reported or discovered

318
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:36,780
by your team, you're better
able to take a look at,

319
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:41,090
okay, here's what the real
threat is, understand what

320
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:44,000
these threats are to your code,

321
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,270
and then make adjustments
to your code as necessary.

322
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:49,600
Okay, does this need to
be patched immediately?

323
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,100
Can we release this on
a regular patching cycle

324
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,880
and things like that.

325
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,570
So I do think from an internal
development perspective,

326
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:58,083
it makes a lot of sense.

327
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:03,620
Tenable has its own system,
proprietary system called

328
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:07,119
the Vulnerability Priority Rating, VPR.

329
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,729
It combines the technical scoring of CVS

330
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:11,960
with the risk of
exploitation, which again,

331
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:15,780
that's a big component
here that CVS is missing

332
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,869
that needs to be focused on.

333
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:19,489
It looks at a variety of different forms

334
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:24,130
of intelligence to build a
holistic score of not just

335
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:28,200
what is the impact of the vulnerability

336
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:31,333
but again, how widely deployed is it?

337
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:37,150
What's the likelihood that
this is gonna be exploited

338
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:39,700
and then take that into account.

339
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:42,240
So it reduces the number of high

340
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,670
and critical vulnerabilities

341
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:45,723
to make patching more manageable.

342
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:48,643
Excuse me.

343
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,929
So, in other words, what you're doing is,

344
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:57,930
you're taking not everything
that has a CVSS Score of a nine

345
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:01,370
or 10 needs to be patched immediately

346
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:05,320
but you don't know that just
looking at a CVSS Score.

347
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:08,399
So instead, what this does
is it takes a bigger look

348
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,070
at the whole picture though
it's sort of the whole internet

349
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:13,710
in terms of, what's
likely to be exploited,

350
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:16,790
not likely to be exploited
and then comes up

351
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,270
with a number based on that.

352
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:24,370
So you wind up with fewer critical

353
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:28,830
and high level vulnerabilities,
but you still have those

354
00:18:29,718 --> 00:18:31,810
but the ones that you do have as critical

355
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:35,590
and high level are the ones

356
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:38,129
that you actually need
to worry about patching.

357
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:42,540
And again, that becomes much
more, (coughs) excuse me

358
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:43,990
it comes to be much more actionable

359
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:46,310
and it's much more
based on the actual risk

360
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:50,190
of the vulnerability in your organization.

361
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:51,690
Again, it's maintained by Tenable.

362
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:55,300
There's a great blog post
on VPR on the Tenable blog

363
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,013
that you can read and find out more about.

364
00:18:59,464 --> 00:19:00,414
(coughs) Excuse me.

365
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:07,350
So Recorded Future takes
a blended approach to this

366
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:11,923
but one that is much more risk centered.

367
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,429
And this is where I
think the difference is.

368
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:20,310
So what Recorded Future tries to do is

369
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:24,970
we try to provide relevant
threat-based risk scores

370
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:26,170
that are updated in real time

371
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:29,910
for fast prioritization
of vulnerabilities.

372
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:32,340
We do real-time alerting often days

373
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:36,179
before they're published on
NVD and detailed risk evidence

374
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:39,940
and context for transparent
and fast analysis.

375
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:40,773
And then of course,

376
00:19:40,773 --> 00:19:43,622
integration into existing
vulnerability management tools.

377
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,699
So what we do at Recorded Future

378
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:50,150
when we're building out our risk scores

379
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:53,490
is we look at the vulnerabilities

380
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:55,350
when the vulnerabilities
were now announced,

381
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:58,480
again, the prevalence of the software

382
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,177
but we also, if you've uploaded your list

383
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:08,560
of software installed
in your organization,

384
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:12,110
we also compare that against
your list of software

385
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:14,149
so that we can say, okay, this,

386
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:16,100
we can provide you with more relevant.

387
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,760
So giving you a list

388
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,080
of a thousand high scoring vulnerabilities

389
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,750
it doesn't matter if only
10 of them are actually

390
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:25,150
within your organization.

391
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:27,490
But we look at things like,

392
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:28,870
whether or not it was reported

393
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:33,310
before the NVD actually
publicly reports it,

394
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:35,659
which is really important
'cause that gives you a chance

395
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:40,523
to jump on mitigations before
a patch may be released,

396
00:20:41,794 --> 00:20:45,273
or be able to patch right away.

397
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,370
Whether or not it's being
exploited in the wild

398
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:50,199
or has been exploited in the wild

399
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:54,380
or if similar vulnerabilities

400
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:56,960
to this were exploited in the wild.

401
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,330
We look at that as well,

402
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:00,710
so that we kind of have a better context

403
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:03,630
and understanding of how
the vulnerability worked.

404
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:08,630
And again, if it was
used by different actors.

405
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:12,179
So that also becomes really important

406
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:14,600
especially depending on
your organization type

407
00:21:16,346 --> 00:21:20,960
an attack used by a nation
state actor, or an, excuse me

408
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,670
an exploit used by a
nation state actor has

409
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:29,610
a different connotation than
necessarily an attack used

410
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:32,350
by as a sort of a low level
or a vulnerability, excuse me

411
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:36,879
exploited by a low level
cyber criminal gang.

412
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,290
So knowing not just that it's
been exploited in the wild

413
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:44,690
but who's exploited it
becomes really important.

414
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:48,840
And what we found that
the way this works well

415
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,169
is what it does is,

416
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:55,060
it allows your vulnerability
management team

417
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,473
to tell a story.

418
00:21:57,410 --> 00:21:59,200
And in general, when we're talking

419
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,260
about threat intelligence,
the ability to tell the story

420
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:05,580
is what makes it more effective.

421
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:08,120
So those of you that are

422
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,760
in vulnerability management know this

423
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:14,393
are probably painfully
aware of this, that,

424
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:17,790
in vulnerability
management, what you do is

425
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:20,129
you run your scans,
you get the information

426
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:23,140
about new vulnerabilities, and
then you push out what needs

427
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:25,940
to be patched with a recommendation

428
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,500
and you send it out to the Windows team

429
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:30,264
and the network infrastructure
team and the Unix team.

430
00:22:30,264 --> 00:22:32,129
And then they're responsible.

431
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:33,680
You're not responsible for patching.

432
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,020
You're just responsible for alerting.

433
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:38,853
And so the problem with that again, is,

434
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:43,810
the other teams that you're
not responsible for have to go

435
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:47,330
and they have to find the time
to actually get these done.

436
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:48,827
And they've got the setup.

437
00:22:50,064 --> 00:22:52,240
They've got to set up the Windows

438
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,988
and run and patch everything.

439
00:22:55,988 --> 00:22:59,180
And if the only thing you
can tell them is this is a 10

440
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:01,250
you need to patch it now,

441
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:05,260
then you're much less
likely to get the patch done

442
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:08,530
in a timely fashion, even
if it's a high priority.

443
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:12,680
So what we found is having
the ability to tell the story.

444
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,280
You need to patch this media

445
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,800
or this needs to be patched immediately

446
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,560
because this is currently
being exploited in the wild

447
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,893
by a ransomware group.

448
00:23:22,616 --> 00:23:27,450
That has a much bigger
impact on the response time

449
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:29,220
from the different departments

450
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,510
because now they understand the nature

451
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:34,379
of the threat as well as you do.

452
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:37,780
And they're able to say,
okay, yes, we definitely need

453
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:40,260
to have that change control
window put in place.

454
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:43,030
And we need to patch this
and reboot it immediately

455
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:45,030
because we don't wanna
get hit with ransomware

456
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:47,220
or we don't wanna get
hit by a nation state

457
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:49,490
or whatever it is.

458
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:52,480
So that is where threat
intelligence comes in.

459
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,620
And that's really where
our risk score comes in.

460
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,310
And that's the benefit that we provide

461
00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:00,389
with that risk score is being able

462
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:05,193
to tell that story with it.

463
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:09,939
And again, it doesn't
necessarily have to be going

464
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:12,600
to the portal to see that
because of the integration

465
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,280
that Recorded Future has

466
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:19,240
with your existing
vulnerability management tools

467
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:22,680
you can often pull those
scores right into your tools

468
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:25,090
so that everything is in the same place

469
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:27,290
and then push it out to whatever
your ticketing system is.

470
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:29,620
So take it from your
vulnerability management system

471
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:33,370
over to service now, or
whatever you using the process

472
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:38,040
which is a really big,
important part of all of this.

473
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:41,659
With whatever you're doing
as you move away from CVSS

474
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:44,900
to other types of
vulnerability scoring systems,

475
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,710
you want something that
can integrate directly

476
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:49,483
into your existing workflow.

477
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:55,330
We discuss this often in cybersecurity

478
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:59,840
that one of the things that
we don't do very well is

479
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:03,699
we tend to try and give you
another box for every problem.

480
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:06,840
It's, okay, here's your firewall.

481
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,300
Firewall's not covering everything.

482
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,090
Well, great, here's an IVS.

483
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:11,370
Okay, well, the IVS isn't
covering everything.

484
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:12,939
Here's your web proxy.

485
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:15,690
You wanna have things that
integrate into your workflow

486
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:18,230
rather than create more work for you.

487
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:21,650
And that's what, I mean,
that's one of the reasons

488
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:24,380
why CVS has been so
popular is it's integrated

489
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:26,840
into everything that you're using already.

490
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:30,820
Whatever system that you're
switching to as a better way

491
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:34,110
of doing risk scoring
for your vulnerabilities.

492
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:37,746
You want something that
is going to be integrated

493
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:45,760
into your current workflow
rather than having to restructure

494
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,193
how you do everything.

495
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,803
So really what you wanna do,

496
00:25:54,137 --> 00:25:56,590
what I kind of want everybody
to take away from this

497
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:59,832
is ways to apply what
you've learned today.

498
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,930
I mean, we've all dealt
with vulnerabilities.

499
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:05,130
If nothing else on Twitter

500
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:07,680
you've seen the vulnerabilities fly by

501
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:11,100
as Patch Tuesday comes out
or something new happens

502
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:14,300
with Google Chrome or Oracle or Apache

503
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:18,143
or whatever particular
system you're using.

504
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:22,150
I think we can all agree on
is the current system relying

505
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:24,400
on CVS scoring is broken.

506
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,080
It doesn't work the way
everyone hoped it would

507
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,622
which obviously is a big problem.

508
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:36,363
And unfortunately, it's been
broken for a really long time.

509
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:40,720
Again, this goes back to 2016 or 2005

510
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,290
that we've been using CVSS Scores.

511
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:44,670
And even though there weren't

512
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:48,783
as many vulnerabilities in,
most certainly not in 2005

513
00:26:48,783 --> 00:26:52,209
as there are today, there's
still always been the problem

514
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:54,840
that patching takes longer than it should.

515
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:57,970
It's much harder to get things
patched than it should be

516
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:01,040
and there are still too many patches.

517
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,730
And that was true in 2005.

518
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:04,170
Unfortunately, it's still true today.

519
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:05,890
We haven't fixed that problem.

520
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:07,730
And I don't know that we ever will.

521
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:09,883
So we have to find ways to make it better.

522
00:27:11,055 --> 00:27:13,250
And the best way that you can do that

523
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:16,720
is to start taking a risk centric approach

524
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,260
to vulnerabilities and
patching in general.

525
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:22,080
So that risk is not
just the external risk.

526
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:27,080
So it's not just the
risk of, Hey, vendors say

527
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:29,930
that this is really bad,
but also internal risk.

528
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:34,230
How much of the vulnerable
systems do you have?

529
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:35,650
How exposed to the internet

530
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:37,250
and the rest of the network are they?

531
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:39,680
What kind of valuable data that they have?

532
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:44,680
So that risks center can't just
be an external risk sensor,

533
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:49,139
excuse me, center, it's
gotta be internal as well

534
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,980
knowing what you have in your environment,

535
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:55,370
knowing what's exposed,
knowing what the risks are.

536
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:58,899
If a threat actor gets on there
and is able to exploit the

537
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:02,470
a vulnerability on those
particular systems.

538
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:04,780
So, again, that becomes really important

539
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:08,230
and that's a big part of
that risk conversation

540
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:09,653
that you have to have.

541
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:11,690
It's kind of weird.

542
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:12,780
People don't think about it

543
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:16,550
but vulnerability intelligence
and vulnerability reporting

544
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:21,040
is really one of the first
types of threat intelligence

545
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,159
that we're out there.

546
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,650
Because you're taking all
of this external information

547
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:26,110
about new vulnerabilities.

548
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:28,939
You're dropping into a feed
and you're delivering it

549
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:33,940
to other teams, to other organizations

550
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,860
so that they can apply that scoring.

551
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:39,159
So it's great that
vulnerability management

552
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:42,130
or vulnerability scoring in general

553
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:44,260
is one of the first types
of threat intelligence

554
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,920
but we do make need to
take it to the next level.

555
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:51,920
Nobody takes just an unfiltered
feed of IP addresses anymore

556
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:55,600
and says, "Great, we'll
block all of these."

557
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,070
You need to have more than that to it.

558
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:59,870
And we need to do more with
vulnerability management.

559
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:03,620
So what I'd recommend is
read some of the white papers

560
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:06,409
that are listed in this
document and think about

561
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:10,200
what you can do within your organization

562
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:15,150
to make your vulnerability
management more risk focused.

563
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:17,680
I'm not saying that you need
to rip everything out today

564
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:21,200
and start new and start fresh,

565
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,450
but at least start thinking
about ways you can add

566
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:25,907
a more risk centric approach

567
00:29:25,907 --> 00:29:29,040
to your vulnerability management system

568
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,540
and move forward with that.

569
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:33,810
And again, my name is Allan Liska.

570
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:36,350
I really appreciate
everybody's time today.

571
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:39,060
I hope you've enjoyed the RSA so far

572
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:42,210
and you're gonna enjoy some
of the other great talks.

573
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:47,210
If you wanna get ahold of me,
my Twitter handle is there

574
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:50,830
but I'll be again, here
answering questions

575
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:53,689
and hopefully answering
questions along the way.

576
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:55,430
So thank you all again for your time.

577
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:57,230
And I hope everybody has a good day.
