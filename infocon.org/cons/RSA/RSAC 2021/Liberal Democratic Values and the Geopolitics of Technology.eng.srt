1
00:00:00,109 --> 00:00:02,692
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,840
- The world is undergoing
most significant shift

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,880
in strategic alignment
in the 21st century.

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,759
Daily we see the signs
of heightened competition

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,370
between major powers.

6
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:23,630
The geopolitical contest where technology

7
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:26,320
is increasingly a key battle ground

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,300
within suing impacts on security, trade

9
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,860
and industry, foreign
relations and grand strategy.

10
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:36,040
And the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic both immense

11
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:39,870
and widespread continues to
accelerate technology's ability

12
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,280
to drive rapid change.

13
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,930
Yep, humans have always
looked to technology

14
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:48,240
for competitive gain and the
advancements of technology

15
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,400
has long underpinned
increased global prosperity

16
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,790
and in turn geopolitical competition.

17
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:56,100
And we've seen the effects

18
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,490
of recent technological change before.

19
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:00,830
The advent of the microprocessor,

20
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:02,670
the rollout of the internet,

21
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,670
the proliferation of personal computers,

22
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,230
the world changing
impact of the smartphone

23
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:11,540
and mobile connectivity is a
key enabler of our lifestyles.

24
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:15,140
And the remarkable
diminutive semiconductor chip

25
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:19,060
with its ever decreasing size
and ever growing capacity.

26
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:19,930
These are but a few

27
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:22,840
of the incredible technological
developments to have shaped

28
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,520
the last few decades and they are maturing

29
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,429
at a staggering rate.

30
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:29,130
When you consider the breadth

31
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:32,929
of these technologies alongside
their many applications,

32
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:34,700
you start to realize just

33
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:38,100
how significantly a global connected world

34
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,830
is reshaping human existence.

35
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:43,740
I try to avoid the term unprecedented,

36
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:47,119
but the situation we're
currently in warrants it.

37
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,940
When you consider the breadth

38
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:52,950
of emerging technologies coming
online near simultaneously,

39
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:56,960
it's difficult to find a
comparative historical reference.

40
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,149
The revolutionary impact,
this transformative state

41
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,400
of change will have on our societies

42
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,480
and on our planet cannot be understated.

43
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,150
And it has already proven
to be transformation

44
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:12,070
with unexpected and
unpredictable consequences

45
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:15,790
a transformation that
requires a global response

46
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:18,730
as it realigns the
international balance of power

47
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:21,972
and reshapes the geopolitics
of the 21st century.

48
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:25,299
For those who can harness the current wave

49
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:29,140
of innovation mitigate
its risks and capitalize

50
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:31,559
on its transformative powers

51
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,210
will gain significant economic, political

52
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:35,743
and security advantage.

53
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:40,300
Part of my role as Australia's
Ambassador for Cyber Affairs

54
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:43,460
and Critical Technology is
to understand and harness

55
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:47,240
that transformation in a way
that works to our advantage

56
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,970
and reflects our liberal
democratic values to work,

57
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:54,550
to understand what really
is at stake and what

58
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:58,200
are the true risks that
we face as governments,

59
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,750
companies and individuals.

60
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,420
In answering these questions

61
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:05,760
and understanding what it is
that should be front of mind

62
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,390
as we look to design,
develop and use technology,

63
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:11,559
it's helpful to consider the current state

64
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,926
of play across Cyberspace
and the Technology Landscape.

65
00:03:14,926 --> 00:03:17,509
(upbeat music)

66
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,570
In 2017 when we put pen to paper

67
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:25,739
on our first International
Cyber Engagement Strategy

68
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:28,960
the world looked a little
different to how it does today.

69
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,970
None of us could have imagined
how significantly Cyberspace

70
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:34,470
and the Technology Landscape
would change in the years

71
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:37,890
that followed and the
effects of that change.

72
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:41,000
The geopolitical landscape
has become more competitive

73
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,250
and more technologically complex

74
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:46,840
with technology enabling
a new range of actors.

75
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,300
Technological innovation is an
increasingly crucial element

76
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,880
in the relationship between superpowers.

77
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,630
Occupies center stage

78
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:58,049
in our contested international
economic environment.

79
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:59,900
And the adoption and integration

80
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,310
of technology enabled gray zone activities

81
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:05,060
into Statecraft has
fueled a more dangerous

82
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:07,930
and contested international environment.

83
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:10,500
Governments, companies, and individuals

84
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,530
will power in unforeseen and
increasingly complex ways

85
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,100
and are all working to advance

86
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,003
their technological capabilities.

87
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:21,202
Some are like-minded and some are not.

88
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:25,810
Connectivity has spread and
brought with it a wider range

89
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:29,430
of actors exerting their
influence in cyberspace.

90
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,810
5G networks have become the litmus test

91
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:35,490
for both technological
and political competition.

92
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:38,380
We've created entirely new industries,

93
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:42,140
moved our schools, healthcare
and commerce online

94
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:44,863
and created communities
that span the planet.

95
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:49,830
Power derived from controlling
the design, development

96
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:52,750
and use of technologies and capabilities

97
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,190
is extending national

98
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:56,513
and corporate influence across the world.

99
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:00,810
The boom in connected
devices and digital platforms

100
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:04,140
has enabled constant global communication,

101
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:06,680
but also allowed the
amplification of narratives

102
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,340
to influence the views of billions

103
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,150
and primed our societies

104
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:13,633
for disinformation and misinformation.

105
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:17,830
And digital platforms are
increasingly shaping debates

106
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:20,909
about what freedom of
expression looks like online

107
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:23,160
and the extent to which
they should be involved

108
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,893
in political debates in
carrying on their services.

109
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:29,430
The interconnectedness of technologies

110
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:33,470
has brought unforeseen risks
and created new opportunities

111
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:36,270
for threat actors with an asymmetric cost

112
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:39,190
in favor of malicious cyber activity.

113
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,810
States are increasingly focused

114
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:43,250
on standards development organizations

115
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,230
as a way of ensuring emerging,

116
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:47,810
technological trajectories reflecting

117
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:49,740
their national interests.

118
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,960
Trajectories that can either uphold

119
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,729
or undermine the international order,

120
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:58,720
and protect and promote human
rights or impinge upon them.

121
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,890
The resilience of technology
supply chains has been thrown

122
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:05,070
into the spotlight,
especially as we slowly emerge

123
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:07,133
from the COVID-19 pandemic.

124
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,870
Technology markets lack diversity,

125
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,360
allowing domination by individual actors

126
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,770
and the monopolization of industries

127
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:19,359
which has lowered
competition, increased costs

128
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,470
and weaken resilience.

129
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:23,580
And the ubiquity of cyberspace

130
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,909
with its world spanning
reach yet subtle borders

131
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:29,730
has only added to these challenges.

132
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:32,500
A domain that has allowed
our emerging technologies

133
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,840
to be cyber enabled and data driven

134
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,750
and spawned increasingly
interdependent innovation

135
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:41,860
like smart cities, Smart
Grid and driverless cars.

136
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:45,920
Out of necessity our focus
has expanded to technologies

137
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,410
that we have come to term as critical.

138
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:51,970
Those that have the capability
to impact upon the security

139
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:54,460
of our organizations and nations,

140
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:57,570
our prosperity both public and private,

141
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:01,460
and the very fabric that
underpins our social cohesion.

142
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:05,080
These critical technologies
include artificial intelligence,

143
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,770
the internet of things, quantum computing,

144
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:11,810
blockchain, biotech, 5G, and many more.

145
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:13,340
These emerging technologies

146
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,890
and their applications
are often enabled by

147
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:18,650
and reliant on information
that is created, stored

148
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:21,340
and transmitted through digital networks.

149
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:24,320
In other words, data of which we produce

150
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:28,270
about 2.5 quintillion bytes every day.

151
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:31,229
And as you all know, only too well.

152
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:33,000
Where there are digital technologies,

153
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,830
where data flow is there is risk.

154
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,990
And where there is risk,
there are also those who work

155
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:42,760
to infiltrate out networks,
impact our systems

156
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,820
and generate effects
against our interests.

157
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:50,740
And this risk takes many
forms, cyber, physical, social,

158
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:55,440
economic, geopolitical, and
individual to name, but a few.

159
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,273
And you'd be forgiven

160
00:07:56,273 --> 00:07:59,040
for asking when mitigating these risks

161
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,339
where do you start.

162
00:08:00,339 --> 00:08:02,922
(upbeat music)

163
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,890
In distilling down the many
risks posed by technology,

164
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:11,080
the question becomes what
is really under threat

165
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,630
and why should we care?

166
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:13,830
Is it our networks?

167
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:14,909
Is it our data?

168
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,210
Is it our tech?

169
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:18,969
We all might have different
answers to those questions,

170
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:20,250
and a different rationale

171
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,630
for our cybersecurity and engagement.

172
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,200
But the issues and risks

173
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,400
that exist in cyberspace and
across the tech landscape

174
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,260
do not occur in isolation.

175
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,050
And as innovation continues

176
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:34,919
at increased speed and
complexity, so do these risks.

177
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,789
When the puzzle is pieced together

178
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:39,809
and the linkages between
each are more clearly drawn

179
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:42,880
the final picture of risks
looks a little different.

180
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,080
And the question becomes what
should be the key lens through

181
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,280
which we seek to mitigate the risks

182
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,360
that we find in cyberspace and across

183
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,200
the technology landscape.

184
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,840
And that lens is values.

185
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,790
Many of you may be asking, but so what?

186
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:01,550
What the values have to do
with innovation research

187
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:02,959
and development and the goods

188
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,963
and services that we bring to market.

189
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,070
And how do the values

190
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:10,470
of the humans behind our
innovation effects cyberspace

191
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,330
and the tech landscape that it enables.

192
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:16,650
We'll look to simply put
value shape technology

193
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:17,930
and technology built

194
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:20,930
on liberal democratic
values means technology

195
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:22,319
that supports a stable

196
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,510
and peaceful international
order protects human rights

197
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:29,300
and reflects how we want
our societies to function.

198
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:32,329
And it means a cyberspace
that well not perfect

199
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:35,160
is open, free and secure.

200
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,459
But there are many who
do not share this vision

201
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,420
of Cyberspace and Technology

202
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,520
and who seek to shape tech trajectories

203
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,530
in a way that undermined
international security

204
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:46,939
and basic human rights.

205
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:50,070
I'm talking about technologies
such as facial recognition

206
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:51,550
and surveillance systems

207
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:54,060
that can be used to enable
social credit systems

208
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:58,239
and perpetuate persecution
across countries and continents.

209
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,210
The institutionalized theft
of intellectual property

210
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:03,130
to advance entire industries

211
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:06,810
without the R and D burden,
the production of software

212
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:08,750
that lacks security by design

213
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,950
and is intended to advance the economic

214
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:14,003
and strategic interests
of authoritarian regimes.

215
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:17,770
And attempts to rewrite the
architecture of the internet,

216
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:21,280
to perpetuate censorship, remove anonymity

217
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:25,209
and allow greater control
of people and information.

218
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:27,820
These threats to democracy
are more than threats

219
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,660
to the current international order.

220
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:33,780
They risk reshaping our
industries, markets, societies

221
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,492
and our democratic way of life.

222
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:40,050
So we must ask ourselves
how we are ensuring

223
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:42,930
that technology is being
used as we intended.

224
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:46,010
And fundamentally is the
work we are doing in line

225
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:47,840
with our core values.

226
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,280
Because value shape technology

227
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,839
and they guide our innovation.

228
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,320
By being present in our standard setting,

229
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,217
the connective tissue between technology

230
00:10:57,217 --> 00:11:00,170
and the market by underwriting our laws

231
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:03,250
and ethical frameworks,
regulations that decide

232
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:06,430
whether technology promotes
and protects human rights,

233
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:10,790
diversity, and equality or
confines more than it empowers

234
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:14,060
and defining the future
of our economy, societies,

235
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:16,439
and the international environment.

236
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,280
But while technological change may be fast

237
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,970
the impact of tech-related
change can be slow.

238
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:27,490
Often it's this creeping Delta
that is the hardest to see,

239
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:29,900
to understand and to assess.

240
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:34,300
Sure, events like the COVID-19
pandemic have forced decades

241
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:37,670
of digitization into the
space of mere months.

242
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:40,300
And the effects of this
change will take much longer

243
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,760
to be felt and seen
whether good or otherwise.

244
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,467
But if the premise of our
innovation of our work,

245
00:11:46,467 --> 00:11:49,689
and to design, develop and use technology

246
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:52,240
is in line with our democratic values,

247
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,050
we reinforced the very foundations

248
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:56,923
of what we're seeking to protect,

249
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:02,310
our prosperity, our
security and our societies.

250
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:04,619
And we do it in a holistic way

251
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:07,260
that individual security efforts cannot,

252
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:10,530
although they do play a crucial role.

253
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:13,100
The question then is how?

254
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,420
How do we do this?

255
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:17,300
And as individuals, as
organizations, as governments

256
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,507
and as an international community.

257
00:12:19,508 --> 00:12:22,091
(upbeat music)

258
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,490
To navigate an increasingly

259
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:29,730
challenging international environment,

260
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:32,090
Australia has prioritized and enhanced

261
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:35,880
that international cyber and
critical technology diplomacy.

262
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,720
We've understood that cyberspace

263
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,780
and critical technology
affect international relations

264
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:44,910
at all levels, national
security, economic prosperity,

265
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:47,439
the protection and
realization of human rights

266
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,870
and freedoms, sustainable development,

267
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:52,770
and international peace and stability.

268
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:55,520
That our democratic values
underpin our efforts

269
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:59,189
in cyberspace and across
the technology landscape.

270
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:01,130
And they provide the foundation

271
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:03,670
for our international engagement.

272
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:05,540
Australia's International Cyber

273
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:09,680
and Critical Technology
Engagement Strategy sets exactly

274
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,729
out how Australia will engage

275
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:15,500
in this dynamic environment to
shape the design, development

276
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,570
and use of cyberspace
and critical technology

277
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:21,540
in line with liberal democratic values.

278
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:24,209
Is constructed around three main pillars,

279
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:28,590
values, security, and prosperity.

280
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:29,490
They make clear

281
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:32,150
that we will always pursue
a values-based approach

282
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:34,660
to cyberspace and critical technology

283
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,949
and oppose efforts to use technologies

284
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:39,340
to undermine these values.

285
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,920
That we will always
support international peace

286
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,867
and stability and secure trusted
and resilient technology.

287
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:48,699
And that we will always
advocate for cyberspace

288
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:52,170
and technology to foster
sustainable economic growth

289
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:55,430
and development to enhance prosperity,

290
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:57,890
all while asking the same basic question.

291
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:00,130
How do we keep the revolutionary impacts

292
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,780
of technological innovation positive

293
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,860
and mitigate the negative consequences

294
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:07,450
of this ever-changing space,

295
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:10,800
and ensure that the future
of technology continues

296
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,660
to promote and protect our democracy?

297
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:16,680
Well, we're doing this by
shaping critical technology

298
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:20,089
to support peace and security
both at home and abroad.

299
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:22,520
Supporting the ethical,
design, development

300
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,439
and use of technologies
so that they're consistent

301
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,670
with international law,
including human rights.

302
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:31,490
Promoting greater diversity
in technology markets

303
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:33,840
and supply chains to bolster resilience

304
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,070
and encourage a more
competitive playing field

305
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:38,200
for technology providers.

306
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,020
Empowering States to choose transparent,

307
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:44,260
secure and sustainable
technology solutions

308
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:47,520
and oppose technology-related coercion.

309
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,310
Building international resilience

310
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:53,550
to digital disinformation,
misinformation and its effects.

311
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:55,800
Opposing the violation of human rights

312
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:59,439
or freedoms using cyberspace
or critical technology

313
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,840
or building capacity that
seeks to share our experiences

314
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:06,160
and encouraging diversity
and gender equality to ensure

315
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,620
that all voices are heard.

316
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,830
And expanding and improving

317
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:13,210
the policy and regulatory settings

318
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:15,260
that accompany our infrastructure projects

319
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,933
both at home and abroad.

320
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:21,550
Ultimately the Australian
government's vision is for a safe,

321
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:24,949
secure, and prosperous
Australia, Indo-Pacific

322
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:29,480
and world enabled by cyberspace
and critical technology.

323
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,050
Enabled by our belief that
if we shape technology

324
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:33,410
in line with our values

325
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:35,630
we will build resilience into our economic

326
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:40,070
and national security, our
industries and our societies.

327
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:43,950
Because the risks that we face
when distilled down a wider

328
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:46,370
than technical cybersecurity threats

329
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:48,950
and they cannot be mitigated
by hardened networks

330
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:52,710
and cyber defenses alone
because the prevention of risk

331
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:56,060
and threats in cyberspace
alone is not enough.

332
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:58,439
And rather than build higher digital walls

333
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,510
and stronger defenses we
need to look further ahead

334
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:04,400
and deeper into the issues
to shape our environment

335
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,490
and the future that we face.

336
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:09,010
Because technology that
has to be built around

337
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:11,630
our values will be more
resilient against efforts

338
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,510
to use it maliciously.

339
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:15,300
It will bolster cyber resilience

340
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,459
to the ever-increasing threat
of malicious cyber activity.

341
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:21,210
And it will reinforce the
foundations that we are seeking

342
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:24,523
to protect in ways that individual
security efforts cannot.

343
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:29,189
But no country and no company
can hope to shape cyberspace

344
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:31,330
and the tech landscape alone.

345
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:34,710
If we do, we risk an
unsustainable decoupling

346
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:37,600
of our industries and the
effects of bifurcation

347
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,640
into incompatible technology ecosystems

348
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,941
that will be felt by all.

349
00:16:41,941 --> 00:16:44,524
(upbeat music)

350
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:48,620
So we cannot go down this road alone

351
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:51,150
and instead must turn to our values.

352
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:54,750
The key differential between
us and our adversaries,

353
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,930
and the solid foundation that aligns us

354
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:58,949
with our international partners.

355
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:02,030
Partners that include
governments, industry

356
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:03,530
and civil society.

357
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:06,599
Partners who can join us in
pursuing a coordinated approach

358
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:09,000
to shape cyberspace
and critical technology

359
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,099
in line with our shared
interests and values.

360
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:15,139
Because technology is a
field of global competition.

361
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:17,750
And to promote and protect a strong policy

362
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:21,140
and industrial foundation
based on shared values,

363
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:24,040
we must bring together
those who share our vision

364
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:27,270
and understand that by
opposing the risks that we face

365
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:29,340
we can reap the rewards.

366
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,899
And we need to push back
together against those

367
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,710
who would undermine our efforts.

368
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:36,000
Those who would undermine
the rules of the road,

369
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,010
the international law and norms

370
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:41,540
that define responsible
state behavior in cyberspace.

371
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:43,450
Those who do not want to cyberspace

372
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:46,200
that is open free and secure.

373
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,930
And those who seek to
destabilize and overwrite

374
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:52,053
an internet defined by
multi-stakeholder governance.

375
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:56,470
So we must engage at all
levels, domestic, regional

376
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:59,640
and international, private, and public

377
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:03,500
and every stage of the technology
and regulatory life cycle.

378
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,450
We must reach out

379
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:07,620
to the undecided through
transparent advocacy

380
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,969
and convince them why our approach is

381
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:13,860
in their interest and that of
the international community.

382
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:17,600
And we must come together
formally and otherwise to be more

383
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,659
than the sum of our parts.

384
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,200
To present shared interests

385
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,670
and to respect and uphold
international rules

386
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:27,230
and obligations through
positive, practical engagement

387
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:30,080
to protect and support the
sovereignty, prosperity

388
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,490
and security of the region.

389
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:35,160
The key example is the quad.

390
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,120
The key pillar of our international agenda

391
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,090
that brings together four
like-minded democracies.

392
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:44,280
The United States, Japan,
India, and Australia.

393
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,010
It's a dialogue committed
to deepening cooperation

394
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:49,590
on cyber affairs and critical technology.

395
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:52,060
The resilience of regional supply chains,

396
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:55,440
key cyber enabled systems
and critical infrastructure.

397
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,460
And through our like-minded engagement

398
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:00,660
we can embrace the huge
economic and trade benefits

399
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,310
that the quad will bring.

400
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:05,870
With its increased focus on
trusted markets, regional trade,

401
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:09,699
and innovation built on
shared democratic values.

402
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,830
But we can't just have governments
at the table, especially

403
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:14,810
as industries become the battleground

404
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:17,179
for geopolitical supremacy.

405
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:19,040
With a majority of the capability

406
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,639
and infrastructure that delivers

407
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,470
the internet and digital
connectivity resting

408
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:26,290
with the private sector
and the lion's share

409
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,810
of technological innovation

410
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:31,200
done by private research
institutions and companies.

411
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,940
Without these organizations

412
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:36,740
without you being involved
in appropriate discussions,

413
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:40,540
we as government cannot arrive
at the correct settings,

414
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:41,960
and we cannot work towards

415
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:45,283
the technologies and the
resilience systems that we need.

416
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:49,350
But we cannot rest on our
laurels and nor can you,

417
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:51,550
especially as the power
of the private sector

418
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:54,450
becomes ever more visible, highlighted

419
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:56,710
by state owned enterprises
working to shift

420
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:59,980
the scales of tech in
favor of illiberalism

421
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:03,110
and the targeting of private
non-governmental organizations

422
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:04,689
who are historically responsible

423
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:07,240
for the formation of the
internet by countries

424
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,840
who feel that the state should

425
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,720
have more control over cyberspace.

426
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:15,170
More than ever now is the
time for demonstrating

427
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:19,000
how we can assist each other
to understand, mitigate

428
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,050
and respond to efforts that threaten

429
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:24,930
our innovation, infrastructure
and our digital architecture,

430
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:29,064
and the foundation of democratic
values on which they adopt.

431
00:20:29,064 --> 00:20:31,647
(upbeat music)

432
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:35,820
To conclude, in order
to protect our vision

433
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,850
for Cyberspace and Technology

434
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:40,899
the challenge is becoming
increasingly clear.

435
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:43,480
It is undeniable that we now live

436
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,910
in a markedly changed era.

437
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:49,370
COVID 19 continues to disrupt the world.

438
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:52,570
Technology impacts across
the breadth of domestic

439
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:54,370
and foreign affairs.

440
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:55,879
Innovation advances at

441
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:59,320
an increasingly disruptive pace and scale.

442
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,679
And the flow on effects

443
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:04,350
of technological competition
are playing out more broadly

444
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:06,173
than in technology markets alone.

445
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:10,090
The risk of decoupling and of bifurcation

446
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:12,240
into two technology ecosystems

447
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,560
cannot be overlooked nor understated.

448
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:18,370
Its effects will be felt by all.

449
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:19,830
There is without doubt

450
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:22,919
an enormous challenge ahead for all of us.

451
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:26,030
One that is more broad
than domestic policy

452
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:29,389
and that no single government
can tackle by itself.

453
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:31,070
But we are not alone.

454
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:34,270
Like all others in our
international society of states

455
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:36,690
we must continue to address the challenges

456
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:39,730
of emerging technologies
to understand the benefits

457
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:40,743
and the risks.

458
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,640
In Australia our international
engagement will continue

459
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,200
to give us a much needed
understanding of how technology

460
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,460
is impacting the world around us

461
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:54,110
and how we can all shape
it in our interests.

462
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:57,629
And in line with the democratic
values that keeps cyberspace

463
00:21:57,630 --> 00:22:00,500
and technology working in our interests.

464
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,960
And reinforce our
organizations and innovation

465
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,380
in a way that cybersecurity

466
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,233
and hardened networks alone count.

467
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,760
Working collaboratively and transparently,

468
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,870
we will preserve our values, our security

469
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:16,610
and our prosperity, and
ensure that the future

470
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:21,453
of Cyberspace and Technology
looks as we would like it to.

471
00:22:21,453 --> 00:22:22,286
Thank you.

472
00:22:22,286 --> 00:22:25,453
(upbeat music fading)
