1
00:00:00,098 --> 00:00:02,681
(music)

2
00:00:17,104 --> 00:00:19,686
(music)

3
00:00:28,314 --> 00:00:31,064
(music)

4
00:00:40,483 --> 00:00:43,010
- Thank you so much to
everyone for joining us today.

5
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:43,843
For what I know

6
00:00:43,843 --> 00:00:45,910
is going to be a really
interesting conversation

7
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:48,169
about the US Cyber Solarium Commission

8
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:50,480
and the 117th Congress.

9
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,269
I know we all wish we could
be together in California,

10
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:56,090
but our present circumstances
and the past year

11
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:59,740
really illustrate an underscore
the critical importance

12
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:02,820
of cybersecurity and
information security issues.

13
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,580
I'm Susan Hennessey, I'm the
Executive Editor of Lawfare

14
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,220
and a Senior Fellow at
the Brookings Institution.

15
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,780
I'm very honored to be joined today

16
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,390
by Congressman Mike Gallagher

17
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:13,060
and Congressman Jim Langevin,

18
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:14,550
who our co-chair and member

19
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:18,039
of the Cyberspace Solarium Commission.

20
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,150
Both of these members
need no introduction.

21
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:22,660
And in the interest of
our very limited time

22
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:23,890
in that reality,

23
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:26,670
I'm actually gonna dive
right into questions.

24
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,410
Congressman Gallagher,
I'd like to start with you

25
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:31,580
and just talk a little
bit about the background

26
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:34,000
of the commission and
really how we got here.

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,160
I think initially a lot
of people in Washington

28
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,350
had a little bit of skepticism

29
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:39,809
about the commission approach

30
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,600
generally, commissions
are often where you put

31
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,580
really hard problems to die

32
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,470
and bury them under process.

33
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:49,160
And you did something sort
of unusual and that's,

34
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,369
that you put out a really
thoughtful set of recommendations

35
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:54,440
and astonishingly enough,

36
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,009
Congress actually passed
some of them into law.

37
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:59,650
And so I'm sort of interested to hear

38
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:02,657
what was your initial approach
to the commission's work,

39
00:02:02,657 --> 00:02:05,710
and what was the process
and really sort of the goal

40
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:07,660
when you first set out?

41
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:10,549
- Well, the dirty secret
is we had a super power

42
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:14,020
on our commission and that
was my colleague Jim Langevin,

43
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,220
has been paying attention to
these issues so far longer

44
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,300
than I have and probably
pays more attention

45
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,787
to them than any other member of Congress

46
00:02:19,787 --> 00:02:22,010
and was instrumental
in us being successful.

47
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:26,402
But, after the establishment
of the commission

48
00:02:26,402 --> 00:02:28,970
in the 2019 NDAA,

49
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:31,900
and the population of the
commissioners and the co-chairs,

50
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,060
we really took a look
at it and thought, yeah,

51
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,343
there's a lot of these outside commissions

52
00:02:36,343 --> 00:02:38,549
that do good work, they write
very thoughtful reports,

53
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:41,760
but a lot of times these
reports just sit on shelves

54
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,690
and they collect dust.

55
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:45,320
And so, we also looked at
the makeup of the commission

56
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,183
was for sitting legislators,

57
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:49,850
an independent from Maine, Angus King,

58
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:51,970
my co-chair Jim, Democrat,

59
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:54,237
myself a Republican, a
Republican Senator, Ben Sasse,

60
00:02:54,237 --> 00:02:56,350
and we thought, well, this is unique

61
00:02:56,350 --> 00:03:00,710
in that it is a congressionally
driven exercise.

62
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,093
And so we should take advantage

63
00:03:02,093 --> 00:03:04,429
of Congress's unique strengths.

64
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:07,250
We had great participation
from the executive branch,

65
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:10,810
we had phenomenal outside
experts like Chris Inglis

66
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:15,530
and Suzanne Spaulding, Sam
Ravich, a lot of others,

67
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:19,850
but with Congress sort
of being the institution

68
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:21,570
that gave life to the
commission with four members

69
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:23,079
of Congress on the commission,

70
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,330
what we should write a report
that's really a blueprint

71
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,680
for legislative action.

72
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,810
And so, if you look at the final report

73
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:31,580
not only are we trying to sound the alarm

74
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:34,487
in terms of the challenge
we're facing in Cyberspace,

75
00:03:34,487 --> 00:03:37,210
and a lot of times we
sort of thought of this as

76
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:40,010
being the 9/11 Commission without the 9/11

77
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:43,260
trying to warn America
and the inter-agency

78
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,130
so that we can avoid the crisis,

79
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:47,140
you'll not only see that
warning in an attempt

80
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,920
to sort of convey the stakes
to the American people,

81
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,209
you'll see recommendations
that were geared

82
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:57,280
towards being put into being
implemented right away.

83
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,610
And in any case where we're
saying Congress should do X

84
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:02,650
Y or Z, we then also
took the trouble to draft

85
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,410
the legislative language
and I'm proud to say

86
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,600
we got about 25 of our
recommendations effectuated

87
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,549
into law with last year's NDAA.

88
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,520
We got a lot of work yet to be done,

89
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:15,130
but when you boil it down,
I think we're arguing for,

90
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,680
it's a call to arms for
whole of nation approach,

91
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,760
we believe deterrence,
some form of deterrence

92
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,529
is possible in Cyberspace,

93
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:23,700
it involves denying
benefits to our adversaries

94
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,210
by expanding public-private collaboration,

95
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:29,130
building resilience, and finally
it involves imposing costs

96
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:32,100
against malign actors by
maintaining the capability,

97
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,020
capacity and credibility
required to retaliate

98
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:37,190
against those who attack
our interest in Cyberspace.

99
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:40,570
So, we've been very pleased
with the results so far,

100
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:41,920
but again, a long way to go.

101
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,610
And we're gonna continue
that fundamental approach

102
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:47,230
which is that, this is
a mechanism for action

103
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:50,170
not just a sort of a debating
society in which Jim and I

104
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:51,770
get to talk to each other a lot.

105
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:54,680
- So congressmen Langevin,
the commission report

106
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,620
I think came out in March, 2020.

107
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:00,000
So we're sort of right past
the one-year anniversary,

108
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,780
a lot has happened between then and now.

109
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:05,840
Sort of, what is your
accounting of the successes

110
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,960
of the commission and
sort of the end the report

111
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,080
and where are the areas where
you think that there's new,

112
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,140
there's additional work
that needs to be done

113
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:14,979
and the work that's gonna be
driving the commission's agenda

114
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:18,070
and legislative priorities
sort of moving forward?

115
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:22,290
- Sure, well, virtual let
me just say a few words

116
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:24,640
about our two co-chairs.

117
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,610
First of all, I thank Mike

118
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:31,770
for the kind words about me,
but the truth of the matter

119
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:34,820
is we had two rockstar
co-chairs with my colleague

120
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:38,433
Congressman Mike Gallagher
and Senator Angus King.

121
00:05:38,433 --> 00:05:39,840
So I was proud to serve on there

122
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,159
also with Senator Ben Sasse,

123
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,420
but then all of the
incredible talent that we had

124
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,540
both in the executive branch
and the private sector

125
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:51,563
including Chris Inglis
and Suzanne Spaulding,

126
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:56,289
Chris was Deputy Director
of the NSA first now,

127
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,380
to be nominated as our
national Cyber Director,

128
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,850
And then Suzanne Spaulding of course

129
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:05,850
who was the Former Director
of what is now CISA,

130
00:06:06,134 --> 00:06:09,600
'cause we had Dr. Samantha
Ravich, Tom Fanning.

131
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,950
I could just go on the list,
just outstanding commission.

132
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,729
I should have mentioned everybody.

133
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:17,870
But I also wanted to mention
our Executive Director

134
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,530
Retired Navy Rear Admiral Mark Montgomery,

135
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:22,440
who from the outset was
determined that we were gonna keep

136
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:26,160
this process moving along and
the incredible rockstar staff

137
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:26,993
that we had.

138
00:06:26,993 --> 00:06:30,210
So, and again, wonderful
team to work with.

139
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:33,159
So, in terms of what we've accomplished,

140
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,130
one are the most important recommendation

141
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:38,360
something I've been working
on for more than a decade,

142
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,913
is to create a national
cyber director a position

143
00:06:40,913 --> 00:06:43,160
that is senate confirmed
in the Executive Office

144
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,160
of the President.

145
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,840
As I mentioned, Chris
Inglis is nominated now

146
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,169
as the first ever National Cyber Director

147
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:54,080
and he's awaiting
confirmation as we speak.

148
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,359
But the one thing that had been missing

149
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,960
in all of our strategy
and all of our efforts,

150
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,130
was a quarterback on the field
someone that had both policy

151
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:06,400
and budgetary authority
to reach across government

152
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,609
and compelled about
departments and agencies

153
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:11,950
to do their part, to do
more on cybersecurity

154
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:14,832
and we now have that
quarterback in Chris Inglis.

155
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:19,000
Beyond that we also were very successful.

156
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,410
So we had, I mean, there
were 80 recommendations

157
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:25,190
that came out of the, our final
report, 55 which had to do

158
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,469
I just say to proposals.

159
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:31,470
And we got about 27 of
those enacted into law

160
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,930
through the National
Defense Authorization Act

161
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:37,440
where I served as a
chair of a subcommittee

162
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,940
on the House Armed Services Committee.

163
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:43,040
And in addition to the
national cyber director,

164
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,260
we had provisions in there to
strengthen the Cybersecurity

165
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:49,200
and Infrastructure
Security Agency or CISA,

166
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,969
creating a joint Cyber Planning Office.

167
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:56,850
It's this giving CISA now
administrative subpoena authority

168
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,530
and allowances to also to
do proactive threat hunting

169
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:03,070
on other government networks.

170
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:06,400
A lot of people didn't
realize that CISA in the past

171
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,679
could only do threat hunting
on others government networks,

172
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,170
if they were invited in.

173
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:13,900
And we know what happened in that case.

174
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,359
Departments and agencies
don't wanna look bad

175
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,280
'cause if they invite CISA
and they find something

176
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,520
doesn't make them look good potentially.

177
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,969
And so it's consequently
CISA was never invited in.

178
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,150
Well that has all changed.

179
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:26,739
Now CISA I can do threat hunting

180
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,790
on other government networks

181
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:30,540
and they're gonna be much more proactive.

182
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:34,900
Also working closely with
critical infrastructure

183
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:37,539
codifying the Sector
Risk Management Agencies.

184
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:39,870
So we delineate responsibilities.

185
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:43,510
And also the continuity
of economy planning

186
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:47,380
is another aspect that got enacted.

187
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:51,970
So there's something Dr.
Ravitch was really championing

188
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:53,240
on our efforts.

189
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:56,490
So, those are some of just the highlights.

190
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:58,180
In terms of what our next steps,

191
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,599
again, there's still more work to be done

192
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,580
and we're ready to go again for round two

193
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:07,580
in terms of legislation, the setting up

194
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:13,329
it's systemically important
critical infrastructure

195
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:16,340
designation that would
identify those areas

196
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,410
of critical infrastructure

197
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:20,900
that are just too important to fail.

198
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:24,819
And so, we wanna have a
basically a new social contract

199
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:27,057
with this entity what we call (indistinct)

200
00:09:27,057 --> 00:09:28,750
for lack of a better acronym.

201
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:31,640
But systemically important
critical infrastructure.

202
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:35,930
So a new social contract,
they would have to be more aid

203
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:38,030
and information sharing from government,

204
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:40,390
but also they would have
to be continuous monitoring

205
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:44,840
on these critical networks
for critical infrastructure.

206
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,680
All of these things are really important.

207
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,250
We also wanna establish and create

208
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,040
the joint collaborative environment.

209
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:56,089
So we have both real-time
information sharing

210
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:59,880
and collaboration between
critical infrastructure

211
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,250
and the government.

212
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:05,310
And that's something that
is really lacking right now.

213
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:06,439
The last thing I wanna say is,

214
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:10,360
we also need to create a
Bureau of Cyber Statistics

215
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,220
so that we can quantify what's working

216
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,980
and what's not in Cyberspace.

217
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:18,864
Right now we don't have
that what is working

218
00:10:18,864 --> 00:10:21,110
in terms of the data, and what's not.

219
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:23,420
We think we know, a
lot of times we should,

220
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,770
even CISA will shoot from the hip.

221
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:28,600
We need to quantify
that so that even CISAs

222
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,510
can make the business
case to their CEOs or CIOs

223
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:34,433
or the boards.

224
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:37,830
And then the last thing I'll mention is,

225
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:41,760
we need to create an
ambassador rank position

226
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,100
at the state department with a bureau

227
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,870
underneath that ambassador,
so that we're leading

228
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,850
more proactively on the
international front.

229
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:51,300
That's another area
that's lacking right now.

230
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,680
But I could go on for a while,

231
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,599
but those are some of the highlights.

232
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,320
- So I think parts of your
answer referenced a little bit

233
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,280
what has occurred over the past year

234
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,310
and I think really the SolarWinds breach

235
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:04,680
being the most consequential,

236
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,250
and sort of this has emerged a little bit

237
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,380
of sort of a Rorschach (indistinct),

238
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:10,770
where everybody looks at
it and sees confirmation

239
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:11,603
of their priors.

240
00:11:11,603 --> 00:11:14,290
We've got people sort of
arguing, "Well this illustrates

241
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:17,209
the failures of our current
cybersecurity posture

242
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:19,360
and why doesn't forward, doesn't work."

243
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,480
We have simultaneously
other people arguing

244
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,730
this shows the need to double
down on the current strategy,

245
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:25,930
it's sort of do more of it.

246
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:26,762
And Congressman Gallagher,

247
00:11:26,763 --> 00:11:28,930
I'll direct this to you initially.

248
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:31,739
When you look at SolarWinds in particular,

249
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,440
I'm sort of what is your big takeaway

250
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,380
about what this means and
what this says for you

251
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:38,603
as cybersecurity strategy and posture?

252
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,410
- Well, I think it is notable

253
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:44,339
that a lot of the warning we got about it

254
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:46,740
or at least the initial
detection was from FireEye.

255
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,240
So it wasn't from a US government entity,

256
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,030
it was from the private sector.

257
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:53,470
And I think that is a reminder of the need

258
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:56,330
to relentlessly push

259
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:59,110
on public private collaboration

260
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:01,670
and for the federal government
to have the humility

261
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:05,420
to recognize that it needs the cooperation

262
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,339
of the private sector

263
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,340
particularly when over 80% of
the critical infrastructure

264
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:11,823
in Cyberspace is controlled
by the private sector.

265
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:13,730
That's essential.

266
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:14,940
And I think if you read our report,

267
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,120
you'll see a good faith effort

268
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:21,120
not to adopt a very
top-down, one-size-fits-all,

269
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,440
onerous regulatory
approach where NSA or DOD

270
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,130
or CISA is saying, you private sector

271
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:32,100
must give us X, Y, Z information,

272
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,360
or you must do things a certain way,

273
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:37,490
but rather an attempt to
have a more collaborative

274
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,480
a partnership to get the incentives right.

275
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,480
And also for the federal government

276
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,560
to take a look at itself as it needs to do

277
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,329
in the wake of SolarWinds

278
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:48,970
and have an honest conversation
about where it went wrong.

279
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:51,160
I know a lot of commentators
have pointed out these hacks

280
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:55,219
as examples of the failure of
defend forward for example,

281
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:57,670
but that's not totally accurate, right?

282
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:01,349
I mean, defend forward
posits that us cyber forces

283
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:04,030
should maneuver into what's
called red and gray space

284
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:05,970
or adversary controlled and third party

285
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:07,300
controlled cyberspace,

286
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,209
to learn about how adversaries operate

287
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:12,130
and then when authorized conduct
cyber effects operations.

288
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:14,640
But in both of the cases recently,

289
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:18,090
adversaries took advantage
of blind spots in blue space

290
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:20,790
where the military
appropriately does not operate.

291
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:22,819
And so, what the attacks teach us is that,

292
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:26,180
the US needs to get a more
complete understanding

293
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,219
of the threat environment

294
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:30,850
which will require fusing
insight from across blue,

295
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:34,650
gray and red space to
enable among other things

296
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:37,340
defend forward to be more
effective and anticipating

297
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:39,370
and thwarting malicious activity

298
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:41,670
when it happens outside
of the US for example.

299
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:45,290
all of the things that
Congressman Langevin talked about

300
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:46,490
the joint collaborative environment,

301
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:49,210
the Bureau of Cyber Statistics
are geared towards that.

302
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:51,220
And the other thing I think
we really need to monitor

303
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:53,120
particularly when it
comes to SolarWinds is,

304
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,440
we feel very strongly, Jim mentioned it.

305
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,780
But we feel strongly that something like,

306
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:00,750
giving CISA threat hunting
authority and .gov networks,

307
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:03,520
really empowering the
incident response teams

308
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,819
they have at CISA, would
have made a difference

309
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,210
perhaps not prevented the attack,

310
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:11,530
but perhaps allowed us to
detect it, the hack rather,

311
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:13,439
and allowed us to detect it quicker.

312
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,790
We need to monitor the executive
branch over the next year,

313
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:19,089
two years to see if you
authorities and resources

314
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:22,990
we are giving them, are actually
having the effect we think

315
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:24,350
they're going to have.

316
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:26,290
And that really want the
commission going forward

317
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:29,980
to be interactive with the
executive branch to figure out

318
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,870
if kinda we hit the mark
on certain recommendations

319
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,960
or if we miss the mark on others.

320
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,980
- So Congressman Langevin,

321
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:38,540
there's clearly is an ongoing
sort of incident response

322
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:41,372
within the US government right now.

323
00:14:41,372 --> 00:14:42,676
And there's sort of
continues to be this question

324
00:14:42,677 --> 00:14:45,370
about the external response.

325
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:47,800
The breach has been publicly
attributed to Russia,

326
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,180
but I think there's still
a lot of disagreement

327
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,469
about how to respond,

328
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:54,290
and really how to even
understand what happened?

329
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:55,920
And for somebody like yourself

330
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,270
who's been in this space
for a really long time

331
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:00,550
and thought a lot about sort of breaches

332
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:02,949
as they've evolved over time,

333
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:05,540
how should we even
understand what happens?

334
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:08,770
Do you view this as
conventional espionage?

335
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:11,160
And so whenever we should think
about sort of the response

336
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,800
options available, it really
is sort of the moderate tools

337
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,443
that are typical of that context,

338
00:15:16,443 --> 00:15:18,150
or whenever you look at SolarWinds,

339
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,290
do you say no, this is
something different,

340
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:23,160
this is something that
crosses a normative line

341
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,833
and demand some more aggressive response?

342
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,357
- Well, a lot of ways, this is something

343
00:15:29,357 --> 00:15:31,668
that it's gonna be incumbent
upon the administration

344
00:15:31,668 --> 00:15:33,880
to give us that answer.

345
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,870
Certainly, there's a lot of elements here

346
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:38,170
that look like traditional espionage.

347
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:41,770
But it was the worst US cyberintrusion

348
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,410
in US history and in
terms of what they did

349
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:47,760
in terms of getting on our networks.

350
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:52,140
But it's really gonna be
up to the administration

351
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:56,640
to delineate between
whether this was broader

352
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:00,300
than a traditional espionage
or is it traditional espionage.

353
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:05,300
Because we do run the risk of
blowback from other entities

354
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:12,540
and saying that if they see our activities

355
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:18,480
or allies activities as very similar,

356
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,310
what is the difference between this say

357
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:22,170
and cause no Petra.

358
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:23,599
Now there was a big difference

359
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,800
and we have to make that delineation,

360
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,140
I mean, not Petra was
clearly a cyberattack,

361
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:32,090
this was a cyberintrusion.

362
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:35,360
And in terms of SolarWinds,
and now delineating it

363
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,070
terms of how much damage was done

364
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:39,580
and did it cross the line.

365
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,280
That really it's gonna be
up to the administration

366
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,230
to answer that question.

367
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:46,223
But, if we don't do that donation,

368
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:51,470
does it disincentivize
Russia from conducting say

369
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:56,000
a SolarWinds versus a not Petra attack.

370
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,000
And, it also could put US
operatives at risk too.

371
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,760
That's something else
that I'm worried about

372
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,460
in terms of a blowback.

373
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:07,640
So, we're gonna have to be very
careful about how we did it.

374
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,310
There's no doubt SolarWinds

375
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:13,060
is a very damaging cyberintrusion,

376
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:16,429
but now we've got to make
clear what the difference is,

377
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:18,869
and what our response will be.

378
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:19,703
- Congressman Langevin,

379
00:17:19,703 --> 00:17:21,629
I want to stick with you
for a moment just to return

380
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:23,930
to sort of something that you said earlier

381
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:25,970
about the national cyber director

382
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:28,600
and President Biden's intent
to nominate Chris Inglis

383
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,830
the Former Deputy Director of
NSA, my former boss as well.

384
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:34,370
And I'm curious sort of, are you satisfied

385
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:36,389
that nominating someone of that stature

386
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:39,860
really fulfills your vision
for what this position is

387
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:42,129
in practice, or do you think

388
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:44,780
that the national cyber director
is ultimately going to need

389
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:48,260
additional legal
authorities to be effective

390
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,830
and empowered sort of,
is this a necessary,

391
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:52,087
but not sufficient condition

392
00:17:52,087 --> 00:17:55,003
or sort of your vision
really been fulfilled?

393
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,750
- So I'm absolutely
thrilled with Chris Inglis

394
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:01,630
being nominated as the
first Cyber Director

395
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:03,200
is again senate confirmed position

396
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,490
the Executive Office of the President.

397
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:08,930
Chris is a a real thought
leader on cyber policy.

398
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:12,730
And he understands both the
cyber offense and cyber defense.

399
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:15,930
And he's gonna know how
to rebalance equities.

400
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:19,060
He will focus obviously
on the defense side.

401
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:22,740
But right now up until this
point, we didn't have anybody

402
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:25,330
within the Executive Office
of President that was,

403
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:28,030
that had that policy and
budgetary authority right now

404
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:29,570
that the arbiter is,

405
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:33,399
and was the Office of
Management and Budget.

406
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:38,400
And cybersecurity is not on
this primary mission or focus.

407
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:42,480
Now you're gonna have
somebody that Chris Inglis

408
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,570
that will be reviewing
departments and agency budgets

409
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:47,580
and can make recommendations directly

410
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:50,026
to the president and directly to ONB

411
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:56,270
to do better protect our
networks in Cyberspace.

412
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:58,680
So we close off those vulnerabilities

413
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,800
certainly where they're glaring

414
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,930
and we didn't have that before.

415
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:06,930
So, the Office of National
Cyber Director of course,

416
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:12,790
is really just focused on cyber security.

417
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:13,960
And that's what we really needed.

418
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:17,700
Someone that's gonna be
that wake up every day

419
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,820
going to work and that is his mission.

420
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:23,110
And I have great confidence in Chris

421
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:25,600
to be able to do that job effectively.

422
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,120
- So Congressman Gallagher,
sort of the conversation

423
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,540
about the national cyber director,
I think it's taking place

424
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:33,050
in the context of a, sort of a fight

425
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:35,169
that's pretty familiar at the dawn

426
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:38,920
of a new presidential
administration as various agencies

427
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:42,130
sort of jockey for
position sort of position

428
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:45,140
within domestic cyber incident response

429
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:48,370
in particular where there's
a foreign state actor

430
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:50,389
and sort of a threat actor.

431
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:52,710
The White House, DHS, NSA,

432
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:54,890
this new NCD office, the FBI,

433
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:57,060
a lot of people have a dog in this fight,

434
00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:00,480
in terms of the piece that
they feel responsible for,

435
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,390
and sort of relatedly
what legal authorities

436
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:06,010
and funding they are entitled to

437
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:10,520
in order to execute their
mission and sort of holistically,

438
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:14,290
what is your view for what a
structure for incident response

439
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:18,320
should look like, are there
too many cooks in the kitchen?

440
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,929
You've now spent over two years

441
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:22,370
really examining this
question and sort of,

442
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:26,072
what are your views about who
should be in charge of what?

443
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,900
- Well at first if I
could just dovetail off

444
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,920
what Congressman Langevin said,

445
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:34,380
I do think if the old rule
of bureaucratic politics

446
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,920
is where you stand
depends on where you sit,

447
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:40,860
I understand the reluctance of
those in the executive branch

448
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:45,540
to have Congress voiced an
alternative structure upon them.

449
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,420
But I can tell you that there
was just a lot of thought

450
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:48,253
that went into this.

451
00:20:48,253 --> 00:20:50,120
And I do think in the early going

452
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,000
of the national cyber director,

453
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,580
so much is going to be dependent

454
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,100
on the personalities involved.

455
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:58,709
And I think we're very lucky
in Chris to have someone

456
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:00,240
obviously he's deeply knowledgeable,

457
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,820
high energy but low ego
who can work very well

458
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:05,669
with Anne Neuberger and with
Jen Easterly and others.

459
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:08,240
And I just think the
personalities are right

460
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,590
to make it work,

461
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:12,189
and I think Congress
stands ready to engage

462
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:14,470
the administration and conversation
about further resources

463
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:16,660
and authorities as to
your direct question.

464
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:18,600
I mean, the national cyber
director is intended to act

465
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:22,179
as a central coordinator for
US Government Incident Response

466
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,930
or any inherently defensive action

467
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:26,830
the government takes to secure cyberspace.

468
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:30,260
So, I don't expect any major
changes in the authorities

469
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:34,520
and responsibilities of
for example CISA or the FBI

470
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:37,840
that you primary agencies
involved in incident response,

471
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,439
but I expect the USG,
I expect the government

472
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,270
to continue to use the
cyber response group

473
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:45,730
for day-to-day activities,

474
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:48,210
and to use the unified coordination group

475
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:49,620
to respond to crises.

476
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:52,600
These groups serve as
primary coordinating bodies

477
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,439
for cyber incidents.

478
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,620
I think it's fair to
say they would benefit

479
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,860
from even heavier involvement
from the private sector

480
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:01,540
which as recent events have
shown are indispensable partners

481
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,010
in large scale incident response.

482
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:04,540
And then more long-term I think,

483
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,149
the national cyber
director will be critical

484
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:08,940
and ensuring greater
coordination, planning,

485
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:11,670
and information sharing
across federal agencies

486
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:14,160
so that we can more quickly
detect cyber incidents,

487
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,760
and we're better prepared
to respond to them

488
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,683
when they arise.

489
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,610
- So I think I have time to
squeeze in a final question

490
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:23,322
if I can, and I'll pose it
to you Congressman Langevin

491
00:22:23,323 --> 00:22:26,340
And that's, for the past five years,

492
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,790
like really election security

493
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:30,040
I think has been at the top of the agenda,

494
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:33,649
it's consumed a lot of
attention in the national debate

495
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:36,160
with the 2020 election behind us now.

496
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,830
I think there's a little bit
of a tendency of the public

497
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:41,840
and public attention to
also legislative attention

498
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:46,699
which is a finite resource to
shift to other priority areas

499
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,320
including other priority
areas in Cyberspace,

500
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:52,460
including the very long
list that we've discussed

501
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:54,483
just in this conversation thus far.

502
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:58,300
That said, the work of election security

503
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,350
is very much unfinished.

504
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:04,889
And so, to your mind sort
of what are the next steps

505
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:06,240
for election security

506
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,720
and what are sort of the
legislative priorities and efforts

507
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,590
that we might anticipate
seeing in that space

508
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,919
in the 117th Congress?

509
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,990
- Sure, well my clear
message on that point is,

510
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:19,080
don't take our eye off the ball.

511
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,060
Yes, we had the most secure elections

512
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:21,893
in US history.

513
00:23:21,893 --> 00:23:25,220
I agree with Chris Krebs
when he made that statement.

514
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:28,050
And it's because of a lot of
work, a whole of government,

515
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:30,940
whole of nation approach
working with state,

516
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:33,110
local governments and elected officials,

517
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:35,810
making sure that we had secure elections.

518
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:40,500
But it doesn't mean that we can
stop defending our elections

519
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,900
going forward because
our adversaries enemies

520
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:46,540
who would like to so doubt
or undermine confidence

521
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:48,110
that our elections are still out there

522
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:50,590
and they're gonna be at it again I'm sure.

523
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:53,810
So, we need a sustained investment

524
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:57,040
on the part of the federal
government to lock-in our gains.

525
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:02,040
And that means more support for strong

526
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:05,260
up-to-date modern election equipment.

527
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:09,200
It means paper ballots, it
means risk-limiting audits,

528
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,040
it means attention to non-voting systems,

529
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,450
like voter registration systems as well.

530
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:16,570
That somewhere else that
are enraged and adversaries

531
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:18,280
will have to be able to sow doubt.

532
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,860
We can't allow that to happen.

533
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:24,382
But, in the battle now in
terms of what comes next,

534
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:27,480
the battle-space is already shifting out

535
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,730
from say, elections
nonfunctional equipment,

536
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:31,970
again which we have to keep
our eye on the ball there

537
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,020
and lock-in those gains.

538
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:36,620
But also the battles now
shifting to misinformation

539
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:39,500
and disinformation, our
enemies and adversaries

540
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:44,500
want to sow doubt in
discord among the electorate

541
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:47,250
and the American people, we
can't allow that to happen.

542
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:50,270
We've got to build in
resiliency into our system.

543
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:53,887
So, strong civics education is important,

544
00:24:53,887 --> 00:24:57,210
and also digital literacy
so that people understand

545
00:24:57,210 --> 00:24:58,760
how important it is to
not just get their news

546
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,890
from one source, but from multiple sources

547
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:05,100
and really be discerning
in the news that they see.

548
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:08,040
But, election cybersecurity
is absolutely necessary,

549
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,280
but it's really not sufficient to counter

550
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,530
our enemies and adversaries.

551
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:15,139
So, we again have to have a government

552
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:17,570
of whole of nation approach
and involves obviously

553
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:19,139
not only government,
but the American people.

554
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,740
Private sector is important.

555
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:23,780
And we have to make sure that
our enemies and adversaries

556
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:28,290
can't so that those seeds
of doubt in our system

557
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:31,409
and our discourse and our
democracy it really does take

558
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:35,400
a discerning electorate and
we need to do this together.

559
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,810
- And that sort of briefly
Congressman Gallagher,

560
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:39,210
just to take it back to sort of Congress.

561
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:41,760
Is this an area in which
you feel optimistic

562
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,850
about the possibility of
bipartisan legislation

563
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:47,919
sort of, are you hopeful about that,

564
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:52,920
and is there a real sort of
constituency across the aisle,

565
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:57,880
or are you concerned that
this might fall victim

566
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,260
to some of the same
factors of a polarization

567
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:02,960
that has prevented
common sense legislation

568
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,490
endorsed by both of you I believe,

569
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:06,610
from moving forward in the past?

570
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:09,209
- Well, I think at least in
two areas I'm optimistic.

571
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:13,970
When it comes to sort of
the unique cyber expertise

572
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:17,070
as well as obviously just intelligence

573
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:20,100
that as an intelligence
community intelligence

574
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:23,389
that the federal government
has and can share with state

575
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:26,070
and local and tribal and
territorial officials

576
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,770
in the context of an election,

577
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:29,560
I think that's a bipartisan conversation.

578
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:32,270
And I've supported a
variety of Jim's efforts

579
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:33,530
on that regard.

580
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:35,893
And then I think there's
broader consensus on the need

581
00:26:35,893 --> 00:26:40,280
for enhanced support for civics education

582
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,620
in the digital age, right?

583
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:42,949
Where the demands of citizenship

584
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:45,340
I think are increasing for all the reasons

585
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:47,850
that Congressman Langevin laid out

586
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:51,730
as it pertains to the broader
debate, about elections,

587
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:54,250
and kind of in the non-cyber domain,

588
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:56,490
and there sort of the constitutional role

589
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:57,680
of the states for the federal government

590
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,300
maybe I'm a little bit more pessimistic,

591
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,060
but, I think with a lot
of things we talked about

592
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:04,300
in the report that are more
specialized in cyber focused,

593
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:07,720
I think there is a room
for bipartisan cooperation.

594
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,870
I think what's most remarkable

595
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:10,989
about the cyber debate in general is,

596
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:13,240
is its bipartisan character in the house.

597
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,650
I mean, I think he could have come

598
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:17,860
into any of our commission
meetings blindfolded

599
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:19,590
and you wouldn't have known
who the Democrats were

600
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:21,270
and the Republicans were.

601
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:23,379
I guess you can't know what
taking your blindfold off.

602
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:25,110
There's not like a look
for one or the other.

603
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:29,090
But the conversations were very bipartisan

604
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:32,230
and I think Jim my
friendship and partnership

605
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:33,420
is evidence of that.

606
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:35,300
- Congressman Gallagher
and Congressman Langevin,

607
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,456
thank you so much for joining me.

608
00:27:37,456 --> 00:27:38,360
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

609
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,029
Thanks for moderating, great job.

610
00:27:40,029 --> 00:27:42,612
(music)
