1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:04,120
- Okay, good afternoon and good morning

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:05,870
depending on where you are.

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:10,870
Welcome to Masterclass, a
Cyber Case Law Review 2021.

4
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,580
Rick and I have done this
before, never in this format.

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,663
So we're happy to give it a go.

6
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,060
Just before we get started,

7
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,110
our contact information is included,

8
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:22,830
the materials you have.

9
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:26,729
Please, please, please ask
questions in the chat room.

10
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:29,310
In fact, the secret word for CLE credits

11
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:32,920
gonna be in the chat room
but feel free to populate.

12
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:36,120
If we can't get to questions,
we will follow up with you.

13
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,129
We will do what we can.

14
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:38,870
You have our information,

15
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:42,669
but as you know we might've
been home for a lot of 2020

16
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,930
but it certainly didn't
slow down the courts

17
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:46,089
from continuing to work

18
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:48,940
and it certainly didn't slow
down the number of cyber cases.

19
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:50,763
So we have a lot to get to.

20
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:53,370
Before we get started,

21
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:56,530
Rick's gonna put up the
lawyer's favorite disclaimer

22
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:57,800
and legal caveat

23
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,339
just so I can make sure
that I've acknowledged that

24
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:04,550
that this presentation is
designed to raise awareness

25
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:06,560
of general legal principles raised

26
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,360
in several recent domestic and
foreign cyber related cases.

27
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,670
The session and any information contained

28
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:16,310
in this presentation is not legal advice

29
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,270
and shouldn't be construed such.

30
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:21,289
The views and opinions
expressed in this presentation

31
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:23,270
are those of the authors

32
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:26,740
and do not reflect the
policy opinion or position

33
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:30,119
of their employers or any other entity.

34
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,010
Having gotten all of that out of the way,

35
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:34,992
I'm gonna spend this packed hour

36
00:01:34,992 --> 00:01:37,990
making sure everybody gets as
much information as they can

37
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:40,110
and the person who's gonna
give that information to you

38
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:42,750
is Professor Rick Aldrich, over to you.

39
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,380
- Thank you very much, Julie.

40
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,949
So since this conference
is about resilience,

41
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:50,630
we thought we would start
out by addressing that issue.

42
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:52,764
And so this Merriam-Webster
dictionary definition

43
00:01:52,764 --> 00:01:54,759
is an ability to recover from

44
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,440
or adjust easily to misfortune.

45
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,850
And so this session is
designed to help you

46
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:03,940
the attendees identify some
curve balls in the case law

47
00:02:03,941 --> 00:02:07,570
that you may need to help your company,

48
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:08,858
your government agency,

49
00:02:08,859 --> 00:02:12,090
or yourselves in recovering from.

50
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,480
And we're gonna try to
present those issues

51
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,780
as we go along.

52
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:19,500
So after each case, we'll
provide some key takeaways.

53
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,120
And at the end of the course

54
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,043
we will kind of summarize
those key takeaways.

55
00:02:26,291 --> 00:02:29,370
Today what we're gonna do
is we're gonna address cases

56
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:31,580
in five significant areas.

57
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,190
We've selected these cases

58
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,777
because they are either
currently pending before

59
00:02:35,777 --> 00:02:39,380
or recently decided by a
prominent appellate court.

60
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:41,315
In fact, one of them is
a US Supreme Court case.

61
00:02:41,315 --> 00:02:44,250
Others are Federal Circuit
or state Supreme Court cases.

62
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,340
And one is even by the Court of Justice

63
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,040
of the European Union.

64
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,775
Each of them raises significant issues

65
00:02:49,776 --> 00:02:52,380
that have developed splits in the circuits

66
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:57,150
or otherwise raised issues of
significant first impression.

67
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:00,376
So I think these will be a cases.

68
00:03:00,376 --> 00:03:02,590
What we would like to do in our approach

69
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:06,300
is we're gonna to set out the
facts for you on each case,

70
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,740
and then ask you to make the call.

71
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,880
We normally do this in a physical setting

72
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,859
where we actually ask
people to raise their hands

73
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,480
but because of the limitations
of this technology,

74
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,265
what we're gonna do instead is ask

75
00:03:17,265 --> 00:03:20,109
that you just think about the question

76
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:23,450
and then kind of mentally
lock in your answer.

77
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:26,394
We think that this will help
you better learn the material

78
00:03:26,395 --> 00:03:29,900
if you're wrong, or you just
guessed listen carefully

79
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:33,020
to why the court decided as it did.

80
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,080
If you were right,

81
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,080
then see if the explanation
confirmed what you thought.

82
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,960
After we move through these five areas,

83
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,330
we'll move to some cases to watch.

84
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:45,710
These are some upcoming issues

85
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:47,500
that you may wanna keep your eye on

86
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,410
as they come around the horizon

87
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:51,980
because they also could
throw some curve balls

88
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:52,912
at you as well.

89
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:59,180
So the first case is Van Buren
versus the United States.

90
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,421
And this is actually
before the Supreme Court

91
00:04:01,421 --> 00:04:05,160
or argument was heard just last November.

92
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,960
The facts of the case involve Van Buren

93
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,110
who was a police officer

94
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:12,080
in the coming Georgia Police Department.

95
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,360
In this capacity, he was authorized

96
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,649
to utilize the Georgia
Crime Information Center

97
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:19,359
also known as GCIC.

98
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,040
That was a particular database

99
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,820
that he was authorized to use.

100
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,710
It's an official government database

101
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:28,359
maintained by the Georgia
Bureau of Investigation

102
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,160
and connected to the National
Crime Information Center

103
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,063
or NCIC which is of course
maintained by the FBI.

104
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:38,500
There was an individual in
this community named Albo

105
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,640
which the sheriff advised his deputies

106
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,440
and other place officers
to kind of stay away from

107
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,600
cause he was a little bit of trouble,

108
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,270
but for reasons not entirely clear,

109
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:52,190
Van Buren on decided to go up to Albo

110
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:57,190
and say, "Hey, look, I
could use a $15,000 loan.

111
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,160
Can you help me out?"

112
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,930
Well, Albo knowing that he
had some run ins with the law

113
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:04,630
before kind of felt like
he was being shaken down.

114
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:07,130
So he reported to the Sheriff's office.

115
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:09,680
The Sheriff's officer reported to the FBI

116
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,070
and they asked Albo to
serve as an informant

117
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:16,659
for an undercover sting operation.

118
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:20,060
In his role as an informant,
Albo asked Van Buren

119
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:23,167
if he would run the license
plates of a woman he met

120
00:05:23,167 --> 00:05:26,520
to see if she was an
undercover police officer

121
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,250
and pursuant to his undercover role,

122
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:32,140
he gave Van Buren some
fake license plates.

123
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:36,050
It turned out shortly after
that and after paying $5,000

124
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:38,160
initially where the promise of more,

125
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,316
Van Buren actually did run
the fake license plate number

126
00:05:41,316 --> 00:05:44,409
through the GCIC system.

127
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:47,960
So the question is he was
subsequently prosecuted

128
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:52,960
and convicted of a computer
crime under Section 1030(a)(2)

129
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:57,990
which prohibits the
unauthorized or excuse me,

130
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,640
unauthorized access of information

131
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,550
or exceeding authorized access

132
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:04,710
under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.

133
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:07,409
So the question is whether
a person who is authorized

134
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:09,650
to access information since
he was authorized access

135
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:11,520
to information on a GCIC

136
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,030
if it becomes illegal under Federal law

137
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:17,669
if his purpose was improper.

138
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:20,730
So how many of you think that Van Buren

139
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,180
his conviction will be upheld

140
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:27,022
and how many of you think
it will be overturned?

141
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:35,830
So the 11th circuit held, yes
they can prosecute Van Buren

142
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:40,250
for this and that he did
violate the Federal law

143
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,880
by the improper purpose.

144
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,520
They did this primarily because
there was an existing 11th

145
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:51,260
circuit opinion on this issue
and other circuit case law,

146
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:54,800
they're not allowed to overturn
it unless it goes on bonk

147
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,290
but their rationale seemed

148
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,930
to be that this was a
supportable position.

149
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:01,170
Now this is different
from several circuits.

150
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,840
I give some examples here
of the second and ninth

151
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,159
who opposed this whole thing

152
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,580
but actually virtually every
circuit has weighed in on this

153
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:12,890
and they're almost evenly split.

154
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:16,310
The second and the ninth
kind of raised this issue

155
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:18,570
of a parade of horribles.

156
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:22,260
So what they're saying
is that in most companies

157
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:25,123
there are rules or policies

158
00:07:25,124 --> 00:07:28,540
that people who use company resources

159
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:32,360
are not permitted to use
them for non-company purposes

160
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,150
or are not allowed to
share their passwords

161
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:38,030
or things like that.

162
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:40,719
Some people say that if you
started to really enforce

163
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,150
those types of restrictions,
what you would find

164
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:46,890
is that a lot of people would fall subject

165
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:49,844
to this federal parental law.

166
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:52,880
In fact some companies even
prohibit watching sports

167
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,550
highlights or shopping or playing games,

168
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,010
chatting with friends,

169
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:00,870
these are all things that a
lot of people in many companies

170
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:04,650
and government agencies to
do with some regularity.

171
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,830
And although the company may not like it

172
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:10,200
they also generally don't
consider it to be a federal crime.

173
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,420
So the question is should
the court recognize

174
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:15,670
these improper purposes as arising

175
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:18,330
to the level of a federal felony?

176
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:21,060
Now in this particular case,

177
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,820
when it was argued before the court

178
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:27,330
a lot was made of the
discussion of the words so

179
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:28,710
strangely enough,

180
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:31,849
and that is because under
the particular statute

181
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:34,840
in question, actually the way it's worded,

182
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:39,840
they basically say that when
you exceed authorized access

183
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:43,230
that can be a crime if you use that access

184
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:45,950
so to obtain information.

185
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:48,630
And so that word, so in
some cases, people said,

186
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:51,130
well he's just using
his authorized access,

187
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:56,130
he's not violating any password
protection physical guard

188
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:58,060
or anything like that to get into it.

189
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,900
He's actually been authorized it

190
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:04,300
but the government was
arguing that this so to obtain

191
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,680
meant that he was obtaining it

192
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,349
into reason that was improper.

193
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:10,340
Based on the discussion
at the Supreme Court,

194
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:14,350
the Supreme Court seemed rather
uneasy with this approach

195
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:17,740
because it seems to broaden
the statute significantly.

196
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:20,653
And in most cases, the underlying crime

197
00:09:20,653 --> 00:09:23,200
that the person committed
could probably be charged

198
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,370
in some other way, other than 1030(A)(2).

199
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:29,250
So it seemed like the
court was likely to narrow

200
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,490
the scope of this, but it's unclear.

201
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:34,240
And unfortunately we
are expecting a decision

202
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,120
to come out prior to this session today

203
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,120
but it still hasn't come out.

204
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,707
It should come out any day between now

205
00:09:40,707 --> 00:09:43,620
and the end of June so stay tuned.

206
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:46,461
But in the meantime, because
this is both a criminal statute

207
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:50,170
and a civil statute, I would suggest firms

208
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:53,760
that plan to rely on it
for prosecuting insiders

209
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,650
who have gone bad probably
choose another way,

210
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:58,329
because it's not clear this will hold up

211
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:00,860
and at least in about half the circuits

212
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,623
it does not hold up already.

213
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,729
The next case where we wanted to discuss

214
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:10,460
is Mondelez International versus Zurich

215
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:12,390
American Insurance company.

216
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:14,439
This is an interesting
case because Mondelez

217
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,440
is a very large snack company.

218
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:20,070
They own Nabisco, Oreo and
other large brand names

219
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,570
that you may be familiar with.

220
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:27,520
At one point in 2017, they
were hit by the NotPetya virus

221
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:33,420
and they suffered about
$100 million in damages

222
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:38,420
bricking some 1700 servers
and 24,000 laptops.

223
00:10:38,516 --> 00:10:41,963
So this obviously did a lot
of damage to their company.

224
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:47,035
For them, they said, "We're
covered by insurance"

225
00:10:47,035 --> 00:10:50,530
and particularly their insurance company

226
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:54,780
or insurance contract
actually covered physical loss

227
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:59,370
or damage to electronic
data programs or software

228
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:01,410
including physical loss or damage

229
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,439
caused by the malicious introduction

230
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,530
of a machine code or instruction.

231
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:08,610
So they thought, perfect, this is it.

232
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:11,080
When they went to Zurich
to file the claims

233
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,580
Zurich said okay, you need to
submit a significant amount

234
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,820
of evidence to support this claim

235
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:19,690
and so Mondelez spent a
significant amount of time

236
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:22,180
collecting all the evidence of
how much damage they suffered

237
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:27,089
and how they suffered it and
the cost of replacing it, etc.

238
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:32,090
During that time, the company, excuse me,

239
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,730
the insurance company, Zurich American

240
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:38,767
was running advertisements saying,

241
00:11:38,767 --> 00:11:41,880
"Boy, everyone should
take this as a warning

242
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,780
of how important insurance is

243
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,949
because if you'd only
been covered by insurance

244
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:49,550
for NotPetya you would have
been so much better off.

245
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:52,849
But then when Mondelez
actually filed their claim,

246
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:55,110
they denied the coverage

247
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:58,910
and what Mondelez claimed
she knew what Zurich claimed

248
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:02,420
was that NotPetya was a cyber attack

249
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:07,079
that was originated by Russia
and that the United States

250
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:11,400
and several other countries
recognize that Google

251
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,670
and some other tech companies

252
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:15,219
also said they attracted back to Russia

253
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,250
and that it appeared that the attacks

254
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,130
were primarily against Ukraine.

255
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:22,340
Ukraine did suffer I think
about 80% of the damage,

256
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:24,240
even though the damage worldwide

257
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,053
was on the order of $10 billion.

258
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:30,220
Also, it was interesting
because it was designed

259
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:34,550
to mimic a criminal ransomware package

260
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:37,620
that was then being
circulated called Petya

261
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,880
which was also a virus that did damage

262
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,970
but for which, if you paid the ransom,

263
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:45,630
you could get basically your data back,

264
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:47,410
this variant was changed

265
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:49,100
so that even if you paid the ransom

266
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,430
you wouldn't catch her data back.

267
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:52,719
That's why it was changed to NotPetya.

268
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,810
So the question is,

269
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:57,489
is collateral damage from NotPetya

270
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:59,869
excluded under an act of war exclusion

271
00:12:59,869 --> 00:13:02,130
from insurance coverage?

272
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:06,433
How many think it is and
how many think it is not?

273
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,819
Unfortunately, I don't have
a decision on this yet.

274
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,830
The case has been pending for a long time

275
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:16,330
and we're getting no real indications

276
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:17,690
of where this is going.

277
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:20,210
Although several other insurance companies

278
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:22,320
have jumped onto this bandwagon.

279
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,370
So the whole cyber insurance industry

280
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,240
is in a little bit of an uproar

281
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,320
about how this type of
case should be handled

282
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,470
if it is merely based on the fact

283
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:33,060
that it was state-sponsored

284
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,784
that creates all sorts of problems,

285
00:13:34,784 --> 00:13:38,590
because we can think of
just this year SolarWinds,

286
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:40,390
which was attributed to Russia,

287
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:44,390
the MS, Microsoft
Exchange virus or problem

288
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,390
which was attributed to China

289
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:50,960
and several others of recent
origin that were widespread.

290
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,950
There were also attributed
to nation states.

291
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:57,250
So if it's the mere
attribution to a nation state

292
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,200
that triggers this act of war exclusion

293
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,990
that would be a problem.

294
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:04,050
I will say that the coverage was denied

295
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:06,870
under an exception called the hostile

296
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:09,070
or war-like actions exception.

297
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:11,340
And they said, this
exception applies to actions

298
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:15,800
by any government de jure
or de facto or their agents.

299
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,007
So even though Russia
is frequently charged

300
00:14:19,008 --> 00:14:24,008
with collaborating with
criminal organizations

301
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:27,440
to disguise and make somewhat a deniable

302
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,430
via their own acts of aggression

303
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:34,150
as long as it's perceived or can be proven

304
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:37,850
that Russia was ultimately
behind even criminal activity

305
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:40,890
then there might be this exception,

306
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:42,840
the applicability of this exception.

307
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,730
So it does create a lot of problems.

308
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:46,700
I will say in the NotPetya case

309
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,960
it seems a little bit more clear

310
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,940
that Russia was actually engaging

311
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,640
in some type of harassment of the Ukraine

312
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,460
whether it was actually
an act of war or not,

313
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:59,350
is less clear but a lot
of these other cases

314
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:04,350
seem more like cyber
espionage rather than war.

315
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:08,500
And so what if the espionage
itself causes damage

316
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:12,110
would that therefore be covered
or would it still be covered

317
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:15,972
under this hostile or
war-like action exception?

318
00:15:15,972 --> 00:15:18,870
And since we're talking about insurance,

319
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:21,090
I thought I would just take away from this

320
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:24,230
in addition to basically
covering yourselves

321
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:26,830
by checking your insurance
policies when you return to see

322
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:29,890
if you have these broad war
exclusions in your policies

323
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:34,670
look also for broad precision
clauses or betterment clauses.

324
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:37,000
Those also tend to be problematic.

325
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,180
A betterment clause says
that the insurance company

326
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,620
will not pay to make your equipment better

327
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:44,050
than it was when it was attacked.

328
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:46,410
This is a problem with IT

329
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:49,180
because if you had five-year-old computers

330
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:51,800
and they were basically (indistinct)

331
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,829
and you wanna get new computers

332
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:56,300
almost all computers
nowadays are gonna be better

333
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,609
than the ones that you had been.

334
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:59,450
It's going to be really
hard to find something

335
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:03,100
that not better and yet most
insurance company clauses

336
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,170
that have this betterment clause

337
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:06,630
in it will not pay for
anything that's better.

338
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:08,040
So you're gonna have to find something

339
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,099
that's as bad as your
five-year-old equipment

340
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,740
in order to get coverage.

341
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:14,040
I should also point out
there was a US Office

342
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,890
of Foreign Assets Control Guidance

343
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:17,760
that came out are fairly recently

344
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:21,370
about like probably fall of last year

345
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:24,460
that said beware when
you make ransom payments

346
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,700
to certain entities.

347
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:29,670
So if they're in any way tied
to a terrorist organization

348
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:31,880
or otherwise on the OFAC list

349
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,580
and you make a payment to them,

350
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,915
there's strict liability for the victim,

351
00:16:35,915 --> 00:16:39,260
the insurer and the forensic company.

352
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:43,140
So if you work for any of those,
you need to be very careful

353
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,199
about ransomware payments.

354
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,580
If you're their forensic company

355
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,410
and you recommend that
they make the payment,

356
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:49,459
or you're the ensuring you
agreed to make the payment,

357
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,620
you're going to be a victim,

358
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:52,223
you recommend the
insurer make the payment,

359
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:56,779
all of you potentially
could suffer from penalties

360
00:16:56,779 --> 00:17:00,340
imposed by the OFAC for that.

361
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:02,400
And again, like I said,
it's strict liability.

362
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,270
So even if you do due
diligence and you believe

363
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:07,548
that it's not one of
these prohibited entities,

364
00:17:07,548 --> 00:17:09,180
if you make the payment

365
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:11,619
and subsequently OFAC
determines it actually was,

366
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:13,139
you're still liable.

367
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,180
So what can you do?

368
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,864
Actually try to cooperate
with a federal law enforcement

369
00:17:16,864 --> 00:17:19,492
agency, the FBI or someone similar,

370
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:24,130
because that pretty much shows
that you worked in good faith

371
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:27,150
and that you probably should
be minimally held liable

372
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:29,820
even if in fact you made a mistake.

373
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,639
Also on the issue of insurance,

374
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,710
make sure that you're
covered for your work at home

375
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:36,500
or work from home environments.

376
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,340
This last year has put a lot
of people working from home

377
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,709
in order to maintain safe distances

378
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:43,620
and keep people out of the office.

379
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:46,550
But in some cases insurance contracts

380
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:51,050
require you to strictly lay
out what your architecture is

381
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:52,620
and if your architecture that you submit

382
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:53,453
to your insurance company

383
00:17:53,453 --> 00:17:56,129
was what your in office architecture was,

384
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:57,880
then you really need to update that

385
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:01,380
or they may not cover events that came

386
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,860
about as a result of these
work from home environments.

387
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,580
So that's another thing
you should check on

388
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,580
as soon as you get back to your offices.

389
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:13,250
The next case involves
an insurance, excuse me

390
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,620
a border case.

391
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:18,830
And that border case involves
Alasaad versus Myorcas.

392
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:22,060
Now you may know this case
Alasaad versus Nielsen

393
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,899
or Alasaad versus Wolf.

394
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,210
It's been known as all these names

395
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:28,000
because the way they named these cases,

396
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,870
the defendant is whoever's the head

397
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:32,500
of the Department of Homeland Security.

398
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,730
So it has changed three times.

399
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:36,640
The facts of the case are interesting

400
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,630
because it involved 10 US citizens

401
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:41,030
and one lawful permanent resident

402
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:45,930
and some of them actually
were religious personnel

403
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:48,185
who because of their religious beliefs

404
00:18:48,185 --> 00:18:51,159
believed that they should
not be seen by males

405
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:55,660
to him they were not related
with their head coverings off.

406
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:59,460
And some of them had
pictures on their iPhones

407
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:04,150
or their cell phones indicating
these types of situations

408
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:06,830
where they had their headscarves off.

409
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:09,879
And there were only four
male members of their family

410
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:14,320
but when the CBP or the
ICE agents at the border

411
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,740
or at international airports
asked for their phones

412
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,030
and required that they be unlocked,

413
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:21,940
they in some cases saw these pictures

414
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,770
and in some cases even seize them

415
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:27,680
also when they would go back
through that border checkpoint

416
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:31,257
later in some cases ICE agents would say,

417
00:19:31,257 --> 00:19:33,540
"Oh, you took off the one picture

418
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,899
that I really liked last time

419
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,730
or that I remember from last time."

420
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:38,730
So that caused them even more hard

421
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:42,180
because they felt like these
were being used against them.

422
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,040
Additionally, within
this group of plaintiffs

423
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:48,320
were some lawyers who had
attorney client privilege

424
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,689
and did not want to turn over their phones

425
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,930
to the ICE agents because of that.

426
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:54,300
And ICE said it doesn't matter,

427
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,409
we're going to check your phones,

428
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:56,840
you have to give it to us.

429
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,760
And then there were other
people who were journalists

430
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,330
and said, look, I have
a story I wanna run,

431
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:05,189
I can't let you have this phone

432
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:06,970
because then I won't meet my deadline.

433
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:11,900
And in those cases, the border
patrol still seize the phone.

434
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:14,540
So the issues were raised
under both the first

435
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:18,854
and fourth amendments, should
the border patrol agents

436
00:20:18,854 --> 00:20:21,320
be allowed to do manual

437
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,129
and/or forensic searches of a cell phone

438
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:27,150
at the border with no reasonable suspicion

439
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:31,040
and does either the
first or fourth amendment

440
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:31,873
on the limit though.

441
00:20:31,873 --> 00:20:34,530
So how many of you think that
first or fourth amendment

442
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:36,430
can limit us or at least some extent

443
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,120
and how many of you think it cannot?

444
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:46,580
The Massachusetts District Court
said, yes it can be limited

445
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,790
only by fourth amendment.

446
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:50,149
The first amendment cannot limit it

447
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:53,050
but that even though
border patrol agents enjoy

448
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:56,840
a lot of freedom at the border
that as soon as the border

449
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,760
search becomes non-routine

450
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,330
then it does require reasonable suspicion.

451
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:04,260
And that court held that
a non-routine search

452
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:07,150
includes searches of cell phones

453
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:12,130
because cell phones and mobile
devices such as laptops, etc

454
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:14,420
have so much information on them

455
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:18,540
that it becomes overly
invasive to do that.

456
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:21,379
Now, unfortunately for the
people who liked that decision

457
00:21:21,379 --> 00:21:24,480
the first circuit just recently this year

458
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,356
reversed that decision saying,
"No, no matter how invasive

459
00:21:28,356 --> 00:21:33,320
it may be it doesn't violate
the border search exception

460
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,870
unless it's physically invasive."

461
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:38,610
So if they ask you to
just rub or they asked

462
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:40,340
to do a body cavity search,

463
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,810
those are the types of searches

464
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:43,030
that would be overly invasive

465
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:45,139
and for which reasonable suspicion

466
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:48,640
must first be required
or in some cases more.

467
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,403
But in this particular case,

468
00:21:50,403 --> 00:21:52,900
they said no matter what
they did to yourself out,

469
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:55,090
it can never be overly invasive.

470
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:58,669
Now, again, this creates a
circuit split both the fourth

471
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:01,519
and the ninth circuits have
held that reasonable suspicion

472
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:04,690
is required for forensic searches.

473
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:08,390
Forensic search just are
what the law enforcement

474
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:11,380
at the border does
other than just flipping

475
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,213
through the phone.

476
00:22:12,213 --> 00:22:15,409
So if they have to do any
kind of metadata search

477
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:16,730
or if they need to do,

478
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:18,287
to take the data off the phone

479
00:22:18,287 --> 00:22:20,750
and actually search through
it with forensic tools

480
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,270
and if you may have to do of that nature,

481
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:25,730
the courts have held at least
in the fourth and the ninth

482
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:29,480
that reasonable suspicion
is necessary in those cases.

483
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:33,337
Even the border patrol guidance
says that is required now

484
00:22:33,337 --> 00:22:35,280
based on these two circuits,

485
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,990
the 11th circuit, however, whoops, sorry.

486
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:41,800
The 11th circuit, however
took an even more hardline

487
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,820
position saying that even in those cases,

488
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,409
there is no requirement.

489
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:48,940
They refuse to extend
the rationale of Riley.

490
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:51,610
Riley was a case where the Supreme Court

491
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:55,209
held that lawful search incident to arrest

492
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:57,100
could not include cell phones generally

493
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,560
because of the invasiveness
of cell phones.

494
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:02,370
And some thoughts, the Supreme
Court's holding in that case

495
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:04,290
might extend to other exceptions

496
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:06,170
such as the border search exception,

497
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:10,170
but at least this particular
court holds that it does not.

498
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:11,900
Now the other problem with this

499
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:15,410
is that it does seem to
create a kind of a work around

500
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:16,470
for the fourth amendment.

501
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:19,566
So some of you may recall
the Bradley Manning case

502
00:23:19,566 --> 00:23:23,290
or Chelsea Manning, as he's
now known, as she's now known

503
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:29,030
when that individual was
first being investigated,

504
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:31,690
police wanted to interrogate

505
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:35,690
one of his close associates David House.

506
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:38,610
They did not have probable
cause to search David House's

507
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:43,160
electronic media or his
cell phone or anything else.

508
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,469
So what they did instead of
corn to New York times article

509
00:23:45,469 --> 00:23:48,480
is it they alerted all
their border patrol agents

510
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,710
and said the next time
he ever crosses a border

511
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:52,370
or ever takes an international flight,

512
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:55,340
seize his IT so that it can be searched.

513
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:59,545
So this would seem to suggest
that there may be a workaround

514
00:23:59,546 --> 00:24:03,560
for law enforcement that
may not have been envisioned

515
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,990
by the courts at least
when they were holding

516
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:08,020
what's allowed at the border.

517
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:11,020
So the takeaway for this
is if you have corporate IT

518
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:15,810
that is moving across borders
be aware of these holdings

519
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:18,730
and in most cases you would
probably be best advise

520
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:22,000
to only take kind of stripped down laptops

521
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,170
across borders keep
everything in the cloud,

522
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:27,800
have your employees just
download it from the cloud

523
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,389
when they get to their destination

524
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:32,700
so that it does not get swept
up in a search at the border

525
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:35,300
and potentially get left
on government computers

526
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,562
over which your company
may have no control.

527
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,765
- So Rick, can I stop you for second?

528
00:24:40,765 --> 00:24:41,598
- Yes.

529
00:24:41,598 --> 00:24:42,431
- We have a great question

530
00:24:42,431 --> 00:24:43,890
as to whether or not the Patriot Act

531
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:47,358
might also apply, you
have any thoughts on that?

532
00:24:47,358 --> 00:24:51,679
- The Patriot Act, the main
thing there was that it lowered

533
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,100
the sharing of information
between law enforcement

534
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:58,120
and intelligence when
terrorism was involved.

535
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:01,030
So to the extent that
there is law enforcement

536
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:03,980
and intelligence sharing in
that type of border search,

537
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:06,789
it would allow even if the
search was done pursuant

538
00:25:06,789 --> 00:25:10,470
to a law enforcement purpose
or for law enforcement,

539
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:13,900
it would allow them to
share that data more easily.

540
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,680
But otherwise I don't see a clear holding

541
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,363
on the border search exception.

542
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:19,720
- Thank you.

543
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,890
- The next case is unlocking smartphones.

544
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:25,320
And this particular case is
from Indiana Seo vs State.

545
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,159
And this was a ruling by
the Indiana Supreme Court.

546
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,850
The facts of the case involve a sale

547
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:32,679
she was allegedly raped

548
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:35,020
and she reported to the
local Sheriff's office.

549
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,770
She provided them some information

550
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:39,433
indicating that her boyfriend at the time,

551
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:43,476
had basically ended up
raping her and harassing her.

552
00:25:43,476 --> 00:25:47,670
But the police, after
doing some investigation

553
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:49,860
they determined that
they did not believe this

554
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,050
was actually true,

555
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,710
they believe that she was actually trying

556
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:54,230
to set this person up.

557
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:58,350
So they arrested her and seized iPhone 7.

558
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:00,129
After they seized the phone,

559
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:03,630
they asked her to or
directed her to unlock it.

560
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:06,960
She refused and so they got a court order

561
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,920
ordering her to unlock it.

562
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,630
She refused to still unlock it.

563
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:13,650
And so she was held in
contempt for refusing.

564
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:16,710
Her claim was that making
her unlock her phone

565
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:18,530
was a violation of the fifth amendment.

566
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:20,670
So how many of you think
that requiring someone

567
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:22,213
to unlock their phone is a violation

568
00:26:22,213 --> 00:26:23,540
is violation of the amendment

569
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,682
and you cannot be held in contempt.

570
00:26:25,682 --> 00:26:26,515
And then how many think

571
00:26:26,515 --> 00:26:28,480
you should be able to be held in contempt

572
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,430
that the fifth amendment doesn't apply?

573
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:34,070
The Indiana Supreme Court said,

574
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:37,377
no you can actually be held in contempt,

575
00:26:37,377 --> 00:26:40,129
excuse me, you cannot be held in contempt.

576
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:44,440
It is testimonial and not
a foregone conclusion.

577
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:47,030
So let's break that down a little bit.

578
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:50,395
Basically the fifth
amendment only protects

579
00:26:50,395 --> 00:26:53,520
against testimonial statements.

580
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,310
So what you say has to be
something that's testimonial.

581
00:26:57,310 --> 00:27:01,060
So is unlocking a phone testimonial?

582
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:03,000
Some people say, well,
no, it's just an action.

583
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,750
But actually by unlocking
a phone and turning

584
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:08,810
it over to law enforcement,
you are in essence saying

585
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:10,504
this is my phone because otherwise

586
00:27:10,505 --> 00:27:12,550
how would you have been able to unlock it

587
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:14,070
only you would presumably have known

588
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:15,600
how to unlock your own phone.

589
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,403
So it is testimonial and that it reveals

590
00:27:18,403 --> 00:27:20,780
that it is your phone.

591
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:23,300
Now, in some cases, the courts
have been all over the board.

592
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:27,310
They said, okay, you can't
make them disclose a password

593
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:30,700
but you could make them
actually unlock the phone.

594
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:31,890
So they're making a distinction here.

595
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:34,070
And this is why I have the
three different images.

596
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:36,846
One image has a key in the phone.

597
00:27:36,846 --> 00:27:40,880
And so some attorneys
have analogized encryption

598
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,390
to being a lock and key.

599
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:46,060
And if you analogize it that
way, some judges will rule.

600
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:48,060
Then you can make people give it up

601
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:50,379
because courts you do require people

602
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:53,340
to surrender actual physical objects

603
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,770
or allow the government to seize them.

604
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:58,480
If you perceive it like the
second image there though

605
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:03,440
as a combination safe, the
courts are equally aligned

606
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,060
in generally saying that
the courts cannot force

607
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,520
you to say something from your mind.

608
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,623
So you can't be required to
tell what the combination is.

609
00:28:14,007 --> 00:28:17,170
And then the third image is
the eye and the fingerprint

610
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:21,660
or even the facial ID in
those particular cases,

611
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,170
generally most courts

612
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:25,050
are saying that you have no expectation

613
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:26,837
of privacy in those.

614
00:28:26,837 --> 00:28:29,533
So the courts have held
that law enforcement

615
00:28:29,534 --> 00:28:32,750
can seize your fingerprint or
take a picture of your face

616
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:35,680
or do other things to force you basically

617
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,460
inadvertently to open your phone

618
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:41,550
by them using that information
to get your phone open.

619
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:44,620
There is one court in the ninth circuit,

620
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:46,560
not not at the ninth Circuit
level, but it district court

621
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:49,970
in the ninth circuit that has held courts,

622
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:53,290
the police cannot even do
that because it circumvents

623
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:56,210
the courts order that the
password not be disclosed

624
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:59,470
or that the phone not be
ordered to be unlocked.

625
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:00,720
These are tricky questions.

626
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,870
The courts are all over the board

627
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:04,310
as indicated by this summary here.

628
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:06,290
And I think it goes down
to the fact that Riley

629
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:07,870
which we discussed a little bit earlier

630
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:09,580
did hold the computers are different.

631
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:11,699
And so you're actually asking
someone to open up something

632
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,550
that will reveal a lot
of personal information

633
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:15,149
about themselves.

634
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:17,051
And some courts have actually said

635
00:29:17,051 --> 00:29:20,020
to the extent that we allow it at all,

636
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:23,889
we're going to really limit
your search to specific files.

637
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:26,380
Now be careful here because in some cases

638
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:28,623
law enforcement said,

639
00:29:28,623 --> 00:29:31,410
well we wanna find
pictures of pornography.

640
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:34,390
And then subsequently
they didn't allow any data

641
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:38,190
or any information in about document files

642
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:40,300
or Excel documents, or etc

643
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,649
or said that the law enforcement

644
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:43,780
shouldn't have searched those

645
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,910
because they weren't
looking for documents.

646
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:50,400
I think that shows some lack
of knowledge by the courts

647
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:53,920
because obviously somebody
could put an ending on any file

648
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,950
to make it look like another file,

649
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:58,890
you could hide pictures
obviously in document files, etc.

650
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:02,900
So the law enforcement just
needs to make sure they word

651
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,330
their search authorizations

652
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:07,210
or search warrants appropriately there

653
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:10,640
but Carpenter also goes into
some digital privacy interests.

654
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,690
And some of the language in
that case even though it dealt

655
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:15,320
with the different issue

656
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:20,320
suggested maybe that in order
to maintain the equilibrium

657
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:23,870
that the fourth amendment
has enjoyed in the past

658
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:26,908
that the courts may have
to modify the rule somewhat

659
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:30,949
in this current, highly
technical day and age,

660
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:32,410
or otherwise the fourth amendment

661
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:35,720
may basically be dissolve away.

662
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,650
So the takeaway from this is assess

663
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:39,700
whether your company
actually needs a policy

664
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,430
on how employees should respond

665
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:43,490
when they're asked to unlock their phones,

666
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:45,280
especially if they're corporate phones

667
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:48,540
and also try to make sure
how you want to be able

668
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:50,649
to indicate evidence of your own phones.

669
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:52,377
If someone's doing something
wrong in your company

670
00:30:52,377 --> 00:30:56,870
and you wanna investigate
them as an insider problem,

671
00:30:56,870 --> 00:31:00,330
you probably need to have MDMs set up

672
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:03,120
to be able to access
the data on those phones

673
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:07,080
regardless of whether the
individual surrenders the passcode

674
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,393
or anything else that
is used to get it back.

675
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:15,950
The next case deals with geofence warrants

676
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:19,170
and this case arose, excuse me

677
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:22,610
it's titled in re search
of information stored

678
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:25,189
at premises controlled by Google.

679
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:28,850
And Google has actually seen a big rise

680
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:30,546
in these geofence warrant cases.

681
00:31:30,547 --> 00:31:32,480
And so I should probably first describe

682
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,240
what a geofence warrant is.

683
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,450
It's a search warrant issued by a court

684
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:39,560
to allow law enforcement
to search a database

685
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,771
to find all active mobile devices

686
00:31:41,771 --> 00:31:46,320
within a particular
virtually defined perimeter

687
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,963
which encompasses an
actual geographic area.

688
00:31:50,474 --> 00:31:53,389
Most geofence warrant seem
to be served against Google

689
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:57,120
because Google has a massive
database of this information,

690
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,659
which is known as Sensorvault

691
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,500
and they hold the location data

692
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:03,850
not only of people who use Android devices

693
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:08,219
but if anyone who uses
any Google supplied apps

694
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:11,440
such as Google Maps,
Google Photos, and etc.

695
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,730
So even if people are
not using Android device,

696
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:16,060
there's a very very good chance

697
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:20,280
that based may have their
physical location data

698
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:24,950
stored in Sensorvault for
some purpose at some time.

699
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:28,340
So based on that, this case
arose out of a suspected theft

700
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:31,139
of some prescription medications.

701
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,570
Law enforcement investigated

702
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:35,578
and determined that whoever
stole the medications

703
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:40,430
and resold them entered one
location two specific times

704
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:43,390
and then the other
location at another time

705
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:45,550
all to kind of transact this theft

706
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:47,930
and reshipping of the medications.

707
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:51,863
So what they did is they
set up three GFS locations.

708
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:55,610
What they asked the court
to approve is a warrant

709
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:58,602
that required first Google
to identify all devices

710
00:32:58,603 --> 00:33:01,420
within those three geo-fences.

711
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:04,320
Second, they would limit them down

712
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,429
to ones that they thought
were most interesting

713
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:09,210
and then require Google to
provide them anonymized data

714
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:10,700
about those users.

715
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,970
And then third, based
on that anonymized data,

716
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:15,466
they would ask Google to
provide subscriber data

717
00:33:15,466 --> 00:33:17,979
on that third subset.

718
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:20,440
And so the question is does this process

719
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,930
of this three-step geofence warrant,

720
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:24,930
does that violate the fourth amendment?

721
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:27,211
How many of you think it does

722
00:33:27,211 --> 00:33:29,153
and how many of you think it does not?

723
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:33,490
So I will say that the case law

724
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:35,610
is again kind of going both ways.

725
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:37,280
In this particular case,

726
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:40,673
this court held that it did
violate the fourth amendment

727
00:33:40,673 --> 00:33:45,673
and they actually had the
government resubmit three times

728
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:49,190
and even miss third amended request.

729
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:51,100
They still held it did not meet

730
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,899
the fourth amendment requirements.

731
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:55,373
Now, for those of you who
are familiar with warrants

732
00:33:55,373 --> 00:33:57,670
this is a little bit of a tricky issue

733
00:33:57,670 --> 00:33:59,457
because generally search requirements

734
00:33:59,457 --> 00:34:03,210
search warrants require a
statement of particularity

735
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:05,110
and a showing a probable cause.

736
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:07,659
And it's generally
gonna be your gonna show

737
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:09,409
that there's probable cause to believe

738
00:34:09,409 --> 00:34:12,730
that a particular person
was at a particular place

739
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:15,260
and they should be searched for items

740
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,679
that relate to a crime

741
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:18,569
that you believe there's probable cause

742
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:22,360
to believe that it's either
on the person or at the place.

743
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:25,157
In this particular case
what a geofence warrant

744
00:34:25,157 --> 00:34:27,230
is a kind of turns everything on its head,

745
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:29,230
it's saying we don't
know who the people are.

746
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:32,507
And we don't know where the
crime evidence is per se

747
00:34:32,507 --> 00:34:37,179
but we think that this evidence may exist

748
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:40,060
on some cell phones at
least where the person was

749
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:42,739
and where the person
was at certain key times

750
00:34:42,739 --> 00:34:46,350
may be evidence that we could
use in a criminal prosecution.

751
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:48,179
So let's kind of turning
everything on its head

752
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:50,429
and that's why it's kind
of thrown the courts

753
00:34:50,429 --> 00:34:54,060
into a little bit of a tizzy here.

754
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:56,670
So in this particular case the court

755
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:58,070
seemed most problematic

756
00:34:58,967 --> 00:35:03,967
with the first to second kind
of funneling or filtering.

757
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:06,850
So they said that the government

758
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:10,410
was saying that after Google
provided this identity

759
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:13,029
of all devices when they'd
be straight geofences

760
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:16,210
that they would use some
unknown filtering technique

761
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:17,620
to what limit it down.

762
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:19,319
And the court was bothered by the fact

763
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,390
that they weren't providing

764
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:22,600
what that filtering technique was.

765
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,930
And the court even said,
what you need to do

766
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:28,020
is just say you will only pursue devices

767
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:29,627
that weren't all three geofences

768
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:32,500
but apparently the government
was not willing to do that

769
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:35,370
because they weren't positive
of their theory of the case

770
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:38,940
and they didn't want to
exclude potential people

771
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,490
who might be involved.

772
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:42,379
And then even from going
from the second one

773
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:45,120
to the third one, again,
the court was concerned

774
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:48,361
that there was just unmitigated discretion

775
00:35:48,361 --> 00:35:50,210
and the government's hands

776
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:53,960
and how they decided
what subscribers Google

777
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,720
would have to identify in that third step.

778
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,888
So they were bothered by that.

779
00:35:57,888 --> 00:36:00,380
And I think in this particular case too

780
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:03,000
if you saw the actual geofences,

781
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,550
you would see that they
cover fairly large areas

782
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:09,910
where a lot of innocent people
would have passed through.

783
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:13,339
One was very near interstate as I recall.

784
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,530
And so there's lots of people

785
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:16,460
that might've driven through that area.

786
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:19,890
And then another was in a
very popular public area

787
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:22,569
that a lot of people would
have passed through as well.

788
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:24,890
In fact, I think one was adjacent

789
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:27,509
to a very large building where
presumably a lot of people

790
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:29,800
would have passed to get
into or out of the building.

791
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,916
So I think the court had a problems

792
00:36:32,916 --> 00:36:35,270
with the fact that so many innocent people

793
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:37,700
would be pulled into this dragnet.

794
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:40,359
The one case that they did approve this

795
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:43,340
which was also out of this same
Northern District, Illinois

796
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:48,004
it was to particular geofences

797
00:36:48,004 --> 00:36:51,540
that were only for a nighttime period

798
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:55,330
in a very remote area where
they expected hardly anyone

799
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:58,040
but these criminals to probably have been.

800
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,870
And the court seemed to approve that

801
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:01,897
because it had a lot less discretion

802
00:37:01,898 --> 00:37:04,860
and was much less likely to swoop

803
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:06,690
up a lot of innocent people.

804
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:08,801
And I think that's maybe
where the courts are going.

805
00:37:08,801 --> 00:37:11,720
Again, we have to look at
Riley, which (indistinct)

806
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,310
talked about and how cell phones

807
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:15,420
and computers are different.

808
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:18,030
This kind of goes a
little bit into the Jones

809
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:19,720
and Carpenter cases.

810
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,350
Carpenter particularly,

811
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:24,890
Carpenter talked about cell site

812
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:28,470
location information and
whether that could be used

813
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:30,509
under the third party doctrine

814
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:33,180
could police get your cell
site location information

815
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:36,359
by asking your provider where you been

816
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:39,750
for a certain period of time
and in the Carpenter case

817
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:41,380
it was over an extended period of time.

818
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:43,790
So the court held that it was a violation

819
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:45,940
of the fourth amendment,
although they didn't rule

820
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:48,450
on what exactly that center of time was.

821
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:51,060
And they tried to keep
their ruling narrow.

822
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,470
And they said, we specifically do not rule

823
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:57,220
on the propriety of tower dumps.

824
00:37:57,220 --> 00:38:00,209
A tower dump is where you take
all the funds that connected

825
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:03,490
to a particular cell tower
over a particular time.

826
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:05,620
And so in many ways a tower dump

827
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:08,000
is somewhat similar to a geofence warrant.

828
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,620
It just uses a slightly
different technology.

829
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:14,390
But I think one of these
questions that carpenter left open

830
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:16,740
is where this geofence warrant case fits.

831
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:17,939
So it wouldn't surprise me

832
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:20,834
if this case eventually does
go up to the Supreme Court

833
00:38:20,834 --> 00:38:23,232
for additional clarification.

834
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:31,530
So now I'd like to go into
some cases and issues to watch.

835
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:33,720
The first case I would like to go into

836
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,573
is the Schrems case.

837
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:41,911
In Schrems we have an individual
may Maximillian Schrems

838
00:38:41,911 --> 00:38:44,380
and he's a privacy advocate

839
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:47,861
and he really pushes hard to get people

840
00:38:47,861 --> 00:38:52,569
to recognize the protections of privacy

841
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:55,900
that he believes are
being run rough shot over.

842
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:59,480
And so one of his favorite
targets has been Facebook,

843
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:02,830
Facebook, Ireland, specifically
since it's in Europe.

844
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:07,737
And so he sued them in Shrems I in 2013

845
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,490
claiming that the transfers

846
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:13,712
under the Safe Harbor
Framework were invalid.

847
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:18,560
Now, when he did that,
it was a very big case

848
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,330
because the United States

849
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:25,290
had negotiated the Safe
Harbor Framework with Europe

850
00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:27,190
to basically protect all transfers

851
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:29,650
between Europe and the United States.

852
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:31,580
And obviously a lot of
data gets transferred

853
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:36,580
between Facebook, Google, Apple,
credit card companies, etc.

854
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,910
So when this was struck down,

855
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:42,140
it caused a lot of fear and panic.

856
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:46,950
And so shortly after
that case was decided,

857
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:51,270
a Privacy Shield Framework
was set up to replace it

858
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:55,270
which kind of held things back together.

859
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:58,968
And also companies were
resorting throughout this period

860
00:39:58,968 --> 00:40:02,589
to what were called
standard contractual clauses

861
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:05,020
and what standard contractual clauses are

862
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:06,976
is even if you're in a country

863
00:40:06,976 --> 00:40:10,290
that isn't otherwise recognized by the EU

864
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:13,500
as providing comparable
privacy protections,

865
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,300
you can establish those protections

866
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:19,840
through contractual clauses
promising to trait the data

867
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:23,153
that you collect and transfer
out of Europe and into Europe

868
00:40:23,153 --> 00:40:26,339
in ways that are acceptable
to the European Union

869
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:31,340
under the GDPR, the General
Data Protection Regulation.

870
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:37,490
So what happened in the
second case, Shrems II

871
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:40,691
is that Schrems challenged
the Privacy Shield Framework

872
00:40:40,691 --> 00:40:44,549
and also these standard
contractual clauses.

873
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:47,590
Now this case arose
out of some revelations

874
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:52,590
made when he left his
role supporting the NSA

875
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:56,940
and revealed a lot of
classified information.

876
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:58,980
And some of the information
that he revealed

877
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:02,395
about how NSA did certain
types of data collections

878
00:41:02,395 --> 00:41:04,660
caused a stir in Europe

879
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:07,700
and so what Schrems tried to claim

880
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:11,620
is that the use of intelligence agencies

881
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:15,261
to collect information against individuals

882
00:41:15,262 --> 00:41:20,262
including potentially European
individuals was not protected

883
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:24,230
by any way that an European
individual could challenge it.

884
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:26,520
And therefore the Privacy Shield Framework

885
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,480
and potentially standard
contractual clauses

886
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,833
should be struck down.

887
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:35,770
In the end the court did
actually say that the reliance

888
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:39,730
on the Privacy Shield
Framework was no longer valid

889
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:44,670
because of the practices of
the US intelligence agencies.

890
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:47,780
Now, this was kind of
frustrating for the US government

891
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:52,780
because the GDPR expressly
exempts the European Union's

892
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:56,663
own intelligence activities or
at least we thought they did.

893
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:02,310
Just last fall after
this decision came out

894
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:03,910
and the United States complained

895
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:05,460
that there was a dual standard here

896
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:07,800
that US was being treated differently

897
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,980
for its intelligence activities
than the EU was itself,

898
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:13,700
the Court of Justice of the European Union

899
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:17,600
actually said that the
US intelligence agencies

900
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,632
could no longer claim their exemption.

901
00:42:20,632 --> 00:42:25,632
If they involved third parties,
such as internet providers

902
00:42:27,850 --> 00:42:30,190
and others to collect data for them

903
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:32,000
that they could only claim the exemption

904
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,370
for things that they
did entirely themselves

905
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:36,540
not if they involve any third parties

906
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:38,940
and this has caused a big stir in Europe.

907
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:41,740
And so now they are trying to renegotiate

908
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:43,529
an ePrivacy provision.

909
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:46,070
And they've kind of been
stocked because France

910
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:49,000
and some other countries are
saying that they will not sign

911
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,570
onto that new updated ePrivacy provision

912
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:55,030
unless the Court of Justice
of the European Union

913
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:59,110
expressly is forbidden to take

914
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:01,800
into account the EU's
intelligence activities.

915
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:04,560
So that only sets up an
even stronger argument

916
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,643
for the United States
however, because now it shows

917
00:43:06,643 --> 00:43:08,630
that the United States is being held

918
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:11,223
to a higher standard
potentially than the EU.

919
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:15,160
Now what the Court of
Justice of the European Union

920
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,589
is trying to claim is that,

921
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:18,810
well, we are also taking into account

922
00:43:18,810 --> 00:43:20,529
that the European Court of Human Rights

923
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:24,046
also does control some EU
intelligence activities

924
00:43:24,046 --> 00:43:27,140
but the United States
actually during this case

925
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:28,640
tried to interpose that saying,

926
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,799
look hold us to the less
stringent European Court

927
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:34,194
of Human Rights Standard
and will be satisfied that

928
00:43:34,194 --> 00:43:36,120
but the Court of Justice
of the European Union

929
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,500
refuse to do that.

930
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:40,270
And they did so probably
because they wanted to uphold

931
00:43:40,270 --> 00:43:41,740
a higher standard.

932
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:43,910
So this continues to be problematic.

933
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:45,310
And the big takeaway from this

934
00:43:45,310 --> 00:43:47,700
is that if your company is relying

935
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:50,549
on standard contractual clauses,

936
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:52,160
you may need to re-look at those

937
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,259
because unless you can
claim that your company

938
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:58,540
is in an industry that has
probably never been subjected

939
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:02,150
to a FISA warrant, or
would not in the future,

940
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:03,740
your standard contractual clause

941
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:05,859
has actually had its legs
cut out from under it.

942
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:08,030
So you might need to relook at that.

943
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:10,262
You should also and since
we're talking about privacy

944
00:44:10,262 --> 00:44:12,360
check to make sure that you're compliant

945
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:15,720
with the California Privacy Regulations

946
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:20,720
which took effect in 2021
for the CCPA and the CPRA

947
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:23,549
which takes effect in January, 2023

948
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:26,530
those are somewhat similar

949
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:30,880
but somewhat different from
the European privacy rules.

950
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,850
New York has also proposed
a Data Accountable

951
00:44:33,850 --> 00:44:35,290
and Transparency Act.

952
00:44:35,290 --> 00:44:38,140
And just recently the Virginia state

953
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:42,680
has actually passed a
data privacy act as well.

954
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:46,490
Virginia's act kicks in
also in January of 2023.

955
00:44:46,490 --> 00:44:49,770
So there's a lot of European
privacy protections.

956
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:53,620
And now state side
within the United States

957
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:55,740
privacy protections that any company

958
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:58,484
should be ensuring that
they are compliant with.

959
00:44:58,485 --> 00:45:02,330
I should point out too and I
put this in the notes here.

960
00:45:02,330 --> 00:45:06,292
If you work for the government,
this decision shrines mail

961
00:45:06,292 --> 00:45:08,540
adversely impact sharing

962
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:11,240
between the five eyes
intelligence communities.

963
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:13,629
So these are the five
English speaking countries

964
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:16,020
the United Kingdom, United
States, Canada, Australia

965
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:19,620
and New Zealand currently, they
share a lot of intelligence

966
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:22,460
but it may put them in an awkward position

967
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:24,690
for instance, Canada,
currently and Australia

968
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:28,090
for that matter, currently
enjoy a recognition by the EU

969
00:45:28,090 --> 00:45:30,780
that they comply with the GDPR.

970
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:32,527
But if they start sharing
intelligence information

971
00:45:32,527 --> 00:45:36,850
and with the NSA and with
other US intelligence agencies

972
00:45:36,850 --> 00:45:38,670
the Court of Justice of the European Union

973
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:41,481
may find that suspect and
may actually undermine

974
00:45:41,481 --> 00:45:45,410
their recognition as being compliant.

975
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:49,770
So it may actually adversely
impact that as well.

976
00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:54,060
The next case is the Biometric
Information Privacy Act.

977
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:57,020
Although this is only an Illinois act

978
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:59,820
it has caused a little cottage industry

979
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:04,820
of lawsuits around the country,
because anytime you deal

980
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:08,870
with any Illinois citizens information,

981
00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:11,210
if you're collecting their
biometric information,

982
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:14,290
you may be pulled in under this law.

983
00:46:14,290 --> 00:46:16,340
Recently, I said, in this particular note

984
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:19,530
that Facebook settled
the case for 550 million.

985
00:46:19,530 --> 00:46:21,350
That was the case until this year

986
00:46:21,350 --> 00:46:23,589
it turns out a judge would not accept

987
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:25,910
that he said it was too low.

988
00:46:25,910 --> 00:46:28,509
And so in March of this year

989
00:46:28,510 --> 00:46:31,300
Facebook ended up paying 650 million,

990
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:34,532
about an extra 100 million
to settle that case.

991
00:46:34,532 --> 00:46:38,220
They did that because the
way the law is written,

992
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:42,910
you automatically owe $1000
for every improper collection

993
00:46:42,910 --> 00:46:47,060
or use of biometric
information for any citizen.

994
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:50,570
And since Facebook had
so many Illinois citizens

995
00:46:50,570 --> 00:46:54,310
who were part of Facebook
and they did so many uses,

996
00:46:54,310 --> 00:46:56,420
they actually determined that 650 million

997
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:57,940
was the cheapest way out.

998
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,230
And they also had to agree to change some

999
00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:00,640
of their practices.

1000
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:04,310
So some of those automatic
recognition of pictures

1001
00:47:04,310 --> 00:47:07,100
that you used to maybe see in Facebook,

1002
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:08,390
Facebook no longer does that.

1003
00:47:08,390 --> 00:47:10,930
You actually have to opt in explicitly

1004
00:47:10,930 --> 00:47:12,839
to get back feature now.

1005
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:14,060
So those are some other things.

1006
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:17,680
So again, the takeaway here
is if your company in any way

1007
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:21,049
collects biometric information
from your employees

1008
00:47:21,050 --> 00:47:25,140
or your customers or anyone
else, make sure that if,

1009
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:28,096
and if Illinois citizens
can be involved in any way

1010
00:47:28,097 --> 00:47:30,800
that you're with BIPA

1011
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,623
or else you may be in for a big surprise.

1012
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:40,180
The next case involves the
notice of FISA requirements

1013
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:42,290
and this particular case as United States

1014
00:47:42,290 --> 00:47:47,290
versus the Moalin, it's not too
much of record breaking case

1015
00:47:50,670 --> 00:47:52,560
here because in the end the court

1016
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:55,180
held that the case was moot.

1017
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:57,690
It was a suit by a Moalin

1018
00:47:57,690 --> 00:48:02,040
who had basically been
convicted for a crime,

1019
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:03,860
some of which the evidence

1020
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:06,210
of which was collected under FISA

1021
00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:11,470
and it turned out although
the government did alert him

1022
00:48:11,470 --> 00:48:13,459
that some of the content they collected

1023
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:14,293
with collected under FISA,

1024
00:48:14,293 --> 00:48:16,540
what they had failed to tell him

1025
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:19,540
is that they had done a
lot of metadata collection

1026
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:21,440
which led them to him

1027
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:26,440
and what enabled them to do
the eventual FISA warrant

1028
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:29,990
to get the content data.

1029
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:31,500
And the court held that FISA

1030
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:36,540
does require generally
a notice requirement

1031
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:41,020
when the court is intending
to allow FISA data

1032
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:43,860
or FISA derive data in

1033
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:46,840
there hadn't been any court
that previously ruled this.

1034
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:49,440
So it's an interesting case to look at.

1035
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:52,750
We'll have to see whether
other courts buy into this

1036
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:55,180
but it was pushed out by the ninth circuit

1037
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:58,343
which is a fairly significant
circuit obviously,

1038
00:48:59,306 --> 00:49:00,990
and fairly influential.

1039
00:49:00,990 --> 00:49:04,299
So basically the takeaway is
to the extent your company

1040
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:05,980
is involved in responding
to FISA warrants,

1041
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:07,950
just review the implications of that.

1042
00:49:07,950 --> 00:49:11,960
And it may have some
play maybe not more so

1043
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:14,100
in the government, making
sure that the government

1044
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:17,509
prosecutors are aware of this as well.

1045
00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:22,033
And then the next case is
the CLOUD Act searches case.

1046
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:27,010
So as many of you may be aware Microsoft

1047
00:49:27,010 --> 00:49:29,550
and virtually every company stores

1048
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:30,720
a lot of data in the cloud.

1049
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:33,350
Microsoft particularly
came to the attention

1050
00:49:33,350 --> 00:49:34,790
to the federal government

1051
00:49:34,790 --> 00:49:36,259
when the federal government believed

1052
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:40,111
that one of its customers
was involved in some crime

1053
00:49:40,111 --> 00:49:45,111
and the government issued
a subpoena basically

1054
00:49:45,890 --> 00:49:48,810
to get the data, telling
Microsoft get the data

1055
00:49:48,810 --> 00:49:50,690
on this individual for us,

1056
00:49:50,690 --> 00:49:53,183
Microsoft responded by saying,

1057
00:49:54,208 --> 00:49:56,603
excuse me, they issued a search warrant

1058
00:49:56,603 --> 00:49:59,510
under FISA clause.

1059
00:49:59,510 --> 00:50:02,600
Microsoft responded by
saying, we can't get that data

1060
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:05,720
under this warrant because
the data is in Ireland.

1061
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:08,640
You need to use your mutual
legal assistance treaty

1062
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:12,220
to go get the data from
the Irish authorities.

1063
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:14,899
When the government got that response

1064
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:16,460
they were not satisfied.

1065
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:18,811
And they said, no you can
actually pull the data

1066
00:50:18,811 --> 00:50:20,530
through your servers.

1067
00:50:20,530 --> 00:50:23,717
And we are serving the warrant
on you here in United States

1068
00:50:23,717 --> 00:50:26,270
and we expect you to get the data for us.

1069
00:50:26,270 --> 00:50:28,743
So Microsoft contested it.

1070
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:32,240
But in order to actually
bring this to a head,

1071
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:35,910
Microsoft had to deny and
actually put themselves

1072
00:50:35,910 --> 00:50:38,430
in jeopardy to make it
a case in controversy.

1073
00:50:38,430 --> 00:50:41,529
So they did, they refuse
to provide the data

1074
00:50:41,530 --> 00:50:43,490
which sets you to the second circuit.

1075
00:50:43,490 --> 00:50:44,968
And the second circuit ruled

1076
00:50:44,968 --> 00:50:48,990
that the government could
not enforce a warrant

1077
00:50:48,990 --> 00:50:53,000
against Microsoft because
the data was in Ireland

1078
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,773
and warrants are not effective
in foreign countries.

1079
00:50:56,630 --> 00:51:00,400
This was kind of problematic
because it was very tied

1080
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,888
to specifically how
Microsoft did business.

1081
00:51:02,888 --> 00:51:07,040
So when Microsoft has
Europeans who apply for

1082
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:11,919
a Microsoft Hotmail account
or other Microsoft accounts,

1083
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:15,860
if they apply from within
the European Union,

1084
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:16,890
they're generally routed

1085
00:51:16,890 --> 00:51:21,890
to a European Union cloud
provider of Microsoft.

1086
00:51:22,570 --> 00:51:24,500
And the data is kept in the European Union

1087
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:28,280
to facilitate compliance with
the GDPR and other things.

1088
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:30,930
So it was fairly straightforward
the way they did it

1089
00:51:30,930 --> 00:51:32,690
even though they did
have access to the data

1090
00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:34,450
from within the United States.

1091
00:51:34,450 --> 00:51:38,220
Google tried to interpose
the same defense,

1092
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:40,359
but the way Google does it technologically

1093
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:42,470
is Google shards the data.

1094
00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:44,419
So that means that they put into a bunch

1095
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:46,260
of different smaller packets

1096
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:48,560
and they throw the data
all over the place.

1097
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:50,549
So when Google tells
the federal government

1098
00:51:50,550 --> 00:51:53,720
you have to go get the
data where it exists,

1099
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:56,430
it doesn't necessarily
exist in any one country,

1100
00:51:56,430 --> 00:51:57,950
or at least not in any one country

1101
00:51:57,950 --> 00:51:59,689
for any long period of time

1102
00:51:59,690 --> 00:52:02,400
because Google is constantly
moving the data around

1103
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,580
to wherever it's the cheapest to house

1104
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:06,610
and through the sharding technique,

1105
00:52:06,610 --> 00:52:08,840
it could be in multiple
countries at the same time,

1106
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:10,790
even a single email.

1107
00:52:10,790 --> 00:52:13,230
So when Google was
making the same argument

1108
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:15,900
it became, well, how do
we deal with this issue?

1109
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:18,560
Because a lot is dependent
on the technology

1110
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:21,880
that the provider implements
because in Google's case

1111
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:24,920
there'll be really the only one
that can pull the data back.

1112
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:27,040
In Microsoft's case the data

1113
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:29,490
could be obtained from Irish authorities.

1114
00:52:29,490 --> 00:52:31,441
So that case went to the Supreme Court

1115
00:52:31,441 --> 00:52:35,180
and this Supreme Court
ultimately was able to punt

1116
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:36,720
because at the same time

1117
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,477
Congress realized they
weren't sure they wanted this

1118
00:52:38,477 --> 00:52:40,210
from a court to decide that case.

1119
00:52:40,210 --> 00:52:42,740
So they passed this act, the Cloud Act,

1120
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:46,524
which basically says that distinctions

1121
00:52:46,525 --> 00:52:49,540
will be made for cloud data.

1122
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:54,505
And it allowed for foreign
providers to get access

1123
00:52:54,505 --> 00:52:56,980
to US data and the cloud

1124
00:52:56,980 --> 00:53:01,410
and US providers to get
access to data in the cloud

1125
00:53:01,410 --> 00:53:03,240
outside the United States.

1126
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:07,779
So right now the only
country that I'm aware of

1127
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:10,800
that has fully complied with
the Cloud Act requirements

1128
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:14,360
under this provision
is the United Kingdom.

1129
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:18,350
And because they have
taken the necessary steps

1130
00:53:18,350 --> 00:53:21,360
under this law, UK law enforcement

1131
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:25,000
can now serve production orders
directly on US providers.

1132
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,170
They don't have to go through the Mutual

1133
00:53:26,170 --> 00:53:27,350
Legal Assistance Act

1134
00:53:27,350 --> 00:53:30,440
or anything like that or treaty rather.

1135
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:33,290
And so what this does is it creates

1136
00:53:33,290 --> 00:53:37,919
some interesting situations
because now if you US providers

1137
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:42,919
do something similar will there
be Schrems to implications

1138
00:53:42,990 --> 00:53:46,089
because the US provider
will be serving process

1139
00:53:46,090 --> 00:53:49,620
directly on a UK provider.

1140
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:51,893
So it raises metricing issues.

1141
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:56,140
What I would say the takeaway
is if your company stores data

1142
00:53:56,140 --> 00:53:58,200
in a commercial cloud
make sure you understand

1143
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:00,040
what the implications are.

1144
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:02,720
Most government agencies,
US government agencies

1145
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:05,560
require their cloud data be
stored in the United States

1146
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:08,390
so that they maintain data sovereignty.

1147
00:54:08,390 --> 00:54:10,049
I think there are some other companies

1148
00:54:10,050 --> 00:54:12,100
that like to do the same.

1149
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:14,940
Oftentimes it may be more
expensive to store your data

1150
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:17,420
only in United States
because the cloud provider

1151
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:18,960
has to take additional precautions

1152
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:22,160
and obviously handle
your data differently.

1153
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:24,569
But in some ways you
have a lot more control

1154
00:54:24,570 --> 00:54:28,640
over who has access to the data
and how you can control it.

1155
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,580
So what have we learned today?

1156
00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:33,310
Well, I think some of the
things that you need to apply

1157
00:54:33,310 --> 00:54:36,049
are when you get back first of all,

1158
00:54:36,050 --> 00:54:40,060
check to make sure that if
you're dealing with individuals

1159
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:45,060
private information, you are
aware of this GDPR problem

1160
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:47,640
right now that has not yet been solved.

1161
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:49,940
Check your standard contractual clauses

1162
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:52,020
to see if they could still stand up.

1163
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:54,870
If not see if they can
be modified to stand up.

1164
00:54:54,870 --> 00:54:58,900
See if you're ready for
the CCPA California suits

1165
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:03,010
that may already be applicable
to California citizen data.

1166
00:55:03,010 --> 00:55:06,100
Start preparing for
Virginia's Data Privacy Act

1167
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:08,210
and for New York's Data
Privacy Act as well

1168
00:55:08,210 --> 00:55:10,760
because there was coming
up in less than two years.

1169
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:13,937
In the first three months
after you get back,

1170
00:55:13,937 --> 00:55:17,949
try to see if you can minimize
your use of biometric data

1171
00:55:17,949 --> 00:55:20,680
especially from any Illinois citizens.

1172
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:25,680
Make sure you have policies
dealing with how employees

1173
00:55:25,850 --> 00:55:29,690
are to deal when they cross
borders with your data

1174
00:55:29,690 --> 00:55:33,100
and how they're to secure their
cell phones and smartphones

1175
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:34,940
if they're carrying your data

1176
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:37,460
and then how you're securing
your own data in the cloud,

1177
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:39,755
and whether you're maintaining
data sovereignty over that,

1178
00:55:39,755 --> 00:55:42,150
or whether you're
playing the lesser price,

1179
00:55:42,150 --> 00:55:43,520
but taking a risk that the data

1180
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,070
may end up in a foreign country

1181
00:55:45,070 --> 00:55:47,980
which may have different
laws pertaining to it.

1182
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:49,840
And then I put it within
the next six months

1183
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:52,730
I would actually ask you
to do it much faster,

1184
00:55:52,730 --> 00:55:56,160
but we ran through a lot
of problems with insurance.

1185
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:58,796
And the only reason I put six
months is oftentimes insurance

1186
00:55:58,796 --> 00:56:02,040
policies only expire after
a certain period of time.

1187
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:04,890
So you may need to do
some are doing of this,

1188
00:56:04,890 --> 00:56:07,420
but before your insurance company

1189
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:09,950
or your insurance is renewed

1190
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:12,193
make sure you're aware

1191
00:56:12,193 --> 00:56:14,740
of what those war-like provisions are.

1192
00:56:14,740 --> 00:56:17,129
Make sure you are aware
of the betterment clauses,

1193
00:56:17,130 --> 00:56:20,800
make sure you're aware of
the ransomware policies, etc

1194
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:22,740
because there are a lot
of really big issues

1195
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:24,109
in cyber insurance now.

1196
00:56:24,110 --> 00:56:26,120
And I know a lot of
companies like to use that

1197
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:29,080
as their backup, last protection,

1198
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:31,671
but it may not provide too much protection

1199
00:56:31,671 --> 00:56:34,460
based on a lot of the ways
these cases are going.

1200
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:36,260
So just make sure you're aware of that.

1201
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:39,023
And you only pay appropriately
for what you're getting.

1202
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:42,014
That pretty much wraps it up for us.

1203
00:56:42,014 --> 00:56:44,450
Julie, did you have any
questions in the chat?

1204
00:56:44,450 --> 00:56:45,689
- Sure do.

1205
00:56:45,690 --> 00:56:48,393
You are as usual spot on time.

1206
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:51,530
I know we love to have the interaction,

1207
00:56:51,530 --> 00:56:54,322
look forward to that next
year, but a question came in

1208
00:56:54,322 --> 00:56:57,360
with respect to the geofencing searches

1209
00:56:57,360 --> 00:56:59,420
about what about false positives.

1210
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:02,730
- Okay, that is a problem

1211
00:57:02,730 --> 00:57:04,831
because obviously there
can be a lot of people

1212
00:57:04,831 --> 00:57:07,433
who are caught in these geofences.

1213
00:57:08,570 --> 00:57:09,870
It's hard to say.

1214
00:57:09,870 --> 00:57:13,240
I think there's a lot of false positives

1215
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:14,682
with a lot of technology now.

1216
00:57:14,682 --> 00:57:17,727
Obviously facial recognition
has a lot of false positives

1217
00:57:17,727 --> 00:57:20,116
so there are gonna be some false positives

1218
00:57:20,116 --> 00:57:21,690
in the geofences.

1219
00:57:21,690 --> 00:57:23,430
And I think that's perhaps why the courts

1220
00:57:23,430 --> 00:57:25,620
are stepping a little bit cautiously.

1221
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:30,620
I think it's less likely if the culprits

1222
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:34,390
or the suspect commits the
crime in a very remote area

1223
00:57:34,390 --> 00:57:37,120
where very few people
pass then the likelihood

1224
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:40,560
of false identification
is gonna be far less.

1225
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:45,560
But in some of these
city focused geofences,

1226
00:57:45,980 --> 00:57:48,130
there's tons of people
that pass through there

1227
00:57:48,130 --> 00:57:50,270
and for the police to say
there's probable cause

1228
00:57:50,270 --> 00:57:51,890
to believe that just
because you happen to pass

1229
00:57:51,890 --> 00:57:55,940
through a couple
artificially set up geofences

1230
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:57,850
that you are a prime suspect

1231
00:57:57,850 --> 00:57:59,299
because you have me carrying your phone

1232
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:01,660
at the same time is problematic.

1233
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:05,100
And I think that courts
are gonna start holding law

1234
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:07,259
enforcement to a higher standard.

1235
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:09,250
I mean, it's already a
probable cause standard

1236
00:58:09,250 --> 00:58:12,610
but they're gonna be starting
to show me the probable cause

1237
00:58:12,610 --> 00:58:14,110
here because I'm not seeing it

1238
00:58:14,110 --> 00:58:16,373
in this very unique type of situation.

1239
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:19,220
- That's great, thank you.

1240
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:22,557
I know we are right at time,
but I really wanna thank you.

1241
00:58:22,557 --> 00:58:27,189
I'm certainly gonna go
start looking at bio data,

1242
00:58:27,190 --> 00:58:30,470
Natal, Illinois and reading
my insurance policy.

1243
00:58:30,470 --> 00:58:33,020
And I'm sure many of you are as well,

1244
00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:36,100
certainly as remote work will continue

1245
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:37,830
in whatever the next normal is.

1246
00:58:37,830 --> 00:58:41,173
And certainly to some
extent, but thank you again.

1247
00:58:42,158 --> 00:58:45,650
And we very much look
forward to seeing all of you

1248
00:58:45,650 --> 00:58:49,210
hopefully in person next year
but this has been terrific.

1249
00:58:49,210 --> 00:58:50,930
Thanks so much professor Aldrich.

1250
00:58:50,930 --> 00:58:53,480
- Sure and just a couple
of closing comments.

1251
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:55,330
I think we have maybe a minute or so.

1252
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:57,890
The courts are really looking at this

1253
00:58:57,890 --> 00:58:59,569
about this fourth amendment equilibrium

1254
00:58:59,570 --> 00:59:01,730
and I see a lot of the
cases are going in this way

1255
00:59:01,730 --> 00:59:03,080
where the courts are saying

1256
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:05,600
if we allow the technology to define it,

1257
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:07,180
as we always have

1258
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:10,640
do we basically undermine
the expected rights

1259
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:12,210
that people have had for so long.

1260
00:59:12,210 --> 00:59:14,400
And so I think this is gonna
be an increasing tension

1261
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:17,140
as we deal with these
cases and Riley Jones

1262
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:19,609
and Carpenter are three
very good examples,

1263
00:59:19,610 --> 00:59:21,600
but I think some of the
cases that we raised today

1264
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:23,380
create more examples.

1265
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:25,120
Now the courts are eventually
gonna have to grapple

1266
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:27,950
with this and that's gonna
be exciting times ahead.

1267
00:59:27,950 --> 00:59:29,430
Thanks Julie.

1268
00:59:29,430 --> 00:59:32,212
- Thank you and thanks
everybody for participating.
