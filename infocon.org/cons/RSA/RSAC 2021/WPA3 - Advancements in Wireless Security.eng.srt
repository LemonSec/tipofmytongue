1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:03,000
- Welcome everybody,
thank you for joining me

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,320
for our WPA3-Advancements in
Wireless Security discussion.

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,500
My name's Steve Orr.

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,629
I'm a distinguished architect

5
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:11,870
from Cisco Systems U.S.
Public Sector division.

6
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:13,209
Pleasure to be here today.

7
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:14,460
I'll just give you a quick background.

8
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:15,920
I've been in the networking industry

9
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,120
for the better part of 25 years.

10
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,710
From a wireless security perspective,

11
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,160
one of the day jobs I
have outside of Cisco

12
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,910
is I luckily get to work
within the Wi-Fi Alliance

13
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:27,610
and I work with a bunch of great companies

14
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:30,740
in the Wi-Fi Alliance security

15
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,500
both technical and
marketing working groups.

16
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,590
And I also work within some
of the IEEE groups as well.

17
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:40,230
So the whole goal for
today is to get everybody

18
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,040
a little bit better
understanding of what's going on

19
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,750
in the world with WPA3 and Enhanced Open

20
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,260
and a couple of the
other new security things

21
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,190
that have been happening since WPA2

22
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:50,710
was first introduced into the market.

23
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:53,690
We spent a lot of time in
the last couple of years

24
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:56,010
really focusing on enhancing security.

25
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:58,330
So again, really the whole goal for today,

26
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:00,930
know where and when to deploy
the new security technologies.

27
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,160
And even, if you haven't turned it on,

28
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,379
forgot where to turn it off
your network architecture

29
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:07,289
and just kind of kick the tires on it.

30
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,370
As right now, we've got a lot
of new products coming out

31
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,470
not just Cisco, but vendors altogether.

32
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:14,030
The Wi-Fi Alliance is pushing really

33
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:18,230
to get everybody supporting
WPA3 as quickly as possible.

34
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:19,630
So in kicking it off,

35
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:21,697
I know everybody is at the RSA conference

36
00:01:21,697 --> 00:01:24,410
and there's a security and usability.

37
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:26,080
There's always a trade off.

38
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,720
You can over-rotate either way

39
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,650
which can cause security challenges.

40
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:31,530
So really, what we wanna do and kind of

41
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:33,640
the focus of this is know where and when

42
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,930
and how to deploy the
different technologies

43
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:38,390
whether it's personal versus
enterprise, transition modes,

44
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:40,830
EAP types, or cryptographic strength.

45
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:43,039
We're not gonna go into
every possible use case.

46
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,610
We're really just gonna
kind of hit the highlights

47
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:47,550
of what's been going on
in WPA3 the developments

48
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,119
and all the cool things
that we're trying to bring

49
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:52,920
to market under the Wi-Fi
Alliance WPA3 brand.

50
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,840
So, funny slide,

51
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,850
our interest in wireless
security technologies.

52
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:59,240
Typically a very few
people were interested

53
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,070
in wireless security
until there is an attack.

54
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:05,860
Once the attack occurs,
everything happens in the media.

55
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,850
We fix everything as quickly as possible.

56
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:09,820
Then it's kind of like back to normal

57
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:12,230
and nobody's really paying
attention to security any longer.

58
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,899
So, what we're trying to
do in the Wi-Fi Alliance

59
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,273
is really smooth that
curve out and make security

60
00:02:17,273 --> 00:02:20,870
a continuous development
and continuous innovation

61
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:23,240
within the Wi-Fi Alliance, within industry

62
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,320
also that we can bring the best security

63
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,709
as quickly as possible to the market

64
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:31,300
and into the hands of
consumers and IT folks.

65
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,750
I've put this slide in here as well.

66
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,150
It's kind of a joke.

67
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:37,160
We've been working on WPA3 for probably

68
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,030
the better part of six to seven years.

69
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:42,190
So yeah, it really was a five-year mission

70
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:45,090
since before we started working on WPA3

71
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:47,620
to actually when it was mandated.

72
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:50,280
So as of July 1st, 2020,
which was last year

73
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,300
all new Wi-Fi certified
products have to support WPA3

74
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,340
which includes Wi-Fi6, Wi-Fi6E

75
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,780
and all current and future
programs are gonna be launched.

76
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,770
So we're embedding the best technology,

77
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:06,400
the most secure technology,
right from the start

78
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,070
so that we don't have
to kind of go look back

79
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:11,143
and see if we can bring up
the best security to play.

80
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,540
So a real quick view of where we are

81
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:17,310
with the Wi-Fi Alliance
security program history.

82
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:21,100
What you'll see, we started
back the WPA back in 2003.

83
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,630
Again, this is just a short history lesson

84
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:25,670
on where we've been so
that you can see where

85
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:28,480
we've actually started to
accelerate focus on security.

86
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,410
So we had WPA in 2003, WPA2 in 2004

87
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:35,630
and then from 2004 to roughly 2018,

88
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:38,579
not a lot of things
happened in the WPA space

89
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:41,850
for us doing things in the security world.

90
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:44,450
So we get some security
enhancements in 2018

91
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:46,810
right after KRACK came out.

92
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,500
Then we launched WPA3 in 2018.

93
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,060
We launched Wi-Fi Enhanced Open,

94
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,610
we'll get to that in a little bit.

95
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:56,020
And then we saw some things
that happened with Dragonblood

96
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:00,770
and we quickly came out
with another WPA3 revision

97
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:03,130
December of 2019 and December of 2020.

98
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:06,079
Each one of those
continues to add features

99
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,240
and new capabilities
under the WPA3 branded.

100
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,920
Again, most people that are looking

101
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,160
at what goes on in WPA3
don't necessarily see

102
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,870
that we've actually had a continual focus

103
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:18,070
for the last probably six to seven years

104
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,790
on bringing new security features

105
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:21,810
and capabilities to market.

106
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:24,200
So the best thing is you're here.

107
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,820
So in December, 2020,
we released an update.

108
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,700
We'll talk about pretty much WPA3,

109
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,420
what happened in 2019 and 2020

110
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,400
to bring those things to market

111
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,929
and what new features that are beyond

112
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,380
what you normally see in
personal and enterprise.

113
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,360
So let's start with the first one.

114
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,560
So open networks get an
upgrade as I call it,

115
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,490
Wi-Fi Certified Enhanced Open.

116
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:49,370
So, this basically we have a capability

117
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,220
and I threw some of these
screenshots in here.

118
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,657
So we have an Enhanced Open-only mode.

119
00:04:52,657 --> 00:04:54,840
And I wanted to really
bring for those people

120
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,679
who want to get down into
the weeds a little bit

121
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,170
exactly what it looks like.

122
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:00,520
So we've got group
ciphers, pairwise ciphers.

123
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,950
The thing that's interesting
about Enhanced Open

124
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:06,810
which is based on OWE which is Of:ac:18.

125
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:08,060
The interesting thing here is

126
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:11,920
it's unauthenticated encryption.

127
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,060
So this is completely
different than what we do

128
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,650
in an open network today,
which is we don't authenticate

129
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,030
and we don't encrypt.

130
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:20,659
This is really an opportunity for us

131
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,230
to solve passive eavesdropping.

132
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,900
That's what we targeted.

133
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,729
It's not an open network
where people can pass the

134
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,890
we see the traffic that's going on,

135
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:30,840
but, we actually give you the ability

136
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,830
to encrypt the traffic.

137
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:35,479
So again, this falls into
privacy, not necessarily security.

138
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,360
So when people claim, Oh
my God, Enhanced Open,

139
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,460
it's still subject to
certain vulnerabilities

140
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,620
and certain issues.

141
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:44,950
We're never claiming
here that Enhanced Open

142
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:47,890
is solving a man in the middle problems.

143
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,490
It's actually giving us a way

144
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:51,540
to solve passive eavesdropping problems.

145
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,620
So again, remember where and when

146
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,340
and what technology you're using.

147
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:57,810
If you have open networks today

148
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:00,180
you can migrate to Enhanced Open networks

149
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,443
and get that passive
eavesdropping security.

150
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:07,030
Speaking of transitions, we
always have transition modes.

151
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:08,530
So anytime we're trying to transition

152
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:10,330
from an older technology
to a new technology

153
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:11,370
even in the case where we're going

154
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:14,280
from open to Enhanced Open,

155
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,059
again, when you look at what happens

156
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:18,080
when you have an Open SSID enabled

157
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,900
on an Enhanced Open certified AP

158
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:26,609
we actually mandate that it
creates a separate hidden BSS

159
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:29,360
with the same properties as the open BSS.

160
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,610
Why do we do this?

161
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:32,420
To make it easier for those stations,

162
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,050
those older legacy stations

163
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:36,360
that don't support
Enhanced Open to still have

164
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,910
an open SSID to connect to.

165
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:40,360
And those that do support Enhanced Open,

166
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,630
the transition mode allows
them to actually, excuse me

167
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,630
allows them to actually
make the connection.

168
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:46,880
What happens in the real world

169
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,340
is some of those legacy devices

170
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:52,859
when they see an Enhanced
Open BSS or an SSID,

171
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:56,010
they may get confused on how
they handle those beacons,

172
00:06:56,010 --> 00:07:00,104
where some Legacy STA may
see it as Open into dot1x

173
00:07:00,104 --> 00:07:03,150
or PSK network that led
to poor user experience.

174
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,020
So what we did was we kind of created

175
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,940
a transition mode mechanism where

176
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:12,150
the Open SSID actually advertises in it

177
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:15,710
the Enhanced Open SSID and information.

178
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:20,280
So that those stations that
see the Open SSID know that

179
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,169
there's an Enhanced Open SSID

180
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:24,170
they can connect to for enhanced security.

181
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:26,390
And we do the same thing
in the Enhanced Open SSID.

182
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:29,229
We also notify, excuse
me, those newer stations

183
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:30,800
that there's an open network as well.

184
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,110
So really the gist of what
we're trying to do here

185
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:35,260
is we're trying to get the stations

186
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:38,969
that can do advanced security
onto those new networks

187
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:42,400
as quickly as possible while
preserving the usability

188
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,229
of the legacy stations that
don't necessarily understand

189
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,683
what Enhanced Open is.

190
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:50,440
So again, moving forward.

191
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,969
So that's Enhanced Open,
what we're doing to try

192
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:55,220
to eliminate the challenges
of open networks.

193
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:59,800
So WPA2, WPA3, we still support both.

194
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,460
The big question I always
get is why did we call a WPA3

195
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:05,799
versus WPA2.1 or two and a half?

196
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,590
So, what we looked at was we
made such significant changes

197
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:12,400
between WPA2 and what we now called WPA3.

198
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,729
We figured it was time
for a major number change

199
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:18,490
to indicate how much work
actually went into it.

200
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:22,330
So one of the things that
kind of goes unsung about

201
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:26,416
what we're doing differently
with WPA3 is normally WPA2

202
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:29,120
and earlier was all based
around interoperability.

203
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,890
So as long as two stations inter-operated

204
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:33,150
from a security perspective,
everything was fine.

205
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:36,360
However, what could happen in reality is

206
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,870
you could have two
stations that inter-operate

207
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:41,539
but they inter-operate with a less

208
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:42,949
than optimal implementation

209
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:45,544
which means there could be
something wrong with it.

210
00:08:45,544 --> 00:08:48,319
So we actually introduced
conformance testing into WPA3.

211
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,860
In conformance testing,
we actually introduce

212
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:56,770
in the test bed equipment
we issue or we run tests,

213
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:58,170
we call them negative tests

214
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:01,689
so that we can detect
how stations under test

215
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:03,940
and devices under tests are gonna respond

216
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:07,960
and react to misbehaving network devices.

217
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,480
So conformance has been really huge for us

218
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,490
to be able to help vet a lot
of the stuff that's going on

219
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:16,920
in both clients and in
access point implementations

220
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,280
since we implemented WPA3.

221
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,970
One of the other interesting things,

222
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:22,600
there's really no information element

223
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,450
that designates WPA3 from WPA2.

224
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:27,980
We didn't go down the
path of creating a new IE

225
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:32,570
Really what WPA3 is defined
by is the AKM Cipher Suite

226
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:35,530
and protect the management
frame combinations.

227
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:37,130
So when you look at those combinations

228
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:40,570
you can easily see what WPA3 is,

229
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:42,310
what the building blocks are.

230
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:44,137
Now again, when we look at PMF,

231
00:09:44,137 --> 00:09:45,709
our so protected management frames

232
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,370
that was something that
came out during WPA2

233
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:50,910
but we didn't see wide adoption.

234
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:53,280
So one of the things that we
wanted to make sure we did was

235
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,949
kinda in this building block
architecture of security

236
00:09:56,950 --> 00:10:00,490
we made sure that PMF had to be negotiated

237
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:01,980
for WPA3 connections.

238
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:05,970
So if a connection is
classified as a WPA3 connection,

239
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:10,250
PMF must be negotiated between
the station and the AP.

240
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,645
We had left it at optional in WPA2

241
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:15,630
and what we were seeing
was, not a lot of clients

242
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:20,630
were negotiating PMF which
leaves a fundamental hole

243
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:23,720
in the initial onboarding
and on a communication

244
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,853
between the station and the AP.

245
00:10:25,853 --> 00:10:28,689
With WPA3 it's also mandatory
for Wi-Fi6 and newer.

246
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:30,960
So this is an awesome thing for us.

247
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,470
We got to attach to the
Wi-Fi6 MAC and PHY program

248
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:38,700
so that all these new
Wi-Fi6, 6E and beyond APs

249
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,373
will all have WPA3 as the starting point.

250
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:45,040
So let's real quick talk about modes

251
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,709
because modes are different than brands.

252
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:49,220
So WPA3 is a brand and then
there's individual modes

253
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,730
that happen underneath it.

254
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:54,140
So WPA3-Personal, there's an SAE mode.

255
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:56,180
So what we did was we swapped out

256
00:10:56,180 --> 00:11:00,500
what we did for WPA2-PSK using SAE,

257
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,370
which is defined in the IEEE.

258
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,420
And then we also created
an SAE transition mode.

259
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:07,209
Again, when we think about
going back to Enhanced Open

260
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:09,470
we wanted to preserve client experience

261
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:12,180
and bring the best experience
and most secure possible.

262
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,530
So how do we help those
clients that may only have

263
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:19,050
or those people that may only
have WPA2 capable devices

264
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:21,189
and now they've bought
a WPA3 access point.

265
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:23,810
We've got to provide them some
way to be able to communicate

266
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:25,969
and onboard those older devices

267
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:28,530
and not have to do a fly
dang on a cut and run on

268
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:30,920
some of those older devices.

269
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,390
When we moved into WPA3-Enterprise,

270
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:35,830
we have a WPA3-Enterprise-only mode.

271
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:37,897
Again, the main difference between this

272
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:42,620
and WPA2-Enterprise is a PMF.

273
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:45,690
PMF shall be negotiated
for all WPA3 connections.

274
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:48,810
And we're working on doing
some negative test cases again,

275
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:50,333
to bring those to bear
so that we can make sure

276
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:54,410
that we catch any potentially
bad acting stations

277
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:56,170
or access points.

278
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:57,160
Transition mode.

279
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,060
Transition mode again,
with WPA3-Enterprise allows

280
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:03,660
both WPA2 and WPA3-Enterprise connections.

281
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,969
This is where a PMF is set to optional.

282
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:07,690
Then we have this new thing that we did

283
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:11,430
which was called
WPA3-Enterprise 192-bit mode.

284
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:15,400
In this mode, we actually
had looked at some input

285
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,260
from different governments looking

286
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:19,720
at consistent cryptographic
implementations

287
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,540
in cipher suites to
avoid misconfiguration.

288
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:26,430
If you look at AKMs, group
ciphers, regular ciphers

289
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:29,670
and all the different
things that go into creating

290
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:31,910
a wireless connection including EAP types,

291
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:34,290
TLS cipher suites.

292
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:35,870
What we looked at is being able to create

293
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:38,700
a consistent cipher suite

294
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,410
or consistent bit strength
across all the cipher suites.

295
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:44,709
So this is where the
192-bit mode came from.

296
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:48,630
It's 192 bits of security
when deployed in this mode.

297
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:50,970
That's what you're guaranteed end to end

298
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:53,543
from the station to the access point.

299
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:58,610
So transition modes again,
just to touch on real quick

300
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:01,130
why did we do a WPA3 transition mode?

301
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:03,750
I always get the, Hey, I
can support multiple BSS's

302
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,820
on my AP's today.

303
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,510
It's 2020, 2021.

304
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:09,400
Transition modes,

305
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,020
they're created to preserve
interoperability with WPA2.

306
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:14,500
So it's really there to
help end user experience.

307
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,560
Wi-Fi is the liquidous technology.

308
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,170
It's from the home user all the way

309
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:20,000
to the enterprise and beyond.

310
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,690
Home users are not necessarily going

311
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:23,800
to spin up multiple BSS at home.

312
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,069
So what we wanted to do was
provide this easier transition.

313
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:30,933
So in WPA3 transition mode
or personal transition mode,

314
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,430
we can use the same pass rates

315
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:38,349
between a WPA2-PSK network
and a WPA3-SAE network.

316
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,150
So just the caveat.

317
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:41,560
So when you have it's transitioned

318
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,550
or you have to understand
the security implications

319
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:47,260
of transition modes,
that in a transition mode

320
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:51,439
you're only as secure
as your weakest link.

321
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,509
In this case it's the lower
security, the transition mode.

322
00:13:54,509 --> 00:13:57,590
So in WPA2-PSK, it still
means that if I'm using

323
00:13:57,590 --> 00:14:02,340
the same passphrase, I can
perform all the attacks

324
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:04,690
against the WPA2-PSK network.

325
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:07,530
I can potentially get the passphrase.

326
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:08,990
All that will do is get me access

327
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:10,680
to the infrastructure, the network.

328
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,839
It won't allow me to decrypt

329
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:16,610
the WPA3-SAE traffic over the air.

330
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:19,879
So again, knowing where and
when to deploy transition modes

331
00:14:19,879 --> 00:14:22,649
and what the security
implications are are critical.

332
00:14:22,649 --> 00:14:24,750
So anytime you mix and
match a lower security

333
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:27,980
with a higher security,
you're always going to have

334
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,680
to address the lower security challenges

335
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,540
in these transition mode.

336
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:33,569
So again, know your security requirements

337
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:36,800
for your deployment and if
having a transition mode

338
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,240
between WPA3 and WPA2 doesn't meet

339
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,690
your security requirements,

340
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:44,227
you can always change
this and have a WPA2 SSID

341
00:14:45,228 --> 00:14:46,599
and a WPA3 SSID

342
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,850
with different security
requirements on them.

343
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:52,760
Again, just a quick look
at some of the frames.

344
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,689
Again, I wanna make sure
for those that wanted

345
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:57,367
to dig in deep and see what's going on

346
00:14:57,367 --> 00:14:59,610
in WPA3-Personal only.

347
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:01,000
Again, we're using SAE

348
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,540
which you can see is the
AKM ending in zero eight.

349
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,550
It specifies SAE.

350
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,729
You can see that management
frame protections required,

351
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:12,920
and we're solidified around
AES-CCM-128 for group,

352
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:17,573
pairwise and CMAC-128
for broadcast integrity.

353
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:21,210
In the transition mode, this
is where it gets interesting.

354
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:23,110
So in transition mode,
we have a group cipher

355
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:26,150
and pairwise cipher,
again with AES-CCM-128

356
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,740
but now we're actually have the ability

357
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:31,230
to advertise Multiple AKMs
in a single advertisement.

358
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,470
So in this case, I added a couple of AKMs.

359
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:38,390
So I added PSK, PSK (SHA256) and also SAE.

360
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:40,270
And then management frame protection,

361
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:43,090
that's listed as capable
instead of required.

362
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:44,900
And then we do broadcast
integrity protocol

363
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,069
again, it's CMAC-128.

364
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:49,640
So this actually allows
me in a single SSID

365
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:54,640
to associate PSK,
WPA2-PSK, WPA2-PSK clients

366
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:57,130
that support SHA-256

367
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:00,880
and SAE all at the same
time in a single BSS.

368
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,500
Again, knowing what your
security requirements are

369
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,290
and potential challenges,
just make sure that you know

370
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:07,719
what AKMs you're putting on there

371
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,070
and what implications
that mean to the network.

372
00:16:11,126 --> 00:16:13,490
And WPA3-Enterprise-192.

373
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:15,320
Again, when we look at what this is,

374
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,580
we look at the AKM, which
pretty much designates

375
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,750
what's the requirement.

376
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,800
AKM here is 12 which is basically saying

377
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,900
I have to use SHA384.

378
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:26,367
And then my group cipher is AES-GCMP-256.

379
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,459
And the pairwise cipher is AES-GCMP-256.

380
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:33,580
And the broadcast integrity
protocol is GMAC-256.

381
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:37,520
So one of the big differences
between Enterprise-192

382
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,760
and your regular WPA2-Enterprise

383
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,819
you can actually see that we
shifted from CCMP to GCMP.

384
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:46,430
And we went from 128 to
256 in the bitstream.

385
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:50,609
And again from SHA-256
to SHA-384 for hashing.

386
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:53,550
So again, some subtle differences here,

387
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:54,859
but again, just make sure you know

388
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,380
if you need stronger security

389
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:57,580
you requires stronger security.

390
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:01,227
There's always an option
with WPA3-Enterprise-192.

391
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:03,970
Now, a couple of interesting things

392
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:06,270
and most people don't
necessarily delve too deep

393
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:08,470
into what the Wi-Fi Alliance is doing.

394
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:10,790
There's a bunch of stuff now
that's online and available

395
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,750
for everybody to go
out and take a look at.

396
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:15,300
So the Wi-Fi Alliance security homepage.

397
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,002
The tech specs are out there.

398
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:22,040
Now, the most interesting
we've done in the last year

399
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,079
is there's a security development page.

400
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,720
There's a ton of interesting stuff located

401
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,460
in the security development page.

402
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:31,220
And what's been opened up
is you can provide feedback

403
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,670
or if you have interest in it

404
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,730
just go to the webpage,
download the documents.

405
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:38,250
And there's a way to provide
feedback about what's going on

406
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:41,773
from a security development
perspective in the standards.

407
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:46,480
So, we had an update in 2019.

408
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,380
So in WPA3 2019, these are
some of the things that we did

409
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:54,410
in an off year on how did we wanna go back

410
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:56,960
and capture some of the
things that were going on?

411
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,980
So we had fast BSS transition

412
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,970
and each server certificate validation.

413
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:03,310
So everybody knows fast
BSS transition, right?

414
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:06,590
This is 802.11r within the IEEE.

415
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:09,297
So what we did was we
actually took the intel

416
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:12,540
and our testing was scattered
around in different locations

417
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,260
in some of the Wi-Fi Alliance testing.

418
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:17,480
And we had heard from a lot
of feedback out in the field

419
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:21,110
that no one's testing 802.11r
to its fullest extent.

420
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:22,409
So we brought all these tests in

421
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:27,180
and now we have a full test
suite labeled under WPA3

422
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:29,800
for 802.11r fast BSS transition.

423
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:34,440
So we test both a
WPA3-personal, WPA3-enterprise

424
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,070
also WPA2-personal and transition modes

425
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:39,700
for both over the air and over the DS

426
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:42,860
if the stations and the AP support it.

427
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:45,139
One of the other key benefits that we did

428
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:48,070
is we also created a preference order.

429
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:53,070
So if you have multiple
AKMs that are on a BSS

430
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:56,520
whether it's personal or
enterprise we actually prescribe

431
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:59,980
the order in which you
should select those AKMs.

432
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:02,230
So if it is a personal network,

433
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:05,950
the most secure is FT-SAE.

434
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:08,070
So you should select that
if it's being offered

435
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:12,720
then it goes to SAE, FT-PSK, PSK (SHA256)

436
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,223
and then PSK with (SHA1).

437
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:16,990
The same thing with enterprise.

438
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:21,990
With enterprise it's a
FT-EAP, then it's EAP (SHA256)

439
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:23,500
and then EAP with (SHA1).

440
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,760
Again, we wanted to bring
some consistent practices

441
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:30,290
around what was the most
secure, when it should connect

442
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:32,649
and then if there were other options

443
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:34,350
of what the next option should be.

444
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:39,310
Now, EAP Server Certificate
validation, or SCV.

445
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:41,879
This was one that we had also gotten

446
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,610
a lot of feedback about whether

447
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:46,979
it was evil-twin attacks
on client devices.

448
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:51,710
We do a lot of stuff where
the actual server validates

449
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:54,780
the client certificate,
but not where the client

450
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:57,530
or the station validates
the server certificate.

451
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:58,620
So we wanted to try to address

452
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:00,110
some of these longstanding problems we had

453
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:02,240
in WPA2-Enterprise.

454
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,420
So this is all about
attacks that were occurring

455
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,410
on the inner client authentication.

456
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:09,840
So we created a, we sat
down a period of feature

457
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,020
where we required the station

458
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:15,320
to perform server certificate validation

459
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,790
for any EAP type that's using TLS.

460
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:21,000
So in this case, EAP-TLS,
EAP-TTLS and PEAP

461
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,110
and we have this concept of trust anchors

462
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:25,409
where we have a server
cert, CA cert pinned

463
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:29,190
to a network profile and
concepts like Trust-on-First-Use

464
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:31,920
and User Override Server Certificate.

465
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,830
Basically when you're doing an onboarding

466
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:35,699
you're gonna have to trust that first time

467
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,560
that you're using that server certificate

468
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,370
unless the profile's been pushed to you

469
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:42,469
at some point and then
you can move forward.

470
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:46,720
We also have a capability
called Trust Override Disabled

471
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,960
where a network operator,

472
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,720
so again, if you're in
an enterprise scenario

473
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,090
and you don't want your
end user to be able

474
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:54,490
to override that server cert,

475
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:56,510
you can issue a Trust Override Disabled

476
00:20:56,510 --> 00:21:00,370
where they can't override
or change the server cert

477
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:02,820
that they're being validated against.

478
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:05,780
And this way, SCV can't be disabled.

479
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:09,760
Again, mandatory for a Wi-Fi
certified WPA3-enterprise.

480
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,900
And again, that was starting

481
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:13,803
in December of 2019 in our update.

482
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,760
Now, onto some of the interesting things.

483
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,060
In WPA3 2020, again, this
is just last December,

484
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:23,240
we came out with a bunch of updates.

485
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,230
So there's a couple of
things that we came out with.

486
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:27,270
So SAE Hash-to-Element,

487
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:29,170
a feature called Transition Disable,

488
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:33,020
SAE Public Key, Wi-Fi QR
code, Beacon Protection,

489
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,760
Operating Channel Validation

490
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,280
and privacy enhancements or
MAC randomization topics.

491
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,580
So I'll touch on each
of these really quickly.

492
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:42,650
SAE Hash-to-Element.

493
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:44,610
So as I mentioned in right
at the very beginning

494
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:47,228
of the slides when we had KRACK

495
00:21:47,229 --> 00:21:48,062
and then we had Dragonblood.

496
00:21:48,062 --> 00:21:52,350
So SAE Hash-to-Element was
a response to Dragonblood

497
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:55,887
when it got published to help address

498
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,780
some of the challenges
that were brought up

499
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:01,370
in SAE using the
hunting-and-pecking algorithm.

500
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:04,540
So we have this intermediary key

501
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,830
which is derived from
the password offline.

502
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:08,310
So that's the key for this.

503
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:10,370
The password that we're gonna be using,

504
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:13,209
or the PT that we're
deriving from the password

505
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:16,020
happens offline when
you create the profile.

506
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,379
So it's one time per group.

507
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:20,580
So it helps mitigate some
of the side channel attacks

508
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,070
that we're seeing occurred.

509
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:25,120
It was defined in 802.11,
which is now 2020.

510
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:29,120
So AKMs remain the same
such as SAE and FT-SAE

511
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:34,080
but the H2E capabilities
advertise in RSNXE message.

512
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,179
So again, if the stations don't support

513
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:38,597
or if the stations connecting to an AP

514
00:22:38,597 --> 00:22:41,730
and the AP doesn't
support Hash-to-Element,

515
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:43,690
it will fall back to hunting and pecking.

516
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:45,980
So again, not necessarily
a transition mode

517
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:50,400
but a way not to strand
stations that are out there.

518
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,350
So again, mandatory feature
for Wi-Fi certified WPA3.

519
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:56,399
Now, here's some of the interesting news.

520
00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:01,260
SAE Hash-to-Element only
exists for six gigahertz bands.

521
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:05,377
So it doesn't have the older
hunting and pecking mechanism.

522
00:23:05,377 --> 00:23:08,639
Six gigahertz only has the
Hash-to-Element strategy

523
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,870
in there solely so that we
can start in that clean band

524
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:14,850
and move forward with the latest security.

525
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:16,189
So we'll talk about what's going on

526
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:17,840
in six gigahertz in a little bit.

527
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:19,840
Transition Disable.

528
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,050
Again, this is another thing
that came out of some of the

529
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:25,310
other discussions around
security vulnerabilities.

530
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:27,720
It's giving us a way to protect ourselves

531
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,640
against transition mode downgrades.

532
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:33,290
So if I have a WPA3
transition mode networking,

533
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:37,060
personal or enterprise, if I have WPA2

534
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:40,010
in a sense WPA2-PSK still on there,

535
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:42,740
I can get downgraded from WPA3-personal

536
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:45,490
to WPA2-personal on that transition mode.

537
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:49,500
So what we want to stop is
having in those transition modes.

538
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:54,390
At some point in time, there'll
be a mechanism or a time

539
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:56,820
that you're gonna want to
disable those transition modes

540
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:59,179
not just on the infrastructure.

541
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:01,920
This is a way to actually
signal to the stations

542
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:06,143
no longer use transition modes
on these network profiles.

543
00:24:06,994 --> 00:24:08,399
So it's basically the infrastructure

544
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,560
signaling to the station,
don't use a transition mode

545
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,633
on this BSS or this SSID.

546
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:17,582
What we currently support,
WPA3-personal transition mode,

547
00:24:17,583 --> 00:24:21,270
SAE-PK, WPA3-enterprise and Enhanced Open.

548
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:23,590
So basically, if you had a
station that was connecting

549
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:26,000
with WPA3-personal transition mode

550
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,650
after it receives a
Transition Disable indication

551
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:33,650
from the network, it will no
longer allow WPA2-personal

552
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,360
on that BSS.

553
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,209
So again, trying to protect
from those downgrade attacks.

554
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:41,149
SAE Public Key.

555
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:42,740
This was another thing that we had done

556
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,160
in the Wi-Fi Alliance.

557
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:48,150
Again, looking for in these
small public hotspots,

558
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:51,400
not a large hotspot like
Passpoint or Hotspot 2.0

559
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,320
how do we try to avoid evil-twin attacks

560
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,320
by an attacker who knows the password?

561
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,159
Again, it was a mechanism
where we looked at

562
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,060
how do we leverage some of the stuff

563
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:02,860
that's going on in the today, like SAE

564
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:06,270
and some public key
cryptography to be able to bring

565
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:07,720
in the best of both worlds.

566
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,850
So, again, it's just an
extension to the SAE.

567
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:12,689
So it's using the same AKM

568
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:14,737
but we're actually just advertising SAE-PK

569
00:25:14,737 --> 00:25:18,680
in the RSNXE field, authentication results

570
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:22,200
in a pairwise master
key just like with SAE,

571
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,630
but the SAE-PK network's configured

572
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:27,390
with an Elliptic Curve public key pair.

573
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:30,400
So we're actually using
public private keys

574
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,623
in order to validate that AP.

575
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,510
So the password is actually gonna embed

576
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:39,629
a base32 fingerprint of
the public key of the AP

577
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:41,330
so that we can actually
get some resistance

578
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:42,770
to pre-image attacks.

579
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:47,090
And this gives us the
ability to validate that AP.

580
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:49,980
So again, it's another mechanism,

581
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:53,490
another tool in the toolkit
for uses in public networks

582
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:56,020
in like coffee shop or other places where

583
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:59,930
you still have to publish
a key, a passphrase

584
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:02,130
for people to be able
to get on the network.

585
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,340
Wi-Fi QR code.

586
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:06,659
Again, this was just
more of a standardization

587
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:09,150
where we've seen Wi-Fi QR codes.

588
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,800
We actually went back
through and just wanted

589
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:14,230
to make them backward compatible
with the Wi-Fi URI format.

590
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:15,980
And we just added some new capabilities

591
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:17,470
for the features we were coming out with

592
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:21,900
such as Transition Disable,
SAE-PK, and Non-ASCII passwords.

593
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,920
So again, just more of an update

594
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,020
from that perspective on the QR code from.

595
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:31,240
A couple of other features
that we pulled in from 802.11,

596
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,000
which became 802.11-2020,

597
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,700
beacon protection and
operating channel validation.

598
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:39,110
Again, other things that
we were made aware of

599
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:43,939
that could be used to demanded
middle tax and other things

600
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:46,610
where beacon frames
typically being vulnerable

601
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:49,520
as well as operating channels
doing channel switch announced

602
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,790
with being able to intercept a station

603
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:55,649
and switch it to a different
channel, to a different BSS

604
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:57,890
and then allow the man in the
middle attacks to occur there.

605
00:26:57,890 --> 00:27:01,880
So again, it was being developed in 802.11

606
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04,780
at the time, and then became 802.11-2020.

607
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:06,470
We had pulled in both of those features

608
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:10,620
to really round out how
we were trying to focus

609
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:13,919
on security as more instead
of individual features

610
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:18,510
but really trying to build
a more robust protection

611
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:21,410
from initial onboarding beacon frames

612
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:24,200
all the way up to
encrypting data in transit.

613
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:27,350
Again, these are optional
features for Wi-Fi certified WPA3.

614
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:31,120
Again, when you go out to
the Wi-Fi Alliance website

615
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,370
you can take a look and see
what features and capabilities

616
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:36,389
the individual products
that you're getting

617
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:38,243
what they have on the certificates.

618
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:43,760
Kinda at the tail end of what
we did for December, 2020

619
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,890
in this latest WPA3,

620
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:48,510
we tried to address some ground rules

621
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:50,879
around privacy extension mechanisms.

622
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,740
You'll see this as, it was
like MAC address randomization.

623
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,870
It was based off of 802.11aq,

624
00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:01,689
which was again
incorporated in 802.11-2020.

625
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:05,430
There's a whole wave of work being done

626
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:08,690
around protecting users' privacy.

627
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:12,480
Classically we've done, identified
people's things, devices

628
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,140
by their MAC address 'cause the
MAC addresses didn't change.

629
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:20,140
However, using MAC addresses
in Wi-Fi allows basically

630
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,950
everybody to be tracked

631
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:24,010
because the MAC address
used to stay consistent

632
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:26,320
or constant when you were roaming.

633
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,950
So, one of the things that came out,

634
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:31,690
as I said that was introduced
in 11aq was the ability

635
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:36,110
to have your MAC addresses
randomized in a sense being able

636
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:38,459
to use locally significant MAC addresses.

637
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,190
So the station can construct these unique

638
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:43,140
randomized MAC addresses
typically per SSID

639
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:46,260
unless you have this same network profile

640
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,700
in which the way the standards written

641
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,540
when you come back to that same SSID,

642
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:52,629
you should use the same MAC address.

643
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:55,660
Also, The key things that
we're trying to protect too is,

644
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,690
when you're walking
around and roaming around

645
00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:00,170
with your Wi-Fi turned
on during active scanning

646
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:04,210
and not associated to a
BSS and for ANQP exchanges,

647
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:06,980
you're gonna continue to
randomize your MAC address again,

648
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,680
to decrease the footprint

649
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,230
of any personally identifiable
information leakage.

650
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:14,590
Just real quick on MAC
address randomization

651
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:16,490
for those that aren't familiar with it.

652
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:21,010
Again, it's based on a
rule where the first octet

653
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:23,590
if it ends in two, six, A
or E, that's going to be

654
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:25,990
a locally administered
or random MAC address.

655
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:29,910
So again, there's always a
push pull when we start talking

656
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:33,160
about MAC randomization
or protecting identity

657
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:36,010
from a end user side or a station side

658
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:37,650
and then the enterprise side.

659
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:40,800
There's a bunch of groups
ranges from the Wi-Fi Alliance

660
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:44,300
to the WBA, to the IEEE
out there looking at

661
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,580
how to best protect users' privacy

662
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:50,090
while not impeding user experience.

663
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:52,050
So basically making
sure things don't break

664
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:54,149
and you're still being
able to be protected

665
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:57,230
and your privacy is being
able to be adhere to.

666
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:59,810
So with that, so what's next?

667
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:01,260
And this is what I get asked all the time.

668
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:02,093
What's next?

669
00:30:02,093 --> 00:30:03,150
So what's on the horizon?

670
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:05,800
So six gigahertz or Wi-Fi6E

671
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,370
which is just coming out
60 gigahertz and others.

672
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:11,310
What do we see on the future
on the roadmap for Wi-Fi

673
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,409
for security perspective?

674
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:15,480
So, from a Greenfield
perspective, MAC/PHY/Bands

675
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:19,760
so again, Wi-Fi6E, WPA3
is the starting point.

676
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,710
WPA3-personal's required, WPA3-Enterprise

677
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:24,350
and Enterprise-192 are optional.

678
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:26,219
However, and this is the big part,

679
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:31,220
Legacy WPA2 and WPA will
not be supported at all

680
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:32,260
in the six gigahertz band.

681
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:34,940
So if you have a device that's
operating in six gigahertz

682
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:37,110
it's WPA3 only right now.

683
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:40,360
You will not be able to connect
to it with WPA2-Personal

684
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:43,610
or WPA2-Enterprise.

685
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:44,709
Here's the other big news.

686
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:46,320
Open networks are eliminated.

687
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,797
So there will be no open
networks in six gigahertz.

688
00:30:49,797 --> 00:30:53,560
If you have a need for
an open light network

689
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,970
in six gigahertz, it's Enhanced Open

690
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:58,160
and not Enhanced Open
with transition mode,

691
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,860
it's Enhanced Open only.

692
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:03,139
So what we tried to do in
these new MAC/PHY/Bands,

693
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:06,760
eliminate transition modes,
eliminate legacy security

694
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:09,310
start fresh, move forward from here.

695
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:12,200
And most importantly, WEP and TKP,

696
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,433
absolutely not supported in these bands.

697
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:18,220
So, when I put 2020 and beyond here

698
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:22,950
this is really WPA3 2020 and beyond is

699
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:25,030
what we're looking at is
what do we focus on now?

700
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:27,680
So Wi-Fi security is
an obscure technology.

701
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,450
Why do I say it's obscure?

702
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:31,610
Again, if I go back to my first slide,

703
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:33,800
most people aren't worried
about Wi-Fi security

704
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,010
until there's a reason for
them to worry about it.

705
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:38,720
So we've been tossing around
ideas on what we should do.

706
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:43,210
Is it better UX/UI to inform
users of the security?

707
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:44,660
Consistent photography?

708
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:47,190
Should we be focusing on
things three to five years out

709
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:49,000
as opposed to feature by features?

710
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,930
So, I love presenting to groups like these

711
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:53,900
because these are opportunities
for groups like this

712
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:54,880
to make your voice heard

713
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,500
and really kinda drive
where we're focusing

714
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:00,540
and where we're going from
a Wi-Fi security perspective

715
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:03,670
as we try to get ready for
the next future release

716
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:05,520
which could be anywhere between a year

717
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,853
to two to three years out.

718
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:09,780
Just as an advanced decoder gram,

719
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:11,710
I wanna provide this for everybody.

720
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:13,260
This gives you the features,

721
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:15,290
which bands that they operate in today

722
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:18,470
and whether they're optional or required.

723
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:19,840
So if I look at the feature,

724
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,203
let's just pick Enhanced
Open transition mode.

725
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:25,170
Enhanced Open transition will be required

726
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:28,480
Enhanced Open supported, but
you see it in six gigahertz

727
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,500
Enhanced Open transition
mode is disallowed.

728
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:34,520
The same thing with
WPA3 and WPA3-Enterprise

729
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,680
no transition modes
allowance in six gigahertz.

730
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,330
So again, wanted to make sure everybody

731
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:41,919
had this decoder ring so they
could see what, where and

732
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,903
how things are getting deployed
from a security perspective.

733
00:32:45,869 --> 00:32:46,980
And really just to wrap it up,

734
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:49,020
and again, I appreciate everybody's time.

735
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:52,690
Again, how do you apply
what you've learned today?

736
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:55,749
So if I wanna look at this at
next week, a couple of months

737
00:32:55,749 --> 00:33:00,230
and half a year away, within
the next couple of weeks,

738
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:01,433
really identify the
devices in your network

739
00:33:01,433 --> 00:33:06,370
that support WPA3 and which
WPA3 features they support

740
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:09,370
even identify which devices
supported Enhanced Open.

741
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:13,689
If you can spin up an Enhanced
Open SSID or transition mode,

742
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:16,090
SSID for Enhanced Open on your network,

743
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:17,449
give it a shot, see what you can do.

744
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:19,670
I mean, those are one of the
things you can able today

745
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:21,750
to increase minute with
some of the security

746
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:22,920
that's going on in your network

747
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,210
without being disruptive
to all the stations.

748
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:27,720
The other thing, enable
the WPA3 transition mode.

749
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,760
If your goal is to still be WPA2-PSK

750
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:34,600
try enabling a WPA3
transition mode on an SSID

751
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,610
to see what of your
stations that are out there.

752
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:38,169
What of your clients are out there

753
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:39,610
that may support WPA3.

754
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:41,510
I'm sure there'll be more
shocked than you think

755
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:43,590
on how many devices that are shipping now

756
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:46,000
that actually supported WPA3.

757
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,010
Six months from now, my
goal would be to create

758
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:51,290
a WPA3-only SSID.

759
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:53,399
Move forward with the latest security.

760
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,590
Again, construct this as part
of your security architecture

761
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:58,310
and see what you can do there,

762
00:33:58,310 --> 00:34:00,919
and maybe enable some of
the more optional features.

763
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,780
Again, your mileage is
gonna vary depending

764
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:04,530
on vendor certifications.

765
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:07,879
So again, really try to plan
out that Wi-Fi security roadmap

766
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:10,050
that you have looking at your devices,

767
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:11,620
looking at your infrastructure

768
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:14,759
and kinda move forward
building that more feature

769
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:18,159
defense in-depth architecture
around Wi-Fi security.

770
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,580
So with that, I'd love to
thank everybody for their time.

771
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:21,850
I really appreciate the opportunity

772
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:24,549
to get in front of groups
like this and have a session

773
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:26,280
and really just talk about Wi-Fi security.

774
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,800
So again, thank you, much appreciated

775
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,270
and looking forward to the questions.
