1
00:00:00,947 --> 00:00:04,160
- Good afternoon, and thank
you for joining us today.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,540
I hope you are enjoying
your RSA Conference so far.

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,660
My name is Lisa Ashjian,
and I will be your moderator

4
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:12,440
for today's panel discussion

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,629
on building an extended
detection and response

6
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,880
or XDR Architecture Strategy.

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,399
Including why XDR is important,

8
00:00:21,399 --> 00:00:24,819
the considerations for your XDR strategy

9
00:00:24,819 --> 00:00:28,779
and some best practices
on how to get started.

10
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:30,380
And joining me today,

11
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:32,780
are three subject matter experts,

12
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:36,461
each bringing unique perspectives
into the elements of XDR.

13
00:00:36,461 --> 00:00:39,870
And they have come together here,

14
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:41,830
to help you on your journey

15
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:45,570
to building that XDR
architecture strategy.

16
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,220
We have Rakesh Shah,

17
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:51,280
who is the Director of Architecture
for AT&T Cybersecurity.

18
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,460
And his currently leading the development

19
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,960
of AT&T threat detection
and response services.

20
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,080
Next, we have Allison Clelan,

21
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,570
who is the Director of Threat Operations

22
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:04,482
for AT&T Cybersecurity.

23
00:01:04,482 --> 00:01:07,218
And leads multiple
security operations centers

24
00:01:07,218 --> 00:01:10,270
covering numerous security products.

25
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:12,660
And finally, we have Jared Phipps,

26
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:14,560
who's the Senior Vice President

27
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,320
of Solutions Engineering for SentinelOne.

28
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,690
And a veteran of the
United States Air Force,

29
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:21,560
where he worked in cyber defense

30
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,991
and offensive cyber operations.

31
00:01:23,991 --> 00:01:26,000
Welcome, to each one of you.

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,940
And thank you, so much for taking the time

33
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:30,993
to help educate our listeners
on this important topic.

34
00:01:32,386 --> 00:01:36,195
All right, and as we jump
into this discussion today,

35
00:01:36,195 --> 00:01:39,058
please feel free to ask
your questions via chat

36
00:01:39,058 --> 00:01:42,130
and we're here to help
answer those for you.

37
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:42,963
So, with that,

38
00:01:42,963 --> 00:01:46,853
let's kick off right into
our first topic of why XDR.

39
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:50,960
We've all heard about extended detection

40
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,788
and response, or XDR.

41
00:01:52,788 --> 00:01:57,090
The panelists, can you help us
with what is included in XDR,

42
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:00,853
and what can this do to help
businesses security ecosystem?

43
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:05,020
- I'll take that one.

44
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,830
Yeah, XDR is a new hot term.

45
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:10,169
It's very exciting in the industry,

46
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:12,720
and really what it is,
is that it's addressing

47
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,880
two major problems that have

48
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,698
plagued the security
industry for many years.

49
00:02:17,698 --> 00:02:19,877
Number one, alert fatigue.

50
00:02:19,877 --> 00:02:23,370
Just being overwhelmed
with the alerts coming in,

51
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:25,390
analysts not knowing how to manage those

52
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:26,886
and just, you know, frankly

53
00:02:26,886 --> 00:02:29,670
afraid that they're gonna miss something.

54
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:32,649
And then number two, tool overload.

55
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:35,210
Where you know, due to
the kind of explosion

56
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:38,488
in security tools, and
just the threat surface

57
00:02:38,488 --> 00:02:39,880
that's out there,

58
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,930
there's just a lot more tools out there

59
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,210
and that's kind of overwhelming.

60
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:45,660
And XDR is this intent,

61
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:48,647
really intended to try
to fix those two problems

62
00:02:48,647 --> 00:02:51,743
with alert overload and tool overload.

63
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:55,290
- Yeah, I'll tag in with,
with Rakesh on that one.

64
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:56,192
I mean,

65
00:02:56,193 --> 00:02:57,590
coming out of the Air Force

66
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:59,760
we had this methodology defense in depth,

67
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,980
and we kind of used to joke around

68
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:04,250
and really what it was it
was expensive depth, right.

69
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,560
If you look at cybersecurity today,

70
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,116
what I would tell you is
it's largely a data problem.

71
00:03:10,116 --> 00:03:12,530
There's an app for that, right.

72
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:13,970
Like there's a vendor for that.

73
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:17,030
There's a vendor for every
little niche challenge

74
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,320
you have with cybersecurity.

75
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,989
They all wanna generate alerts.

76
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:21,845
Everybody wants to give you alerts.

77
00:03:21,845 --> 00:03:23,754
What we need to move towards

78
00:03:23,754 --> 00:03:26,480
and kind of what we need to transform

79
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,350
as an industry is towards
a data management.

80
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:30,989
And how can we start to scale,

81
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:32,590
how do we automate.

82
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:35,430
XDR is the fundamental architecture

83
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,440
that enables the way
we're going to be able

84
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,440
to do security operations in the future.

85
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:44,210
- Awesome, thank you both
for that perspective.

86
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:46,500
Alert, fatigue, tool overload

87
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,380
and then the ability to scale

88
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,685
all of these different point solutions.

89
00:03:50,685 --> 00:03:53,292
Absolutely, that's the power of XDR.

90
00:03:53,292 --> 00:03:56,408
So, but this concept isn't new, right.

91
00:03:56,408 --> 00:03:58,374
Why is this so important now,

92
00:03:58,374 --> 00:04:00,833
and how is this different than before?

93
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:03,433
- Lisa, I'll try to,

94
00:04:03,433 --> 00:04:04,680
I'll try to answer that one.

95
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,250
I really think the difference now

96
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,290
is the focus on orchestrated response.

97
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,584
And I think Rakesh, and Jared both talked

98
00:04:10,585 --> 00:04:12,410
a little bit about the
evolution over time,

99
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:14,620
and we went from big data gathering

100
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,928
and just try to get all the logs in.

101
00:04:15,928 --> 00:04:17,730
And then we went,

102
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:19,718
then the focus was on making
sense of all of this data

103
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:23,930
and better visualization tools and,

104
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,569
using detections using correlations

105
00:04:26,569 --> 00:04:29,770
to help combat some of
that analyst alert fatigue

106
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,460
that Rakesh mentioned.

107
00:04:31,461 --> 00:04:34,130
This, the focus now is really shifting

108
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:37,460
a little bit towards, that orchestrated

109
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:38,830
and automated response.

110
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:41,490
And that helps us reduce
the time to respond,

111
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:42,680
and minimize damage.

112
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,980
We see that passing investigations

113
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,740
between teams takes too long,

114
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:49,178
we loose the contacts,
the urgency is lost,

115
00:04:49,178 --> 00:04:51,240
we might reenter accidentally

116
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,290
or inadvertently re-introduced another

117
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:54,550
vulnerabilities later.

118
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:57,310
And I just think companies
too many times have this

119
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:59,870
be impacted by the same malicious activity

120
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:03,133
repeatedly due to delayed
or poor response action.

121
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:06,919
- Yeah, and then kind of building on

122
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:09,060
what Allison is describing.

123
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,800
I think it's really interesting

124
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,050
if you look at one change

125
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:16,060
that's been very dramatic
the last 10 years or so.

126
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,537
And I think why XDR is
more important than,

127
00:05:18,537 --> 00:05:20,200
than ever is, you know,

128
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,740
the explosion of cloud, right.

129
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:25,160
Digital transformation,
infrastructure as a service,

130
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,380
software as a service.

131
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:30,185
You know, the threat
landscape has expanded

132
00:05:30,185 --> 00:05:32,760
pretty significantly because of that.

133
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,039
And so, some of those
operational challenges

134
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,565
as Allison mentioned,

135
00:05:36,565 --> 00:05:40,219
were there before and
now they're exacerbated

136
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,961
because the threat can come from anywhere.

137
00:05:41,961 --> 00:05:44,350
And so, it's even more
important now to be able

138
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:46,121
to have that visibility,

139
00:05:46,121 --> 00:05:47,717
and to be able to do something about that

140
00:05:47,717 --> 00:05:51,450
because that is just
exploding and it makes sense

141
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:53,983
given that cloud is kind of the new thing.

142
00:05:56,237 --> 00:05:58,190
- Yeah, definitely.

143
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:01,272
So, you know, being able to
have a orchestrated response

144
00:06:01,272 --> 00:06:04,840
and really reducing the time to respond,

145
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,645
in the ever complicating,

146
00:06:06,646 --> 00:06:08,804
more complicating way that we're

147
00:06:08,804 --> 00:06:12,330
transforming with cloud
and other digital means.

148
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,947
So, absolutely I agree with you there.

149
00:06:14,947 --> 00:06:19,330
But, part of the promise from XDR is this

150
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:22,820
automated response in machine
learning capabilities.

151
00:06:22,821 --> 00:06:26,200
How could this machine
learning help a business

152
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,082
improve their security posture?

153
00:06:29,148 --> 00:06:31,130
- Oh, well, I'd love to answer that.

154
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:32,680
And I think,

155
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,080
there's a lot to that
question to delve into.

156
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,280
So, I said earlier that,

157
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:40,300
I think cybersecurity is a data problem.

158
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,990
And let me reiterate this, right it's,

159
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:43,757
we talk about alert fatigue.

160
00:06:43,757 --> 00:06:47,820
But when we start to get
into the EDR and the NDR,

161
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:51,210
and now extend the data
response, the XDR world,

162
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:53,190
really what we're talking about,

163
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,880
and a lot of people I
assume we are talking about

164
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,540
is data capture.

165
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,640
So, if I can capture
events and capture data

166
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,960
from all these different places,

167
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,818
then I have an XDR solution.

168
00:07:01,819 --> 00:07:05,662
Capturing data does not mean
you're understanding data.

169
00:07:05,662 --> 00:07:08,734
For example, I can tell
you from the SentinelOne

170
00:07:08,734 --> 00:07:10,640
installations that we have globally.

171
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,969
73% of the time that we make a detection,

172
00:07:12,969 --> 00:07:16,409
there is no known record

173
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:19,705
of that artifact in a
reputation intelligence service.

174
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:22,490
And if I drill into that a little bit

175
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:24,270
and I go into like documents, PDFs

176
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:27,676
where we get into specific
file types, 96% of the time

177
00:07:27,676 --> 00:07:30,268
that we make a detection we
say that those are malicious.

178
00:07:30,268 --> 00:07:32,229
There is no record whatsoever

179
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:35,600
of those existing in a
reputation, intelligence service.

180
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,080
So, just collecting data,

181
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,868
and then being able to come
back and query that data,

182
00:07:39,868 --> 00:07:42,790
that's not an intelligent
way to do operations.

183
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:44,230
That's actually a very legacy way.

184
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,070
And then what we wind up with is,

185
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:48,210
trying to lean on threat intelligence

186
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:51,128
to go hunt and understand,
what happened in the past.

187
00:07:51,128 --> 00:07:56,020
What XDR is gonna give us, is
the option to understand data.

188
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:58,108
Use AI, using machine learning

189
00:07:58,108 --> 00:08:01,220
because decisions need to
be made in the milliseconds.

190
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,053
And that's the reality.

191
00:08:02,053 --> 00:08:04,670
The prevention decisions need
to be made in milliseconds,

192
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:07,460
they need to be made by machines

193
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:10,794
that can then kick off automated
and orchestrated responses.

194
00:08:10,794 --> 00:08:12,810
And that's what we've been pioneering here

195
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:14,330
for the last several years.

196
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:16,599
And one of the reasons I'm so
excited about what we're doing

197
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,100
'cause I've lived in
that cybersecurity world,

198
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,200
like I've done that grind of alerts.

199
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,250
And then I get my (murmurs) notifications,

200
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,510
I get my NSA notifications,

201
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:27,170
I've gotta go run queries and come back

202
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:29,630
and it's just overwhelming,
it's time blogging.

203
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:31,270
When you're coming up with a,

204
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:34,590
with a different solution
that says, we're gonna use AI,

205
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:35,669
we're gonna use machine learning,

206
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:37,849
we're gonna respond to these
things in milliseconds,

207
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,842
we're going to natively
make everything intelligent,

208
00:08:40,842 --> 00:08:42,780
it's completely transformational.

209
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:46,953
It's, I literally think XDR
will be an inflection point

210
00:08:46,953 --> 00:08:48,553
for the cybersecurity industry as a whole.

211
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:52,393
- Absolutely, that's powerful.

212
00:08:53,328 --> 00:08:55,713
Anything else to add for the panelists?

213
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,620
- Sure, I would just add,

214
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,657
I would just put some of the things

215
00:08:59,657 --> 00:09:01,050
that Jared mentioned there.

216
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:02,900
I do think that malicious activity

217
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,709
is lots and lots about IoCs.

218
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,310
It's less (murmurs)

219
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:08,891
It can be combinations of
seemingly benign activities.

220
00:09:08,892 --> 00:09:10,795
I think the advancement of user

221
00:09:10,795 --> 00:09:13,319
behavioral analytics and machine learning

222
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,070
really assist analyst in
pivoting through data sources,

223
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:17,721
based on techniques or TPPs,

224
00:09:17,721 --> 00:09:19,980
and the adversary attack life cycle.

225
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,440
It really helps the analyst
better discern between,

226
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,960
what I would consider explained,

227
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,540
or what I would call I
guess, explained anomaly

228
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:30,588
and actually, and higher
competence malicious activity.

229
00:09:30,588 --> 00:09:33,370
So, I do think that those
are gonna be really valuable

230
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:35,953
and there's point in
getting time to respond.

231
00:09:37,511 --> 00:09:39,516
- Yes, yeah, definitely helping.

232
00:09:39,516 --> 00:09:43,046
Wow, that's some very
powerful points there.

233
00:09:43,047 --> 00:09:45,310
Going beyond the data capture,

234
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:47,609
being able to respond quickly.

235
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:52,610
Wow, 73% of threats were unknown,

236
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,350
and 96 were malicious of those, wow.

237
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:57,970
That's pretty powerful,

238
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,817
and certainly you see the need for

239
00:09:59,817 --> 00:10:04,117
that automated response and
machine learning capabilities.

240
00:10:04,117 --> 00:10:06,122
And so, really appreciate

241
00:10:06,123 --> 00:10:09,043
everybody's feedback there.

242
00:10:10,285 --> 00:10:13,130
Let's go ahead and switch gears

243
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:17,800
into the considerations needed
for building an XDR strategy.

244
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,834
So, let's talk about that
in a little more depth.

245
00:10:19,834 --> 00:10:21,786
So my first question is,

246
00:10:21,786 --> 00:10:26,786
can you guys help describe what
I hear called the ground up,

247
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:32,250
or versus a top down
approach to addressing XDR?

248
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:35,040
And how are they different,

249
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,240
and how will that play a
role in a business's approach

250
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,563
to their XDR architecture strategy?

251
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:45,700
- Yeah, you know, I really
love hearing that approach.

252
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,790
And I think as you're considering

253
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:50,208
building out your XDR architecture.

254
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:52,360
The first thing to look at is look,

255
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,710
the same has been the
de facto pane of glass

256
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:59,220
for security operations
for 20 plus years, right.

257
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,560
And start with the assets
that you have, right.

258
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,760
And most enterprises have a SIM

259
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,723
or some capability to do
that level of monitoring.

260
00:11:06,723 --> 00:11:08,609
And I think that's kind of the top down

261
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:09,970
as you start there and you go,

262
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:11,280
what data am I collecting.

263
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,930
I think kind of building, as Jared said,

264
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:16,380
you know, that
understanding the data first

265
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,260
and kind of getting that visibility.

266
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,910
And then in parallel,

267
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:22,640
what we've seen in the last,
you know, five, 10 years

268
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,490
is that EDR has kind of emerged as

269
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:26,770
that second pane of glass if you will.

270
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:29,287
Where folks are looking
for that to go well,

271
00:11:29,287 --> 00:11:30,890
"Hey, I'm detecting threats here

272
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,910
for a lot of my hunting or investigations.

273
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:36,415
I'm leveraging the forensics
in my EDR solution."

274
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:39,720
So, they're kind of peanut
butter and jelly, right.

275
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,790
One's coming from the top down.

276
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,339
The other, one's kind of
coming from the bottom up.

277
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:46,946
And I think that as you
look at your architecture,

278
00:11:46,946 --> 00:11:50,340
start thinking about how those
pieces are coming together.

279
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:54,310
And I give an example, I
talked to a Fortune 500 CISO,

280
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:57,030
a couple of you know,
maybe a year or two ago.

281
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,430
And they were going through a spreadsheet

282
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:00,339
with all their different solutions.

283
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:03,100
It was like 70 or 80 different vendors,

284
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:03,933
that they have deployed.

285
00:12:03,933 --> 00:12:06,210
And they're like, "I just
can't figure this out,

286
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:07,350
I don't know where to go."

287
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:09,090
And so, I think as
you're thinking about XDR

288
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:11,110
you've got your
spreadsheet in front of you

289
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:13,000
with all your different solutions.

290
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,680
Maybe, start with the SIM,

291
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,329
look at the EDR that you have

292
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:18,780
and kind of make that your
foundation and think about

293
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,233
how those can come together.

294
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:23,689
- Yeah, to tag on Rakesh saying like,

295
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:25,381
if I was looking at architecting out

296
00:12:25,381 --> 00:12:27,949
like just saying back at my
former role in the Air Force,

297
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:30,440
and I'm looking at
architecting out a solution.

298
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:35,230
I'm gonna start with complexity,

299
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:37,360
being a number one issue
that I wanna resolve

300
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,220
and get out of the way.

301
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,962
And number two is, I'm
looking for context.

302
00:12:40,962 --> 00:12:43,420
Because I already know
that I'm gonna have data.

303
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,938
Data is gonna be everywhere.

304
00:12:44,938 --> 00:12:47,451
Why, and I see a lot of organizations

305
00:12:47,451 --> 00:12:50,150
starting their XDR strategy now

306
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:52,140
by focusing on the endpoint,

307
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,689
and that's because that's the last line.

308
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:56,020
Like that's where everything
happens. (Jared chuckles)

309
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,060
That's what gets attacked,

310
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,089
that's where the data gets taken from.

311
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:01,620
The endpoints servers,
everything of this nature,

312
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,350
it's where compute happens.

313
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:05,883
If you think about it in terms of context,

314
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,710
I heard, when I was in the Air Force,

315
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:12,320
in the SOC we had 32
analysts on shift 24 seven.

316
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,220
If and this is 10 plus years ago.

317
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,270
So, it's not this way anymore.

318
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:19,002
But I still see this type of a mentality

319
00:13:19,003 --> 00:13:20,960
as I go through corporate America,

320
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,699
where if an analyst is
going to look at an alert,

321
00:13:23,699 --> 00:13:25,625
they're gonna pull it out of the SIM.

322
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:28,280
There might be one or two recommendations

323
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,770
by the SIM from another product,

324
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:32,189
but they check out that alert

325
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:34,050
and they start to investigate that alert.

326
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:34,949
Three rows down,

327
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:36,730
someone else's checking
out a different alert,

328
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:37,770
investigating another alert.

329
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:40,500
There's no context or whether
it's not the same event.

330
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,910
Now, let's do an analogy
to a crime scene, right.

331
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:44,480
If you have a crime scene, does

332
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,017
does an investigator walk in and say,

333
00:13:46,017 --> 00:13:48,460
"I'm with FBI." and then
they do their investigation

334
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,460
in a silo, and then somebody else walks in

335
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,760
from the Sheriff's office, and
they do their investigation.

336
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,270
Like, no investigations get shared, right.

337
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:57,000
And information gets shared.

338
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,120
The crime scene has as orders
and processes that go with it.

339
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,447
So, the value of what I wanna
architect and build from,

340
00:14:03,447 --> 00:14:07,129
is how do I get context around the data,

341
00:14:07,129 --> 00:14:10,070
and then how do I simplify the approach

342
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:12,120
for the investigators that use that data?

343
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,336
- Awesome, yeah, that's wow.

344
00:14:19,336 --> 00:14:22,500
Both good, good responses there.

345
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,820
So, just bringing the technology together,

346
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:28,186
coming together being
able to make it simple.

347
00:14:28,186 --> 00:14:31,470
And I love the crime scene analogy.

348
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:34,879
That's, that's too true
with the situations

349
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:39,090
that our SOC team face when
they're analyzing those threats.

350
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:42,133
So, I appreciate
everybody's feedback there.

351
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:48,400
So, now let's jump to
the next question here.

352
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,300
When it comes to considerations

353
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,500
for that architectural strategy.

354
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,950
And that is that,

355
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:57,530
what are the challenges business face

356
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,501
with threat detection and response,

357
00:14:59,501 --> 00:15:02,521
and how does a business
determine the gaps they have

358
00:15:02,522 --> 00:15:04,460
with their current threat detection

359
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,183
and response architectures?

360
00:15:07,241 --> 00:15:09,189
- Yeah, this is a big one, right.

361
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:11,130
It's, there's like so many dimensions

362
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:12,340
you can approach it from, right.

363
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,500
There's the technology perspective,

364
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,400
which we've talked a bit about.

365
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,420
There's looking at your people

366
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,530
and you know, what resources you have.

367
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:22,410
There's also looking at
your processes, right.

368
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:25,737
The kind of triad of people,

369
00:15:25,737 --> 00:15:28,180
process, and technology.

370
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,189
And you can start there.

371
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:31,210
I mean, I take a simpler approach

372
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:32,760
and maybe I'm too simple as like,

373
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,100
look at where the threat
actor is coming from.

374
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,872
If you've done red team exercises,

375
00:15:36,872 --> 00:15:38,670
if you have an understanding of,

376
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:41,500
you know, where they're
taking advantage of.

377
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,750
Kind of the threat surface area,

378
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,094
which as we've talked about is expanding.

379
00:15:45,094 --> 00:15:48,250
That's where you can look for those gaps.

380
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,275
And so, I think, you
know, using the prism of

381
00:15:50,275 --> 00:15:53,350
people process technology,

382
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:54,740
I think you have to start there

383
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:57,550
'cause the gaps can be addressed
in all three dimensions.

384
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:58,969
But then, you know, do some real,

385
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:00,440
you know, red team exercises.

386
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:03,040
Figure out you know, what
the threat actor might do

387
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,099
or is doing, and use that

388
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,900
to kind of determine your prioritization,

389
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,363
because it's a lot to take on all at once.

390
00:16:10,226 --> 00:16:12,210
- And I would say in combination

391
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:14,670
with understanding the
threat, and the attackers

392
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:16,750
TTPs and frame of mind,

393
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,770
you really have to have a good
knowledge of your network.

394
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,220
What is, what's your key terrain,

395
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,640
what are you trying to protect and how,

396
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,540
and the attack surface as Rakesh,

397
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,860
mentioned is ever changing.

398
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,977
So, you can't just do this
once and forget about it.

399
00:16:27,977 --> 00:16:32,209
There are gonna be vulnerabilities
that exist over time,

400
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:33,820
but that weren't accounted for.

401
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:36,030
And I think coupling this
with your business objectives

402
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,771
and then any compliance requirements,

403
00:16:37,771 --> 00:16:41,048
those three components will
yield a fairly extensive

404
00:16:41,048 --> 00:16:43,433
and complete product analysis.

405
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,459
- Awesome, great points.

406
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,660
Aligning with those business objectives,

407
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,281
that's extremely important.

408
00:16:51,281 --> 00:16:55,493
And those red team exercises
to help identify the gaps,

409
00:16:55,494 --> 00:16:57,750
great suggestion, Rakesh.

410
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,265
And then not forgetting
about the network elements

411
00:17:00,265 --> 00:17:03,380
and that digital transformation
that our businesses

412
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:06,980
are undergoing and taking
that into consideration.

413
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:09,700
So, really appreciate that insight.

414
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:12,240
So, the next question is,

415
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,204
what are some of the
pitfalls and challenges,

416
00:17:15,204 --> 00:17:19,302
as a business works to
pursue an XDR strategy?

417
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:22,630
- I'll start with that one.

418
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:24,588
'Cause I do help companies all the time,

419
00:17:24,588 --> 00:17:26,780
as they start to develop
out their XDR strategy

420
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,305
and the thought process.

421
00:17:28,305 --> 00:17:30,170
I think one of the things to consider,

422
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:32,440
is you need to start with the end in mind.

423
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,320
When you're thinking of your strategy,

424
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,945
do you want to have technology
that empowers people,

425
00:17:37,945 --> 00:17:40,530
or do you wanna build a program

426
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:43,940
that's people using tech to get results.

427
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:46,394
And figure which one of
those two skills, right.

428
00:17:46,394 --> 00:17:48,880
So, if you want a scalable solution

429
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,230
and you're looking for solutions

430
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:52,010
where technology empowers people.

431
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:54,609
Automation, AI, machine learning,

432
00:17:54,609 --> 00:17:56,740
you know, pull in vendors that have

433
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,675
that class of capability.

434
00:17:58,675 --> 00:18:01,800
From there, then there's other two things

435
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,909
that I would say that,

436
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:03,990
that is a concern.

437
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:07,537
Number one, is just vendor
fatigue, tool set fatigue.

438
00:18:07,537 --> 00:18:10,740
Is not just the expense of buying them,

439
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,490
you've got to train on them,

440
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:13,660
you have to sustain them.

441
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:16,110
Even if they're in the
cloud (chuckles) right.

442
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:18,469
That just gets to be a fatigue over time,

443
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:21,090
especially when you're dealing
with 70 plus solutions.

444
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:23,713
It gets exhausting, frankly
having run that wars.

445
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:27,450
The the other caution I would give about

446
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:29,080
is a vendor lock-in, right.

447
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:33,793
So, to get away from that
fatigue of too many solutions,

448
00:18:33,793 --> 00:18:37,129
the opposite swing of that pendulum is,

449
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:38,840
I'm gonna pick vendor
a, I'm just gonna buy

450
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,970
everything that vendor ecosystem has.

451
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:42,770
Like that's the easy button, right,

452
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:44,527
'cause it checks all the boxes.

453
00:18:44,527 --> 00:18:47,330
The problem with that is

454
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:50,141
that you are now limited
by that vendor ecosystem.

455
00:18:50,142 --> 00:18:53,694
Is the entire ecosystem
tech powering people?

456
00:18:53,694 --> 00:18:55,840
Probably not, is probably tech,

457
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,879
and they're expecting you to
instrument it and implement it.

458
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,380
Furthermore, if you're gonna have a bypass

459
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:04,430
or someone figures out a
way to bypass product a,

460
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:07,490
is probably gonna bypass pretty
much the entire ecosystem.

461
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:09,570
So, you've put all your
eggs in one basket.

462
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:11,693
I think the promise of XDR is actually

463
00:19:11,693 --> 00:19:14,980
simplifying and making a much easier way,

464
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:17,123
to use multiple vendors in your ecosystem.

465
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:20,729
- That's a great point, Jared.

466
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:23,190
And I think that it gets back to being,

467
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:25,220
now look what, a lot of
us are technologists,

468
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:27,640
we geek out on what vendors are doing

469
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,440
and what the next new hot thing is,

470
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,660
and talk AI and ML.

471
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:34,170
But you know, you do have
to be business smart, right.

472
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:36,480
I think as Jared said, you know, that's,

473
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,640
you know, wearing that
other hat and just thinking

474
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,050
that through and look
security has a pendulum,

475
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:42,110
it's gonna go back and forth, right.

476
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:45,169
There'll be best (indistinct)
is the new thing.

477
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:48,040
Then it's gonna be, you know
consolidated security stack.

478
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,509
That's the easy button and,

479
00:19:49,509 --> 00:19:51,540
you know, that's gonna change over time.

480
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:52,680
And so, I think, you know,

481
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,720
be business smart and then,

482
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,420
you make sure you've got that hat on,

483
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:58,370
so that when you're
talking to your colleagues

484
00:19:58,370 --> 00:19:59,840
who don't understand the technology

485
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,673
and don't geek out on that,

486
00:20:00,673 --> 00:20:03,030
you know, you really have that nailed

487
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:05,410
and make sure you're
not falling into traps

488
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:06,410
like vendor lock-in.

489
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:10,512
- Yeah, great points, both of you.

490
00:20:10,512 --> 00:20:13,340
And I think Rakesh, being business smart

491
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:16,730
goes back to what Allison
mentioned earlier about,

492
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:20,523
aligning your XDR strategy
to your business objectives.

493
00:20:20,523 --> 00:20:23,459
So, spot on there and then

494
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,740
Jared, the, you know,

495
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:28,516
diversify yet simplify kind of message

496
00:20:28,516 --> 00:20:31,360
is very important when it comes

497
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,439
to building that XDR strategy.

498
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,247
So, let's jump into
the next question here.

499
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:40,514
What elements should go into developing

500
00:20:40,514 --> 00:20:44,290
the internal architecture
and purchasing policies

501
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:47,072
for the businesses XDR strategy?

502
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,750
- Yeah, and I think this,

503
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,290
you know, I'll say it
again, be business smart.

504
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:55,129
Again, because you really
wanna understand, you know,

505
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:57,727
what are the business
drivers and you know, what,

506
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:59,507
and then drive that to outcomes, right.

507
00:20:59,507 --> 00:21:01,420
You know, looking at threats,

508
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,640
looking at the network,
looking at the environment

509
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,410
and then figuring out how that impacts

510
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:07,283
not only your internal architecture,

511
00:21:07,283 --> 00:21:10,129
but how that impacts the business.

512
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:13,300
And so, it's almost like
the easier way to look at it

513
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,020
and it's not the easy button is go,

514
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:18,400
what are my security and
business outcomes, right.

515
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,597
What am I trying to drive,

516
00:21:19,597 --> 00:21:21,858
and then work back from there

517
00:21:21,858 --> 00:21:24,740
to look at the threat actors in the TTPs,

518
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,850
and in your network as we've talked about,

519
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:29,127
and kind of go in that dimension.

520
00:21:29,127 --> 00:21:31,590
Because I think if you
start with technology,

521
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,129
if you start with like this,

522
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:35,422
it's, it's gonna lead you
to a lot of different paths.

523
00:21:35,422 --> 00:21:37,840
And, you know, you may
just get lost in this,

524
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,790
the alphabet soup.

525
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:39,623
But if you start with

526
00:21:39,623 --> 00:21:41,800
what are you trying to
solve from a security,

527
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,340
and business outcomes perspective

528
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:45,110
and then follow it from there,

529
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:46,882
it'll make your life a lot easier.

530
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:50,510
- Yeah, the one recommendation
I would add to that is

531
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:52,081
on the business outcomes,

532
00:21:52,081 --> 00:21:55,414
for whatever reason, and I
get in the cybersecurity,

533
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:56,629
this is probably where we start here.

534
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:58,570
But for whatever reason,

535
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:00,439
the emphasis when people are architecting

536
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,920
and designing is upfront is always around

537
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,655
the investigation and the
detection capabilities.

538
00:22:05,655 --> 00:22:08,500
There's two elements that I
think often get overlooked.

539
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,830
Number one, is prevention.

540
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:12,270
It's no, I think we've had this mentality

541
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:13,570
of assume compromised,

542
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:16,480
and that's a great to have
that paranoia mindset.

543
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,430
But there's nowhere in assumed compromise

544
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:21,304
that means you have to assume
a defeat is (indistinct).

545
00:22:21,304 --> 00:22:24,560
Go after technologies
that are going to prevent

546
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,270
and block as much as possible,

547
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:29,090
because you want to investigate
as little as possible.

548
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:32,370
And that final step is really
focused on business outcome

549
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:34,810
which is business resilience
and business continuity.

550
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:37,010
You wanna be online, right.

551
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:39,730
You do not want your
business taken offline.

552
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:42,300
So, how do you recover from attacks?

553
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:46,040
If you're in an XDR world
and you can orchestrate

554
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:49,260
the detections, you can
orchestrate the investigations,

555
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,750
can you orchestrate the recovery?

556
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:53,590
What does that look like,
how long does that take?

557
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:55,000
If you can't go from

558
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,471
detection to recovery in under 10 minutes,

559
00:22:57,471 --> 00:23:00,633
keep looking because there's
people that can get you there.

560
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:04,379
- Great, yeah.

561
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,450
That's a very good insight.

562
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:09,670
Thank you to Rakesh and Jared, both.

563
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:12,512
Driving business outcomes,
absolutely imperative

564
00:23:12,512 --> 00:23:16,236
and aligning to those business outcomes.

565
00:23:16,237 --> 00:23:19,410
The, being proactive, Jared

566
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:21,770
the way you're describing
it with prevention.

567
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:23,580
And then definitely,

568
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:27,298
the focus of being resilient
in business continuity,

569
00:23:27,298 --> 00:23:30,633
so important in today's environment.

570
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:36,060
Okay, so, let's move along
to our next question here.

571
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:39,159
As we continue to consider the elements

572
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,320
of building our XDR strategy.

573
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:44,010
And that is, how would a business go

574
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:47,600
about analyzing internal staff skill sets,

575
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,159
determine what additional
skillsets are needed

576
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:53,950
to manage in-house versus when
a business should consider

577
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:57,093
an MSSP to manage an XDR solution.

578
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,630
- Lisa, I love that you
asked this question.

579
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:02,750
We've been talking to the
past 30 minutes or so,

580
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,750
about automating and orchestration.

581
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,900
And ultimately you just can't completely

582
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,560
remove the humans from this equation.

583
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,610
You're always going to need a staff.

584
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:14,590
And the talent shortage
in this space is real.

585
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:19,290
So, it's gonna come down
to an organization cost,

586
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:20,629
and risk appetite.

587
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:23,050
But there are several,
several I guess phases

588
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:24,620
that you could go through to help you

589
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:25,699
make that determination.

590
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,734
I know for us internally,

591
00:24:27,734 --> 00:24:30,899
we started with it,
with a talent assessment

592
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,543
and we took a skill
inventory of all of the,

593
00:24:33,543 --> 00:24:36,040
folks in our organization.

594
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,480
We created what almost
looks like baseball cards

595
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,400
that include any skills
they currently have,

596
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,039
any of their interests and hobbies.

597
00:24:42,039 --> 00:24:44,843
We were, we did this
in order to try to find

598
00:24:44,843 --> 00:24:48,100
pipeline and development
paths for some of these folks.

599
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,719
But also to find these hidden skills,

600
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,040
did we, were there some

601
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,090
skills that we had on the team

602
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:54,629
that we weren't taking full advantage of.

603
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:56,500
Were we optimizing the use of the talent

604
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,100
that we already had,

605
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,488
did we have some folks that
were scripted on the side

606
00:25:00,489 --> 00:25:01,660
that could have helped us

607
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,320
with some of our dev ops and automation,

608
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,139
did we have folks that
were prior auditors,

609
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:07,580
that really understood the
compliance requirements

610
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:09,530
that could help some of our customers in,

611
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:11,924
in places that we hadn't
thought about applying them to?

612
00:25:11,924 --> 00:25:14,843
So, that really helped us with

613
00:25:14,843 --> 00:25:17,868
determining if we had any
extra bandwidth on the team,

614
00:25:17,868 --> 00:25:21,312
and if we were appropriately optimized.

615
00:25:21,313 --> 00:25:25,627
And I think to some of the
points we talked about earlier,

616
00:25:25,627 --> 00:25:28,430
it helps us also with the burnout factor.

617
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:31,515
I mean, we can't expect a lot
of our teams to stay in these

618
00:25:31,515 --> 00:25:34,108
SOC analysts, or tier
one to year after year.

619
00:25:34,108 --> 00:25:36,042
That's, it's just not likely that,

620
00:25:36,042 --> 00:25:39,024
we're gonna be in a constant
state of retraining,

621
00:25:39,024 --> 00:25:42,120
and retaining talent,

622
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,989
if we don't have a great
development pipeline

623
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:45,382
for these folks.

624
00:25:45,382 --> 00:25:47,530
So, ultimately it's a challenge for,

625
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:49,300
of a lot of our customers including us

626
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,139
making these decisions about when to,

627
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:55,023
when to in source and
outsource some of this work.

628
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:58,340
- Yeah, I think I
mentioned something earlier

629
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:00,595
where you have to have
technology that skills people,

630
00:26:00,595 --> 00:26:01,990
technology that empowers people, right.

631
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:03,309
And I think that,

632
00:26:03,309 --> 00:26:05,711
what I've seen as a major trend

633
00:26:05,711 --> 00:26:07,827
over the last several years.

634
00:26:07,827 --> 00:26:10,404
This organizations of all sizes,

635
00:26:10,404 --> 00:26:12,738
the biggest in the world
down to the smallest,

636
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:16,228
everybody now is leaning into MSSPs

637
00:26:16,228 --> 00:26:18,220
with different strategies.

638
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,800
Some of the larger organizations,

639
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,385
they want to be able to offload
tier one responsibilities

640
00:26:22,385 --> 00:26:27,300
which helps them retain the
highly talented security staff

641
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:30,520
and manage the complex
architecture and investigations

642
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,850
that those individuals are hired to do.

643
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:36,031
In other cases, they want
to be able to flex and have,

644
00:26:36,031 --> 00:26:39,665
I would say, overflow into MSSP teams,

645
00:26:39,665 --> 00:26:41,870
assistance on expert investigations

646
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:42,810
and things of that nature.

647
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:45,879
So, those skill sets
are very complimentary.

648
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,467
And I think that if you
are looking in this world,

649
00:26:48,467 --> 00:26:50,350
like you'll see a lot of product vendors

650
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:52,264
are adding in those types
of services as well.

651
00:26:52,265 --> 00:26:54,500
So, the notion today that

652
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,701
you buy a product and you
drop it in front of your team,

653
00:26:56,701 --> 00:26:58,110
and you're good.

654
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:59,000
I think you're starting to see

655
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,979
the partnerships go everywhere, right.

656
00:27:00,979 --> 00:27:03,270
And so, I mean, if you look at the

657
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:05,070
really really good MSSPs in the world,

658
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:06,500
like we're talking to now,

659
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,220
they have figured out
how you use technology

660
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:11,500
to scale people, how to attract

661
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,445
and train the right talent
to retain that talent.

662
00:27:13,445 --> 00:27:17,610
And that lets them do
things like sign SLAs,

663
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:19,159
and pre-commit to things

664
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:22,650
that larger complex organizations
simply need to have.

665
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:24,620
So, that's really the benefit I see.

666
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:26,439
And then I do have a lot of conversations,

667
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,645
with a lot of CISOs globally right now.

668
00:27:28,645 --> 00:27:30,430
Everybody's talking about this,

669
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:33,643
everybody is figuring out
what their strategy here is.

670
00:27:34,974 --> 00:27:36,877
- Lots of things to consider.

671
00:27:36,877 --> 00:27:40,649
I really appreciate both
tech, gen power, people,

672
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:42,790
Jared, absolutely necessary.

673
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:46,980
And considering those
SLA, it's very important.

674
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:49,900
And then Allison, I love
your baseball card analogy.

675
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,677
That's very smart to go

676
00:27:51,677 --> 00:27:55,632
and look for those hidden
skillsets amongst your team.

677
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:01,020
And then an important
consideration with the human factor

678
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:03,682
is that cost and risk appetite,

679
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:05,827
and then the burnout factor for

680
00:28:05,827 --> 00:28:09,010
those security analysts.

681
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:14,010
So, I appreciate everybody's
perspective there, thank you.

682
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:17,470
So, let's switch gears to our final topic,

683
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:22,470
which is helping our listeners
here with how to get started.

684
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:24,490
So, how would someone get started,

685
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:29,130
especially if XDR is new
to our listeners here?

686
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:33,592
What type of evaluation
and testing would be needed

687
00:28:33,592 --> 00:28:36,693
to be able to implement a strategy?

688
00:28:38,294 --> 00:28:40,380
- Yeah, I mean, I'd say as you know,

689
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,590
we've been all saying,

690
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:44,961
really it's, don't jump into
the technology deep end.

691
00:28:44,961 --> 00:28:48,250
It's really easy and tempting to do that.

692
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:49,770
And you know, I personally have worked for

693
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:52,639
multiple security
companies for many years.

694
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,457
I love talking to security
practitioners about

695
00:28:55,457 --> 00:28:57,870
technology and you usually

696
00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:59,669
are talking about products, right.

697
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:02,140
And it's just tempting
to go down that path.

698
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:06,010
Take a step back and look
at security outcomes, right.

699
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:08,730
If you're implementing GDPR,

700
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:10,750
or the California Protection Data Act,

701
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:13,347
if you're going down
those, and you're saying

702
00:29:13,347 --> 00:29:16,557
"That's something I have
to implement in 2021."

703
00:29:16,557 --> 00:29:19,350
And that's a security outcome
that you're driving to,

704
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:20,570
then what are the people,

705
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:23,800
the process and the
technology to get you there.

706
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,307
And your KPIs will hopefully be driven by

707
00:29:26,307 --> 00:29:28,750
what your security outcomes are.

708
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:31,391
And then I think XDR,
you'll find the technology

709
00:29:31,391 --> 00:29:33,450
will fit into that, right.

710
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:34,970
For all the reasons we've talked about,

711
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:37,240
you need to have your team ready to,

712
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,836
you know, address those
threats and not be overloaded,

713
00:29:39,836 --> 00:29:43,190
you need to have, you know
too many tools out there

714
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:45,030
and too much overwhelming data.

715
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:46,080
So, I think that, you know,

716
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,240
you start with the security outcomes.

717
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,680
What are you trying to drive,

718
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,633
and then from there you,
technology will follow.

719
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:58,170
- Yeah, and I think,

720
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:00,063
you know, if I could, if
I could jump into that,

721
00:30:00,063 --> 00:30:03,040
I think something Rakesh said
I think is really important is

722
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,456
he said the word outcomes.

723
00:30:04,457 --> 00:30:06,939
"Start with the outcomes in mind."

724
00:30:06,939 --> 00:30:10,410
There's no one size fits
all, there's, you know,

725
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:12,900
we are gonna say what's
your company's risk profile,

726
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:16,190
what is your company's desire
for business continuity,

727
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:17,577
business operations.

728
00:30:17,577 --> 00:30:19,800
If you start with the outcome in mind

729
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,480
then you can start picking
the right partners.

730
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,870
When it comes to the vendor side,

731
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:25,276
everybody sounds very similar this day.

732
00:30:25,277 --> 00:30:26,750
And they always have in this space.

733
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:28,960
I've sat 10 years on the buying side,

734
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,650
I've sat 10 years on
the on the vendor side.

735
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:34,362
When it's successful, both parties,

736
00:30:34,362 --> 00:30:37,740
the buyer, the seller, both parties

737
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:39,480
are really working together.

738
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:42,050
So, is there a culture fit
between you and the vendors?

739
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:43,320
Something a lot of people don't really

740
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,689
think about and look about,
they get into tech and price,

741
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:47,200
but you know,

742
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,610
if it's the middle of the
night and you wake someone up

743
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:50,780
is that person gonna wake up,

744
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:51,850
or are they gonna be there for you?

745
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,360
That, those little things do matter a lot.

746
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,729
And you know, extend out your ecosystem

747
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:58,469
of trusted partners and advisors.

748
00:30:58,469 --> 00:31:01,540
And one of the great things
about MSSPs for example,

749
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:04,268
is they don't just touch a
lot of different technologies.

750
00:31:04,268 --> 00:31:07,259
They can use them, firsthand at scale.

751
00:31:07,259 --> 00:31:10,070
You can reach out to them for advice.

752
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:12,179
Where should I look out
for this technology,

753
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:14,165
tell me two or three
that you would recommend.

754
00:31:14,165 --> 00:31:15,720
What pitfalls did you run into

755
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,796
when you we're implementing
project in your organization?

756
00:31:18,796 --> 00:31:20,650
They can provide those insights,

757
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:22,020
they can provide those lessons learned

758
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:23,773
and it is absolutely valuable.

759
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:28,240
- Awesome, okay.

760
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,100
Well, I really appreciate
everybody's input here.

761
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,939
So, I just wanna see if
there's any final thoughts

762
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:38,463
from the group before we close out.

763
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:44,720
Okay, well, thank you so much everyone

764
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,620
for your time and attention today.

765
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,590
And we are here to continue

766
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:50,712
to answer your questions via chat.

767
00:31:50,712 --> 00:31:52,748
And we all hope that you continue

768
00:31:52,748 --> 00:31:55,790
to enjoy your RSA Conference experience.

769
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:56,870
Thank you, so much.

770
00:31:58,350 --> 00:31:59,327
- Thank you, so much.

771
00:31:59,327 --> 00:32:00,160
- Thank you.

772
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,660
- Thank you, too.
