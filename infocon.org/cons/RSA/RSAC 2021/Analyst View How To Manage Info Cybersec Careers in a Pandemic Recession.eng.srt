1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:02,990
- Hi, this is David Foote
from Foote Partners.

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:06,380
I'm chief analyst, and
welcome to my session.

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:09,490
It's an analyst view on
how to manage careers

4
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:10,810
in a pandemic recession.

5
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:12,410
They didn't give me enough space

6
00:00:14,487 --> 00:00:16,030
on the opening slide to say that I'm gonna

7
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:17,607
be speaking about not just information

8
00:00:17,607 --> 00:00:20,990
and cybersecurity, but privacy data,

9
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:22,790
audit and governance jobs.

10
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:24,300
So we're gonna cover all five of those.

11
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,910
So when I say in the five areas we cover,

12
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,583
it's going to be all five of those.

13
00:00:31,721 --> 00:00:34,110
It's been a hell of a year.

14
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:36,910
Since the last RSA,
we've been in a pandemic.

15
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:38,550
My guess is you're here

16
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:40,550
because you have two questions:

17
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:41,660
What should I be doing now

18
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:43,519
to optimize my job prospects

19
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,870
given this wacky year that we've had?

20
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:46,980
But more importantly, what should I

21
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,199
be thinking about for the next three years

22
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,730
to grow and solidify my career?

23
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,519
And that's exactly what
we're gonna talk about today.

24
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,300
And I'm going to organize
it in the following way.

25
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,790
There are really three
sections to this presentation.

26
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:02,830
We're gonna spend about 10 minutes

27
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:04,840
on just some assumptions,

28
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,280
some things that we've learned

29
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,630
as analysts in the pandemic

30
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:11,310
that are driving demand

31
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,670
for the five areas that we're covering.

32
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:16,780
And we're gonna share some
market growth, as well,

33
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,600
to show you that, if anything,

34
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,940
the pandemic has really assisted you

35
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,149
in your prospects in the five areas

36
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:28,680
of privacy, governance, auditing

37
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:32,410
information security, cybersecurity.

38
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:35,663
And I think I've said them all.

39
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:38,289
And it should help.

40
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:40,760
And that's a good story,
but it is very confusing,

41
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,410
and we'll cut through the confusion.

42
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:43,700
Next, we're gonna spend about 15,

43
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:46,990
20 minutes on compensation data.

44
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:48,780
We're gonna look at not just salaries,

45
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,240
but we, as an analyst firm,
track the market values

46
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,270
of tech skills and certifications.

47
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:58,060
That is, cash pay premiums that are paid

48
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:01,740
to 90,000 IT workers

49
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:02,850
that we can capture

50
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:05,539
for particular
certified/non-certified skills

51
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:06,510
that they have.

52
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,900
They're usually paid outside of base pay.

53
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,120
And there's a lot of reasons
why companies do this.

54
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,810
They do it to recognize people's skills.

55
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:15,270
They do it as a way of trying

56
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:17,170
to make it easier for their HR departments

57
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:19,010
to classify people and grade them.

58
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:20,390
They also do it as an incentive,

59
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,850
as a way of communicating
to their workforce

60
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:26,290
what skills they find valuable

61
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:28,929
to try to communicate
these are the kinda skills

62
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:31,280
we're looking for, we're
trying to staff up in,

63
00:02:32,722 --> 00:02:34,470
we're trying to increase
our bench strength.

64
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:37,940
So if you're interested
in furthering your career

65
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:40,230
and promotion and digging deeper,

66
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:42,810
these are the skills
that we're investing in.

67
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,750
So it's also a very good thing.

68
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,720
And we'll look at several different views

69
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,190
of those, including highest paying

70
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,930
and those that are growing,
those that are declining

71
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:52,500
in pay and so forth.

72
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,640
And then we'll spend

73
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,440
the third part and final
part of the presentation

74
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,683
on what are your job options right now?

75
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,310
And in that section,

76
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:05,070
and really stick around for that section

77
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:06,750
'cause in that section,
we're gonna give you

78
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:10,880
51 information/cybersecurity, risk,

79
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,049
audit, governance and privacy jobs

80
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:15,020
that employers tell us

81
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,660
they're dying to fill right now,

82
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,079
in very high demand.

83
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,170
They're desperate to fill these jobs

84
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:21,640
with suitable candidates.

85
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,527
We're also gonna look at 18 certifications

86
00:03:23,527 --> 00:03:26,040
and 25 non-certified skills

87
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,109
in the five areas that we think

88
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:30,630
that will be in sustained demand

89
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:31,990
for the next three years.

90
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:33,510
So not just this year,

91
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:34,436
but over the next two to three years,

92
00:03:34,437 --> 00:03:36,470
and it'll help you, I think,

93
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,030
plan out your career.

94
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,380
And then we have addendums.

95
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,060
I'll talk about that at the very end

96
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:43,870
'cause we couldn't put
everything in the presentation.

97
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:46,283
But you will wanna do screenshots.

98
00:03:47,444 --> 00:03:48,923
There's some data tables.

99
00:03:48,924 --> 00:03:51,170
You will wanna do screenshots
or ask us for a copy

100
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:52,470
of this presentation or download it

101
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:55,080
from the RSA site

102
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,580
because we're providing this to you

103
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,210
as research to look at
later, and we'll pull out

104
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:00,900
some of the things we want you to learn

105
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,513
from those slides as we go along.

106
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:07,020
So how did we get all this information?

107
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:10,830
Well, for one thing, we're analysts.

108
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:12,410
I'm a former Gartner analyst.

109
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:14,270
I was at META Group as well.

110
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:16,980
I've been an analyst at Foote Partners

111
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,860
for 24 years.

112
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,023
And in that time,

113
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,790
I worked with CIOs almost exclusively,

114
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,140
CIOs and CTOs.

115
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:28,690
And they never really
wanted to talk about tech.

116
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:30,490
They said, "Our biggest problems,

117
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:33,060
in terms of execution and
furthering our careers,

118
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,710
are finding the right
people at the right time

119
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:36,840
at the right intensity,

120
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,207
and being able to launch them again

121
00:04:39,207 --> 00:04:40,950
and again and again into projects,

122
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,599
and then not lose them,

123
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,087
retain them in the company."

124
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:47,710
So much so that we developed a whole area

125
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:49,680
of analysis that didn't exist

126
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,350
before we started it, in terms of applying

127
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,400
sort of an analytical and forecasting view

128
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,419
to the tech workforce.

129
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,253
So we had to build

130
00:04:59,253 --> 00:05:01,700
a pretty strong research
partnership network.

131
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,719
It's now up to 5,800 employers

132
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,690
in 40 industries in 15 countries.

133
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:07,210
We're gonna focus a little more today

134
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:09,060
on just the North American market.

135
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,280
So that's almost 3,800 employers

136
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,140
across 38 industries and public sector.

137
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,650
And we're going to share a lot

138
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,120
of what information
that they share with us

139
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,830
about managing the tech workforce.

140
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,250
And I think it'll be valuable to you

141
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,210
in your own careers, and that's why

142
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:30,049
we're doing this presentation for you.

143
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:32,610
Some of you may have seen
our presentation last year.

144
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:33,770
It's going to be similar to that,

145
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:35,099
but it's gonna be updated in terms

146
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,980
of all the new trends
and, obviously, new data,

147
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,620
as well, in terms of supply
and demand for talent

148
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,323
and for skills and certifications.

149
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,360
So as an analyst,

150
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,160
looking at this for almost 25 years,

151
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,670
I believe this statement to be true,

152
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:52,960
that job security and solid
career growth opportunities

153
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,277
for all of you in these areas right now

154
00:05:54,277 --> 00:05:56,550
are the best I've seen in 20 years,

155
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:58,520
so congratulations.

156
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,280
However, you're on your own.

157
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,309
Don't expect a roadmap or
a lotta career guidance

158
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,250
from your employers.

159
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,440
And that's presumably why

160
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,960
you've come to this session.

161
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,940
I'll do my best to provide
what your employers

162
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:12,200
are not providing to you.

163
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,620
So we've had plenty of problems

164
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:17,060
before COVID-19,

165
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,270
and you'll be familiar with these.

166
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:20,599
Pretty deep, persistent tech skills gaps,

167
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,340
a lotta retention issues, particularly in

168
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,359
the more experienced jobs.

169
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,260
We've had these companies continue to add

170
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:31,760
more and more multidimensionality to jobs.

171
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,550
Sometimes tech skills,
sometimes soft skills.

172
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:35,700
Now they may require you

173
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,909
to be experienced in several platforms,

174
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:40,610
several programming languages.

175
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:43,490
It's gotten to be difficult

176
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:45,870
and it's given you a lot of options

177
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:48,060
in your careers, so it's a good thing,

178
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,030
but managing that has been really tough.

179
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:52,390
Most companies have a
lotta trouble forecasting

180
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:55,260
beyond their current fiscal year.

181
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:58,349
And the volatility in the marketplace

182
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:59,750
has been fairly persistent.

183
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,213
And we track volatility.

184
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,010
So I was talking about
the supply and demand

185
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:07,690
and pay for certifications and skills.

186
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:10,160
Well, we track that in
our volatility index.

187
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,313
So this is 14 years of data.

188
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:16,760
Every three months, we report what we see.

189
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,780
So every data point is every three months.

190
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,070
And you see the red line,

191
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,880
which is all the certifications and skills

192
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,713
that we cover.

193
00:07:22,713 --> 00:07:25,670
Again, we're talking about
almost 1,200 right now.

194
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:28,100
And you see that pretty
much every three months,

195
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,530
20 to 30% of those skills

196
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:32,309
are changing in value.

197
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,780
So if you're planning your,

198
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,119
if you're doing a one or two-year plan

199
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,280
for your career and for your next job

200
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,539
or your current job,

201
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:42,190
you have to really refresh regularly,

202
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:44,520
every month, every three
months, every six months,

203
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,700
because the market is changing in terms

204
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,080
of the value that it puts on skills

205
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,039
and abilities and
capabilities and knowledge.

206
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,870
You have to be very, very aware of this

207
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,980
because we're gonna recommend you,

208
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:00,420
at the end of the
presentation, that you spend,

209
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:03,660
you frequently look at your job plan

210
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,630
or your career arc that you've got

211
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:08,480
and pay attention to data like ours.

212
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,010
'Cause we'll tell you, on a rolling basis,

213
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:12,909
what's hot and what's
not in the marketplace

214
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:15,460
and what employers are looking for.

215
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,539
So you can go back and
spend a little more time

216
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:20,430
on this again after we present

217
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:23,110
and when you get a copy of the slides.

218
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:26,150
So with COVID, a lot
of disruptors continue

219
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:28,510
to change everything
we know about business.

220
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:30,039
I would ask for a show of hands

221
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,370
if we were in a room together to say

222
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:35,740
do any of you not believe

223
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:38,059
that any bullet point on this list

224
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:42,239
is not impacting demand for cybersecurity,

225
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,870
security, information security,

226
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:47,250
privacy, auditing

227
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:50,520
or governance skills right now?

228
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,260
Are there any on this
list that are not driving

229
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:56,483
more demand for security and risk?

230
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,770
I can't think of one.

231
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:01,329
If we had more time, I could
go through each of them

232
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:04,450
and show you exactly how they are growing

233
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:06,360
and how they are impacting

234
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,170
because we go into great
detail on all of these

235
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:12,420
when we are doing our
analysis of the job market.

236
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:15,579
But suffice it to say
that each one of these

237
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,320
is having a very positive impact

238
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,070
on demand for your skills.

239
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:22,780
And now let's go into a little more detail

240
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,010
a little later in the presentation

241
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:26,350
on exactly what are the hot skills

242
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:28,000
and which are the skills that are not

243
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,730
so transportable in the market right now.

244
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:32,090
But what I'd like to do now

245
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:34,650
is just show you the results

246
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:37,480
of a recent survey from Red Hat.

247
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,470
About 1,500 IT professionals

248
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:41,093
participated in this survey.

249
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,530
And since this is all about
digital transformation,

250
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:45,416
they asked the question, what do you think

251
00:09:45,417 --> 00:09:47,760
are the top barriers
preventing your company

252
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,350
from being successful in
its digital transformation?

253
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:53,670
And it may not surprise you to know

254
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:56,750
that the top, two of the top three,

255
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,480
were security and
compliance and talent gaps.

256
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,000
And then when they went
into corporate spending,

257
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,010
over the next 12 months,

258
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:05,800
what are your company's
top IT funding priorities,

259
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,293
security's at the very top.

260
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:11,360
So not only are companies recognizing

261
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,610
these skills gaps and recognizing

262
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:15,800
these disruptive technologies as areas

263
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,849
where they need to increase the intensity

264
00:10:19,895 --> 00:10:20,880
of their protections,

265
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,990
but they're putting money into it.

266
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,650
And anytime they're putting money into it,

267
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:28,260
that translates into
skills premiums and jobs.

268
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,689
That translates into
being able to negotiate,

269
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:33,300
if you have the right set of skills,

270
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,740
for a salary that is at least equal

271
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,830
or exceeds the market value

272
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:39,620
of your market value in the marketplace,

273
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,050
so it's important for you to know

274
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:42,380
what those numbers are.

275
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,890
And that's why we're gonna
present some of this data

276
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:46,850
later in the presentation.

277
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:48,340
So what are some of the assumptions

278
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,590
affecting labor demand

279
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:52,810
for information security, cybersecurity,

280
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:54,239
risk, privacy, audit,

281
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,090
governance talent and workforce demand

282
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:58,490
and market growth?

283
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:01,320
So I wanna frame this in the following way

284
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:03,420
before we go any farther.

285
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:07,530
So at a very 30,000-foot view,

286
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:09,036
all companies have become tech companies,

287
00:11:09,037 --> 00:11:10,910
and this is one of the
reasons why security

288
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,459
is an issue with every company.

289
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,280
Every company, private
sector, public sector,

290
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:19,280
nonprofit, every company is either

291
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,410
delivering their products
as a tech product.

292
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:23,360
They're either tech products,

293
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,240
they're delivering them
or they're supporting them

294
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,450
with the use of technology.

295
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:28,843
And all of that needs to be secure.

296
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:33,090
Something that's been
happening for the three decades

297
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:34,510
that I've been involved as an analyst

298
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:36,740
is tech and business roles
have been folding into

299
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:39,980
each other, where people
on the business side

300
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,740
need to know much more about tech,

301
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,540
not from a user side, but more

302
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:47,280
from a execution side,

303
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,140
helping to build solutions.

304
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,020
That's true on the tech side, too.

305
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:53,140
Tech workers and security workers,

306
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,870
as you'll see a little
later in the presentation,

307
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:57,690
you need to have many
more business skills.

308
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:00,160
So we're always saying
if you're a tech worker,

309
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,589
don't always think that
another certification

310
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:06,910
or a re-upping on the current
certification you have

311
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,170
is going to add value

312
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,040
to your future job potential.

313
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,740
Sometimes going to school

314
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,410
and learning something in the area

315
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:18,660
of business capabilities
or business knowledge

316
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:21,689
or business skills may
be just what employers

317
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:23,610
are looking for 'cause
they're continually,

318
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:26,180
again, integrating technology and business

319
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,930
from a human capital point of view.

320
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,940
The pandemic has definitely altered

321
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,440
the business and tech landscape.

322
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,630
It's a new normal.

323
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:36,120
As we come out of it, we'll
have another new normal.

324
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,990
It's unclear what that landscape will be,

325
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,320
but it certainly will
have an effect on jobs,

326
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,950
skills, pay and this
area of total rewards.

327
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:46,360
And we call that, for this presentation,

328
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,193
the new-new normal.

329
00:12:47,193 --> 00:12:48,439
We don't know what it's gonna be yet,

330
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,000
but we're going to help you to understand

331
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,390
what we think some of it may look like.

332
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:54,270
And then, of course,
there are differentials

333
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:55,740
according to industry, geography,

334
00:12:55,740 --> 00:13:00,090
enterprise size and the
whole timeline for this.

335
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:03,690
Last of all, we have to
answer the question for you,

336
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:05,620
we have to, is how long do we believe,

337
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:08,090
as analysts, the pandemic's gonna last?

338
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:09,660
So we consulted our usual group

339
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:12,043
of almost 6,000

340
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,410
employers, but we also
consulted immunologists,

341
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:18,900
epidemiologists, healthcare workers,

342
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,843
social scientists and macroeconomists.

343
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:24,170
And we looked at a lotta factors in this.

344
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:27,750
And so the idea is when
will we feel safe again?

345
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,210
When will we be able to predict

346
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:31,870
what our future looks like?

347
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:34,430
'Cause we certainly haven't.

348
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:35,900
We've been constrained in this area

349
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,063
in the last year.

350
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:42,160
And we think it'll be the
fourth quarter of 2022.

351
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,189
So you're watching this in May.

352
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:48,980
So we're saying we're
looking at fall of 2022.

353
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,600
So, you know, 15 months

354
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:54,890
to 18 months from now

355
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:57,170
is when we think this new-new normal

356
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:01,040
will be solidified.

357
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,022
And I'm reasonably sure of that.

358
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,610
I don't know exactly what
it's gonna look like.

359
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:07,810
There might be other variants.

360
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:09,880
There might be another pandemic season.

361
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,640
We don't know this yet.

362
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,120
But we think things will
be a little more in control

363
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,910
compared to the way they
were in the last year.

364
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:21,589
And let's look at some,
mark some assumptions

365
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:24,130
on cybersecurity and risk market size,

366
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:26,850
workforce, labor and talent demand

367
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:27,910
and things like that.

368
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:31,160
Well, all of these things
shouldn't surprise you.

369
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:34,920
Cybersecurity costs,
cybercrime costs are huge.

370
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,160
They're in the trillions.

371
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,689
They're approaching 10,
11 trillion by 2025.

372
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:43,740
The spend on cybersecurity
products and services

373
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,460
is approaching a trillion in the period

374
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:50,370
from 2017 to 2021.

375
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:52,050
The cybersecurity market worldwide

376
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:54,400
is forecasted to be almost 1/4

377
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,510
of a trillion dollars by 2023,

378
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:58,453
driven mainly, we see,

379
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,670
as a couple of industries:
aerospace, defense

380
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,250
and intelligence verticals.

381
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:07,020
And there's some hot areas
down below there, too.

382
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:09,250
And then we have 6 billion

383
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,440
internet users by 2022.

384
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,020
Think about that, 6
billion internet users.

385
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,870
How many devices do we have,

386
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:19,940
multiples of those 6 billion?

387
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:22,140
All of those have to be secured.

388
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:24,290
All of those networks have to be secured.

389
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,772
This is a gargantuan
effort for all of you.

390
00:15:27,687 --> 00:15:30,630
As far as workforce size and gaps.

391
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:33,330
Okay, right now, about 3 1/2

392
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:36,880
to 4 million unfilled cybersecurity jobs,

393
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,710
growing at a compound annual growth rate

394
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:41,980
of almost 37% year to year

395
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:45,090
from 2012 to 2022.

396
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:47,240
Cybersecurity professionals, that job

397
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:50,190
is growing almost three
1/2 to four times faster

398
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:53,630
jobs growth than the overall IT market,

399
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:55,563
so you're in a hot area.

400
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:00,980
And since nobody can find everything

401
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,550
that they want on the market,

402
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:04,439
no amount of money is going to be able

403
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:08,030
to find a person that doesn't exist

404
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:09,939
if that's what you're looking for,

405
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,000
and a lot of companies
are looking for people

406
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,400
where there just isn't enough supply.

407
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,449
So I think in terms of cyber expertise,

408
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:18,610
we've been telling employers
for a couple of years now

409
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:20,530
that they're gonna have to develop

410
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:22,329
their cyber experts internally,

411
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:24,210
people who can drive, develop and drive

412
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:26,240
interconnected real-time systems.

413
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,040
These are also new professions.

414
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:31,240
And domain experience is
gonna continue to evolve.

415
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,970
But that's how these
jobs are gonna be filled.

416
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:36,080
They're gonna be filled
through internal selection

417
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,750
and internal training

418
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,080
and development programs that are gonna

419
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:44,170
be much more robust than
you've seen in the past

420
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,319
and much more effective.

421
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,930
We think the remote
business models will remain,

422
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:50,910
continue to increase
cybersecurity threat landscape.

423
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:54,020
And add to that privacy
regulation, open-source software,

424
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:56,430
it's gonna stimulate
an unprecedented demand

425
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:58,959
going forward in cyber
and security personnel,

426
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,910
as it is right now by some of the numbers

427
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:02,969
I just showed you.

428
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:05,319
Collaboration apps will
become even more popular.

429
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:07,139
And that just increases the threats,

430
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,950
the channels for hackers to leverage

431
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:11,730
malicious content, and
put pressure on employers

432
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:15,630
to put in place more
robust security monitors.

433
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:17,720
And as far as that, we
see greater reliance

434
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,890
on smart tools and AI to handle the bulk

435
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:22,859
of event monitoring and incident response.

436
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:24,979
So you're already seeing now,

437
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,290
new generation of firewalls

438
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:29,060
with built-in machine learning technology.

439
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,780
You're kinda getting an early.

440
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:33,020
I'm foreshadowing something I'm gonna say

441
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,980
again and again through this presentation,

442
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,420
that we need more AI expertise

443
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,370
in security and cybersecurity.

444
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:42,889
Most CSOs and CISOs I know

445
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,410
will not consider a hire in this point

446
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:47,890
into their departments

447
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:50,300
without that person
having some basic level

448
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:53,350
of demonstrated expertise

449
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:55,173
in AI, at some level.

450
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,100
It doesn't have to be at the level

451
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,419
of machine learning or deep learning,

452
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:01,170
but is able

453
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:03,290
to hit the ground running

454
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:06,170
on AI-driven initiatives

455
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:09,040
within the security
and risk organizations.

456
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,610
And we'll talk more about that

457
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:12,030
as we go forward.

458
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:13,820
And here it is, human analysts

459
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,929
will be even more overwhelmed.

460
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:18,620
This is our assumption
we're making going forward.

461
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:21,139
With information, we're relying more on AI

462
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,720
for decision-making.

463
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,824
And in that regard,
cybersecurity spending,

464
00:18:25,824 --> 00:18:28,070
we're learning, is being
focused more on AI.

465
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:30,740
And you should probably focus
more on that in your career.

466
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:33,480
Here are a number of
AI-supported use cases

467
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,690
that have been reported to us.

468
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:36,220
The ones in red

469
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,170
are the ones that seem to have

470
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:39,840
a little more attention
being paid to them,

471
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,560
where either they're looking for skills

472
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:44,963
in these areas or people have
some depth of experience.

473
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:49,070
So I would look at this as a hit list

474
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:50,530
for those of you who are looking to add

475
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:53,580
a little more AI into your tool belt

476
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,620
and to focus on these because these

477
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:59,419
are actual use cases that
are currently in operation.

478
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:01,070
And again, the ones in red are the ones

479
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:03,923
that we've been told have
a little higher priority.

480
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:08,070
So then, lastly, before we
go into the compensation data

481
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:10,230
are the skills-based models.

482
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:11,850
Our talent models versus job-based

483
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,786
will become even more
valuable going forward.

484
00:19:13,787 --> 00:19:16,610
And these have been sort of in evolution

485
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:18,969
for the last 10 or 15 years,

486
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:20,900
more of an architecture view.

487
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,700
And the reason why is that companies

488
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,649
demand that their tech
workforce be more flexible

489
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:28,790
and more adaptable 'cause
these business models

490
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:30,409
are changing all the time.

491
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:33,533
Particularly during the pandemic, I mean,

492
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,840
radical changes in business models

493
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,300
in response to what was happening

494
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:42,460
in their customer base, supply and demand,

495
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:45,850
as far as their products and services.

496
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:48,469
I mean, it was really pretty
hairy there for a while.

497
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:50,730
But those with more adaptable, flexible,

498
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:53,640
more architecture-based
models, the talent models,

499
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,780
seemed to do much, much better.

500
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:58,860
So if we have time or if
you have any questions

501
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:01,300
about this, I'd be
happy to talk about this

502
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,260
in the Q and A.

503
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,430
There's a 40 minute Q and A

504
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:05,360
that's following this session.

505
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,319
I'd be happy to go into
a little more detail

506
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:10,490
about what I mean by architecture-based,

507
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:13,200
skills-based talent models.

508
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,453
So let's talk about compensation trends.

509
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:19,110
And most of what I'm gonna present to you

510
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:20,469
is contained in this report

511
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:22,760
we update for every quarter.

512
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,260
It only goes out to our customers,

513
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,480
and it's free to our customers,

514
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,080
but it really is a file dump,

515
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,210
very data-driven of what's happening

516
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:30,190
in the marketplace

517
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:35,370
for skill supply and
demand and volatility.

518
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:36,969
And everybody who attends this session,

519
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:38,160
if you can prove to me that you

520
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,500
attended this session,
we'll give you a copy

521
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,993
of the latest quarterly
edition of this report.

522
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,010
And so that's one way of also getting

523
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:48,720
some of the content that
you're about to see,

524
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,810
but it's obviously a much
more expanded version

525
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:52,870
of what I can just show you today

526
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:54,723
in the time that we have available.

527
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:59,139
So here are the demographics
to what I'm gonna show you.

528
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:01,910
Get about 3,800 employers, 40 industries

529
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:04,913
in Canada and the United
States, about 83 cities.

530
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:09,417
We have data reported to us for 34,000,

531
00:21:09,417 --> 00:21:12,303
340,000 tech professionals.

532
00:21:14,005 --> 00:21:17,110
These are the geographical areas

533
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:19,429
that we're in, or the
industries that we're in.

534
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:20,820
I'm sure you can find the industry

535
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,730
that you're employed in or would like

536
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:24,210
to be employed in on this list.

537
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:26,000
Pretty much covers them all.

538
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,060
These are the cities.

539
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:29,450
The United States, we have separated

540
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:32,010
into large metro areas and secondary

541
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:33,270
and tertiary areas.

542
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:34,570
And there's our Canadian cities.

543
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:36,510
And we're pulling data from companies

544
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:38,093
in all of these cities.

545
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,600
The erosion, the pandemic erosion.

546
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,310
In our IT Professional Salary Survey,

547
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:44,870
something happened that I hadn't seen

548
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:47,820
in the 25 years we've been
publishing this survey.

549
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:50,830
That is almost 1/3 of all job titles

550
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:53,679
on a national basis declined in pay

551
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,260
over the last 12 months.

552
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,850
That never happens.

553
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:58,889
This is the pandemic effect of,

554
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:01,170
we call it pandemic erosion in pay.

555
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:04,450
And why is there pandemic erosion in pay?

556
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:06,180
Well, it's happening in information

557
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,540
and cybersecurity jobs.

558
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:09,260
We have three titles in that area.

559
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:11,763
Three of the 13 declined in pay, again,

560
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:16,860
on a national basis,
national average basis.

561
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,919
And it's for these reasons:

562
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,500
There's more supply.

563
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,550
A lotta people were laid off from jobs,

564
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,510
so there is more supply
for some of the jobs,

565
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:28,000
not all, given the level

566
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,550
of demand for talent.

567
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:31,649
A number of laid-off workers were rehired

568
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:33,290
at lower salaries.

569
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:34,300
There's a reason for that.

570
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,210
There's actually a good reason for that.

571
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:37,970
It's not predatory hiring

572
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:41,690
by employers that laid people off.

573
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:43,360
A lotta times, they were bringing them in

574
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,899
to help automate their job,

575
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:48,380
and then be able to be in-house.

576
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:49,730
But they have the advantage

577
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:54,160
of any job opportunities that come up.

578
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,870
It's better to be in the company

579
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:58,530
that outside the company, a lot of times,

580
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:00,190
when it comes to hiring decisions.

581
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:02,100
And also salary adjustments

582
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,943
for remote workers and locations.

583
00:23:07,722 --> 00:23:09,450
If you're in New York City

584
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:11,060
and you were receiving
a New York City salary,

585
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:13,010
and you moved to Vermont or New Hampshire,

586
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:15,640
many companies would reduce their salary

587
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,260
to the cost of living

588
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:19,629
in Vermont, New Hampshire,
and they won't pay

589
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:23,200
New York salaries, or San Jose salaries

590
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,410
if you've moved to Boise, Idaho.

591
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:28,100
And that has, obviously, lowered pay.

592
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:31,780
Again, just cost-of-living adjustments.

593
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:34,700
And we found some, this is an interesting,

594
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,470
I'm not gonna talk a lot about this,

595
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:37,303
but I wanted to see, well,

596
00:23:37,303 --> 00:23:39,850
what were the in-migration
and out-migration cities?

597
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:42,050
What were the cities
that were losing people

598
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:44,798
during the pandemic and
what were the cities

599
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:45,631
that were gaining people?

600
00:23:45,631 --> 00:23:48,070
And this isn't just tech
talent, these are all jobs.

601
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:50,419
And U-Haul started, (David laughs)

602
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,210
put out some interesting data

603
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:54,230
on rental pricing patterns.

604
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:55,940
All the red cities are the cities

605
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:58,050
that tended to lose people
during the pandemic,

606
00:23:58,050 --> 00:23:59,480
and the green cities were the ones

607
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,530
that expanded their population,

608
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:04,010
largely due to the remote workforce

609
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:05,000
being able to have a choice

610
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,620
of where they want to live.

611
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,139
So I give you this

612
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:11,930
as interesting data that
you might wanna consider

613
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:14,610
as you're looking into
your future of employment

614
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:16,639
and maybe where you'd like to be employed.

615
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,363
Here are some possibilities.

616
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:22,420
So what job families in our
Professional Salary Survey

617
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:24,280
were most affected by the erosion in pay?

618
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,113
Well,

619
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:29,150
it were these, one, two, three,

620
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:31,100
four, six, seven, eight, nine, 10,

621
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,899
11 job families out of about 36 or 37

622
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,110
that we have in the survey.

623
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:37,560
Among those were information/cybersecurity

624
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,570
and DevOps and DevSecOps.

625
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:41,040
The reason why I believe,

626
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,990
and I'll reiterate this when we

627
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:44,653
look at skill certifications,

628
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:51,070
certifications and skills for
information cybersecurity,

629
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:53,500
is that a lot of people
have flooded into this.

630
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,870
They see this as a prospect,

631
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:57,510
a solid prospect for their future.

632
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:59,960
So if they were working
in systems or networking,

633
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:05,310
they're looking at a job in security

634
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,630
as job security.

635
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:09,590
So as more people have
come into the field,

636
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:12,399
more people have gotten certified in that,

637
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,110
the gap between supply and demand narrows.

638
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:17,229
As the gap between supply
and demand narrows,

639
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:19,240
pay goes down.

640
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,580
So part of that is simply more people

641
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:23,730
flooding into the field
because they see it

642
00:25:25,627 --> 00:25:27,557
as a strong career move for them

643
00:25:27,557 --> 00:25:30,450
and their career arc in
terms of employability

644
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:31,340
in their future.

645
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:33,000
But also, we see that a lotta people

646
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,410
are becoming certified,
and it's driving pay down

647
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:37,130
for certifications, as well,

648
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:39,100
'cause there's certainly a lot of interest

649
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,870
in security certifications
and security skills

650
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:43,860
and in risk certifications and skills

651
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:45,959
and in governance and in privacy

652
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,523
and in audit, as well,
as we're about to see.

653
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,810
Before that, I just
wanted to share with you

654
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:54,879
just two salaries,

655
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,270
mid-level and senior
cybersecurity specialists.

656
00:25:58,270 --> 00:25:59,879
On a national basis, the average

657
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,560
for senior cybersecurity specialist

658
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,659
is about 126,000,

659
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:05,773
a little over 126,000 a year.

660
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,700
And the highest city that we cover

661
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,910
is 162, on average, and the lowest

662
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:13,410
is almost 107.

663
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:15,970
Mid-level cybersecurity
specialists are getting,

664
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:18,169
on average in the United States now,

665
00:26:18,169 --> 00:26:19,383
about 100,500.

666
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:25,560
And again, ranging between about 85

667
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:28,090
and 129, 130,000.

668
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:29,199
But you can see that

669
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,179
senior-level cybersecurity specialists

670
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:35,170
have declined in pay
slightly, very little,

671
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:37,220
but slightly over the last year,

672
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,350
but mid-level cybersecurity specialists

673
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:41,969
have actually gained almost 2%

674
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:43,750
in value over that time.

675
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:46,340
Now, if you're interested
in some of the other jobs

676
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:49,889
that we have, that's the addendum.

677
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:51,720
If you request it, we'll
be happy to send it.

678
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,710
We just didn't have time to include

679
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:56,030
all of the salary tables
in this presentation,

680
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:58,889
but we'd be happy to share those with you.

681
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:00,640
Again, this is all our current data

682
00:27:02,096 --> 00:27:03,973
through the end of March, April 1st.

683
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,189
So when it comes to compensation

684
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:09,710
for tech workers, there's
two kinds, really.

685
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:11,310
There's the salary that you get

686
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:13,870
and there's the skills premium

687
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:15,340
that you would hope to get.

688
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,379
Again, skills premiums

689
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:20,660
are generally paid outside of salary.

690
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:21,830
And there are a number of reasons

691
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:23,879
why you would pay them outside of salary.

692
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,380
You might pay them as a retention bonus

693
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,750
because somebody is being
recruited outta your company

694
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:31,920
and they're at the top of their.

695
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,120
They're one of your workers.

696
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,020
You don't wanna lose them.

697
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,770
They're at the top of their salary range.

698
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:37,650
They don't qualify for a promotion,

699
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:39,560
but you've gotta find some
way to get them more pay

700
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,460
to match an offer that they've gotten.

701
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:45,120
That's a perfect reason to use

702
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,429
a skill or certification pay premium.

703
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:49,770
Offer them something

704
00:27:51,862 --> 00:27:54,120
that's easy to sell to a decision-maker,

705
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,030
saying, "You know, what really makes

706
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:58,020
this person different from other people

707
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:02,510
is their Google,
TensorFlow, Python skills.

708
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:04,879
And those are the exact
skills that a recruiter

709
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,830
is searching for in the market.

710
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:09,199
So, you know, pay them a
little extra for those skills."

711
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,260
It could be one of 11

712
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:14,184
or 1,200 skills that we track.

713
00:28:14,184 --> 00:28:16,690
Another reason companies
use skills premiums

714
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:18,930
are for hiring bonuses.

715
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:21,000
Sometimes a one-time hiring bonus.

716
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,370
Another reason they may use them

717
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:25,649
is for communicating

718
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:27,380
to workers, as I said before,

719
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,860
this is what's important to us.

720
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:31,110
These are skills we're
trying to staff up in.

721
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:35,050
If you're interested in those, you may,

722
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:37,356
may or may not, be able to earn

723
00:28:37,356 --> 00:28:38,189
a premium for that.

724
00:28:38,189 --> 00:28:40,430
Every company has their own programs

725
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:41,840
around standards for who they're willing

726
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,149
to pay premiums for.

727
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:45,030
It might just be one particular

728
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:46,260
project group in the company.

729
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,230
It might be a whole population of workers.

730
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:50,090
It might be across the board.

731
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:52,699
They set the rules, but it is pay

732
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,023
outside of salaries.

733
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,540
And we're gonna look at that for a second.

734
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:59,170
So we sort of divide certified

735
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:02,280
and non-certified skills
into two categories.

736
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,480
And by the way, the reason why

737
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,517
there's more non-certified IT skills

738
00:29:05,517 --> 00:29:07,860
and certifications, it's
'cause certifications

739
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,273
are a very limited group.

740
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,159
Infrastructure, networking,

741
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,770
systems, security,

742
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:17,805
maybe program project
management certifications

743
00:29:17,805 --> 00:29:19,940
from PMI, there are
architecture certifications,

744
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:21,940
but it's a pretty limited group.

745
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:25,270
But if you look at the larger population

746
00:29:26,307 --> 00:29:30,010
of tech skills, a lot
of programming skills,

747
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:32,540
a lot of application
development tool platforms,

748
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:35,129
these don't usually
have any certifications.

749
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:36,480
There are a number of skills

750
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,180
that have no certification.

751
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:39,510
No vendor owns them.

752
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:42,000
They may be open-source skills.

753
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,270
So the market dictates what those

754
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:45,453
are going to be paid,

755
00:29:47,578 --> 00:29:49,080
what pay is for those skills.

756
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,860
Whereas in certifications,

757
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:53,250
vendors can easily throw a lotta money,

758
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,700
millions of dollars,
into marketing campaigns

759
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,360
for some of their new products.

760
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,479
You buy their new products.

761
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,720
They'll certify all of your workers

762
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,100
in those products.

763
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:05,240
They'll make it very easy
to get those certifications.

764
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,260
But that, again, is part

765
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,660
of the marketing budget

766
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:10,690
for those technology products.

767
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:12,550
Non-certified skills, again,

768
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:16,580
sort of succeed or die
based on market forces.

769
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:18,187
So the ones we're gonna look at

770
00:30:18,187 --> 00:30:20,750
are the ones in red, all right,

771
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:22,750
primarily, that we think
are more associated

772
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:25,370
with the five areas that
we're talking about today.

773
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:27,689
So non-certified skills,
generally, are worth

774
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:29,423
a lot more than certified skills.

775
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:32,110
And there is a 20 year,

776
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:34,367
21-year chart to show you that.

777
00:30:34,367 --> 00:30:36,580
And also, I wanna point
out that the blue line,

778
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:38,290
which is certifications,
have been declining

779
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:40,370
in value pretty precipitously

780
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:42,129
over the last four years,

781
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:43,720
whereas non-certified skills

782
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,540
have been holding their value.

783
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:47,450
Again, it's market forces.

784
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:49,750
A lot of the non-certified skills

785
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,980
that companies are investing in

786
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:53,490
are customer-facing skills.

787
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:55,710
They're applications development,

788
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:57,670
they're data and data management skills.

789
00:30:57,670 --> 00:30:59,420
They're all kinds of
skills that you would find

790
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:03,530
in those, that list of
disruptive technologies

791
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:05,170
I shared before.

792
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:06,930
They may or may not have certifications,

793
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:08,690
but companies have ways

794
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:11,070
of being able to judge for themselves

795
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:14,167
what the value is to them

796
00:31:14,167 --> 00:31:16,060
and the people that they're hiring,

797
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:17,899
and that does bump up the price.

798
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:20,700
But the average price for
a certification right now

799
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:23,497
is about the equivalent of 6.6%

800
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:26,150
of base pay.

801
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:27,680
So here are our certification.

802
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,412
Then we're gonna look at skills,

803
00:31:29,412 --> 00:31:31,400
and then we're going to
move into what we think

804
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,740
you should do about all this.

805
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:35,470
So certifications, obviously,

806
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:38,020
the highest paying, are
information security

807
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,370
and architecture, project management

808
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:40,453
and process skills.

809
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:44,290
The next charts that I'm gonna show you,

810
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:45,700
I'm gonna go through them very quickly

811
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,890
because these are the charts you wanna

812
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:49,610
do screen grabs or you wanna

813
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:51,500
actually get a copy of the presentation

814
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,570
'cause you should use this,

815
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:54,710
and I'm gonna explain to you

816
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:56,370
how to use this going forward,

817
00:31:56,370 --> 00:31:57,780
what this information means.

818
00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:00,230
These the highest-paying
premiums right now.

819
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:01,800
You're lucky if you have these

820
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,169
'cause if the average
for all certifications

821
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:07,049
is about 9.6, the equivalent of 9.6

822
00:32:07,049 --> 00:32:09,889
or 9.7 of base pay, look
at what these are paying.

823
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:10,950
These are paying between nine

824
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:13,250
and 18% of base pay.

825
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:15,900
So you can earn a lot
with these certifications.

826
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,770
Next, since we haven't had a lotta growth

827
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:19,620
in certifications, they've
mainly been going down,

828
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:22,520
in the last 12 months, there's
only three certifications

829
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:25,080
that are showing growth
over the last 12 months,

830
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:28,439
and it's these: a couple
of penetration testers

831
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:32,163
and the Cisco Certified
CyberOps Associate.

832
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,050
So now I'm looking at, these are the ones

833
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:36,310
you're really gonna wanna stare at.

834
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:38,760
I wanted to look at the certifications

835
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:41,470
in these information and cybersecurity

836
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:42,923
that are losing market value

837
00:32:42,923 --> 00:32:44,570
over the last 12 months.

838
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:46,600
It's a lot of interesting stories in this.

839
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,820
Again, not all of them are losing value

840
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:52,330
because the market finds
them less attractive.

841
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:55,540
Some of them are absolutely losing value

842
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,909
because more and more people that,

843
00:32:57,910 --> 00:33:00,420
certifying bodies have
been very successful

844
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:02,820
in certifying more and
more people in these.

845
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:04,889
And again, that supply

846
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:06,440
narrows the gap between demand

847
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,560
and drives the price down.

848
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:10,290
I don't have enough time
in the presentation today

849
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:12,690
to sort through all of the certifications.

850
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:14,700
There's two slides of them

851
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,470
and why some of those are going down,

852
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:18,140
but I could be able to
separate out the ones

853
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:20,190
where I'm telling you that one

854
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:23,230
is being driven by market forces

855
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:25,450
and that one is being driven by a decline

856
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:28,563
in interest in that
certification by employers.

857
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,770
So in auditing and governance,

858
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:33,950
the same skills right here.

859
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:36,360
We just wanted to put them
out in alphabetical order

860
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,719
to show you how they've been performing

861
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,753
in the last three, six, 12 months.

862
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:44,780
And now moving to certified,

863
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:46,560
or to non-certified skills,

864
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,090
we've done the same thing.

865
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:50,530
These are the pay premiums

866
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:52,143
for non-certified skills.

867
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,420
And again, in alphabetical order,

868
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:57,570
we're showing you three
months, six months,

869
00:33:57,570 --> 00:33:58,850
12-month growth and decline,

870
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:01,000
and what companies are willing to pay.

871
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,853
Again, these are very high
paying, quite frankly.

872
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:07,480
Here are a continuation of that list,

873
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,530
since we couldn't get
them all on one list,

874
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:12,730
going from artificial
intelligence to wireless security.

875
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:16,050
So again, you should look at the amounts

876
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:17,730
that companies are willing to pay, again,

877
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:19,110
as a percent of base pay, but also

878
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:21,429
look at the growth and decline,

879
00:34:21,429 --> 00:34:22,750
the vectors in these,

880
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:23,699
whether they're losing value

881
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:25,770
or gaining value and why.

882
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:27,949
So here are the R and D and governance

883
00:34:29,476 --> 00:34:30,527
non-certified skills.

884
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:34,909
And what are your options right now?

885
00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:37,159
So in the time we have
left in the presentation,

886
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:38,279
I wanted to show you

887
00:34:39,556 --> 00:34:40,706
a very interesting list

888
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,860
that took a long time to put together.

889
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:46,090
These are 51 jobs

890
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:47,380
that employers are telling us

891
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:48,480
they're trying to fill.

892
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,592
So what I've done is the ones in green,

893
00:34:52,356 --> 00:34:53,360
I'm putting a little more attention on

894
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,860
because the ones in green, we went back

895
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,570
and looked at salaries for these jobs

896
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:58,670
and also the value of skills

897
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:00,490
and certifications for these jobs.

898
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:02,299
And if we saw them climbing in value

899
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,420
and we thought that these
were going to be continuing

900
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:06,730
to go up in value, then we wanted

901
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:09,880
to indicate that those
were particularly hot.

902
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,650
So the ones that in green are the ones

903
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:14,320
that we would say are in probably

904
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,310
a little higher demand

905
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:17,442
because they're either paying more

906
00:35:17,442 --> 00:35:20,550
or companies are willing
to pay extra for them.

907
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:23,730
And I'm gonna go through
these, again, really quickly.

908
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:25,610
Again, you can get ahold
of the presentation

909
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:26,630
and you can look at these.

910
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:28,070
It's a rather long list.

911
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:29,403
It's five slides.

912
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:36,653
Got management jobs in there.

913
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,320
These are all in alphabetical order.

914
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,360
So really spend a little time

915
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,950
with these five slides

916
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:51,100
'cause these are jobs that
companies want to hire.

917
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,089
Maybe you're a candidate,

918
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:53,820
maybe you're already in these jobs.

919
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:56,770
You're already in these jobs,
you may be able to negotiate.

920
00:35:56,770 --> 00:35:58,410
Maybe add a few more skills

921
00:35:59,897 --> 00:36:01,163
to your skill toolbox,

922
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:04,980
you might be able to negotiate higher pay.

923
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,710
These are our three-year forecasts

924
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:09,950
of in-demand cybersecurity certifications.

925
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:11,903
These are the ones we think
are gonna maintain value

926
00:36:11,903 --> 00:36:13,080
over the next three years.

927
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,319
These are good ones to have.

928
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:18,280
This list is culled from, again,

929
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,697
540 certifications.

930
00:36:20,697 --> 00:36:22,790
These are the ones that
we think are keepers

931
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:24,050
for the next three years.

932
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:26,060
And these are the

933
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:30,620
non-certified skills

934
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:32,850
that we think are, again, in high demand.

935
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:35,279
Companies are looking for these skills,

936
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,940
increasing intensity in these skills

937
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:37,890
in their workforce.

938
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,430
These are, just for 2021,

939
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:43,669
these are hot jobs and skill areas

940
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:45,370
in the, again, in the five spaces

941
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:46,620
we've been talking about.

942
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,530
Again, you can compare this

943
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:51,970
to your own toolbox, if you will.

944
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:53,740
You can look at in terms of jobs you might

945
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:54,729
be aspiring to.

946
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:57,300
These are areas where companies are dying

947
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:00,190
to find, to hire and also increase

948
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:02,050
their skills intensity.

949
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:05,370
Now, as far as soft skills,

950
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:07,370
I wanna say that marketing
and communications

951
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:10,480
is a really hot skill in the five areas

952
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,820
we're talking about today.

953
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:14,050
And that's because the tech professional,

954
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:16,510
as I said before, as more business

955
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:18,190
and tech skills fold into each other,

956
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:20,220
companies are looking for soft skills.

957
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:22,140
These are compensable,
which means companies

958
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,460
are willing to pay more for them.

959
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:26,070
Whether it's leadership, flexibility,

960
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:27,470
speaking more than one language,

961
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:29,580
being able to be good at
relationship building,

962
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:32,600
good at communicating, good
at presenting at conferences,

963
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:36,040
good at implementation
skills, they want all of that.

964
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,170
And as we talk to CISOs,

965
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:39,430
over the last 10 years,

966
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:41,319
I've been asking them,
what's your wish list

967
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,000
as you hire more security

968
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,120
and risk professionals
into your department?

969
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,170
These are the ones they're talking about.

970
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:50,130
These are a lot of communication skills,

971
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:52,050
a lot of business knowledge,

972
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:54,230
business aptitude skills.

973
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,850
It goes way beyond tech skills.

974
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:57,240
What they say is, to us,

975
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,866
is, "It's easy to get the tech skills.

976
00:37:58,867 --> 00:38:01,170
"It's hard to get the soft skills."

977
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:03,407
And we say, "Well, what are the traits

978
00:38:03,407 --> 00:38:04,410
"that you're searching for?"

979
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:06,600
These are the five traits that they

980
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,819
consistently tell us they're searching for

981
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:12,033
and looking for for new staff.

982
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:14,100
Apply what you've learned.

983
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,589
We think you should take the slide deck

984
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:17,010
and ask three questions:

985
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:18,510
Am I happy in my job right now?

986
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:20,320
Where do I wanna be in my career

987
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,310
three to five years from now?

988
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:22,270
Can I get there?

989
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:23,620
If you don't have the
answer to these questions,

990
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:25,143
start thinking about them now.

991
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:27,910
Three months from now,

992
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:29,620
you should be looking
at this presentation,

993
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:30,650
you should be formulating

994
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:31,790
your three to five-year plan.

995
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:33,090
Six months from now,

996
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:34,207
you should be executing on that plan.

997
00:38:34,207 --> 00:38:38,359
And you should go back and
recalibrate all the time

998
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,010
because if you don't recalibrate,

999
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:43,460
as I said to you before,
you are missing out

1000
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:45,320
on an extremely volatile marketplace

1001
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:48,040
that is going to persist.

1002
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,890
And as I said, all of our data,

1003
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:51,879
as you can see, every three to six months,

1004
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,620
it's changing in value.

1005
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:55,400
It's changing in supply and demand.

1006
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,630
So thanks very much for your time today.

1007
00:38:57,630 --> 00:38:59,960
This is how you can get ahold of me.

1008
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,900
But I do suggest that you

1009
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:04,870
do take a look at some of the data slides,

1010
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:06,290
some of the more detailed slides

1011
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:07,279
in this presentation.

1012
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,653
If you have any questions,

1013
00:39:09,528 --> 00:39:12,470
I'm gonna be there for the
40-minute after-session.

1014
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:14,709
And you can always give me a call

1015
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:16,470
or contact me.

1016
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:18,270
I'll always be available to you.

1017
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:20,020
And thanks very much for your time.
