1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,179
- Yeah, it's just the maintenance
data collection computer,

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:05,189
but once again, as I said, it's that hub.

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:07,170
It's where all the information
is gonna go through,

4
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:08,660
and be redistributed.

5
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:11,710
And we all know about
the 737 Max problems.

6
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:14,210
And that's, from everything
that I understand,

7
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:16,100
and what I've read in
my personal knowledge,

8
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:20,390
it's OFP software, not
accounting for the new CG.

9
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:22,370
They did physical structures, changes,

10
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:24,230
and they didn't update the software.

11
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:26,780
So what if you were able to
actually update the software

12
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:30,500
and somebody could send a
regress into that system?

13
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:35,100
But it's okay, we can all
panic, but there's no need to,

14
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,340
it'll be all right.

15
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:39,100
First off, you have to
gain physical access

16
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:39,933
to these devices,

17
00:00:39,933 --> 00:00:40,920
and we all know how hard it is to get

18
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,690
on a flight line when
you're not allowed there.

19
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:46,129
There's future fixes in play,

20
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:48,570
and there's some things
that we're actually using.

21
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,830
For instance, encryption is being used

22
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:52,683
on the Link 16 combat network.

23
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:55,820
And, as was brought up by Ken,

24
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,340
there's a lot of pilot override.

25
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:00,330
Whenever you're transferring
information to the aircraft,

26
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:01,800
the pilot gives a check.

27
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,039
I think one way to really
fix a lot of these issues

28
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,580
is to have more of that.

29
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,870
Also, you add, not just maintenance codes,

30
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:10,680
but we maybe add hacking codes to the hub,

31
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,090
whenever we go through there.

32
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:13,760
Have certain indicators,

33
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,160
and it would look a lot
like the ATT&CK network.

34
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,260
The ATT&CK MITRE network,

35
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,230
because we already use this anyways,

36
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:21,460
for maintenance problems.

37
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:23,490
So why not just put those
hacking codes in there?

38
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:25,119
You teach a maintainer
how to find these codes,

39
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,880
and they've got it right there.

40
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,899
And, like I said, there's
easy ways to fix this,

41
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,450
we just need to push for those.

42
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:35,520
And it is hard to get into these things.

43
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,670
It's hard to test this stuff.

44
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:38,150
If you wanted to hack an aircraft,

45
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:41,090
you have to understand the
address locations as I mentioned.

46
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:42,380
You have to have access to the gear.

47
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:44,949
The gear is expensive, very expensive.

48
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:48,590
And most systems have
an electronic fallback.

49
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,700
So if you lose all radios,
you lose all COMM Bus.

50
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,620
I'll give you, for instance,

51
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:54,510
the aircraft goes to a 28 volts DC,

52
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:57,490
there is a physical line
between the pilot's hand mic

53
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:59,270
and the COMM1 radio.

54
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:01,610
So there are backups and
the aircraft is designed

55
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:04,620
for safety, even if something bad happens.

56
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,420
And yeah, that's about it.

57
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,919
If there's any questions,
I'd love to take them.

58
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,289
- [Liz] Okay, well, I have a question.

59
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:12,060
So are there resources available

60
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,293
beyond just this one
slide related to this?

61
00:02:15,293 --> 00:02:17,540
- All right. So this is a full talk.

62
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,609
It's a full hour long, and it's available

63
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:22,430
on my GitHub and it's the
same name that's here.

64
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,330
It's the box swapper.

65
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:25,730
So if you type box swapper in
GitHub you'll see this talk.

66
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:27,880
And at the back, I made sure to update

67
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,160
and keep all the links up to date.

68
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,500
The information is out there

69
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,930
because this stuff is standardized.

70
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:34,810
You know, a company can't make devices

71
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:36,890
to install in an aircraft
unless there's a standard.

72
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,350
And a lot of these standards are available

73
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:41,239
for public preview to look at,

74
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,143
so you could learn a lot of this stuff.

75
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:46,660
- [Liz] Looks like we have a question

76
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,667
in the chat from Ryan says,

77
00:02:48,667 --> 00:02:51,950
"Can you say what military
airframes you've worked on?"

78
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:54,970
- C-5, C-17s, KC-135s and B-1s

79
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,930
- [Liz] Are aerospace
communication and navigation

80
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:01,720
systems resilient, would you say?

81
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,301
- Yes. And that goes back
to the fallback systems.

82
00:03:05,301 --> 00:03:07,929
There is a situation
that I was involved in

83
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:10,300
where an aircraft got struck by lightning

84
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,610
and it reset the main control unit

85
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:16,370
for the power bus, and
they lost everything.

86
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:18,660
Luckily, all those backup
systems were working.

87
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,799
They had a backup hydraulic
system all the way down to the,

88
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,240
there's a system called a RAT.

89
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,360
It's a ram air turbine,

90
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,040
pops out the side of the aircraft,

91
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,750
air pushes that one little blade

92
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:30,450
while they're moving
forward, and it turns it.

93
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:32,500
And in some airframes, it creates power,

94
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,310
other airframes it will
actually create hydraulics

95
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:36,260
and they can build off of that.

96
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,209
Aircrafts are resilient.

97
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:38,470
I mean, they're designed
to stay in the air.

98
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:41,560
There's a lot of very
strict policy guidelines

99
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,880
from the FAA for something
to be in the air.

100
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,415
And there's a lot of good fallbacks.

101
00:03:46,415 --> 00:03:47,380
And when I put this together,

102
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,450
I wanted to reiterate that to people,

103
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:51,609
there is a lot of fallbacks
to help things out.

104
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:53,490
There's a lot of double
checks and triple checks

105
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:54,880
in a lot of the systems.

106
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,140
When you have multiple
inputs, say for navigation,

107
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,779
you've got all sorts of things telling

108
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,130
what the accurate location is

109
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:03,180
and they do parody checks
against each other.

110
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,270
- [Liz] Okay. We have
another question here

111
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:06,227
in the chat from Ted says,

112
00:04:06,227 --> 00:04:08,710
"Redundancy is critical in the air.

113
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,210
With hardware being expensive,

114
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:11,480
how would we go about training

115
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,810
with these standards or
inputting crafted packets

116
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:18,117
beyond of Aero Aviation
specific coursework?"

117
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,690
- Yep. And that's what
I was saying is it's got

118
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:24,423
that security through
obscurity for the moment.

119
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:26,940
It's on our side.

120
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,370
And it is hard to come by these things,

121
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:30,480
but as we move forward

122
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,780
it's getting more and more
easy for virtualization.

123
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,020
I myself have been trying to look

124
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:38,409
at ways to virtualize a bus environment.

125
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:41,130
Just to get some coded words
and take a look at them.

126
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:42,340
There's other ways to do it.

127
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:45,169
There is software out there
available for free to do that,

128
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:48,060
you just have to know
what you're looking for.

129
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,370
But, the first step of course,

130
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:50,970
would be learning to read bus traffic.

131
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:52,260
Learning what it is,

132
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:55,030
learning what kind of codes
they're gonna kick out.

133
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:56,229
And that's why I had this slide.

134
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:58,230
It shows you how the package broke down.

135
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,169
- [Liz] Okay. We have a final
question here from Daniel.

136
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:03,670
It says, "Any work you can share on

137
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:07,587
sending malicious or modified ARINC 429

138
00:05:07,587 --> 00:05:10,650
to the end of the EFB or other LRU

139
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:16,869
- I have not messed with ARINC 429

140
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:19,870
except for running radios on the systems

141
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:22,660
and replacing parts after someone
else had troubleshot them.

142
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,360
And it's because I'm
not a licensed mechanic,

143
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,410
I was just assisting a licensed mechanic.

144
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,050
It's possible, it's doable.

145
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:34,680
It's just a matter of
getting it to the EFB.

146
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,960
And as he was saying with the
operating systems on those,

147
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,359
if you know your target,

148
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,530
and you know how to get
information to that target,

149
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:43,809
I think it's very highly likely to

150
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,510
put some bad information on there.

151
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,070
- [Liz] Well, thank you so much

152
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,810
for your time today, Nicholas.

153
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:50,780
- Thank you.

154
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,159
- [Liz] And we will be transitioning now

155
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,130
to our final speaker here,
which is Gabe Mounce,

156
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:59,193
who will be presenting
on AFWERX Space Prime.

157
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:01,783
- Thanks Liz.

158
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:05,323
So now, for something
completely different.

159
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:08,960
I'm with the Department of the Air Force.

160
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,409
So following Nicholas,

161
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:15,090
I appreciate that technical
discussion about aircraft.

162
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:17,390
I'm gonna talk about some
space stuff right now.

163
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:19,960
I represent the AFWERX office

164
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,130
of the Department of the Air Force,

165
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,430
which is an innovation office

166
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:26,410
really geared toward
helping the Air Force,

167
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:28,040
and now the Space Force,

168
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,370
better connect to the industry base,

169
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:31,850
mainly the startup sector,

170
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:35,290
and how we can't adopt or adapt

171
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:38,500
what we're seeing in
innovation within that sector

172
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,863
for military utility.

173
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:44,860
A quick shout out, I want to

174
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:47,860
thank the Aerospace
Village, and I want to thank

175
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,810
my colleagues at the
Air Force research lab

176
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:52,900
running a program on
behalf of the Space Force

177
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,260
and the Air Force called Hack-A-Sat.

178
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:59,800
You'll see that coming
to a galaxy near you.

179
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,790
Go to hackasat.com if you wanna understand

180
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,810
how you can hack a sat.

181
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:05,500
But they gave me the
opportunity to talk about

182
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,540
this Space Prime effort.

183
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:11,330
So, the Space Prime initiative
was one of the major lines

184
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:13,960
of effort that will be
under AFWERX, and, in fact,

185
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,960
will be under a new
office spinning out here

186
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,803
this summer called Space Works.

187
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:23,400
The prime initiative follows
the successful pilot program

188
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,020
that the secretary of the Air
Force level ran through space,

189
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,849
or through AFWERX,
(phone rings)

190
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:33,685
in which satellites
basically, or, I'm sorry,

191
00:07:33,685 --> 00:07:35,730
the original program was
called Agility Prime,

192
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:37,430
and it was all about priming the pump

193
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:42,430
on a market that's nascent in nature

194
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:45,060
but might have implications
for national security

195
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:48,050
if that market were to become robust.

196
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,730
Under the Agility Prime program,

197
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:52,530
they were mainly focused on flying cars.

198
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:54,840
And so what we're going
to do with Space Prime,

199
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,760
Space Prime will be the
next Prime initiative

200
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,200
out of the shoot.

201
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,670
And that Prime initiative is looking at

202
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:03,150
how do we prime a nascent space market

203
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,173
towards national security.

204
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,400
In our terms, what we
mean by prime the pump,

205
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,419
we mean either accelerating a market

206
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,720
that's a little bit nascent,

207
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,020
embryotic, not quite mature yet,

208
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,859
or perhaps even unlocking a market

209
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:20,070
that perhaps doesn't quite exist yet

210
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,020
to this particular effort.

211
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,400
So, this is an opportunity

212
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,219
if you're out in the industry
base on a technical side

213
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,900
looking at what you might help us

214
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,679
with when it comes to the department

215
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,733
of the Air Force and our
satellite systems in particular.

216
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:36,590
I show you a schedule in this chart.

217
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:37,640
That just means to say

218
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,179
that we've done a lot of due diligence

219
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:42,488
on our government side to understand both

220
00:08:42,489 --> 00:08:46,540
what do we need from an Air
Force Space Force perspective?

221
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:49,280
And then what is the
market actually doing?

222
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,630
We're to a point now that we plan

223
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:55,080
to launch the Prime
initiative more formally

224
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:59,380
and publicly this summer in
which we were inviting teams,

225
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:02,540
and those teams could be
performers of any type,

226
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:06,165
startup companies, teams
of startup companies,

227
00:09:06,165 --> 00:09:10,270
big, larger companies that
are maybe not already geared

228
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:13,110
towards the military-industrial base,

229
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,860
and even those that are.

230
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,860
And in fact, we also are looking to see

231
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:21,100
if teams might involve
academic partners and others,

232
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,940
whereby we will select a number

233
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:27,430
of performers to then take
forward into this Prime effort.

234
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:30,719
The Prime effort itself will
have some funding behind it.

235
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,860
It'll have a number of different
funding sources potentially

236
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,530
that can be brought to bear,

237
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:39,230
given to teams to help
them produce something for

238
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:41,920
this nascent market to show
how we might push it forward.

239
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,229
And I'll go into some of the
technical areas in just a bit.

240
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:48,710
Primarily, the central part of
that program will be wrapped

241
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:51,300
around the Air Force's small business

242
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:55,819
innovative research
contracting opportunities.

243
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:56,890
And there may be other ways

244
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:59,300
in which we will be able
to provide funding to teams

245
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:04,300
to demonstrate some capability
on orbit in the future,

246
00:10:04,607 --> 00:10:07,699
around 2024 is what we're looking at.

247
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,710
But we're also looking at a number

248
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:11,570
of other efforts on the
regulation and policy side as well

249
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:14,430
to help potentially unlock a market.

250
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:16,300
For the technical side, though,

251
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,120
realizing that this is
a technical audience,

252
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:23,120
we're looking at a number
of capability focus areas,

253
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,370
and this is where potentially some

254
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:27,590
of the technical capability
that we are interested in

255
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:31,530
from a Space Force Air Force
perspective comes into play.

256
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:34,810
You see a number of those
areas there in the chart.

257
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:36,900
But for this audience, I
think the most important

258
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,400
is that we're looking at, in particular,

259
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:43,480
a focus area around hybrid
data processing and movement.

260
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,057
The tagline for this particular effort is,

261
00:10:46,057 --> 00:10:50,320
"On-demand data, any
time, any place, anywhere

262
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,350
enabling our end users in the
Space Force, the Air Force,

263
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:57,727
and across the military to
utilize data from space."

264
00:10:57,727 --> 00:11:00,290
Right in lockstep with that as well

265
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:04,050
is the cyber aspect of
what we'll need to embed

266
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:06,030
and make into capability if we're going

267
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,780
to have that kind of data movement.

268
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,900
And the space sector,

269
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:13,209
especially as it traverses
in the space sector

270
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:17,030
and traverses into the
terrestrial sector for any

271
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:21,773
of the end-use of that data
that we might want to employ.

272
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,700
We're looking at a bunch of
other focus areas as well.

273
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,750
One of the other ones

274
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,110
of considerable interest is something

275
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:33,770
that is coalescing around
sustainability in space,

276
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:37,230
having to do with what
we want to accomplish

277
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:41,140
in debris mitigation, remediation,

278
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:43,819
and definitely the data transport issue,

279
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:46,780
which enables identification of debris,

280
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:49,100
is important to that as well.

281
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,430
But a number of efforts

282
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:53,620
that we will be launching
underneath the Space Prime

283
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,390
that will have one of these focus areas,

284
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:58,350
if not several, maybe grouped together,

285
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:01,089
as an offering for industry players

286
00:12:01,089 --> 00:12:03,483
to chew on and bite off on.

287
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,270
Pretty simple programs,
so I'm pretty much done

288
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,963
and willing to take questions.

289
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:11,363
- [Liz] In the meantime,

290
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:13,350
I have a quick question for you, Gabe.

291
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:14,957
What actually is AFWERX?

292
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:18,766
- Cool. I was going to
complete the thought

293
00:12:18,767 --> 00:12:21,600
on what AFWERX is. An
innovation office here

294
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,740
that department of Air Force stood up

295
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,480
to help us connect to the private sector,

296
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,910
and make it easier for the private sector

297
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,780
to work with the federal government.

298
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:33,310
And we'll bake that kind of
process into the new Space Works

299
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:35,010
where this effort Space Prime

300
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:37,410
is going to be one of the
major lines of effort.

301
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:42,650
I see a chat there about more specificity

302
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:43,600
with data movement.

303
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,963
Yeah, we're looking at whatever,

304
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,540
we know that the market, and by the way,

305
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:51,849
my name is spelled wrong.

306
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:53,450
I apologize, maybe I can
change it while I'm talking,

307
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:57,450
but the market for data
movement is growing,

308
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:59,620
As I think most people know,

309
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,740
with the likes of Space
X and others launching,

310
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,910
kind of constellations of
satellites to move data around.

311
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,199
We expect that to grow.

312
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,040
And we're just looking

313
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,069
at understanding what
else could be brought

314
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:12,290
to bear to enable that for, you know,

315
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:14,969
Space Force Air Force purposes,

316
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:18,250
including how the new constellations

317
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:22,120
of satellites might inject
artificial intelligence

318
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,560
and machine learning to help drive data,

319
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,969
especially to do a lot
of the data processing,

320
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:30,030
increasing data processing
bandwidth onboard the assets

321
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:33,260
in space, which will be
required to move kind

322
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:35,610
of the high bandwidth
levels of data around

323
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:36,800
that we plan to see,

324
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,589
and are already starting to see in space.

325
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:44,590
So, every aspect of the
compute chain, in our opinion,

326
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:49,950
would be part of that focus
area, including fusion,

327
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:52,646
data fusion, and analytics.

328
00:13:52,647 --> 00:13:57,490
Quick note, if you want to
learn more about this program,

329
00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:00,880
Space Prime in particular
or the Prime initiative

330
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,439
as a whole, underneath AFWERX,

331
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,800
one way is just to contact
me directly on LinkedIn,

332
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,810
is probably the best place
for me, or through my Twitter.

333
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:13,770
Twitter is just @GabeMounce,
Gabe Mounce on LinkedIn.

334
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:14,980
And you can easily connect with me,

335
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:18,070
and I can maybe point you
to some more resources.

336
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:20,820
I didn't mention the other focus area

337
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,680
as we were running out of time.

338
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,471
We're looking at, like I said,

339
00:14:24,471 --> 00:14:27,680
on orbit data processing and movement.

340
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,010
We're looking at potentially
how to contend with debris.

341
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:34,290
One of the other elements
is just advancing capability

342
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:37,680
in space for things like
on orbit maneuvering,

343
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:42,329
advanced maneuvering, on orbit servicing.

344
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:43,480
So this gets into actually,

345
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,470
what can we do with assets in space

346
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:48,940
to eventually drive a market that might

347
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:52,740
have to do with in space manufacturing,

348
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,240
maybe even taking old assets

349
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,520
and creating new things out of them.

350
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,840
Something also on the table
as we look at focus areas

351
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,273
for this Space Prime initiative.

352
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,300
- [Liz] Well, I'd say if we don't have

353
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,670
any more questions here, we're
close enough to the end here

354
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:11,473
that we can call this
a close, I would say.

355
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:15,719
I would want to thank you here.

356
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:20,510
Gabe, Ken, Nicholas, and as well,

357
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:23,516
behind the slide deck here, Nancy,

358
00:15:23,516 --> 00:15:26,290
for bringing this session together

359
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:27,520
and making it happen today.

360
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,699
And also everyone

361
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:32,735
in the crowd who actually
showed up to participate.

362
00:15:32,735 --> 00:15:35,060
So I hope you have the rest
of your conference week

363
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,943
and you enjoy it thoroughly!

364
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,053
Thanks so much!
