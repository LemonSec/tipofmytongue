again, an overview here
of United States efforts

120

and NSA grant-based activities.

121
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,750
- Hello, well, thank you Margaret

122
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,360
for that nice introduction.

123
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,120
And we, I am so excited to be representing

124
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,250
the National Security Agency
at the RSA conference.

125
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,970
Welcome to all of the participants.

126
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:50,300
I'm excited to share
everything that we're doing

127
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,960
on behalf of our nation.

128
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,070
So just to set the scene
a little bit, right?

129
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:58,973
What is the federal government's
interest in cyber security?

130
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,580
Cyber security affects every single one

131
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,050
of us as Americans, right?

132
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:06,460
It affects our nation's national security,

133
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:08,810
it affects our economic security.

134
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:11,620
And so, we care, at the federal level,

135
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:14,470
about what the investments
are in terms of the pipeline

136
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:17,090
and filling the cyber security
gaps that are out there

137
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:19,010
in terms of not having enough

138
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:21,440
cyber security skilled professionals

139
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,230
to fill everything that we
need across all 50 states

140
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:29,250
in healthcare and at the
hospitals and the banks,

141
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:33,180
and transportation and energy and defense,

142
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,730
defense and intelligence
and telecommunications.

143
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:36,930
So we care about that.

144
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,210
So, there's been a number of initiatives

145
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:40,549
which I'm gonna talk about.

146
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:43,480
And I have the pleasure
of joining with me,

147
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,630
Eman from the University of West Florida.

148
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:49,150
And she's been an amazing
partner to the federal government

149
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:51,710
and also to the state level
community there in Florida

150
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:55,000
for everything that she's
doing to promote cybersecurity.

151
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,630
So the National Security Agency
has a couple of initiatives

152
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:00,020
which I'm gonna talk about,
and then the next slide

153
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:03,662
we'll be talking about how
UWF participates in that

154
00:07:03,663 --> 00:07:05,690
and has taken a leadership role.

155
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:07,433
So we're really grateful for that.

156
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,530
So the GenCyber.

157
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,840
So, what is GenCyber?

158
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:16,179
It is a camp that it usually
occurs in the summertime,

159
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,520
but not always, and it's a partnership

160
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,359
with the National Science Foundation.

161
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,260
The National Science
Foundation is an organization

162
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:27,010
that really sponsors R&D
across multiple areas

163
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:29,900
across the country, with universities,

164
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,950
with all different levels in terms

165
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:37,020
of creation and innovation.

166
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:40,099
So we started the GenCyber
camp about seven years ago.

167
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:43,930
We now have GenCyber camps in 48 states.

168
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:48,930
This year we'll be having
154 camps in 44 states

169
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:51,300
and the District of
Columbia and Puerto Rico,

170
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,750
and serving about 5000 students.

171
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:58,080
And it's all free of charge to
get kids excited about cyber,

172
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,246
so they can say, "Oh, that's
what cyber is, okay, great."

173
00:08:02,247 --> 00:08:03,920
And so you'll hear a
little bit more about that

174
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,670
in a couple of other slides.

175
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:08,500
We also started because
there's a national imperative,

176
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,440
right, to have a cyber
security degree program,

177
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,010
that we have cybersecurity professionals.

178
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:14,010
Well, 20 years ago,

179
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:17,190
universities didn't have
cyber degrees, right?

180
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,380
They didn't even exist.

181
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:21,270
There wasn't a curriculum,
there wasn't teachers.

182
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,630
So, it was really starting from scratch.

183
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,210
So 20 years ago, we started

184
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:27,909
this Centers of Academic
Excellence community,

185
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:30,690
which is a program where
we're saying, asking schools

186
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:33,740
to adopt the rigorous
standards that we need

187
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:36,400
to teach cybersecurity
in the areas of three

188
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,500
and three areas, cyber defense,

189
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,480
cyber operations and research.

190
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:45,430
And 20 years later, we now have
330 schools in the program.

191
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:46,839
So that's pretty exciting.

192
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,490
We also have two-year community
colleges in the program,

193
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:52,300
and we also have HBCUs

194
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,530
and minority-serving
institutions in the program.

195
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:56,990
So we're looking at
getting all hands-on deck,

196
00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:00,820
all 50 states, all abilities joining in.

197
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:04,430
The next initiative that started
with a bipartisan effort,

198
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:06,239
with the hill, they supported

199
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,640
a workforce development program.

200
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,430
So you're thinking workforce development.

201
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:12,489
That's more of cross-training,

202
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:14,720
it's not really the
younger kids coming in,

203
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,410
but it's usually, it's
more of an adult learning

204
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:20,300
and cross-training into cyber security.

205
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,189
So we have a great partnership with UWF.

206
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:24,520
They have a number of coalition's

207
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,189
and you'll be hearing from them,

208
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:30,270
and how they're recruiting
veterans and first responders

209
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:33,270
that wanna transition to
cybersecurity to keep giving back

210
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:35,810
because that's what cybersecurity
field is all about, right?

211
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:38,530
There's, it's people
that love to give back,

212
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:41,819
love to secure data,
love to secure people,

213
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,010
proprietary information,
it's pretty exciting thing.

214
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:46,420
So, kudos to all those

215
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:49,719
that are looking in to cross-training.

216
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,740
This is a program here

217
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,870
that will really help
you get that education.

218
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:55,730
The other thing that the
National Security Agency does

219
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:57,160
on behalf of the Pentagon,

220
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,430
is we offer a scholarship program.

221
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:01,040
And it's pretty exciting,

222
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,730
it's similar to a civilian
Cyber ROTC program,

223
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,550
where we'll pay you to go to school

224
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:10,319
at one of the 330 schools.

225
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,610
And with that, then you give
back after you get your degree.

226
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:14,890
So it's pretty exciting there.

227
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:16,880
So, if you're interested

228
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,830
in the DoD Cyber Scholarship program,

229
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:21,567
you can look up that
information off the nsa.gov,

230
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:23,530
and you can also look at someone

231
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:26,939
from the two-year
community colleges as well.

232
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:29,810
And then CEDI is what the
initiative that I mentioned to you

233
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:32,900
with minority-serving institutions, HBCUs.

234
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,990
So common goals and activities.

235
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:36,930
What you'll be hearing from us today about

236
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:38,750
is everything that we're trying to do

237
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:41,580
to support increasing the number

238
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,480
of skilled cybersecurity professionals

239
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,609
in this amazing profession that we have.

240
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:49,600
So, back to you Margaret.

241
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,600
- Thanks so much.

242
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,520
I think one of our next discussions here

243
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:57,410
is really highlighting UWF
and how this has really

244
00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:00,217
been an ideal program and a fit with UWF.

245
00:11:00,217 --> 00:11:03,630
Did you wanna kind of walk us
through these steps as well?

246
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,130
- Sure, I'd be happy to.

247
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:07,803
So, University of West Florida,

248
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:11,610
they're very much leaders in this field,

249
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:13,680
they have done a number of GenCyber camps

250
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,060
and I believe you'll see
later in this slides,

251
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:18,180
a couple of photos from their camps.

252
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,130
The camps are really K-12,

253
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:21,790
they can be focused on middle school

254
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:24,790
or high school, it could be all girls.

255
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:28,510
Their diversity population
is usually running about 46%

256
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:30,980
in terms of the diversity of our,

257
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:33,830
of the students that participate
in the GenCyber camps.

258
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:34,663
And then I mentioned

259
00:11:34,663 --> 00:11:37,540
the Cybersecurity Workforce
Development Program,

260
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,730
there's actually gonna be a slide on that,

261
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:42,170
which is really, really interesting

262
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,500
in terms of the cross-skilling

263
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,550
or what we're calling
really is up-skilling.

264
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:48,060
So that's the effort to up-skill.

265
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,839
And tremendous amount of interest

266
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:53,970
with the Veterans Administration,
the Labor Department,

267
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:57,620
Department of Education at
the state and federal level.

268
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,960
A lot of people looking
in apprentice programs,

269
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,390
how can we get people to cross-train

270
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:03,500
and get into these areas
that we'd need them?

271
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,700
They may not have the
skills, but you set them up

272
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,410
with really neat programs,

273
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:10,670
like the one that you'll hear from Eman,

274
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,610
and they get to cross-train

275
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:14,400
and get paid while they're doing it

276
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,100
and have the tuition paid for it.

277
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,410
And then they get to serve back

278
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:20,240
and they serve our country
and make us more secure.

279
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:25,240
So the country, we divide the
country the same way FEMA,

280
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,750
the emergency management organization

281
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,780
that just divides it
up in terms of regions.

282
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:35,230
So we have regions
throughout the country to,

283
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:38,470
that shepherd and
coalesce the universities

284
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:40,950
and the two-year colleges in that area.

285
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:44,520
So UWF is the lead for
the Southeast region,

286
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:47,210
which is actually a
fairly substantial region

287
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:49,300
in terms of the number of
states that's included,

288
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,680
and it incorporates Puerto Rico as well.

289
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,060
So they're the leader there.

290
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:55,290
They've also as it says here,

291
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:57,329
they started the WiCyS Florida chapter

292
00:12:57,330 --> 00:13:00,850
which encourages diversity
in cybersecurity right now

293
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:03,870
with only about 20%,
right now is in the area

294
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,280
of cybersecurity are females.

295
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,459
So we're trying to
increase gender diversity

296
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,770
as part of that all hands-on deck.

297
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:12,560
And then once you're a CAE
school, you get to partner

298
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,959
and be in the DoD Cyber
Scholarship program.

299
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,070
So their students get to get
access to the scholarships,

300
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:20,540
and they get to have the
Faculty Development Initiative

301
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:24,620
as well, where we'll pay for
their faculty to continue

302
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,970
to learn more about cybersecurity,

303
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:28,340
so they can then turn around

304
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:31,550
and teach cutting edge
network security, for example,

305
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:34,400
or reverse engineering or forensics,

306
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,920
the things that are, you
have to keep learning.

307
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,110
So we've invested in the
Faculty Development Initiative,

308
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,830
and once again, UWF is a partner there.

309
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:43,250
- And what's great is we've included,

310
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,310
thank you so much for that Diane,

311
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:47,829
a number of links within this presentation

312
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:49,020
that you'll have access to as well,

313
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:51,780
so where you can see the
National Security Agency links

314
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:55,033
as well as specific links for UWF as well.

315
00:13:56,896 --> 00:13:58,295
All right, so onto GenCyber.

316
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,939
- Yeah, so I'll let the
folks go to that link there

317
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,330
to have more information.

318
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:05,170
We develop and award the grants

319
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:06,810
but you actually sign up individually

320
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:07,819
across all your states.

321
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,060
So, the awards are just coming out now,

322
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:12,500
so, if you're in one of those 44 states

323
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,090
or the District of
Columbia or Puerto Rico,

324
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:15,330
you should go for it.

325
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:17,170
There's camps for visually impaired,

326
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:19,719
deaf or hard of hearing, ADHD.

327
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,610
We do have students from other states

328
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:24,580
literally travel to different
states to take the camp, so,

329
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:26,080
so go forward if you have a chance

330
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,420
and you have a young one
that you wanna encourage

331
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,170
to go into the cybersecurity field.

332
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,943
- Fantastic, thanks so much Diane.

333
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:37,190
Okay, so now we get to hear from Eman

334
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:39,700
in terms of creating a
culture and basically

335
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,920
what good things have been happening

336
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,160
with University of West Florida.

337
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,170
- Thank you Margaret,

338
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:45,339
and thank you Diane.

339
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:47,740
And it's such an honor
to be with both of you

340
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,880
and to highlight some of the things

341
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,610
that we are doing in partnership

342
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:54,310
with the National Security
Agency and the great work

343
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,729
that Diane is doing there

344
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:58,170
to create a culture of cyber security.

345
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:01,339
So, I wanna take just a
few minute to highlight

346
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,190
some of the ways that we're doing that

347
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:06,810
and really just emphasize that
it boils down to, as Margaret

348
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:09,920
and Diane have said already,
strategic partnerships.

349
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,810
How can we connect industry
and government with academia

350
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:15,609
and get everybody working together

351
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:18,470
and on the same page about the goals,

352
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:22,690
the resources and the programs
and make them scalable

353
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,880
to support national security

354
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,670
and to really kind of get
more involved and engaged?

355
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:31,569
And beyond that, secondly,
how do we develop innovative

356
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:34,410
and flexible programs, so that in addition

357
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:36,969
to the great academic
programs that we have

358
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:40,460
across the 330+ strong CAE schools,

359
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:43,930
we can also develop innovative
and flexible programs

360
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:46,120
to really address the critical shortage

361
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,500
of qualified cyber security professionals,

362
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,190
nationally and across the world.

363
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:53,100
So, if we could keep going,
I'd like to highlight

364
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,130
some of those examples.

365
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:57,130
Great, so, thank you Diane

366
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:59,860
for mentioning the national CAE

367
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:03,090
Cyber Security Workforce
development program.

368
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:05,720
We are so honored to be
leading this initiative

369
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,340
in partnership with the NSA.

370
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:10,340
With, the real focus of the program

371
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:13,740
is to significantly address that shortage

372
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,360
of qualified cyber professionals.

373
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:20,930
We now have over 500,000
unfilled cybersecurity positions

374
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:22,660
across the country.

375
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,620
And we are looking at an approach

376
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:28,530
that will build a national
scalable and sustainable model

377
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:31,530
for years to come to really
put a significant dent

378
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:34,490
in that number, if not altogether decrease

379
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:36,320
that number to zero.

380
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,850
More information is available
on the website there

381
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:40,540
as Margaret pointed out.

382
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,420
And to give our audience

383
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,620
kind of a little overview of the program,

384
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:48,280
it focuses on recruiting
transitioning military veterans

385
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,740
and first responders, those who bring

386
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:54,660
a great prior experience,
diverse skill sets,

387
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:58,120
and who already have a passion
for serving our country.

388
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:01,510
And the program will help
prepare them through training,

389
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:03,140
through hands-on skills development,

390
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:05,700
through career and
professional development,

391
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,560
to go into cybersecurity roles

392
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,720
in our critical infrastructure sectors.

393
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,569
Initially, we are focusing
on financial services,

394
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:17,179
defense, industrial base and energy,

395
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:19,569
and as we've seen with
the latest breaches,

396
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:24,569
there's no better time then to
engage our national citizens

397
00:17:24,849 --> 00:17:28,550
and service members and
personnel across the country

398
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:30,190
to really help prepare them

399
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:33,800
to support critical
infrastructure security.

400
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,620
Over the next three years,

401
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:37,250
we have a very lofty goal

402
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:40,980
than that is to train 1600 veterans

403
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:44,110
and first responders across
the country and help place them

404
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:47,149
into cybersecurity roles
across the country.

405
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:51,530
We are doing that in partnership
with a fabulous coalition

406
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:55,010
of CAE schools or Centers
of Academic Excellence

407
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:58,540
across the country, that
each have developed expertise

408
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,960
and success in workforce development.

409
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,817
So, from the University of
West Florida and South Florida

410
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:07,440
and Florida International
University on the East Coast

411
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,030
to Eastern New Mexico
University to San Antonio

412
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:14,530
and College and University
of Texas at San Antonio,

413
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:18,050
to Augusta University and
Dakota State University

414
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:19,230
and the University of Houston,

415
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:23,310
we've really kind of
reached broad and far,

416
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,270
north and south, east and
west across the country

417
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:28,040
to build a nationally scalable program.

418
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,870
More importantly, what
we're doing concurrently

419
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:34,189
is building the infrastructure
for a national program

420
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:36,850
so that, as Diane pointed
out, in future years

421
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:39,320
the goal is to make this available

422
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,040
to broader diverse populations

423
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,370
of women, underrepresented minorities,

424
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:48,199
other target populations and the public

425
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,940
across the country so that
they can up-skill and re-skill

426
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:54,470
and join the cybersecurity workforce.

427
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:57,466
And that over time we can
also expand this program

428
00:18:57,466 --> 00:19:01,570
to 330, going strong
we'll probably be at 400

429
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:04,520
by the end of the year, to CAE schools,

430
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:08,620
to engage them in offering
workforce development programs

431
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,479
in addition to their academic programs

432
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,320
and really make a significant dent

433
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,373
in the lack of qualified professionals.

434
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:20,220
So, I can keep going, I
could talk a little bit

435
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:23,460
about other kind of
programs that we've launched

436
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:26,930
to address the shortage and
really increase the number

437
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:29,110
of qualified cyber professionals.

438
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:31,060
A few years ago, we launched

439
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:33,300
the Cybersecurity for All program

440
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:36,430
and the website is there if
you'd like to check it out,

441
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:39,210
with a goal of enhancing readiness for

442
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:41,690
and filling cybersecurity jobs.

443
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:44,410
I have been for the last
couple of years passionate

444
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:46,500
about addressing the workforce crisis

445
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,010
that we keep hearing about nationally.

446
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:50,740
We wanna get as many people qualified

447
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,650
and into jobs as possible.

448
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:55,110
And this program not
only helps individuals,

449
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:58,560
it also helps organizations by identifying

450
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:02,280
how we can either up-skill
or re-skill their personnel

451
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,310
for evolving cyber roles.

452
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:07,710
As we see, many organizations are shifting

453
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:11,200
where rather than having a
large number of personnel

454
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,860
focused on IT, they need
more people qualified

455
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:17,429
in cyber security and
cyber defense topics.

456
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:20,710
Or many organizations are expanding

457
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:23,670
their cyber security personnel
and would like to up-skill

458
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:26,550
or re-skill people that they have

459
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:29,750
in order to fill those
work roles from within.

460
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:32,600
And so, the program is
designed to be agile

461
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:36,439
and flexible and cutting
edge to meet those goals.

462
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:40,010
And more importantly, we
also wanna focus on skills

463
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:43,940
and competencies, we always
hear from employers that,

464
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:46,970
what they are looking for,
the number one criterion is,

465
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:51,170
do individuals have the skills
for the job from day one?

466
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:54,330
And so we've launched the
program with an emphasis

467
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:57,610
on how do we engage and
develop hands-on skills

468
00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:00,129
and competencies using
the Florida Cyber Range

469
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:01,820
that we operate and maintain

470
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:04,070
at the University of West Florida.

471
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,399
So to give you an overview,

472
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,940
if we can move on to the next slide.

473
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:10,060
Since we've launched the program,

474
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:14,290
we have offered over 71 courses to,

475
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:17,960
close to 1500 individuals that are not

476
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:22,290
in academic degree programs
or degree seeking students,

477
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:25,830
these are individuals
within organizations,

478
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:29,990
in the general public, who
want to advance their skills

479
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:33,100
and get into or advance in
cybersecurity career roles.

480
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:36,080
And so we're thrilled
to partner with the NSA

481
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,770
to launch the Cybersecurity
for All program,

482
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:40,940
they helped make it possible

483
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:43,320
through their support in developing this

484
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,590
and the program that we just heard about,

485
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:47,470
as well the Cyber Workforce Development.

486
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:50,020
So they're really,
really leading the vision

487
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:53,850
for cyber education, training
and workforce development.

488
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:56,709
We're grateful for the
opportunity to work with Diane

489
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:58,860
and the National Cryptologic School

490
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,219
and really just help be the implementers

491
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,290
of the great vision that they have.

492
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:05,090
And through programs like this,

493
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:07,780
we're able to not only
support individuals,

494
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:11,160
but also organizations
such as, for example,

495
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,580
State of Florida Employees.

496
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:15,879
We've had a partnership with
the Florida State Government

497
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,020
to offer training to state personnel

498
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:20,970
across the Florida agencies
through a partnership

499
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:23,520
with the Florida Department
of Management Services,

500
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:28,170
and also provide a training
to elections personnel

501
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:31,300
and to supervisors of
elections across the state,

502
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,690
because that's an important area

503
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:35,340
of critical infrastructure
security as well.

504
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:37,629
And so, it's great that
we can kind of continue

505
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:40,270
to think about these flexible
and innovative programs

506
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:44,410
to really advance the knowledge
base in cybersecurity.

507
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:46,440
- I wanted to see if Diane
wanted to chime in here

508
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,640
because it's so impressive, it's so broad,

509
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:52,490
in terms of this sweep across the country,

510
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:54,570
obviously across Florida
in general for UWF.

511
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:58,470
But, did you wanna respond or
speak to this at all, Diane,

512
00:22:58,470 --> 00:22:59,817
in terms of critical infrastructure

513
00:22:59,817 --> 00:23:02,100
and the impact this has had?

514
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,080
- Yeah, that's wonderful.

515
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:07,520
Thank you Margaret for
giving me that question.

516
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,480
So, you have to fully appreciate

517
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,230
what you just heard from Eman,

518
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:15,380
because they really do
some amazing things,

519
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,870
and she says it was such ease

520
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:19,989
that you may not realize
that's it's incredible.

521
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:22,070
The work that they did
with the State of Florida

522
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:23,830
in terms of election security,

523
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:25,860
that was actually a significant event.

524
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,879
The work that they're
doing at the federal state

525
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:31,540
and local level is phenomenal.

526
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:33,690
It's not enough for the federal government

527
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:34,980
to be secure, right?

528
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:38,460
It's, we own the
infrastructure in the country.

529
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:41,860
We, as federally owned is
only a bit of maybe be 20%.

530
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:44,370
So 60 to 80% is in the private hands

531
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:46,040
or at the state and local level.

532
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,780
So, we have to have all
hands-on deck, right?

533
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:51,379
To come together and really say,

534
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:53,770
look at this very holistically.

535
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:56,129
So, the holistic approach
that you see here

536
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:59,440
with Cybersecurity for
All, is phenomenal, right?

537
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,970
That's how we as a nation are
going to secure our country.

538
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:06,810
It's us as a nation how
we're going to ensure

539
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:09,960
that our intellectual
property isn't stolen from us.

540
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:14,570
How we're going to ensure
that our vaccines are secure.

541
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:15,700
So it affects all of us.

542
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:18,650
So it's pretty interesting
though, the approach

543
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:21,200
that is taken in the
Cybersecurity for All program,

544
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,580
because it's really that,
it's that team effort

545
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,790
and the partnership
effort, and it's not enough

546
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:28,500
if I get the A at my
day job, it's not enough

547
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,780
if we do awesome on the defense systems

548
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:35,110
if you've got the water
system being hacked

549
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:37,040
or the energy grid being hacked

550
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,940
or the financial sector
having significant problems.

551
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,380
So, what's going on here

552
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,280
with the industrial
control system security,

553
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,480
I wanted to give a quick call out on that.

554
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,510
If you're not tracking, NSA does have

555
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:51,379
a second Twitter handle called NSA Cyber.

556
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:54,523
We do release a number
of alerts and threats,

557
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:58,390
saying hey, we're calling
them advisories I guess,

558
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:00,157
and they release these advisories to say,

559
00:25:00,157 --> 00:25:03,226
"Hey, something's going on,
we want you to pay attention,

560
00:25:03,227 --> 00:25:05,020
"shore up your defenses."

561
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:09,110
So last year in 2020, there
was a lot of attention

562
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:11,790
in the industrial control systems area,

563
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:14,170
we put out some alerts and
you'll be able to see those

564
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:16,690
about protecting operational technologies

565
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:19,470
and control systems against cyber attacks.

566
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:22,000
So, there was a number of cyber attacks,

567
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,530
were demonstrating their willingness

568
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:26,520
to conduct cyber attacks
against critical infrastructure

569
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:29,970
by exploiting internet accessible

570
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:32,100
operational technology assets.

571
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,610
So the older legacy
systems that were becoming,

572
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:37,120
were internet of things
connected to the internet,

573
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,080
were now vulnerable to
these sophisticated threats.

574
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,070
So we need people that
understand that, can teach it,

575
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:44,379
can teach the professionals

576
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:46,330
that may not have always been
thinking that way, right?

577
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:47,750
They may have only worked on the hardware

578
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,277
or the HVAC system.

579
00:25:49,277 --> 00:25:50,777
And here, they have to start thinking of,

580
00:25:50,777 --> 00:25:53,480
"Oh, my gosh, there's this
backdoor coming in here."

581
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,460
So, what's being done
across these 71 courses

582
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,570
is really significant for our country.

583
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:01,810
And we, it's important
and so it's exciting

584
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:04,780
that we have the opportunity
to talk about it at RSA

585
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:08,260
because I know everybody
at RSA is interested

586
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:11,310
in making sure that we
have the proper protections

587
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:13,379
in place in security.

588
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:15,530
- Right, Diane, thank
you so much for that.

589
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:20,683
Okay, onto, talk about outreach
and partnerships nationally.

590
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:24,830
- Great, thank you Margaret,
and thank you Diane,

591
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:28,449
I think it is, really, what
you just said highlights

592
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:32,220
the importance of partnerships
which really is the focus

593
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:34,430
of this session and kind of some examples

594
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:38,170
of some of the partnerships
and outreach activities here.

595
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:42,880
Because as Diane pointed
out, it's a moving target,

596
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,840
the cyber threat landscape
continues to evolve rapidly

597
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,929
and every time there's
a breach or an attack

598
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:50,010
we learn something new.

599
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:52,470
And so to be able to stay ahead of that,

600
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:55,790
requires strategic
partnerships and collaborations

601
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:58,740
among industry, among
government, among federal,

602
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:02,340
state government, local
government, and of course academia.

603
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,480
And so this just kind of
highlights some of the things

604
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,320
we've been doing to continue
to kind of build those bridges

605
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,950
and make those connections.

606
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:15,950
Such as, for example, our
UWF cyber ambassadors,

607
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,590
they are the best of our students,

608
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:18,709
we're so proud of our students,

609
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:22,730
that go out to visit schools,
K through 12 schools,

610
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:24,380
participate in community events,

611
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:27,470
they've been doing so
virtually over the last year

612
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:30,240
to really help just
spread cyber awareness,

613
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:35,010
cyber hygiene, and engage even
elementary school students

614
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:37,650
in cyber hygiene and cyber interest

615
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:40,160
and awareness from an early age.

616
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:43,400
We also are passionate about advancing,

617
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,510
broadening participation and
diversity in cybersecurity

618
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:49,620
and launched the Women in
Cybersecurity Florida affiliate

619
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:53,669
as an example to help bring
together mentors and mentees

620
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:57,110
and professionals and students
across the state who want

621
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:59,000
to support the advancement and recruitment

622
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,150
of women in cybersecurity.

623
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:04,070
And of course, we're thrilled to honor

624
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:05,929
and honored to partner with the NSA

625
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:09,520
to have hosted the CAE
Executive Leadership Forum

626
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:14,190
here in Pensacola a few, very recently

627
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:16,210
when we could still travel.

628
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:18,400
And that was a great
opportunity to really,

629
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,750
again, bring together the best minds

630
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:25,430
to advance cybersecurity,
and executives from academia,

631
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:27,630
industry, and of course from our federal

632
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:29,330
and state government partners.

633
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:31,750
And, I was wondering, Diane,
if you wanted to speak

634
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:34,440
or highlight anything about
ELF, we were so thrilled

635
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:37,390
to work with the NSA to
host that great event?

636
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:38,580
- Oh, yeah, that's wonderful.

637
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:42,500
So, that was really eye opening for me

638
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,630
in terms of the participation.

639
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:47,380
So, a lot of work went into place in terms

640
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:50,410
of inviting presidents of the 300 schools

641
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:53,610
that we have that serve as a
Center of Academic Excellence.

642
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:57,610
So you're talking about the
academic thought leaders

643
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:59,179
of phenomenal institutions

644
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:01,460
all coming together under one roof

645
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:04,190
in a very bipartisan way, all saying,

646
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:06,917
as you heard from Eman, "How can we help?

647
00:29:06,917 --> 00:29:07,857
"What can we do?

648
00:29:07,857 --> 00:29:09,230
"How can we make things better?"

649
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:12,330
And so, it was a great session
in terms of lessons learned,

650
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:13,929
what exciting things were coming.

651
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:16,160
I was able to talk about some
of the Federal initiatives

652
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,460
and grant programs that
were coming down the line

653
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:20,600
that we were going to
looking for their help on.

654
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,929
And then we had the pleasure,

655
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:23,760
you'll see at that the table there,

656
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,060
the blonde hair, that's
Dr. Martha Saunders,

657
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:27,850
she's the president of UWF.

658
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:29,969
And we also had the Lieutenant Governor

659
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:34,970
of the state of Florida, Ms. Nunez,

660
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:37,280
and then we also had the Governor

661
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:41,110
of the State of South Dakota, Kristi Noem.

662
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:43,490
So, that was pretty exciting
that you had Governors

663
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:47,270
in participation there,
we also have as you know,

664
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:49,990
as, I think I mentioned
before, a number of congressmen

665
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:52,250
and senators are incredibly supportive.

666
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:55,260
They all recognize that their
states have an interest here.

667
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:58,280
So, it's just a really
exciting area to be in

668
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:03,280
that we all have a common
core and common denominator,

669
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,913
and that is just to make
our country stronger.

670
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:09,990
- Wonderful, thanks so much,
Diane, for that as well.

671
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:13,350
So, Eman, back to you,
in terms of UWF camps

672
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:16,820
a lot happening there,
especially, again with the NSA.

673
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:20,360
- Yes, the, as Diane mentioned earlier,

674
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:24,050
the GenCyber program
is a fabulous program.

675
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:26,970
And I think great service for our country

676
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:31,070
to just be able to provide
that support to colleges

677
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:33,909
and universities to offer
camps across the country

678
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:36,030
where participants can participate

679
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:39,433
in great learning activities
and have fun at no cost,

680
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:43,300
because of the generous
support from the NSA and NSF

681
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,950
to support these GenCyber camps.

682
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:48,350
So, we've been really
kind of taking advantage

683
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:51,590
of participating in that
program and offering camps,

684
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:55,970
thrilled to offer camps the
last three or four years at UWF,

685
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:58,260
where we started with the students,

686
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:00,860
and you'll see their pictures
from our student camps.

687
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:04,000
And then you'll also see
pictures of our teacher camps,

688
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,830
because as Diane pointed out,
we need to get the teachers

689
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:08,639
and the faculty involved as well,

690
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,810
we need to get their expertise up-to-date.

691
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:12,360
And so, we wanted to make sure

692
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,370
that the K through 12
teachers were equipped

693
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:18,080
to then teach cyber security
in their classrooms.

694
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,919
This coming summer, we're
actually excited that next month

695
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,160
we are going to partner
with the Girl Scouts

696
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:27,350
to offer a camp for middle school girls

697
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:30,919
where they can earn Girl
Scout cyber security badges

698
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,890
as part of the camp.

699
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:35,200
We'll also be offering a teachers camp

700
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,140
for K through 12 teachers.

701
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:39,520
And we're gonna be doing both virtually

702
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,400
so that we can broaden participation

703
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,620
and continue to deliver cyber awareness

704
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:48,489
and cyber knowledge and skills
in this virtual environment.

705
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:49,323
- That's great.

706
00:31:49,323 --> 00:31:50,810
It sounds like a great collaboration.

707
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:52,870
Wonderful, thank you so much.

708
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:54,830
In our last final minutes,
I wanted to flash up again,

709
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:57,389
the contact information
slide that we have here

710
00:31:57,390 --> 00:32:01,450
and certainly we encourage
anyone to put questions

711
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:04,100
in on chat, those will be
answered after the fact

712
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,159
for any of these sessions
that are in the policy

713
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,267
and government track this year for NSA,

714
00:32:08,267 --> 00:32:10,360
but we strongly encourage these questions,

715
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,580
please feel free.

716
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:13,919
Again, they'll be answered after the fact.

717
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:17,060
But everyone's contact
information, everything's here

718
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,780
in terms of their Twitter handles,

719
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:20,389
but I wanted to give the last few minutes

720
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:24,890
to both Diane and also Eman to
give us some closing remarks.

721
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:25,930
Thank you.

722
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:27,520
- Great, no, thank you, Margaret.

723
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,840
So, if there's any question in your mind

724
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,310
that there's a federal imperative

725
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:34,510
to close the cyber security gap,

726
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:37,950
put that out of your mind,
because there is absolutely

727
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:41,070
a federal imperative, but
there's more than just that.

728
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:42,820
There is tremendous amount of energy,

729
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:45,970
tremendous amount of
momentum at the White House,

730
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:50,500
both the Senate and Congress,
all of the federal agencies,

731
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:53,560
most state governments are investing

732
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:56,120
in education and apprentice programs.

733
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,439
Everyone is really looking in this space.

734
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:03,050
So, if you're thinking,
something needs to be done here,

735
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:06,230
my guess is there's probably
something that is being done.

736
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:09,800
If you wanna join in, do
some research, and of course,

737
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,500
reach out to us if you
wanna find something

738
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:15,070
in your local space, because
if we get everyone involved,

739
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:17,909
we're just gonna be stronger as Americans

740
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:19,610
and our country is gonna be better for it.

741
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:24,449
So, we hope we spawned your
interest in getting excited

742
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:26,800
to give back, to get into
the field, to be a mentor

743
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,240
to help out with the camp.

744
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,803
And I thank you so much for
the opportunity, over to Eman.

745
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:33,913
- Thank you.

746
00:33:33,913 --> 00:33:36,250
Thank you again, Margaret and Diane,

747
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:38,340
it's been an honor to just be with you all

748
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,820
talking about these important topics.

749
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:41,840
And like you both mentioned,

750
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,330
there's a lot that's being done

751
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:45,179
and a lot that still needs to be done.

752
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:46,310
And as Diane just said,

753
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:49,560
we welcome all participation and support.

754
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:52,750
So please do reach out
to us if you'd like to,

755
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:56,180
whether you're employers
universities, colleges,

756
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:59,950
learners, donors, supporters,
advocates, volunteers,

757
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:03,900
we need everyone's
support to be successful

758
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:06,080
and to continue to lead in cybersecurity

759
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,370
and to make it a possibility
for our national security

760
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:12,500
and for every, and each
and every one of us.

761
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,533
And I always talk about the,

762
00:34:15,489 --> 00:34:17,819
of course the partnerships,
the strategic partnerships

763
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:21,150
and the the ABCs of cybersecurity.

764
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:26,130
So A be Adaptive, B, be
Bold, and C, be Creative.

765
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:28,840
And together we will make
a difference and continue

766
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:32,219
to kind of build a great
future for our country.

767
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:34,370
- Thank you both so much
for a great session.

768
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:36,359
And I hope this has been
beneficial for everyone

769
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:39,040
and we look forward to
your questions and comments

770
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,529
and have a great conference this year.

771
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:42,120
Thank you.

772
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,270
- Thanks, bye everybody.

773
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:44,800
Thank you for calling in.
