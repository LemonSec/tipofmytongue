1
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:02,349
- Hey, everyone.

2
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:03,970
My name is Angelique Carson

3
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:05,430
and I'm a journalist who's worked

4
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:08,650
in privacy for 15 or so years.

5
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:11,480
I'm so excited to be here to talk about

6
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:15,400
the session we've titled, Extreme
Makeover: Privacy Edition.

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,970
I can't think of three people
that I'd rather have talk

8
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:22,040
about all of this good stuff
with than our panelists today

9
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,849
who have agreed to join us,

10
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,673
season professionals in the field.

11
00:00:26,563 --> 00:00:28,531
So a bit more about myself.

12
00:00:28,531 --> 00:00:29,759
As I said, I'm a journalist.

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,840
I used to work

14
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,160
for the International Association
of Privacy Professionals

15
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,860
for many years and now I'm at Osano,

16
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:37,393
a privacy software company.

17
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,050
To give you an idea of
who our speakers are

18
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:43,180
and why they're relevant
and experts on the topic,

19
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:44,070
we're gonna talk to you today.

20
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,610
I'm gonna shoot it over to
them for some brief intros.

21
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:48,763
Let's start with Ron.

22
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,260
- Hey, everyone.

23
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,780
My name is Ron De Jesus.

24
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:55,310
I am the founder of De Jesus Consulting,

25
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:58,200
a boutique privacy consulting firm.

26
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,600
And I'm also currently the Head
of Global Privacy at Grindr,

27
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,123
the world's largest LGBTQ dating app.

28
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:07,773
- Excellent.

29
00:01:07,773 --> 00:01:09,969
Ruby, will you tell us a
little bit about yourself?

30
00:01:09,969 --> 00:01:10,801
- Sure, I'm Ruby Zefo.

31
00:01:10,802 --> 00:01:12,470
I'm the Chief Privacy Officer at Uber,

32
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:14,480
where I've been for about 18...

33
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,780
No, how long have I been there?

34
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:16,613
I don't know.

35
00:01:16,613 --> 00:01:18,440
Since 2018, COVID time.

36
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,280
I can't remember anything that happened

37
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,673
before about a year ago.

38
00:01:22,815 --> 00:01:25,740
(laughs) before that
I was a vice president

39
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,600
and Chief Privacy and Security
Counsel at Intel Corporation.

40
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,433
- I am Susan Hintze,

41
00:01:29,433 --> 00:01:32,210
and I am managing partner at Hintze Law.

42
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:35,330
We represent a number of tech companies

43
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:39,630
from small startups to
behemoth social media companies

44
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,550
and everything in between.

45
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:46,550
And prior to starting a
firm, I was also at Microsoft

46
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:51,290
as privacy counsel there
and privacy counsel at Dell.

47
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:52,610
And I'm also co-chair

48
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:55,940
of the RSA Conference
programming privacy track

49
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,420
with Angelique.

50
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,980
And happy to do that and happy
to follow in Ruby's footsteps

51
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:02,990
in that regard.

52
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:03,823
So happy to be here.

53
00:02:03,823 --> 00:02:05,899
- Oh yes, I forgot the
most important part,

54
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,713
I'm co-chair of privacy track for RSAC.

55
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,600
Okay, so let's dive
into the content today.

56
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,370
We're gonna chat for
about 35 or 40 minutes

57
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:16,020
and we have a lot to get through.

58
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,050
So just to give you an idea

59
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:19,330
of what you're gonna get out of today,

60
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:21,270
whether you work in
security and you wanna learn

61
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:24,050
about privacy or you're new to privacy

62
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:25,820
or you've been in the
field for a few years

63
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:29,010
and need to make some changes
to keep pace with legislative

64
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:32,690
and technology improvements, if you will,

65
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:33,930
what we aim to do in the session

66
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:37,030
is to deliver some tips
you can use at your job.

67
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:39,020
Because what we know is
that whether you're starting

68
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:42,100
a program from scratch
or revamping your program

69
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,000
to comply with emerging laws,

70
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,920
privacy compliance is a constant pivot.

71
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,829
So we know that a lot
of privacy professionals

72
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:54,350
have explained that it
can be really difficult

73
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:57,570
to get what you need in terms
of whether that's budget

74
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:59,253
or support or whatever.

75
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,580
Let's start with Ruby on this question.

76
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,840
Can we talk about when you're
either building or growing

77
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,170
or pivoting your privacy program,

78
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:12,640
how important is it to
establish a tone from the top?

79
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,570
- Yeah, it's really important,
really, for any kind of,

80
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,680
I would call it a compliancy
role, if you will.

81
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,870
It can really grease the wheels for you

82
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:23,990
when you get a positive tone
from the top without it.

83
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:25,860
It can undermine your credibility,

84
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:29,550
your ability to influence,
your ability to get resources.

85
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,450
And you also don't wanna be viewed

86
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:34,459
as the proverbial roadblock
especially if, like me,

87
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,240
you're an attorney.

88
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,390
But then the question is,
let's say you do get tone

89
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:41,190
from the top, then what do you do with it?

90
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,609
And I think what you have
to do is multiply the tone

91
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:47,440
from the top by really working
well across the organization.

92
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,530
People like us have very horizontal jobs,

93
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,720
so we have a lot of different stakeholders

94
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,900
that we have to work with.

95
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:57,260
So, I like to do that even
though I'm in a compliancy-type

96
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:00,370
of role with the carrot
as well as the stick.

97
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:03,870
And I hear a lot of the stick,
do this or the law does that.

98
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:07,270
But I try to use analogies and stories

99
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:08,770
that help people understand

100
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:11,250
how privacy can be built
into things in a way

101
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,250
that makes a better product
that makes it more attractive.

102
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,940
I've had presentations
with product developers

103
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,890
where I don't even mention
the word compliance

104
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,149
or the law ones.

105
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:22,159
So know your audience,
observe what matters to them.

106
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,130
Try to come up with stories
and analogies that work.

107
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:27,450
Benchmark because they always ask, well,

108
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,020
what are other people doing?

109
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,060
Use real cases.

110
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,210
And then while you're teaching,

111
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:33,567
you're also learning about them as well.

112
00:04:33,567 --> 00:04:35,223
And so it's a two-way street.

113
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:39,960
- Those are all really
good benefits of having

114
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,520
that and having been
at places that have it,

115
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,580
and don't have it and working
with clients that have tone

116
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:49,592
from the top and don't,
or struggling to get that.

117
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,929
Sometimes you don't have
much of a choice for a while.

118
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:56,350
And in the meantime, you
wanna try and communicate

119
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:58,180
as many times as you can to the top

120
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,473
and help educate them about privacy.

121
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:04,100
You ideally wanna do that in a way

122
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:07,652
that doesn't involve a
catastrophe happening first.

123
00:05:07,652 --> 00:05:10,060
Unfortunately, that
sometimes has to happen.

124
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,880
And, so I always tell my clients
when those things happen,

125
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:17,407
well, silver linings, now
you'll get some budget (laughs).

126
00:05:17,407 --> 00:05:21,169
And they're like, oh yeah,
that is a good thing.

127
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:24,490
And so when catastrophe
hits, take advantage of that.

128
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,620
And get in front of the C-suite

129
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,780
and get in front of the
board, tell the story,

130
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,179
explain what resources you could have had

131
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,010
to prevent this in the first place.

132
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:38,493
And that can help their
resources come and flow.

133
00:05:39,361 --> 00:05:42,210
But otherwise, having
that tone from the top

134
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:44,650
and educating your C-suite
so that they understand

135
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,750
these issues that they're
communicating it down

136
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,790
to their management and
team members and everyone

137
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:53,020
down the road, is really just critical.

138
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,380
And you may not be able
to get there right away

139
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:58,150
and in the meantime may
have to cobble along

140
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:00,510
with whatever you can do.

141
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:05,240
But what are opportunities
you have to elevate that?

142
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,120
Take advantage of those, push for those

143
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,330
and that will help people understand.

144
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:13,409
Bring them the stories, the
scariest stories you're seeing

145
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:15,940
about their competitors and
the things that they're doing.

146
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,830
And I think that's another angle is,

147
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:20,840
whenever you can tie privacy compliance

148
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,429
to a competitive advantage
or a feature in a product

149
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:28,030
rather than a roadblock to a product,

150
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:30,179
those can all bring goodness to things.

151
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:33,400
And once they recognize that, they can...

152
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,940
That gives you a lot more
credibility and value

153
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:40,090
and can help you get the
resources you need as well.

154
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:41,950
- Yeah, and I'll just
quickly add, Angelique,

155
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:45,539
and I have to say that these
perspectives are my own.

156
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:49,510
But I think you're likely...

157
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:52,300
Nobody's gonna care if you
don't have that executive way

158
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,080
to your messaging and
that executive buy-in.

159
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,280
And I think it's really key

160
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,619
in terms of where that
messaging is coming from.

161
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,220
So someone at the director level sending

162
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:04,360
out an enterprise-wide
message on your mandate

163
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:09,360
might not come as forcefully
as the CEO really pushing

164
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:11,229
that message down and making

165
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:14,533
it an organization-wide priority.

166
00:07:15,404 --> 00:07:16,600
And that's what I've done in the past

167
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,760
in terms of when I first
get into these roles

168
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,890
is really get on the
executive team's calendar

169
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:24,650
to tell them who I am and what my mandate

170
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:26,239
is and why I'm actually important

171
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,890
or our privacy compliance is important.

172
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:30,580
Because then you get
that executive weight,

173
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:34,877
you get that buy-in from the
top and it's easy to be able

174
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,800
to wield the stick, if
you will, if you need to.

175
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,029
So I think that's really key.

176
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:43,640
- All of you have worked
at various companies,

177
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,460
but as a follow-up, Ron,
I would just ask you,

178
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:48,229
has it been easy to get time
on executives' calendars

179
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,063
like that?

180
00:07:49,063 --> 00:07:52,110
Are you able to get visibility
in front of the CEO?

181
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:55,993
- I think it depends definitely
on the size of the company.

182
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:01,300
Previous to Grindr, I was at Match Group,

183
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,670
which was quite a large company.

184
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:07,670
And so getting time on
the Tinder CEO's calendar

185
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:10,440
was a challenge, but I got 15 minutes.

186
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:14,340
I had my spiel with him and
the next day he sent out

187
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:18,000
a company-wide email really
emphasizing the importance of...

188
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,490
And this was pre GDPR.

189
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:24,270
So we were in the midst of
preparing for that onslaught

190
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,469
of privacy regulations.

191
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:28,840
So it was really key for
me and yet difficult.

192
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,099
But I think finagling your way

193
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:35,659
into a C-level person's
calendar's just the way to go

194
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:36,709
and the way to start.

195
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,299
- I think starting with
goodness on that is a good way

196
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:42,659
to get the CEOs on board.

197
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:45,760
So rather than giving them
the bad messages to convey,

198
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,513
anytime there's like a win
that has to do with privacy,

199
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:52,210
that's when people at the top want

200
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:54,050
to be the ones delivering the message.

201
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:56,010
And so if can kind of train them

202
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:58,110
to deliver the good messages,

203
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:03,110
then you can also help get them
on board with training them

204
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:06,280
to, and encouraging them to also deliver

205
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,422
sort of the more compliance-type messages

206
00:09:09,422 --> 00:09:11,072
that you need to deliver as well.

207
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,560
- It might be a pivot of
the business too, right?

208
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,449
So I took this role at
Intel after many years

209
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:20,660
of doing other types of legal work

210
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:24,040
because the roadmap relatively quickly,

211
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,219
which is not unusual for
the company if you followed

212
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:29,480
it for a long time, but
relatively quickly pivoted

213
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,550
from B2B to B2C.

214
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:33,290
We bought Wearable Spain Company.

215
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:35,699
We bought McAfee security
software company.

216
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,180
We were gonna develop a set top box

217
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,420
which was kind of a precursor

218
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,860
to all the streaming we enjoy now,

219
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:44,550
but it was supposed to be a way
to enable your own streaming

220
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,839
of the content that you
wanted instead of being locked

221
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,170
into cable companies.

222
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:51,530
And so, all of a sudden this stuff falls

223
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:53,560
and it creates a whole different set

224
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,319
of concerns and compliance
for the company.

225
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,640
And so, accepting the
role kind of came along

226
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:05,640
with the desire to build a
new group and a new specialty

227
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:12,370
and a much more robust
support team that would

228
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:14,793
then report out to the
C-suite and the board.

229
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,230
And that included the security team too.

230
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:21,397
We supported both the privacy

231
00:10:21,397 --> 00:10:23,430
and the cyber security team on there.

232
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:24,979
All their legal needs (laughs).

233
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,410
- And a little bit later in this session,

234
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:28,920
we'll kinda talk about how the privacy

235
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,520
and security teams can work together

236
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,180
and sort of leverage each other's work.

237
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:36,250
Ron, maybe you can get
a status on this one.

238
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:39,450
Are privacy programs one-size-fits-all?

239
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:41,930
Could I just look at any
company's privacy program

240
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:44,530
and say I'm gonna recreate that at my own

241
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:46,823
or how do you rightsize it?

242
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,350
- Yeah, absolutely not.

243
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:51,270
They're definitely not one-size-fits-all.

244
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:53,710
And you can definitely
leverage the learnings.

245
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:54,960
I think all three of us have been

246
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:58,830
in this business long enough
to have in our back pocket

247
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:03,290
a set of privacy compliance
programmatic elements

248
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:07,829
that we know need to be
integrated into a company.

249
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:11,280
I'd like to start with the good old AICPA

250
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,720
generally accepted privacy
principles as a starting point,

251
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,860
but we also have more
mature resources now.

252
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:22,080
It's like such as, 2020's
NIST Privacy Framework,

253
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,891
which takes this concept of maturity

254
00:11:24,891 --> 00:11:26,703
and rightsizing it for your company.

255
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:31,160
So, again, I have in
my back pocket a sense

256
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,310
of what I need to do, but
I'm definitely looking

257
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:36,569
at jurisdictional geographic footprint,

258
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:40,770
exactly what the company's
collecting resources.

259
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:44,130
Am I a team of one versus a team of 10?

260
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:45,710
So there's all these different criteria

261
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:50,350
that are gonna feed into making
a program fit for purpose.

262
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:55,070
And also, in terms of
understanding addressing

263
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:58,410
the risk appetite of the executive team,

264
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:01,533
that's all very different,
smaller versus bigger companies,

265
00:12:02,491 --> 00:12:03,600
companies that are again B2B

266
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,810
and not much lower privacy
risks that are direct B2C

267
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,939
organization that might be collecting

268
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:12,150
sensitive personal
information, for example.

269
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,959
So, yeah.

270
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:17,910
Long story short, no, and it
depends on all these factors

271
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:21,290
that I'm sure Ruby and Susan
will opine on even more.

272
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:22,193
So, no.

273
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:24,816
- Yeah, it's--

274
00:12:24,816 --> 00:12:26,263
Go ahead, Ru...

275
00:12:26,263 --> 00:12:27,396
- Go ahead, Susan.

276
00:12:27,396 --> 00:12:28,785
(Ruby and Susan laughing)

277
00:12:28,785 --> 00:12:30,641
- Oh, I was gonna say that, yeah,

278
00:12:30,641 --> 00:12:33,719
the one-size-fits-all doesn't work

279
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,690
and sometimes you'll see
products and services

280
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:41,580
out there that people are
hocking that like, oh,

281
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,300
if you just use this tool,

282
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,800
you're gonna be compliant with GDPR.

283
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,520
No, it doesn't really work that way.

284
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,303
Even some of the law firms I've worked at,

285
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:54,300
partners who don't know
anything about privacy will say,

286
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:57,020
well, this client needs privacy policy.

287
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,439
That's all they need.

288
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,510
No, that's not it.

289
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:02,270
You don't just put up a privacy policy

290
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:03,973
for every company and you're done.

291
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:06,240
That's the tip of the iceberg.

292
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,460
There's all these other things you need

293
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,030
to do behind the scenes.

294
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:11,120
But then having worked with...

295
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,440
Most of my initial privacy
experiences working

296
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,863
at large companies where
you had some resources,

297
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:19,140
it was sort of early days back at Dell.

298
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,470
It was still early days in privacy

299
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:22,380
and they didn't really get what that was.

300
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:26,790
And we were luring people
into trainings with pizza.

301
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:29,990
So, we didn't have the budget.

302
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:33,430
We would convince product
teams to put up a poster

303
00:13:34,322 --> 00:13:35,930
for awareness, it had to do with privacy

304
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:38,640
and beg and control.

305
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,439
I worked with Jill Phillips

306
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:45,080
who is one of the very
early privacy professionals.

307
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:50,080
And she would sing songs that
she had written about privacy

308
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:54,210
as her means to train people.

309
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:56,000
Not a skill that I have.

310
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,330
If you have that skill, that's great.

311
00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:01,040
But her "Can-Spam" song
was just fantastic,

312
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,002
I just have to say.

313
00:14:03,303 --> 00:14:04,970
So there's a variety of
different things you can do

314
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:07,640
to rightsize that for your organization.

315
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:11,620
But what I tell my clients,
get all the basics in place

316
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:15,740
if you're starting off
and you're still small.

317
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:20,740
Don't worry about making it
some deluxe perfect thing.

318
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,090
Sometimes, particularly,
lawyers will get hung up

319
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:26,250
on having every single thing be perfect

320
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:29,130
and just get it done, get it in place,

321
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:29,963
even if it's starting.

322
00:14:29,963 --> 00:14:32,319
And remember, it's a
journey, not a destination.

323
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,760
What you start with
will build on over time

324
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,010
and you can keep making
it better and better.

325
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:42,350
But if you're a small company,

326
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:44,190
you don't need a Cadillac
to get where you're going,

327
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:45,140
you just need a golf cart.

328
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:50,140
And so, rightsizing things is
important as far as that goes.

329
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,449
- I was just gonna
kinda take it up a notch

330
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:54,760
to some of the basics you need to consider

331
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,710
when you're rightsizing.

332
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:57,230
Like, what's your brand in this space?

333
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,180
Are you all in for privacy?

334
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,430
Are you gonna try to
get all the data you can

335
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:03,209
while the getting is good until the law

336
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:04,740
is changing somewhere in the middle?

337
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:05,930
Does the law even apply?

338
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:06,959
If you're really small,

339
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,080
certain number of laws
don't actually even apply

340
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,690
to you or certain components of the laws.

341
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:14,330
What does reasonable
risk-based approach look like?

342
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:17,510
Ron alluded to your
risk tolerance as well.

343
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:18,420
Have you benchmarked?

344
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:21,160
And, I get this question no
matter what size of company,

345
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:21,992
what is everybody else doing?

346
00:15:21,993 --> 00:15:23,880
Have you benchmarked as to what
your competitors are doing?

347
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,230
You wanna look like the outlier

348
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:28,210
or be low-hanging fruit for a regulator?

349
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:30,980
So, you look at these
higher risk elements,

350
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:33,120
you look at the importance to the business

351
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,770
and then you look at the
external visibility too, right?

352
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:38,460
Like, is it gonna be something
someone's gonna notice

353
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,293
and complain about?

354
00:15:39,293 --> 00:15:41,070
That's really a practical issue

355
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:42,680
but it's very important to
be (indistinct) something

356
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,150
that's not really gonna bother anybody,

357
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:47,310
even if it's kind of
on the cusp of the line

358
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:48,420
or pushing the envelope.

359
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,599
How obvious are these things?

360
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,650
Do you have resources to defend
them if people notice them?

361
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:55,800
And then who are your most
important stakeholders?

362
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,632
Is it customers?

363
00:15:56,633 --> 00:15:57,466
Is it shareholders?

364
00:15:57,466 --> 00:15:59,760
Is it investors, regulators?

365
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,790
Which one rules if there's
disagreement in the stakeholder's

366
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:04,310
opinions of what the right thing to do is?

367
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:06,479
So those are small practical questions

368
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,630
you could ask yourself.

369
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,760
- Those are great points, Ruby.

370
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,370
Susan, can you talk to us a little bit

371
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:15,830
about how privacy and security
professionals can work

372
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:17,150
on training and awareness.

373
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:20,079
I know you mentioned you
were giving out pizza

374
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,070
and to be honest I would come
let you train me on anything

375
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:25,790
if there was pizza, especially
if there was pineapple on it,

376
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:27,449
which I know is controversial.

377
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:29,520
Can you talk to us about
some methods that you found

378
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,770
to be successful to kind
of help evangelize privacy

379
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:37,460
within a company maybe establish
some privacy ambassadors?

380
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,293
- Yeah.

381
00:16:38,293 --> 00:16:42,050
Working with security, if you
have a strong security team

382
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:43,660
in place at your organization,

383
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:46,829
they can be some of your
strongest ambassadors.

384
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:48,930
Privacy intersects with data security,

385
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:50,270
they understand data protection

386
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:53,030
at least at the security level.

387
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:55,430
And oftentimes they may
have already done a lot

388
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:56,757
of things that you can leverage.

389
00:16:56,758 --> 00:17:01,758
So get to be good friends with
your security professionals

390
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:06,430
even if that's not in your
remit and your job is privacy

391
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:08,030
and that's it, and you're not...

392
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,829
Somebody else's handling data security,

393
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:14,889
you better be really good
friends with that person.

394
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:19,640
Buy them pizza, take them
out for coffee and beers

395
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,339
and drinks, whatever you
need to do because they will

396
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:25,240
be able to carry your water
for a lot of the things

397
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,390
that you might need to do.

398
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:31,390
For example, many parts of a
good data protection program

399
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:34,399
and privacy program involve
doing a data inventory,

400
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,000
your data security team has
probably already done that.

401
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,640
And if they haven't, you
might wanna point out

402
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,890
to some security laws if they don't

403
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:43,540
have a security person advising them.

404
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:47,600
And then another area that
I can think of is incidents.

405
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,010
So you might be able to leverage

406
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:52,733
their incident response
plan for privacy incidents.

407
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,610
And another area that I can
think of would be reviews.

408
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:00,659
They may already have a
security review process.

409
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:03,190
So before an app launches
or a product launches

410
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:04,570
or a feature launches,

411
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:07,550
may be it has to go
through a security review.

412
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:09,770
Tack on some privacy stuff to that.

413
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:12,690
So, it's already part
of a process that exists

414
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:14,320
so you don't have to create something new.

415
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:18,123
And so all those things
are really critical.

416
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:22,320
Again, even if, as a privacy professional

417
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,120
that's not your lane, those
are your best friends.

418
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,520
You better get to know them.

419
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:32,090
- Yeah, and I would say
also that (clears throat),

420
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:35,790
security teams are almost
always bigger than privacy.

421
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:39,170
I think that's a given, they're
not necessarily more mature

422
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:40,870
but they definitely have more resources.

423
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:45,679
And I think to Susan's point
leveraging their resources

424
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:49,630
and capacity as much as possible
especially with training,

425
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:53,000
as you've mentioned, like there's a sense

426
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,000
of training fatigue where you
might have security course

427
00:18:58,860 --> 00:18:59,810
versus privacy.

428
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:02,429
So why not piggyback as much as you can?

429
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:07,430
I think that's really helpful
because outside of compliance,

430
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:09,210
us as compliance professionals

431
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:11,430
we understand clear
differences between security

432
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:14,560
and privacy, but your
stakeholders and employees

433
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:18,190
at large might just see one
thing and it's important

434
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:21,370
that they know the
differences but attacking them

435
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:24,729
with a multitude of different trainings

436
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,690
at different times doesn't really help.

437
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:30,390
And I would also say in
terms of ambassadorship

438
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:32,830
and getting folks to be privacy liaison,

439
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:35,110
even formalizing that role.

440
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:37,740
So calling someone a privacy ambassador

441
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:40,830
or saying that you've been bestowed

442
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:43,330
with this privacy liaison
role really helps.

443
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:47,372
I think people are more
apt to or more open

444
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:54,100
to increased responsibilities
when there's a formalization

445
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,179
of that in their role or their title.

446
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:58,060
So I'd like to use that to...

447
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:00,190
Like privacy champion, for example.

448
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:01,890
It really helps them take ownership

449
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:04,453
of that role and those
responsibilities as well.

450
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:08,370
- Yeah, we have a privacy
champions program,

451
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:10,669
and we have a really big one actually,

452
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:12,350
it's even post pandemic,

453
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:14,129
I think up to almost 300 people,

454
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,840
but they're all over the business,

455
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,270
they get dedicated trainings,

456
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:19,670
they get actual tasks to do.

457
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:21,450
If they perform at a certain level,

458
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:23,840
like they push a certain amount of things

459
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,139
into the privacy impact
assessment process,

460
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,790
for example, their incentives,

461
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:31,173
they can earn a really cool bomber jacket.

462
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:35,030
We have contests, we pay
for their certification,

463
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:35,950
and if they have an interest,

464
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:38,670
it's very popular an IPP certification,

465
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:39,503
they get...

466
00:20:39,503 --> 00:20:40,939
Their management has visibility into it,

467
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,840
they get a spreadsheet
with who's participating,

468
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,379
and that can help them
with their annual review.

469
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,920
So there's a give but there's also a get,

470
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,470
as Ron was sort of alluding to.

471
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:51,220
- Aside from privacy ambassadors,

472
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,010
I wanna make sure that we hit this point,

473
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:55,950
maybe I can turn to Ruby for this one.

474
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:58,650
Have you found that there are often times

475
00:20:58,650 --> 00:20:59,950
when you don't have to sort

476
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:03,490
of reinvent the wheel in terms of some

477
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:05,840
of the ground that security
teams have already gained

478
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,580
and being able to leverage their work

479
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,159
with the privacy team?

480
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,440
- Yeah, absolutely.

481
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,360
In fact, I was in Intel
Corporation before Uber.

482
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,979
And you can imagine a chipmaker

483
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:19,700
has a really robust security
development lifecycle

484
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,750
that was already in place.

485
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:24,040
And so when these movements
started really coming afoot,

486
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,060
and we just with time

487
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,980
and privacy becoming more important,

488
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:30,470
we were very able to put
the privacy touch points

489
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:31,400
in the design process

490
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,980
in the existing security
development lifecycle process,

491
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:35,420
so that the engineers would not have

492
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,310
to go through a completely
different process

493
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,510
to do those things.

494
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:39,760
We found the right places

495
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,230
where we thought we could embed that,

496
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:43,150
and then there was one process for that.

497
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:44,890
And it's not really
that different at Uber,

498
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:47,020
we have the same intake process,

499
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,370
we work very closely

500
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:50,010
with the privacy engineering team,

501
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:51,370
they take the technical questions,

502
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:53,139
we take the legal questions,

503
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:56,610
and that's more beneficial to everybody.

504
00:21:56,610 --> 00:22:01,080
And then also the intake is also connected

505
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:01,913
to the engineering product

506
00:22:01,913 --> 00:22:05,790
and product development processes.

507
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:09,370
So they have their own and
that feeds into our process.

508
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:11,020
If you're not in one of those,

509
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:13,550
you're not making an engineering project

510
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:17,889
or a product, like a marketing
person has a new initiative,

511
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:20,210
then you just use the
separate standalone form

512
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:21,750
that our group can provide to you.

513
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:24,340
But it feeds through all
these other processes,

514
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:26,610
which is very helpful
to the people using it.

515
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:28,020
And it's become so popular

516
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,510
that now other groups
wanna use our process like

517
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:33,879
for fairness and equality,
where we wanna evaluate things.

518
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:37,230
It's an easy intake to then go evaluate

519
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,380
what you're getting inputted.

520
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:41,310
So you should absolutely
be searching for ways

521
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:42,510
to make things more efficient

522
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:45,050
and make things stand
for more than one thing

523
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:46,693
through the same intake.

524
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,033
- Yeah, Angelique,

525
00:22:49,033 --> 00:22:51,000
and this is actually Ruby's last comment

526
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,000
was a good segue into my
perspective of expanding

527
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,189
that even further.

528
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:58,320
So not even just looking

529
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,129
to leverage the security
functions current processes,

530
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:04,030
but so for example, in tech,

531
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:07,180
obviously if you're working
with engineers and product,

532
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:10,490
they're probably gonna
be using an Atlassian

533
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:11,930
tool like JIRA and Confluence.

534
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:14,550
So, I think it's important to not

535
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:17,310
only utilize those existing tools,

536
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:19,010
because your current
stakeholders are gonna

537
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:22,670
be using them too, but then
also it will save money

538
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:24,380
in terms of why do you need

539
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:28,700
that specific third party privacy
program management vendor,

540
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:33,410
if a, it's just another
hurdle in terms of a process

541
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:35,200
that somebody has to learn,

542
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,080
why not integrate and use a tool

543
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,629
that your current
stakeholders are already used

544
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:42,600
to that's in-house that you can control?

545
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,770
So I think it's through this point,

546
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:46,840
looking at all the different synergies

547
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,810
across your organization

548
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:50,423
in terms of processes
that are really key too.

549
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:53,250
- Great.

550
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:56,560
Ruby, in your experience at
Uber and at Intel before that,

551
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,179
et cetera, how important would you say

552
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:02,010
it is to measure your privacy program?

553
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:02,997
Why is that important?

554
00:24:02,997 --> 00:24:06,600
And do you have any tips on how to do so?

555
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,719
- Yeah, I mean, there's...

556
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,310
I've worked with a lot of executives

557
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:11,970
who say things like, you
get what you measure.

558
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:13,810
If you don't measure it,
people won't perform.

559
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:15,330
I don't know if that's absolutely true

560
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:17,010
but I do think it's really important.

561
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:18,260
And it's hard in these fields

562
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,990
because in security and privacy,

563
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:21,970
sometimes what you're trying
to do is prove them negative,

564
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:23,710
nothing bad happened.

565
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:24,680
So there are two ways.

566
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,830
First of all, you can show
all the work that goes

567
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:29,220
into not making something bad happen.

568
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,780
We used to have this slide we would show

569
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,460
to the board or to C-Suite,

570
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:35,330
which would show everything
from the malware detected

571
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:37,919
and avoided to successful consultations

572
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,880
with data protection, whatever it is.

573
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,290
You've got all kinds of things that went

574
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:44,409
into a bad thing not happening
that you can measure.

575
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:47,640
The other way are just
statistics like for example,

576
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,300
with the privacy impact assessment,

577
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,280
with privacy or security by design.

578
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,720
There's a lot of food for thought

579
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,180
there where you can evaluate
how many are coming in,

580
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:58,020
how long it's taking to turn them around,

581
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,260
where they're coming from.

582
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:02,000
Oh my gosh, this one group
is sending a bunch through,

583
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,070
maybe they need some training,

584
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,240
or maybe they're sending a bunch through,

585
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,170
but only a few make it actually

586
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:07,770
into a privacy impact assessment

587
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:09,180
or a security impact assessment

588
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:12,210
because they are just
sending everything through.

589
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:14,250
Well, they need to (laughs)
things through, all right?

590
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:16,740
Or maybe somebody has
the highest risk ones

591
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,200
and you're like, okay, we better focus,

592
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,033
that's the highest risk,

593
00:25:19,033 --> 00:25:20,490
you need to focus more
of our resources on them.

594
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:23,640
So you get a lot of insight
on where you should spend

595
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,920
your resources from looking
at those types of statistics.

596
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:30,080
You can also grade overall
program maturity and wellness.

597
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,820
There are all kinds of maturity

598
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:34,220
program grading systems out there.

599
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,610
You can have internal audit,

600
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:37,990
they will typically wanna
come in and take a subset

601
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:39,900
of something and grade it.

602
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:42,330
We do internal and external assessments

603
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:45,590
of security programs, in particular.

604
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:48,850
You can evaluate how your
incident management is going,

605
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:50,399
you can do quarterly business reviews

606
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,070
where you're just teeing up a big problem

607
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:55,120
that you solve that may
otherwise go unnoticed.

608
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,409
You can do post mortem,

609
00:25:56,410 --> 00:25:59,130
a (indistinct) on learning
something from a bad thing

610
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:01,170
or a failure, which are also important.

611
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:02,640
You can do your training stats,

612
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,423
and you can do brand surveys,

613
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:07,860
what's the awareness of
privacy with your company now,

614
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:08,860
and I'll do a bunch of stuff

615
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:10,209
in a year from now, re-evaluate.

616
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:11,460
Those are just some ways.

617
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,013
- Yeah.

618
00:26:15,013 --> 00:26:17,899
And also to Ruby's point, Angelique,

619
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:21,260
in terms of privacy
metrics are not super sexy.

620
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,290
Like, we're a call center.

621
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:23,123
So it's like--

622
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:24,110
- Oh, come on Ron.

623
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:26,294
(Ron and Susan laughing)

624
00:26:26,295 --> 00:26:28,050
- (indistinct) guy from Grindr would think

625
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:29,188
everything is sexy.

626
00:26:29,189 --> 00:26:30,022
(indistinct)

627
00:26:30,022 --> 00:26:31,250
- Well, I think his Tinder for sex

628
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:32,376
is a little higher than ours.

629
00:26:32,376 --> 00:26:34,490
(Susan and Ron laughing)

630
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:37,130
- Yeah, I mean, to be honest with you,

631
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:38,760
when I tell the exact team

632
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,760
that we've done 10 DPIAs

633
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,320
and there's crickets at
the end, they're like,

634
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,857
it was exciting for me to say,

635
00:26:45,857 --> 00:26:47,379
and it was exciting for our team,

636
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:50,120
but so what we try to do is look

637
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:54,139
at it in terms of how
have we helped product

638
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:57,870
in terms of addressing
any SLA deficiencies

639
00:26:57,870 --> 00:27:01,389
to respond to this privacy review

640
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:04,260
in the amount of time that we had said per

641
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,490
our policies and procedures.

642
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:07,720
It's stuff like that where
you're turning the absence

643
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,000
into (indistinct) like material things

644
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,340
that are somewhat relevant
to the exact team.

645
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:16,480
And that's difficult,
it'll always be difficult,

646
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,380
just given the position that we're in.

647
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:22,230
But I think that there's somewhat of a...

648
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:26,120
There's gonna be a shift, because I think,

649
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,580
at least from my experiences,

650
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:31,129
the exact teams are starting to be aware

651
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:34,223
that customers actually do
care about their privacy.

652
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:40,340
It's coming to ahead and
I think that when you see

653
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:43,199
that happen, there's gonna be a lot

654
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:48,200
of product focus, especially
in my field there's a lot

655
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:50,290
of resources focused right now

656
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:53,649
on how do we make privacy
controls more apparent?

657
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:57,070
How do we make privacy
controls easier to use,

658
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:59,080
and how do we make the user experience

659
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,169
a little bit more privacy-centric?

660
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:04,650
And I think C-level folks
are starting to see the value

661
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:07,810
of that and intangibly
to answer your question,

662
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:09,500
I hope that come down the line,

663
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,950
we'll be able to measure how these types

664
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:14,023
of privacy controls have actually,

665
00:28:16,979 --> 00:28:18,210
I guess increased revenue,

666
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:23,210
increased user and app
downloads, for example.

667
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,459
So, I'm looking forward to when
we can have sexier metrics,

668
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:29,379
if you will.

669
00:28:29,379 --> 00:28:30,212
(chuckles)

670
00:28:30,212 --> 00:28:31,045
- Yeah.

671
00:28:31,045 --> 00:28:32,610
And some other ways you
can get metrics don't have

672
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:33,443
to cost a lot of money,

673
00:28:33,443 --> 00:28:35,129
you can do some simple assessments.

674
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:40,000
Back when I was in-house
didn't have any money,

675
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,410
sometimes we would do things like,

676
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:45,060
just go around and check
to make sure everyone

677
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,730
was following the clean desk policy,

678
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:49,480
and if they didn't, need to
get a little post-it sticker,

679
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:52,730
and then we chart how
many people were compliant

680
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:55,440
and present that information.

681
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:00,360
And we didn't name and shame
but we showed that metrics.

682
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,629
And then we showed over time,

683
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:05,580
just showing like those
numbers caused a change

684
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:08,240
in behavior amongst people like, oh,

685
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,320
I don't wanna contribute to these numbers.

686
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,909
And you can even have
competitions between teams

687
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:14,410
and things like that to make it even more

688
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:15,620
of a game and make it more fun.

689
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:18,060
But there's some small things you can do.

690
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:21,480
- I will just add that, (clears
throat) my security team

691
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:25,410
when I was at the IBP, they liked to go

692
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:26,490
around and do checks.

693
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:28,540
And if they found that
you had left your desk

694
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:29,750
without locking your computer,

695
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:31,800
they would go in and
change your screensaver

696
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,303
to be a David Hasselhoff photo,

697
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,493
like real close in photo.

698
00:29:39,156 --> 00:29:41,860
It was a humiliating
thing to come back to.

699
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:44,280
But we all did our best.

700
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,149
Okay, so let's talk a little bit about,

701
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:47,900
we've talked about some
of the important things

702
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:50,020
about getting started,
about getting buy-in,

703
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,863
and about how to establish metrics.

704
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:55,410
How do you know...

705
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:56,940
Once you've got your program working,

706
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:00,480
how do you manage it and
improve it over time,

707
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,923
and who should you involve in that?

708
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:06,110
Ron, can you start us off on that?

709
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:10,420
- Yeah, I think it's definitely important

710
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:12,810
to communicate to folks
outside of privacy,

711
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:15,203
that privacy compliance is evergreen.

712
00:30:16,382 --> 00:30:17,700
And what I mean by that is,

713
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,510
when GDPR came in and went,

714
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:21,810
there was a big sigh of relief

715
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:24,889
but things were coming down the pipe.

716
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:28,920
So CCPA was on the rise
and other emerging laws,

717
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,010
and this will never end.

718
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:33,820
So I think it's really
important to demonstrate

719
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:38,820
that privacy compliance is
always gonna be a perpetual part

720
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:44,900
of an organization's
overall compliance program.

721
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:47,000
So, that's key.

722
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,910
And then in terms of upkeep,
I think there's a ton

723
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:53,650
of resources out there,

724
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:56,380
especially you had mentioned,
Angelique, where you come

725
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:59,500
from the IPP, puts out
a lot of great content,

726
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:02,620
and I get my daily dose
from your daily dashboards,

727
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:06,110
I talk a lot with my
peers in the industry,

728
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:08,149
we're quite a small community of folks.

729
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:11,250
So it's good to have varying perspectives

730
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:14,323
from the folks that are
in your same industry.

731
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:16,360
And then just, yeah,

732
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:20,290
I personally just like to
self-educate and self-research

733
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:21,629
on things that are coming down the pipe,

734
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:23,690
and I'll engage outside counsel,

735
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:25,340
if I have to, like Susan,

736
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:29,250
who's excellent at letting
me know if there's something

737
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:33,810
that I should be aware of,
that's some sort of vague control

738
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:35,330
or law that's coming down the pipe.

739
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:36,169
But I think I have--

740
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:37,010
- Thanks, Ron.

741
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:38,580
I owe you that 20.

742
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:39,484
- Yeah.

743
00:31:39,484 --> 00:31:40,317
(Ron and Susan laughing)

744
00:31:40,317 --> 00:31:41,430
Wink wink.

745
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:42,800
But yeah, Angelique,

746
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,120
I guess personally for me

747
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,256
it's all about engaging with the community

748
00:31:46,257 --> 00:31:48,770
and the resources that are available

749
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:50,240
to our community.

750
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,920
- Yeah, I mean, just talk to your peers,

751
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,363
find your peers, do some networking.

752
00:31:55,593 --> 00:31:57,140
The privacy community is very,

753
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:01,580
very open and it's
generous with information,

754
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:02,929
at least it has been traditionally,

755
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:04,270
we'd like to keep it that way.

756
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:06,500
And you can find a lot of folks who,

757
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,373
if you just started dialogue with them,

758
00:32:07,373 --> 00:32:09,290
they're more than happy to share with you,

759
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:10,510
hey, here's our best practices,

760
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:13,570
and somebody might even
give you a template

761
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:15,139
here and there, and you never know.

762
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:17,950
And so it's good to have friends

763
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:18,920
in the privacy community

764
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,130
and maintain those friendships,

765
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:22,350
and they will go a long way.

766
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:24,909
Because a lot of the things
that you learn about,

767
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:26,830
it's easy to read the law,
anyone can read the law,

768
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:29,010
but it really comes from experience.

769
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:31,580
And so short of having
experience, talk to other people

770
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:34,970
who do have the experience,
and how did they do this.

771
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:39,090
And we'd like to say here,
it's law, you don't need

772
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:40,620
to outrun the bear,
you just need to outrun

773
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,340
the other people outrunning the bear.

774
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:45,490
And so you wanna try and use the resources

775
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:47,650
that everybody else is
using and the approach

776
00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:49,700
that they're using so
that you can kind of stay

777
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:50,533
in the park.

778
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:54,860
- Susan, I know you said
anyone can read the law,

779
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:55,693
but I'll tell you what?

780
00:32:55,693 --> 00:32:57,680
I try and write a lot of stories,

781
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,010
and I'm always going to one
of you to say what the heck

782
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:01,150
is this law saying?

783
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:03,390
So let's just be careful with our words.

784
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:04,223
Okay, Susan?

785
00:33:04,223 --> 00:33:06,370
- Well, sometimes we're
going to each other going,

786
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:08,476
what the heck is this law saying?

787
00:33:08,476 --> 00:33:09,580
(laughs) and even though we're lawyers,

788
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:11,399
so you're not alone, Angelique,

789
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,933
I don't think it's
necessarily a (indistinct).

790
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:15,669
- I appreciate that.

791
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:18,960
Okay, so let's say that
your company is successful,

792
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,670
you're doing well,
you're making more money,

793
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:23,700
you've been doing a good job,

794
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:26,750
as whether you're a privacy
officer or a security officer

795
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:30,200
that's helping facilitate
some privacy functions,

796
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,740
what are some important insights
we can share with viewers

797
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:36,610
and listeners about growing your team?

798
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:38,510
Susan, can you start us off with that?

799
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:42,383
- Growing your team.

800
00:33:42,383 --> 00:33:47,330
So, one thing is, as
I've grown my own team

801
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:52,240
and teams over the years, it's really,

802
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,920
you wanna have a lot of
different voices first of all.

803
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,530
I think having diversity
particularly now with a lot

804
00:33:56,530 --> 00:34:01,510
of the issues that are
facing data and use of data,

805
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:04,010
it's not all sort of the nuts and bolts

806
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:05,379
of privacy and the issues,

807
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:09,270
there's a lot of
convergence of other types

808
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:11,080
of issues that that come into play.

809
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,170
And if you're not hearing
from different voices

810
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:16,210
and building your team, you may be missing

811
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:17,440
something very important.

812
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,900
And so, people coming at it
from different perspectives.

813
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,820
Not just getting the
cookie cutter of yourself,

814
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:25,273
but getting people who
are different than you.

815
00:34:26,139 --> 00:34:30,420
It's one key that I have tried to follow,

816
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:32,520
and it's difficult because the temptation

817
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:36,290
is to just hire people
who are clones of you,

818
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:39,219
and I would resist that temptation.

819
00:34:39,219 --> 00:34:41,500
So that's one issue.

820
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:45,350
And then thinking about
people with different variety

821
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:46,639
of skill sets as well.

822
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:49,973
So thinking about what are your needs,

823
00:34:51,254 --> 00:34:52,589
you need the big thinkers,

824
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,530
but you also need people
who have the skills

825
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:55,730
to actually get stuff done.

826
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:57,970
And so, thinking about,

827
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:00,930
what do you need for the
particular set of tasks

828
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:04,270
that you have, and how
can different people fill

829
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:05,600
these different gaps.

830
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,360
But then building the team, relying on,

831
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,276
there's a lot of training,

832
00:35:10,276 --> 00:35:12,049
a lot of conferences, RSAC,

833
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:15,120
as well as other conferences
that you can attend,

834
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,410
and have people go to,

835
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:19,710
get memberships for your organization,

836
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:22,780
so that all your folks can
have consistent training,

837
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:24,960
and then do trainings internally to help

838
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,730
build the skills and build the people.

839
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:31,240
And not only think about people external

840
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,270
to your organization when you're
trying to build your team,

841
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:35,950
but think about people
internally in your organization,

842
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:38,169
'cause having people who
are actually understand

843
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:41,650
your systems and how they
work, if they're willing

844
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:43,370
to learn privacy,
they're interested in it,

845
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:45,589
that could be a big win for you.

846
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:50,590
Because a lot of, I think,
the roadblocks we run

847
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,270
into as privacy professionals
is sort of understanding

848
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:54,920
how to make these solutions work

849
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,030
in different environments.

850
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:58,290
And if they already know
what your environment is,

851
00:35:58,290 --> 00:35:59,890
what the political landscape is,

852
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:02,785
that person can have a big advantage

853
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:04,633
over somebody coming in externally.

854
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:07,653
- Yeah, Angelique.

855
00:36:07,653 --> 00:36:08,558
I'll just quickly add.

856
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:09,392
(clears throat)

857
00:36:09,392 --> 00:36:10,419
So, I'm not a lawyer,

858
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:13,470
and the one thing that I'd really like

859
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:15,379
to emphasize in terms of what I'm seeing

860
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:17,950
in the market in terms
of rules is that a lot

861
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:21,640
of these privacy rules do
require a legal degree.

862
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:24,960
And I think that, and no
offense to Ruby and Susan,

863
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,040
you guys are amazing,

864
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:29,650
and I think that you
contribute tons of expertise

865
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:31,280
and knowledge to your respective roles.

866
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,590
But I think, folks should also understand

867
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:37,330
that there's a huge operational component

868
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:38,950
to privacy program management.

869
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:41,629
So, obviously, it would
be great if you did

870
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:46,630
have someone that was formerly
a lawyer and can also work

871
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:48,640
with various teams.

872
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:52,839
But I think this concept of
a privacy operations manager

873
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,790
is something that should be
considered a little bit more

874
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:57,150
in terms of the tactical experience,

875
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:58,440
folks can bring to this role.

876
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,940
And what I mean by that is,

877
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:04,040
actually being able to work
between the legal departments

878
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,850
and the folks that are on the ground,

879
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:08,470
and the more day-to-day folks,

880
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:09,939
and you're liaison between them,

881
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:13,719
and translating what those
privacy requirements mean to them

882
00:37:13,719 --> 00:37:16,840
from a more tactical perspective.

883
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:19,730
So, I think I just wanted to share that.

884
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:23,210
Again, a lot of these
roles, traditionally,

885
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:25,840
I think privacy compliance is
thought of as a legal role,

886
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:29,330
but I definitely think
folks should, who're hiring,

887
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:32,930
should understand that
someone with good privacy

888
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:35,819
or program management generally
could also bring a lot

889
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:36,733
to the table too.

890
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:39,223
- Great.

891
00:37:39,223 --> 00:37:41,180
Well, I wanna really thank the three

892
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:44,240
of you for spending time
with me and hopefully helping

893
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,069
to educate our listeners and viewers.

894
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:48,160
Ron, Ruby and Susan,

895
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,259
thanks so much for being here.

896
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:52,230
We hope you all were able to
take something away from this.

897
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:53,960
And thanks for coming.

898
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:54,793
- Thanks.

899
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:56,931
- Thanks, everyone.

900
00:37:56,931 --> 00:37:57,931
- Thank you.
