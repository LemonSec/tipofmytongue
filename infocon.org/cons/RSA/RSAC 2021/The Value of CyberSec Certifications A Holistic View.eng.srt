1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,130
- So, welcome to the RSA
Conference Lightning Talk.

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:04,609
This one's specifically titled

3
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:09,263
The Value of CyberSec
Certifications: A Holistic View.

4
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,410
So, in this session we'll
hear from three experts.

5
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:14,950
Each expert will speak for seven minutes

6
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:17,730
to share their big idea one after another,

7
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,190
following all three of these presentations

8
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,760
we will have a Q&A the remaining time.

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,470
So, I'll encourage everyone here

10
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:28,890
that's witnessing all
three of these seven talks

11
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,133
to chime in in the Q&A in the chat here.

12
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,890
You can write your questions
anytime in the chat

13
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:37,840
but at the end, we're gonna cover them.

14
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:41,959
And also, because this
is for all three people,

15
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,183
please direct your questions
to a specific speaker.

16
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:47,730
So, that said, I'm gonna introduce

17
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,239
our first of our three speakers,

18
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,110
that's gonna be Sarah Pickering.

19
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:53,870
She is the Director of Talent Development

20
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:56,480
at Independent Security Evaluators.

21
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,050
She's a self-proclaimed HR nerd

22
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:02,529
and she works with business
leaders to ensure that people,

23
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:05,600
strategy aligns with
company values and culture.

24
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,369
Sarah strives to build trust

25
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:10,200
and high levels of employee engagement

26
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,360
while supporting teams and
leaders to achieve their goals.

27
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,580
So, with that, Sarah
I'm gonna pass it to you

28
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:18,539
and you're going to take it away

29
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,930
with our first little segment.

30
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:22,410
- Thanks Sam.

31
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:24,630
So, as Director of
Talent Development in ISE

32
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:26,699
I also handle all of our recruitment.

33
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,290
So, I will be talking a little bit

34
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:30,350
about what recruiters are thinking about

35
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:32,919
in terms of certifications
at different levels

36
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,000
when we're looking at resumes
to hire, things like that.

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,400
But to start off,

38
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,780
I will definitely say that
every job seeker is different

39
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,640
every manager and company is different.

40
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,080
So, there is no one size
fits all certification plan

41
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,770
that's gonna take you
through your first job

42
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:50,369
on up through the ladder to
Cisco and on into, you know,

43
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:53,330
getting those social security
checks at retirement.

44
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:55,050
So, there's no right or wrong answer.

45
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,700
What you really need to do is learn

46
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,550
how to evaluate those
certifications for yourself.

47
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:02,399
So, you know, everyone learns differently,

48
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,930
reading books or blogs,

49
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:06,420
you know, online or
formal classroom settings

50
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,390
to get degrees,

51
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:09,810
there are labs and things like RSA

52
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,090
and other conferences and CTFs

53
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,990
and, you know, YouTube, there's
just so many different ways,

54
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:18,080
but certifications are
one of these options

55
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,800
that you can pursue to show

56
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,280
your next potential employer
your knowledge skills

57
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,113
and abilities.

58
00:02:25,113 --> 00:02:28,260
So, you know, ISE goes around
to all these conferences

59
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:31,160
all over the world, like RSA,

60
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,590
because we host the IoT Village.

61
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:34,300
And so I meet a lot of people

62
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,910
who are brand new to the job market

63
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:39,299
or they're looking to change their career

64
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,220
and just switch gears altogether,

65
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:44,607
but they have no real
world experience at all

66
00:02:44,607 --> 00:02:46,230
and they wanna break in.

67
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:47,450
So, early in your career

68
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:49,060
when you're choosing a certification

69
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:51,640
I would recommend that
you don't just pick it

70
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,279
because a lot of other people have it,

71
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,413
be intentional.

72
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:58,950
So, there are three questions
that you might wanna ask

73
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:02,079
when you're choosing this
cert early in your career.

74
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,913
The first is,

75
00:03:02,913 --> 00:03:06,070
does this certification
help me get past the ATS,

76
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:08,150
the Applicant Tracking System?

77
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:11,943
Or as I refer to it, the
black hole of resumes.

78
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,030
You know, you wanna get past that filter

79
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,930
if your resume is identical

80
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,270
to someone else at the beginning,

81
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:20,490
a cert can help you stand out

82
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:22,120
and get you through that filter.

83
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,970
So, which one are you gonna choose?

84
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:27,580
What I recommend doing is look
at all the job descriptions

85
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:30,230
that you have been gravitating to,

86
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:32,609
scroll all the way to the bottom,

87
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:35,010
and down there you're gonna
find this section that says

88
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:39,239
preferred qualifications or nice to haves.

89
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:44,240
And if you see the same cert
in a lot of those job postings

90
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,609
that's probably one you wanna
go research for yourself

91
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:51,213
and see if that's in your,
you know, in your interest.

92
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:53,972
Next question is,

93
00:03:53,973 --> 00:03:56,590
does this certification
help you get the job?

94
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:59,500
So, a lot of interview processes
require you to take a test

95
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,600
or complete a challenge

96
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,530
or speak to a challenge
that you've completed

97
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:04,200
and how you did it.

98
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,869
So, the study, the preparation

99
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,670
and the actual certification exam,

100
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,660
might help you with that.

101
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:13,490
So, lastly, does it improve
your work performance?

102
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:15,210
So, concept in theory are important

103
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:18,190
but will the certification
help you complete your work

104
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,420
at a higher quality and efficiency?

105
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:23,860
So, I tend to look for
certs that have like

106
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,290
have practical labs,

107
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:27,500
and then the exam requires hacking

108
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,260
and then explaining what you did

109
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,533
and more importantly why you did it.

110
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,730
So, once you're in the
door, maybe you're mid-level

111
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:40,190
you can stop doing certifications, right?

112
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:42,010
No, probably not.

113
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,320
So, while having real-world
experience is a big deal,

114
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,730
continuing your education
shows me and other recruiters

115
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:49,570
that you have drive,

116
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:52,730
that security isn't
just your nine to five.

117
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:55,150
So, certifications,
building your home lab,

118
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:57,260
doing Bug Bounties, playing CTFs,

119
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,920
all of these things are showing me

120
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,140
that you are very
passionate about what you do

121
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,483
so don't stop.

122
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:06,219
One thing that people start to look into

123
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:09,450
and consider at this point are
certifications that require

124
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:11,409
a certain amount of real-world experience

125
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:14,230
before you can even apply to take them.

126
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,830
So, again, I would recommend,

127
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:18,490
you know, go back and ask
those same three questions.

128
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:22,300
Don't just take a certification exam

129
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,160
to be part of this exclusive club.

130
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,740
If it's just a title

131
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:31,070
to put some letters at the
end of your name on LinkedIn,

132
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:33,360
maybe pass up for
something more applicable

133
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,030
to what you're doing at
that point in your career.

134
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:38,299
I would also recommend at this level

135
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:41,590
to be taking certs that
require a lot of writing,

136
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:42,969
certification organizations,

137
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:45,170
they're not gonna ding
you too much on grammar

138
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:48,260
but writing and communication
are extremely important.

139
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,490
If you wanna move to
that mid and senior level

140
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:53,360
you need to be able to communicate well.

141
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,510
At ISE, we wanna hire
people who are willing

142
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:59,060
to mentor our interns and
our associate level analysts.

143
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,810
Additionally, you need to be
able to explain the impact

144
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:04,830
of these security issues
to decision makers

145
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:08,710
and they aren't always,
you know, technical people.

146
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:12,070
So, communication, communication,
very, very big deal.

147
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,659
So, once you're at the senior level

148
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,890
when you have a lot of
experience in the field

149
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,900
there can definitely start to be a level

150
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:21,659
of diminishing returns
on these certifications.

151
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,460
They don't bring you as much value

152
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,659
as they once did when you started out,

153
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,770
you'll hear from John next,

154
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:31,630
he's sort of like a cert addict
he might be an exception,

155
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:32,810
but at this point in your career

156
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:35,430
you probably have a lot
less time to give to them,

157
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,530
you've got more family,

158
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:39,039
you've got more work responsibilities,

159
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,200
but it's really important
that you stay up to date.

160
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,090
You know, we stay employed because,

161
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:46,030
you know, the malicious actors

162
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:49,130
continue to find new
ways to break our stuff,

163
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:51,000
and so you need to stay up to date,

164
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,750
you need to stay relevant.

165
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:56,150
Some certifications
require you to recertify

166
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:58,929
by getting Professional Development Units.

167
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:00,690
So, those might be a good way to sort of

168
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:05,160
force yourself to continue
getting updated on trends.

169
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,810
Another avenue that I would recommend

170
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:09,750
at the senior level point of your career

171
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,900
is to consider different
types of certification

172
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,799
outside of security that add value

173
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,170
to your organization as a whole.

174
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:20,100
So, looking for training and
certification in business,

175
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,160
in leadership and in project management,

176
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,540
growing your organization

177
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:27,333
and helping it be more
effective and efficient,

178
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,700
that's gonna open doors
for you within the company,

179
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,960
it's gonna help you get noticed

180
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:35,530
by other leaders and executives.

181
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:37,953
So, who's looking for these certs?

182
00:07:37,954 --> 00:07:40,750
At ISE, we don't require certs or degrees.

183
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,540
I think a lot of companies are realizing

184
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,880
that's not everything,
it's not the most important

185
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,980
a lot of hackers that I know have been,

186
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:49,730
you know, breaking things
since they were 13 years old

187
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:52,840
and sort of that formal testing
just isn't for everyone.

188
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:56,070
But there are some places that
are really looking for them.

189
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:59,060
I think the Big Box Consultancies

190
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:01,580
they look for them because
they do all these RFPs

191
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,820
and they add a lot of value to that.

192
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:06,200
The government or government contractors

193
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,130
they look for them because
of the GSA Schedule.

194
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:10,930
And then lastly, some hiring managers,

195
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:12,890
they just like them.

196
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:15,690
They have them, so they wanna
see the candidates have them,

197
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:17,760
but, you know, if you're
doing your due diligence

198
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,150
and choosing the ones that you have,

199
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:21,330
you should be fine with that.

200
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:24,760
So, you know, choose them carefully

201
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:29,349
and good luck with your
certification exams.

202
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:30,600
I'll hand it back to Sam.

203
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:33,080
- Hey Sarah, thank you so much.

204
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,943
Everyone insert clapping emoji.

205
00:08:37,188 --> 00:08:39,449
So, with that, we're moving
on to our next speaker.

206
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:41,850
And remember, we're gonna
do Q&A, all at the end.

207
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:44,690
So, please input your
questions in the chat.

208
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,640
So, our next speaker is John Hammond.

209
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,689
He is a Security Researcher
at Huntress Labs,

210
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:53,070
analyzing hackers, persistent footholds,

211
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:58,070
and doing outreach to share
education in cybersecurity.

212
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:00,609
So, he's gonna continue the conversation

213
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:01,540
from his perspective.

214
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,329
Take it away John

215
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:04,620
- Hey there Sam, thanks so much.

216
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,040
Hey everyone.

217
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,480
I super appreciate you
passing the baton to me

218
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,200
and let me chat a little bit about,

219
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,930
I guess, kind of my
perspective on certifications

220
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:15,739
and training kind of as a

221
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,693
industry professional is what they say,

222
00:09:17,693 --> 00:09:21,760
I don't know, the title for
my name in that card here,

223
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,610
they put this word senior in
front of security researcher

224
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:26,490
and I have no idea why.

225
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:28,800
So, I wanna chat about certifications

226
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,329
and kind of how that dug
me through my career,

227
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:34,320
I suppose, right?

228
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,580
When I was first getting into the industry

229
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,670
or starting off my career,

230
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:42,110
the job that I was applying for,

231
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:43,520
I was looking at more of kind of like

232
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,970
the government and military,
like contract based work.

233
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:51,970
And they required me to
be compliant with DoD 8570

234
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:57,459
or some standard regulation,
I think it's 8140 now,

235
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,320
but it was like, hey John,

236
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,930
if you want this position,
if you want this role,

237
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:06,150
you have to be IAT Level II compliant,

238
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:09,630
or IAM, I think for another
kind of bucket in there.

239
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:12,620
And that's, I think, one
distinction I will make

240
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:15,140
is that when we're chatting
about certifications

241
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,680
there are different buckets

242
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,930
or there are different kind of categories

243
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:22,689
that you might put them in your mind.

244
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:25,210
The way that I put them in my mind

245
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:28,920
is for one thing kind of more high level

246
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,689
or very theoretical,

247
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:34,230
very conversational
about topics and concepts

248
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:36,830
that you might be looking
about in the industry

249
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:38,530
or insecurity.

250
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:40,530
A lot of times I think
those certifications

251
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:42,850
get down to a multiple choice tests,

252
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:46,170
like hey, here's a
boatload of information,

253
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:47,370
can you absorb this?

254
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:48,540
Do you understand it?

255
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,723
Can you talk about it?

256
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,343
Can you talk the talk, right?

257
00:10:54,724 --> 00:10:57,410
And that's one category,
that's one bucket in my mind

258
00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:00,839
but I think the stuff that I really love

259
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:05,280
and when Sarah said, hey,
you're a cert addict John

260
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,470
is the hands-on and practical

261
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:10,180
and competency-based certifications.

262
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:14,489
So, while I was going for
that very, very first role,

263
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:16,880
I needed to have kind of
one of those high level,

264
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,870
very conversational
theoretical certifications,

265
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:23,180
but I wanted to prove my merit,

266
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:26,300
I wanted to prove my
competency and what I could do

267
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:29,510
what I could really do
on the keyboard, right?

268
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:31,689
So, I wanted to pour more

269
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:36,060
into those really hands-on
application based certifications.

270
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,890
And I think that is what helped carry me

271
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:43,890
from a beginner introductory
position, kind of junior role,

272
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:47,300
into that more mid level position

273
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:51,156
where like, hey, I wanna be
doing some penetration tests.

274
00:11:51,157 --> 00:11:51,990
I wanna really be

275
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:53,760
working with the engineers
and the architects

276
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,410
to see how our software works

277
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:58,400
and what tools and things
we can develop and use.

278
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:02,709
And that is what made
the difference for me.

279
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:05,980
Like certifications not only
got my foot in the door,

280
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,120
for one thing,

281
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:12,013
but still helped me level up
my skills and keep on growing.

282
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:16,600
That's why, okay, if you
get to a senior position,

283
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,173
or I think in a senior role,

284
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,500
sure, cert addict and that, oh,

285
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,660
maybe it's a little embarrassing

286
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,500
when you're into the double digits

287
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,930
of certs attached to your name.

288
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:29,430
Sometimes, hey, does it
feel like you're going

289
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:30,603
a little bit overboard?

290
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,180
I think it's all for learning,

291
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,400
I think it's all for bettering yourself,

292
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,199
I think it's for sharpening your skills.

293
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,300
So, I'm still active and
wanting to learn more,

294
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:44,569
I'm taking a certification exam right now,

295
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:47,500
not the exam itself but I'm
studying for an exam right now,

296
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,870
and I have another one in my mind

297
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,750
just lined up right after it,

298
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,190
because I wanna stay on that grind

299
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,023
and I wanna keep learning.

300
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:57,680
And I think if you're getting
that mid tier to senior role,

301
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,010
you're just sharpening yourself

302
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:01,200
and you're getting better and stronger.

303
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,340
That I think is really that value in,

304
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:06,100
okay, mid and higher up to senior

305
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:09,360
and that value and
doing something hands-on

306
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,150
and application-based and practical.

307
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:14,670
So, I would urge you,

308
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,610
if that's something that
you're interested in,

309
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:19,230
yes, we enumerated and listed off

310
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:21,130
or you could play Capture The Flag,

311
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:22,810
you could watch videos on YouTube,

312
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:24,369
you could write write ups

313
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:27,780
and share and talk at
conferences and events like this,

314
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,740
there's so much that you can do,

315
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,830
but with a certification,

316
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:33,900
you have this badge, right?

317
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:36,579
You have this, the certificate,

318
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,900
and that is something
that's super tangible

319
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,209
and you can put it on your resume,

320
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:44,270
you can share it around, you
can demonstrate and prove,

321
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:46,850
people will really take
me seriously now, right?

322
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:47,683
That's I think

323
00:13:47,683 --> 00:13:50,020
something that comes from
having certifications,

324
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,920
that's the value that I find in it.

325
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,140
As in, it'll get you in the door,

326
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,900
it'll keep you moving forward

327
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,757
and then you'll keep learning from that

328
00:13:57,757 --> 00:13:59,459
and continue to grow.

329
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,340
So, that's my pitch,

330
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:04,933
I think that that might be the
best move for certifications.

331
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,740
With that I think I'll kick it off to Sam.

332
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:12,440
Did I go a little too early,
did I speed run that one?

333
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,122
- No, it's all good.

334
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,829
That just leaves more time for questions

335
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:21,190
or follow up discussion,
pretty much in the Q&A portion.

336
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:23,660
And we are getting quite
a few questions here.

337
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,939
So, thank you so much John,

338
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,033
more clap emojis.

339
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:30,459
Awesome, so as we move through this,

340
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:34,410
our next speaker on the topic
is going to be Don Donzal,

341
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:35,740
and he's the founder of

342
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:38,980
The Ethical Hacker Network Online Magazine

343
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:42,940
and is known by his Twitter
handle @ethicalhacker.

344
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,720
He is the Director of Community for INE

345
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,513
and their wholly owned
subsidiary eLearnSecurity,

346
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,180
and they are a provider

347
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,900
of practical cybersecurity certifications.

348
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:58,380
So, it will be an interesting
take coming from both HR,

349
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,070
someone who is a cert addict,

350
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:02,130
and now someone who is working on

351
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:04,210
developing certs and tests.

352
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:05,043
So take it away.

353
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,860
- Well, thanks so much.

354
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,310
And first of all, before I get going,

355
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:12,400
just want to say thanks
to the RSA Conference

356
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,050
for having us as well
as a special shout out

357
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:15,282
to the IoT Village.

358
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:18,819
Some of you are here because, you know,

359
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:21,120
what is the largest security
conference in the world?

360
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,880
And many come specifically to RSA

361
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,610
not only looking to advance
their technical knowledge,

362
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:29,390
but also advance their careers.

363
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:32,860
Well, this could be for
them as an individual

364
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,920
as well as for their organizations.

365
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,882
And their organizations
here that are big and small.

366
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:43,010
But in the end, everyone is
really striving to advance.

367
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:45,210
So, there are those that
are just out of college

368
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,180
striving to advance

369
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,359
by at least getting an entry-level IT job

370
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,630
with the hopes of advancing

371
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:52,780
to a cybersecurity specific role

372
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,803
sometime hopefully in the near future,

373
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:58,710
then there are those that
are already in cybersecurity

374
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:01,410
and they're looking to
advance beyond their entry

375
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:03,453
or their mid-level tech positions.

376
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,080
There are those who are striving
to break into management

377
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:10,910
and who knows maybe one day
sit in the executive chair.

378
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:13,630
And then, as we've all been seeing lately

379
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:14,660
as John was describing

380
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,900
there's all these
different buckets of people

381
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,770
as well as buckets of
certifications that they can take.

382
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,720
Well, there's this new bucket right now.

383
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,770
So, those are the people
that constantly hear

384
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:26,840
of the millions of open positions

385
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,600
with great pay in this
exciting field of ours,

386
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,400
and they're eager to
switch careers completely

387
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,540
and they have no experience at all.

388
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:38,130
Now, all of these different groups,

389
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:39,500
well, they have needs,

390
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,610
and it's incumbent on us,

391
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:44,320
the training and
certification organizations,

392
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,140
to not only prove our worth
to each and every candidate,

393
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,580
but, what we offer in the form of

394
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,300
training and certification exams

395
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,160
should also prove the worthiness

396
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:58,339
of each of those candidates
to their future employer,

397
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,173
because in the end,

398
00:16:59,173 --> 00:17:02,760
isn't that what certifications
are all about, job readiness?

399
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:07,760
So, to have that ability
to prove, i.e. certify,

400
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:10,680
that you either have a
baseline of knowledge

401
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,430
or better yet, as John mentioned,

402
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:15,260
that you can really walk
the walk and talk the talk

403
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:17,410
so you can do what you
say that you can do.

404
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:21,530
Now, because different
levels of one's career

405
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:24,950
demand various provable abilities,

406
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:28,030
and that could be technical or
otherwise as Sarah mentioned,

407
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:31,190
well, the needed credentials also change

408
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:33,850
for each stage of one's career.

409
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:36,699
So, in a nutshell, you
must be prepared to prove

410
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:39,040
in each phase of your career,

411
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,430
what your abilities are.

412
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:44,190
And I know this may sound crazy

413
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:47,110
coming from somebody who works
for a certification body,

414
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:51,750
but that doesn't always include
getting a certification.

415
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:52,860
So, think about it this way,

416
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:55,340
if you're starting your own business,

417
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,459
does the bank loan officer ask you

418
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:00,380
if you're a certified
professional penetration tester?

419
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,090
Well, of course not.

420
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:04,959
However, if you're trying
to get them as a client

421
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,713
and perform their pen tests,
well, you bet they will.

422
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:10,889
If you're trying to prove your ability to,

423
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:12,330
I don't know, analyze malware

424
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:16,919
or do some other higher technical
skill like threat hunting,

425
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,290
pen testing a corporate environment

426
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:20,480
with their active
directory, doing forensics,

427
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,240
or any number of other disciplines

428
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,220
that fall under the
ethical hacking umbrella,

429
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,150
well, do you really
think it matters to them

430
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:30,903
if you passed a multiple choice
exam on basic networking?

431
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:32,850
Probably not,

432
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:36,939
because you're way past that
at your point in your career.

433
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,350
Now, in our third example,

434
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,669
and this is something that all three of us

435
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:41,580
have been talking about
those different levels

436
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,070
of your career,

437
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:46,230
you may be trying to make
it into senior leadership.

438
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:49,323
So, do you think they really
care what your degree is in

439
00:18:49,323 --> 00:18:53,620
10, 15, 20 years after the fact?

440
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:54,879
Not really.

441
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,250
It's a lot more important
to show current skills

442
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,620
to handle the job at hand.

443
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:02,840
So, it really matters what you need,

444
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,570
but more importantly, when you need it.

445
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:06,693
So, for that reason,

446
00:19:08,176 --> 00:19:10,320
I'm not gonna bad mouth any
other certification providers

447
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,360
or training providers, that's not my job,

448
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,770
we wanna stay agnostic.

449
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:15,620
In fact, you'll probably
gonna hear me talk

450
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:16,860
not only about our competitors,

451
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,780
but also in a positive light.

452
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,899
So, there are some cases to be made

453
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,950
that all of them have their value

454
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:25,000
and their place on your resume,

455
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,450
it really all just depends on

456
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:29,170
when, where, and what your budget is.

457
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:31,340
So, my job here today is to kind of

458
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:33,419
take all the examples
that we were talking about

459
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:37,240
and jump into some very
specific recommendations.

460
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,710
So, using our three examples,

461
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,280
here's what you might wanna consider

462
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,470
from a certification perspective.

463
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:44,460
Again, there's always
education and experience

464
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,870
but we're here to talk about certs.

465
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:49,199
So, starting with your
entry-level positions,

466
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,340
you'll need that
foundational knowledge first.

467
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:54,020
And of course since security itself

468
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:56,700
is a more advanced IT topic,

469
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,580
well, again, a little contradictory,

470
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:00,399
but you may not even need a credential

471
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,650
specifically proving your security skills

472
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:05,770
in order to get your first job.

473
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:07,933
But, of course, it wouldn't hurt.

474
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:11,560
So, something else to consider is that

475
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,820
networking is the basis

476
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,610
for pretty much everything that we do.

477
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:16,310
So, to start off I might recommend

478
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:18,750
something like CompTIA's Network+,

479
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,900
another good one would be Cisco CCNA,

480
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:22,910
even some other good ones

481
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:24,930
from, let's say, SisAdmin perspective,

482
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:28,610
would be some basic level of
a Microsoft Certification.

483
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:32,639
Now, starting points in
this industry vary greatly.

484
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,210
Even those that come from
non-technical backgrounds,

485
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:37,010
but most of you who are here

486
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:39,710
have at least some
knowledge or experience,

487
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:43,890
that could be from help desk,
SisAdmin, dev, networking,

488
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:45,570
your mileage may vary.

489
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:50,570
So, having other certs
around topics like cloud,

490
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,140
I don't know, maybe some
specific programming languages,

491
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:55,300
but then definitely
other operating systems

492
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,350
like Linux and macOS,

493
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:01,470
those are all great things
to set your foundation.

494
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:03,800
So, then you could possibly then consider,

495
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:07,950
of course, again, as always,
your path may differ.

496
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:10,290
So, you may not wanna do any of those,

497
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:14,610
but you do want a security
specific beginner credential.

498
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:17,310
So, in that way, Security+ is very good,

499
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:19,280
also our very own eJPT

500
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,430
or eLearnSecurity Junior
Penetration Tester Cert,

501
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:25,260
they're great for this beginner category.

502
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,200
Now, that should be more than enough

503
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,540
to get your foot in the door.

504
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,500
I think John may agree on this.

505
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,830
But of course, once you're
past that entry-level position

506
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:35,429
and you're starting to search out

507
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:39,880
higher, mid to senior
level technical spots,

508
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:44,260
well, honestly, our field
starts to look a little less

509
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,920
at those box checking credentials

510
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,630
as both had mentioned earlier,

511
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:50,820
and more on experience
and hands-on ability.

512
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:53,790
So, this is where those practical
certs that Sarah mentioned

513
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:55,690
really start to take over

514
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:59,220
from those simple multiple
choice exams that you see.

515
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,350
So, great examples here,

516
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,469
would be let's say either

517
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:03,543
the rest of the eLearnSecurity

518
00:22:03,543 --> 00:22:05,580
Blue and Red Team Certifications,

519
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,389
but of course I'm a little biased,

520
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:08,940
so let me mention a few others.

521
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:12,810
Other organizations like SANS
GIAC and Offensive Security

522
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:16,149
are also really good options
in this mid tier to prove

523
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:17,720
your higher technical ability

524
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:21,010
as well as getting that
practical hands-on experience.

525
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:23,080
Now, I'll leave you to explore

526
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,840
reviews of the experts
and some content creators

527
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,060
out there on the web to decide
which one is best for you.

528
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:32,129
Obviously, I'm gonna be
a little more bias there.

529
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:33,670
But then after that,

530
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:36,730
you may actually have your
eye on a management role,

531
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:40,620
then, certs on topics, kind
of like what Sarah mentioned,

532
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,889
on other things that
will help you do the job

533
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:45,700
like Agile and Scrum project management,

534
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,970
and of course not the
technical side of security

535
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:50,340
but security policies and procedures.

536
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,399
Well, those become a lot more valuable

537
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,620
to prove not only your knowledge
of what needs to be done,

538
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:59,469
but also that you can
manage people and projects.

539
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:02,270
So, it's great there
to have the experience

540
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:04,120
that show that you can do that,

541
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,760
sometimes if you don't
have the experience,

542
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,060
certification is a great way to do that.

543
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:10,460
So, things like becoming a Scrum Master

544
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:15,070
or PMP, the Project
Management Professional,

545
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:18,040
those are some good foundational
exams on this level,

546
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,870
but then you have your
security specific certs

547
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:23,580
like CISSP or CISM.

548
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,379
And then of course
there are the GIAC Certs

549
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:28,760
that also fit very nicely
into this category as well.

550
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:31,070
All right, I'm getting close
to the end of my seven minutes.

551
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:32,960
I threw a lot at you very quickly

552
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,410
and there's only so much you
can do in that amount of time.

553
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:38,720
So, this is obviously not
exhaustive or inclusive of the

554
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,400
hundreds of types of
certifications that are out there,

555
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,410
but it can give you somewhat of a roadmap.

556
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:47,620
And then, honestly, it's your own desires

557
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,830
that will lead you the rest of the way.

558
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:53,540
So, of course, you always
have to continue to reevaluate

559
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:57,149
who you are and what you
want with your career.

560
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:58,800
But I also highly recommend

561
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,389
that you do that in
consultation with a mentor,

562
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:04,710
that's always recommended to
have in your bag of tricks.

563
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:06,870
And then of course you put
all these things together

564
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:09,729
and your perfect career awaits you,

565
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:12,450
no one else because it's custom fit.

566
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:15,100
Thanks for your time and I
look forward to questions.

567
00:24:16,475 --> 00:24:18,399
- Thank you so much Don.

568
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,780
And with that, we have concluded

569
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:25,780
the lightning round
rotating for each speaker.

570
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:29,740
So, I think we're all
gonna be on screen now

571
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:31,540
and we're gonna be doing some questions.

572
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:33,860
Remember, you can put your
questions in the chat.

573
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:36,600
If your question was
entered in the chat earlier,

574
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,629
enter it again now

575
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:38,980
and make sure if you have a question

576
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:42,410
that's directed specifically
at one of these people,

577
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:43,910
you know, just add their name.

578
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:48,439
While we wait for a couple
of questions to come in,

579
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,493
let's see here.

580
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:57,580
We do have a sort of a
question around CISSP

581
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:00,260
from Shannon McCormick.

582
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:04,470
She's saying, it appears
to me like the CISSP

583
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:08,670
is more of a requirement for
experienced security roles

584
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:09,853
and do you agree?

585
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,510
So, is there one of you

586
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:15,410
that wants to take a bite on that one?

587
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,639
- Go for it John, I see you unmuted.

588
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,473
- No, I was gonna ask,

589
00:25:20,473 --> 00:25:22,639
hey, does anyone else wanna take this one?

590
00:25:23,851 --> 00:25:25,431
- I can take that, I do know that...

591
00:25:25,431 --> 00:25:26,264
- I got something,

592
00:25:26,264 --> 00:25:28,459
but I know someone else
will have something better.

593
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,080
- And I think Sarah can probably

594
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:32,910
add a little bit more to this,

595
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:35,360
but there are a lot of HR managers

596
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:39,550
that don't necessarily know
exactly what the job entails.

597
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:41,450
If you have your CISSP like I do

598
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:43,100
and I believe John also has it,

599
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,480
what you're gonna find

600
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,070
is that there are questions on there

601
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:48,270
like what's the very
first thing that you do

602
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:49,990
when you have an incident?

603
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:51,650
And it's not handle the incident,

604
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:52,980
it's not something technical,

605
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:56,090
it's always refer back to
your policies and procedures

606
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:57,580
and see what that tells you to do.

607
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:58,870
So, that alone tells you

608
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:01,479
that it's a lot more
on that management side

609
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,890
and how you're supposed
to run your program.

610
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:05,950
So, with that, a lot of hiring managers

611
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:09,320
mistakenly put that as a qualification

612
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,669
for their technical jobs

613
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:12,340
when it's really not a technical cert,

614
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:14,320
it's more of a management cert.

615
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,550
Probably the reason that they do this

616
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:17,129
Sarah maybe you can add
a little bit more to this

617
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:19,420
is because the CISSP actually requires

618
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:21,990
before you take the exam,
as you mentioned earlier,

619
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:24,270
that you have a certain
amount of experience.

620
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:27,139
So, maybe that's a way to guarantee

621
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:28,770
at least that's somebody else verify

622
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:31,160
that you have this security experience.

623
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,650
But again, I think it's misplaced

624
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:35,593
in a number of job descriptions.

625
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,760
- I would definitely agree Don.

626
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,230
And one thing that I like to tell people,

627
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:44,200
when you do get down to
the requirement section

628
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,173
of a job posting,

629
00:26:47,296 --> 00:26:49,960
it's always gonna have more things

630
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,930
than you actually need to do the job.

631
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:55,300
And there's this big disparity,

632
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:59,780
especially for women,

633
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:02,660
that when you see that list of 10 things,

634
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:05,110
women will say, well, I only have eight

635
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:07,040
so I'm not gonna apply.

636
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:10,350
And men typically will
look at that and see,

637
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:12,100
well, I've got five out of 10,

638
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,639
I'm gonna go ahead and apply

639
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,950
and I think this might be
one of those things where

640
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:19,780
if you don't check every
single one of those boxes,

641
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:22,260
go ahead and apply anyways.

642
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:25,520
So, that one might not apply as much

643
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,820
but don't worry about
it if you don't have it.

644
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:31,510
So, I do think it's something worth having

645
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:34,403
but not a requirement to do the job.

646
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,810
- Very good points and right on, yes,

647
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:42,840
I mean, there definitely
is a talent shortage.

648
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:46,540
So, you know, don't feel
like you're an imposter.

649
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:49,639
A lot of these groups
have all talked about here

650
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:53,680
from Sarah to even John they're
doing a lot of education.

651
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:56,740
So, they wanna bring people into this,

652
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:59,273
into this industry not
exclude them or gate keep.

653
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:03,790
So, let's see here, going to
the chat for more questions,

654
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:05,379
see what we got.

655
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:08,200
I think if I scroll up
here's one from Michael Dunn,

656
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,440
he's asking a question for
all the speakers to tackle,

657
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,060
which is performance-based testing

658
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:15,850
versus standardized testing.

659
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:19,530
So, sort of weighing, I
guess, comparing those two

660
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:21,030
how do the speakers feel about

661
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:23,483
performance-based versus
standardized testing?

662
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:28,880
- So, you know, I'm gonna say

663
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,100
the same thing as I have, right?

664
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,659
Anything that's hands on

665
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:35,770
and you're actually getting
to hack into something

666
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:39,510
something that's live, something
that's at the test site,

667
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:41,700
is to me always more useful.

668
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:44,600
And like I said, being
able to write about it,

669
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,790
I think being able to explain

670
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:49,340
why you've done something

671
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:53,189
can be at times even more
important than actually doing,

672
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:54,780
getting the right answer.

673
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:57,389
So, when I see we have a
web app challenge to do

674
00:28:57,390 --> 00:29:00,740
and if you don't actually
find what's going on,

675
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:03,630
we actually really look at
the things you've tried to do,

676
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:05,470
even if it failed.

677
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:08,620
So, those types of things
are really important,

678
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:10,312
I think those are more valuable.

679
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,530
- I think as all three
of us had mentioned,

680
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:18,560
that there are different
levels of your career.

681
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:21,560
So, when you get into more of
those standardized testing,

682
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,639
so, again, probably more along the lines

683
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,363
of being a multiple choice exam,

684
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:28,830
those are things that show, you know what?

685
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:29,790
You have an interest,

686
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:30,623
you studied,

687
00:29:30,623 --> 00:29:32,250
you can retain that information,

688
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:34,250
and you can basically regurgitate it

689
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:35,550
on a multiple choice exam.

690
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,530
That has value,

691
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:39,340
it doesn't mean that
there's no value there,

692
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:42,470
but that's a lot more valuable
to an entry-level position

693
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:44,090
to say, look,

694
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:46,209
I'm really putting forth this
effort and I can do this,

695
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:47,610
I don't have the experience yet,

696
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:50,459
I don't have the number
of years under my belt

697
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:53,210
to where I had the time
to study all this stuff

698
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:57,050
and be as amazing at Python as John is,

699
00:29:57,050 --> 00:29:59,780
but, you know, you'll
watch his YouTube channel

700
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:01,210
and he's just,

701
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:03,200
okay, that took years,

702
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,240
that's not what somebody

703
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,090
who's looking for an entry-level
position is looking for.

704
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:10,050
So, again, there's
different levels for that,

705
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:12,090
but once you start moving
past that entry level

706
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:17,090
to mid or higher senior
level type job postings,

707
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,870
then that's when you really start moving

708
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:21,770
into those performance-based testing

709
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:24,493
or the practical hands-on
certification exams.

710
00:30:29,432 --> 00:30:30,480
- All right.

711
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,373
Let's move on to the next question.

712
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:36,629
Here's one that I
believe Cassie was asking

713
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:39,740
and is also one we were sort of internally

714
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,163
talking about as well.

715
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:43,750
They're asking,

716
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,900
right, essentially, a lot of universities

717
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,700
are offering master's degrees

718
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:51,500
or there's a lot of academic
things that you can do.

719
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:54,900
So, what is our thought on the usefulness

720
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:59,040
of these Master Degrees in Cybersecurity

721
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:04,040
or other college degrees
when it comes to the market?

722
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:10,370
- You know, so I mentioned,

723
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:11,763
and John kind of touched on this too,

724
00:31:11,763 --> 00:31:15,360
that the big consulting firms,
the government contractors,

725
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,020
some of them are gonna require degrees

726
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:19,570
but even those large
companies are realizing

727
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:22,230
that a degree isn't everything

728
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:24,240
and that people learn differently.

729
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,570
And so certifications are
holding a lot more weight

730
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:29,909
in substitution of degrees,

731
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:33,940
but also there's so many
people in cybersecurity

732
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:37,690
that never intended to get into the field.

733
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:40,220
And so, they have degrees

734
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:44,300
in like language arts and
healthcare psychology.

735
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,490
And so they get to check that box,

736
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:49,633
but that undergrad degree
didn't get them anywhere,

737
00:31:50,587 --> 00:31:54,223
and master degrees can be similar.

738
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:57,580
So, there're certainly not everything,

739
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:01,040
but, you know, my
recommendation is, honestly,

740
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,330
if the degree is something
that's important to you

741
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:05,139
and you wanna get it,

742
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:07,390
wait till you get in the door at a company

743
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:09,350
and let that company pay for it

744
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:12,300
through tuition assistance programs,

745
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,950
don't pick up that bill yourself.

746
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,770
- And to even clarify,

747
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:20,260
there is some discussion
going on in the chat

748
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:23,350
around the idea of online only degrees

749
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:29,240
versus say a degree from a,

750
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:34,680
I guess, maybe a more accredited school,

751
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,063
you know, like if there's a program

752
00:32:36,063 --> 00:32:38,113
that this is an online only degree,

753
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:40,990
you know, one person mentions here

754
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:43,560
that some HR professionals call out

755
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,423
online only degrees.

756
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:51,950
- I would just say as long
as the college or university

757
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:56,023
is a certified one, you're in good shape.

758
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,073
- I would say that too.

759
00:32:58,073 --> 00:33:00,450
I mean, there's always
gonna be some organizations

760
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:02,140
that are a little more
snooty about what you have

761
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,340
and what you don't have.

762
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,530
But I think as the industry
grows and they realize

763
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:09,649
that there's so many resources out there,

764
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:14,180
not only online universities
versus your standard,

765
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:17,980
you know, university experience
that most people have,

766
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:20,150
there's also a lot more
free resources out there,

767
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:22,460
there's a lot more training
organizations out there

768
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:24,510
that deal specifically with these things.

769
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:27,450
Now, I do know that there's
plenty of university programs

770
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:29,650
that actually supplement what they do

771
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:31,310
with certification prep.

772
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:33,800
So, they themselves know
that what they're teaching

773
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,500
may not necessarily prepare
you for the real job,

774
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:40,610
but on the other side,
those large companies,

775
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:43,209
large tech companies, I
mean like Google, Microsoft,

776
00:33:44,109 --> 00:33:47,240
all the major tech companies
now are also realizing that.

777
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,500
And so they're saying, you know what?

778
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,660
Degrees really aren't
that important anymore,

779
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:52,140
what's really more important

780
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:54,340
is that you know how to do the job.

781
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,169
So, if you can pass that web app test

782
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:57,850
that Sarah's gonna put you through

783
00:33:57,850 --> 00:34:00,990
or you're gonna win one of John's CTFs,

784
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:02,540
you know, any of those things,

785
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,830
you put that on your resume

786
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:05,070
and that will make you stand out

787
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:07,320
honestly, even more than a degree can,

788
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:10,210
no matter what the institution is.

789
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:12,370
So, that's my two cents.

790
00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:14,643
John, I know you have some
thoughts on this as well.

791
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:16,863
- I'd agree.

792
00:34:19,219 --> 00:34:21,230
So, I mean, I feel like I've gone through

793
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:22,590
education and training

794
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:25,100
but I don't have the like golden receipt

795
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,360
and the stamp of paper that says,

796
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,863
hey, you have a degree.

797
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:31,493
Companies, organizations,
whoever I chat with,

798
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:33,949
they're not gonna like
kick you off the table,

799
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:37,100
at least I feel like in my
opinion, in my experience

800
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:40,690
because you have something that
can showcase as Don had said

801
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:42,880
you have the competency and merit,

802
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:47,130
you've done and you can prove
yourself worthy to do the job.

803
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:51,600
I think that is kind of just
what prevails above all else.

804
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,779
That's not to put down any other efforts,

805
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:56,159
oh, let's go for a master's degree,

806
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,339
let's go for any other degree,

807
00:34:58,340 --> 00:34:59,540
if that's what you wanna do,

808
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:02,850
absolutely do it, and
that is gonna help you,

809
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:06,873
but option, not a requirement.

810
00:35:08,959 --> 00:35:10,669
- The other thing I like to point out

811
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:13,670
when you're choosing a degree program,

812
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:16,950
I'm just always gonna promote this,

813
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:21,799
is I really like programs where
your professors add adjuncts

814
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,113
that work in the field.

815
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:26,690
So, professors that are
tenured and that's all they do,

816
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:28,880
they're great with theory and concept,

817
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,800
but when you attend a university

818
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,610
where you have all these adjuncts

819
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:37,890
that actually are doing the
job that you want someday,

820
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:39,670
that can be a really great experience,

821
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,010
they really know what they're doing,

822
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:44,173
they're really staying up to
date in real world application.

823
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,549
The other value to doing in-person,

824
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:49,980
because you're gonna hear
it everywhere you go,

825
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,340
every networking thing,

826
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:53,700
every conference is the way to get a job

827
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:56,390
is through networking
and through who you know.

828
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:58,330
And so when you do,

829
00:35:58,330 --> 00:36:00,813
you know, the live in person,

830
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:04,560
you know, training or degrees,

831
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,860
that's how you meet other
people in the field.

832
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:08,820
- And I think to add to that,

833
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:10,570
John made a really good point that,

834
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,700
you know, we get asked
the question all the time,

835
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:16,299
you know, what's more important
or what should I focus on?

836
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,620
Should I focus on degrees, certifications

837
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:20,250
or getting more experience?

838
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:24,010
And honestly the answer
is yes, do them all.

839
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:26,100
However, if you don't have one

840
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,360
you kind of need to make it up.

841
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,620
So, like, if you don't have a sense

842
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:30,890
your other senses need to
be a little heightened.

843
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:33,080
And the way that you can do that,

844
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:36,900
is by doing other things in the community.

845
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,060
So as an example,

846
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:40,549
to overcome that catch-22
we often talk about

847
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:41,820
where, well, I don't have the experience

848
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:43,700
so I can't get the job,
and if I can't get the job

849
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,410
well, how do I get the experience?

850
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:47,560
Well, what you really need to do is

851
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,520
not only network like Sarah said,

852
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,600
but go compete in CTFs,

853
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,089
go do Bug Bounties,

854
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:55,000
go do write-ups,

855
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,060
do a blog,

856
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:57,520
do all those other things,

857
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,780
go volunteer your time for
a nonprofit organization,

858
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:04,660
go volunteer your time
for an open source project

859
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:07,310
or create your own project,
whatever it may be.

860
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:08,840
But these are all technical things

861
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,470
that you can actually show a real result.

862
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:14,689
You put all that stuff on
your resume and trust me,

863
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:17,120
all of that is hands-on practical stuff

864
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,830
along with your certifications,

865
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:20,950
and that could totally outweigh somebody

866
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:22,649
who just has a degree

867
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:24,130
and none of that other stuff,

868
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:26,163
trust me, you will rise to the top.

869
00:37:30,457 --> 00:37:32,089
- All right, good conversations.

870
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:35,913
So, moving along, let's see
what other things we can answer.

871
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:38,930
Here's a question I think that some of us

872
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:41,890
were talking about internally,
which is essentially

873
00:37:43,996 --> 00:37:46,396
how do I know when I have
enough certifications?

874
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:50,499
And maybe we can dive a little bit into.

875
00:37:50,499 --> 00:37:52,848
- Maybe it's like being
in love, you just know.

876
00:37:53,987 --> 00:37:55,650
- But I mean, it seems like
there might be a balance

877
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:58,170
between wanting to get certifications

878
00:37:58,170 --> 00:38:01,220
for your own interests
and then also knowing

879
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:03,250
if you have enough certifications.

880
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:04,280
- John, you tell us,

881
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,203
when is enough enough, come on, man.

882
00:38:07,414 --> 00:38:08,497
- It's funny,

883
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:13,379
I was the one that threw that question

884
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:14,840
kind of in our internal ring

885
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,740
when we were brainstorming some ideas.

886
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:20,540
And I see some guys in the
chat like, hey, well, yeah,

887
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:21,940
when you get your dream job,

888
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:26,270
I have to say, it's when
you feel like you're happy

889
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:27,410
and you're content.

890
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:30,440
Like, I feel very, very
fulfilled at my current role

891
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,340
so I'm not gonna be like scouting,

892
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:35,600
I'm not in the market to
go look for a new gig.

893
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,860
'Cause if that's the case,

894
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:39,300
I wanna be looking through those job racks

895
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,980
and those applications to see,

896
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,760
oh, what certifications can I knock out

897
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,830
to look more attractive
to that organization?

898
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:49,610
And if you're feeling like I'm good, man,

899
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:51,930
you know, I'm set, I'm
feeling all right right now

900
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:54,160
I don't feel like I don't
need to grind and hustle

901
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,232
and burnout however many
certifications in a month.

902
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:03,380
If you feel like I've got
what I'd like, then be happy.

903
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:07,200
I don't feel like you need to go crazy

904
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,480
paying for certifications

905
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,683
or suffering through late night studying,

906
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:14,660
just get what you like in your career

907
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:17,029
and then keep learning when it's fun

908
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:18,387
and when it's good for you.

909
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:20,680
- Yeah, and that's a really good point

910
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:23,620
because that's not to say that
you shouldn't keep learning.

911
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:26,089
I mean, we all know that not just in IT

912
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:27,810
but security more specifically,

913
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:30,580
it's a never ending arms race
as Sarah mentioned earlier.

914
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:32,370
So, you always have to keep learning,

915
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,970
but that doesn't always necessarily mean

916
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:36,980
that you have to do a certification
in order to prove that.

917
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:38,517
So, you can try all of,

918
00:39:38,517 --> 00:39:40,520
you know, a whole bunch
of free sites out there,

919
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,930
go practice on your own,
go do your own research.

920
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:43,950
If you're the type of person

921
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:45,720
that just happens to learn a new technique

922
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,973
better by studying to go,

923
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:51,120
basically studying for that certification,

924
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,319
hey, then go do that,

925
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,960
but you don't necessarily have
to take the certification.

926
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,550
But at that point if you're
almost already there,

927
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:57,440
well, why not?

928
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,300
You know, but again, I think
as long as you're happy,

929
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,870
you're having fun and you're
enjoying what you're doing,

930
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:05,540
that's kind of what
dictates where you go next.

931
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:08,490
- Well, I think that's a great
way to end the conversation.

932
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:10,600
We are out of time.

933
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:13,440
So, I wanna thank all the
speakers who came here today

934
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,630
to talk about this.

935
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:17,000
I'll also throw out a
one thing which is that,

936
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,990
I believe there is a David
Foot in the audience here

937
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:23,100
who has a talk that is kind of
continuing this conversation.

938
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:26,190
So, he is talking on his
thing, you know, on Thursday.

939
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:29,020
So, this is an interesting
area for you guys,

940
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:31,130
just look up that speaker,

941
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:32,850
and you know, that will be another place

942
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:35,500
you can continue to learn
more about this type of topic.

943
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,623
Thank you everyone for being here.

944
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:42,720
And it'd be great to
connect with you all online

945
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,569
so you know how to reach us,

946
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:47,256
follow up with us on offline as well.

947
00:40:47,256 --> 00:40:48,145
- Thanks all.

948
00:40:48,146 --> 00:40:48,979
- Thanks everyone.

949
00:40:48,979 --> 00:40:51,163
- Thanks, much appreciated, happy hacking.
