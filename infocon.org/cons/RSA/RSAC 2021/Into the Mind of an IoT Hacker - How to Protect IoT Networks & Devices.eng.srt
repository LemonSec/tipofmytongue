1
00:00:01,168 --> 00:00:02,889
- Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:04,470
I'm very happy to take part

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:08,698
in this really great RSA 2021

4
00:00:08,698 --> 00:00:10,950
Virtual Event this year.

5
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:13,860
My name is Itzik Feiglevitch
and I'm the Product Manager

6
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,680
who leads IOT Cybersecurity
Solutions at Check Point.

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,520
And together with me is Justin Sowder.

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,300
He's our Security Architecture

9
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:28,100
for IOT and ICS Solutions at Check Point.

10
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,690
Now, I'm sure that all
of you will agree with me

11
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:34,250
that IOT is one of the biggest
trends in the market today.

12
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,640
There's huge buzz around this topic,

13
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,160
and I'm sure that many of
you are already familiar

14
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,660
with the huge numbers of IOT devices

15
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:45,160
that we are expecting to
see in the coming years.

16
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:48,529
Now, those IOT devices from
one side are really great.

17
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:52,090
And we can talk about increasing
the operational efficiency

18
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:55,760
of the business, moving to
the digital world and so on.

19
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,489
But we also need to
take into consideration

20
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:00,170
that all of those IOT devices

21
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:02,490
that are now part of our networks

22
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:05,840
also brings with them
lots of security risks

23
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,000
into those networks,

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,350
and actually create a huge attack surface

25
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:14,570
for cyber criminals to come and
to hack into those networks.

26
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:16,229
So in the common presentation,

27
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:18,330
we are going to focus on two topics.

28
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:21,330
The first topic will
be what are the risks,

29
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,880
What are the risks that those IOT devices

30
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,350
brings into those networks?

31
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:30,800
And the second topic is what
is the right security solution,

32
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,170
the cybersecurity solution
to address those risks,

33
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:35,670
to address those challenges

34
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:39,870
in order to protect the IOT
devices inside the network

35
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:43,333
and to protect the network
from IOT related attacks.

36
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,260
Now, at Check Point, we are focusing

37
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:49,990
on four types of customers.

38
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:54,830
The first one at the end
customers it can be enterprises,

39
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:58,860
such banks, insurance
companies, high-tech companies

40
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,477
and they need to deal with
all the Smart Building

41
00:02:01,477 --> 00:02:04,500
and the Smart Office
devices that are connected

42
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,770
to the network.

43
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:06,979
We have a healthcare providers.

44
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:09,810
Those are hospitals
that we are working with

45
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:13,400
who need to deal with all the
connected medical devices.

46
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,520
And we also have industrial customers

47
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,873
such as utilities companies,
factories and so on.

48
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,920
For those types of customers,

49
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,760
we offer in a network security solution.

50
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,570
The solution that sits inside the network,

51
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:31,200
protecting the IOT
devices inside the network

52
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,079
and protecting the network
from IOT related attacks.

53
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,763
The fourth type of customers
that we are working with

54
00:02:37,763 --> 00:02:40,710
are the IOT manufacturers themselves.

55
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:42,710
We helping them to develop

56
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:46,290
and to provide safe to use IOT devices

57
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:50,910
by integrating nano
agents security technology

58
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:53,397
into the IOT devices themselves,

59
00:02:53,397 --> 00:02:55,683
protecting them from the inside.

60
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:00,549
One of the first questions
I'm always asking

61
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:03,380
when meeting with a new customer is,

62
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:06,890
do you know, do you really
know how many IOT devices

63
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:09,089
do you have inside your network today?

64
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:11,330
Those devices are out of your network,

65
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:13,460
those devices are
connected to your network.

66
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:16,220
So how many IOT devices do you have?

67
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:19,433
And the answer is
always, no, I don't know.

68
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:23,210
Well, our research department found out

69
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:26,790
that in a typical enterprise
or 5,000 employees

70
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:31,480
you will find around 20,000 IOT devices.

71
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,140
Now I know that it seems
like a huge number,

72
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,640
but think about all the IP TVs

73
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,390
or the printers or the
surveillance cameras

74
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:42,700
or the sensors inside the
building, the smart elevators,

75
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,423
everything is connected
to the enterprise network.

76
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:49,000
In a typical hospital of 500 beds

77
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,990
you will find around 10,000 IOT devices.

78
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:55,330
Most of them are
connected medical devices.

79
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:58,460
We have MRI machines, CT
devices, infusion pumps,

80
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:01,870
but not only a hospital
is like a small city.

81
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,967
We have gas systems, water systems,

82
00:04:03,967 --> 00:04:07,300
electricity systems, general IOT devices,

83
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:10,113
everything is connected
to the hospital network.

84
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,730
And in a typical factory of 2000 workers,

85
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:18,899
you will find around 5,000
industrial IOT devices.

86
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:21,239
Different controllers, skater systems,

87
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,550
everything is connected
to the factory network.

88
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,670
Now we need to ask ourselves,

89
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:31,190
how are all of those devices
are connected to the network?

90
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:35,380
For the security manager point of view,

91
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:40,380
those are not trivial devices
that sits inside the network.

92
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:43,890
Many of those devices have
their own unique characteristics

93
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:47,780
such as the operating system,
the device functionality,

94
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:50,559
many of those devices are
based on those crazy IOT

95
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,400
and OT protocols; BACnet, Skater, Modbus,

96
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,669
but probably the most
disturbing thing is that

97
00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:00,410
many of those devices
are unmanaged devices.

98
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:03,400
Meaning that they are
connected to our network,

99
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,659
but we don't have any way
to control those devices,

100
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:10,480
to view them and to define
what those devices can do

101
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,370
and cannot do inside our network.

102
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:15,590
If we will go and search for those devices

103
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:19,609
in our existing security
management system,

104
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,403
we will not find those devices.

105
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:26,270
Now, in many cases those
devices are also connected

106
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:28,150
to the external internet.

107
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:30,150
And this is because of many reasons,

108
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:32,370
for an example, we would like to enable

109
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:34,850
the different vendors of
the different IOT devices

110
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:37,210
to be able to access them.

111
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:40,239
Maybe we would like to enable
access to remote users,

112
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,930
specifically during this COVID-19 days,

113
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:45,130
many of us are working from home

114
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:47,100
or maybe we would like to enable access

115
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,810
to a third party service provider

116
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:52,050
who managing those devices for us.

117
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:55,180
For an example, a company
that monitors the printers

118
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:58,840
inside the facility and in
case they will find the printer

119
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,950
with an empty tunnel they will
automatically send a new one.

120
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:05,680
So in many cases those devices

121
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,460
are connected to our
network from one side,

122
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:12,840
and on the other side, also
to the external internet.

123
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,919
Now the attackers using
standard scanning tools

124
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,050
can find those devices.

125
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:18,140
They know what to look for.

126
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:21,110
They know what
characteristics to look for.

127
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:23,160
What types of protocols.

128
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,440
One of those tools is Shodan,

129
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,453
I'm sure you're familiar with that.

130
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:29,530
This is a public website
also known as the Google

131
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:30,840
of the IOT hackers.

132
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,310
And you can see here two searches

133
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:36,417
that have did, they've find
more than 25,000 printers

134
00:06:36,417 --> 00:06:39,130
and almost 300,000 cameras

135
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:41,440
that are connected to the internet.

136
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,730
And of course we can
search for specific model,

137
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:47,163
specific vendors, even for
devices in specific location.

138
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:52,250
Now, once we've managed
to find those IOT devices,

139
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,590
it is quite easy to connect to them.

140
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:58,190
And it is quite easy to
hack into those devices.

141
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:00,950
Most of the IOT devices don't even have

142
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:03,240
basic security capabilities.

143
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,050
When those devices were developed,

144
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,010
no one thought about that.

145
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,510
Many of those devices are based on

146
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:12,349
all the tech software and
legacy operating systems.

147
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:16,590
I've personally seen devices
that still runs windows 95,

148
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:20,969
many old operating systems,
such as windows 2000

149
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:23,840
with no security patches,
with no vulnerabilities

150
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,130
that are very easy to hack into.

151
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:29,370
And many of those devices are
based on default passwords,

152
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:31,500
one two three four eight eight eight.

153
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,810
Someone taking this device out of the box

154
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:36,980
with the default password and
connected it to your network.

155
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:39,670
And now you have hundreds of devices

156
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,210
that are based on default passwords

157
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,152
that are connected to your network.

158
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:48,020
Now we have limitations that
preventing us from going

159
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:50,169
and fixing those issues.

160
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:53,740
We can't go and change the
software inside those devices.

161
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:56,099
We can run dedicated security application

162
00:07:56,099 --> 00:07:57,849
inside those devices.

163
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:00,700
Limitations such as
physical access devices

164
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,860
that need to work 24/7,

165
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:05,573
different regulations,
certifications and so on.

166
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:09,630
Now, the attackers they know that

167
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:10,969
and they're using those devices,

168
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:13,190
and they're using those
devices in two ways.

169
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:16,810
The first way is hacking into
the IOT devices themselves

170
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:18,920
and then manipulating those devices

171
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:22,830
and by doing so damaging the
operation of the business.

172
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:26,430
It can be for an example, a
medical device in the hospital,

173
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:30,880
manipulating such a device can
maybe even, can kill someone.

174
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,970
It can be an industrial
device in the factory,

175
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:36,260
manipulating such a device,
such as Smart Elmo Stat

176
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:39,429
can force the factor to shut
down the entire production line

177
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:41,870
or it can be just a simple IOT device,

178
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:44,382
like a surveillance camera.

179
00:08:44,382 --> 00:08:45,870
And the attacker can take control,

180
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:48,610
can take over this camera
to see what it sees,

181
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:51,160
maybe to turn it into a Botnet attack

182
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,213
or maybe use it for crypto mining.

183
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:57,030
The second way the attackers
using those devices

184
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:59,850
is backdoor to the network.

185
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:02,210
Because as I said, in
many cases those devices

186
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:04,930
are connected to the external internet.

187
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:07,680
And in many cases in security,

188
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,670
because the user don't always
have the right knowledge

189
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,890
about how to connect those devices.

190
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:15,290
So they're using the wrong
protocols, the wrong,

191
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:19,422
unsecure applications so the attackers

192
00:09:19,422 --> 00:09:21,170
can find those devices quite easy.

193
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:24,079
Hack into those devices
and through those devices

194
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,323
to get into the network.

195
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:29,790
I'm sure you're familiar
with Mirai attack,

196
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:34,790
back in 2016 targeting hundreds
of thousands of IOT devices

197
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,440
creating a huge digital setup.

198
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,380
Since then every few months
we've seen a new variant

199
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,360
of Mirai attack.

200
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,748
So we have Mukashi and
Dark Nexus and Kaiji,

201
00:09:46,748 --> 00:09:48,413
and the latest one by the way is Mozied

202
00:09:48,413 --> 00:09:52,690
that was identified by
IBM a few months ago.

203
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:56,070
Now it seems that all those
latest variants of Mirai attack

204
00:09:56,070 --> 00:10:00,270
now targeting specifically
Enterprise IOT devices,

205
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:03,699
such as IP phones and printers.

206
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,990
And we're also seeing that
the new types of attacks

207
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:08,650
are crypto mining attacks.

208
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:11,220
Trying to turn those
devices into crypto mining.

209
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:15,560
So each of the IOT devices
don't have lots of CPU power

210
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,930
but you need to multiply
it by hundreds of devices

211
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:21,989
that you have in each of
the enterprises networks.

212
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:26,350
So in one attack, you can even
hound the several thousands

213
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:29,723
of dollars from this network,
from the IOT devices.

214
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:35,260
ZigBee systems becoming to be very popular

215
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,730
within Smart Buildings.

216
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:39,863
In a typical system you
will deploy on one side,

217
00:10:39,863 --> 00:10:42,500
a ZigBee gateway and on the other side,

218
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,840
the large number of smart
devices that communicating

219
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,320
with this ZigBee gateway,

220
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,873
so with the ZigBee wireless network.

221
00:10:49,873 --> 00:10:53,110
A very popular ZigBee system
is for smart lighting.

222
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,470
Controlling the lights
all over the building

223
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:57,700
through this network.

224
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,590
Now our research department found out

225
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:05,590
that it is quite easy to
hack into the ZigBee gateway.

226
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,450
You can simulate a ZigBee
device from your laptop,

227
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:11,940
connect to the gateway, manipulated it,

228
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:15,280
make it think that you
have a legit ZigBee device

229
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,689
and installed inside a malware.

230
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:19,650
Now think about the next scenario.

231
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:22,630
You can sit in the lobby of a large bank.

232
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:24,120
The only thing you need to make sure

233
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,970
is that you will be in the range

234
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:28,000
of the ZigBee wireless network.

235
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,360
And now you can hack into the
system and for an example,

236
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,873
turn off all the lights
in the entire building.

237
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:40,010
In case you've missed this case,

238
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:42,700
few months ago this
group of ethical hackers

239
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:45,550
managed to find 28,000 printers

240
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:47,890
that are connected to the internet.

241
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:50,730
As you've seen it, it's quite
easy to find those printers,

242
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:54,170
just go and search for
them in Shodan website.

243
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:56,270
And they managed to
connect to those printers

244
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:58,620
and send them a command that caused them

245
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,850
to print this page saying
"This printer has been hacked,

246
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:03,800
here is a list of things
that you need to do

247
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,380
in order to secure this printer."

248
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:09,686
Now, once you've managed to
get a connection to a printer

249
00:12:09,686 --> 00:12:13,597
it is quite easy to hack into the printer.

250
00:12:13,597 --> 00:12:16,238
And in case I'm always saying,

251
00:12:16,238 --> 00:12:18,100
there is a hacker that ready to use

252
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:21,422
free exploitation toolkit that
you can download from GitHub,

253
00:12:21,422 --> 00:12:23,770
PRET Printer Exploitation Toolkit.

254
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:25,930
Just run this application,

255
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:28,319
give it the IP address of the printer.

256
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,910
And there's a high
probability that this printer

257
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:35,910
is based on a port 9,100 IPP,
Internet Printer Protocol.

258
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,480
And there it is, you can
hack into the printer.

259
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,290
There is a very nice list of,

260
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:43,660
all several things that
you can do to this printer.

261
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,959
For example, get a copy of everything

262
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,420
that is being sent to this printer,

263
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:50,000
or maybe it use this
printer for (indistinct),

264
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,963
or maybe even cause a physical
damage to this printer.

265
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:59,670
This is a smart controller
that is being used in BMS,

266
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,459
Building Management System.

267
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:06,410
On one side, the interfaces
such as a BACnet, Modbus

268
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:09,750
to the different systems
inside the building.

269
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:13,440
You can connect it to HVAC,
to smart lighting and so on.

270
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,133
On the other side, as you can
see there is a web interface,

271
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:20,381
you can connect to this controller

272
00:13:20,381 --> 00:13:22,622
and you will get a very nice dashboard,

273
00:13:24,072 --> 00:13:28,070
enabling you to control all the
devices inside the building.

274
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:30,750
Now, more than a year ago,

275
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:33,520
US department of Homeland
security published

276
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:37,040
a higher risk score to this device.

277
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,810
Actually it was, it is the highest score,

278
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:41,770
it gave it a score of 10

279
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:45,160
with a critical risk with a
backdoor based on port 22,

280
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:49,760
enable attackers to gain
control over this controller

281
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,510
and basically to gain control
over the complete systems

282
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:54,870
inside the building.

283
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:57,010
Now of course that the
vendor immediately released

284
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:59,827
a software update,
called all the customers,

285
00:13:59,827 --> 00:14:03,040
"You need to immediately update
the software inside device,"

286
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,910
but I'm interested to know how
many of the customers didn't

287
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:09,620
did this upgrade.

288
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,610
Think about the Seesaw of a large bank

289
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:14,080
getting this email
telling him you need to go

290
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,410
and upgrade the software

291
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:19,670
inside your Building Management System.

292
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:22,400
Probably he will not know
what you're talking about.

293
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,900
He's dealing with users,
and account and clouds.

294
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:29,242
So, he might forgot to do this upgrade.

295
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:33,613
This is a real ultrasound machine

296
00:14:33,613 --> 00:14:35,760
that we bought to Check Point Labs

297
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,420
in order to try and hack into it.

298
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:41,719
And the thing is that it
took us only a few minutes

299
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,760
to succeed with that.

300
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,170
And the reason is that this machine

301
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:47,892
is based on windows 2000
with no security patches.

302
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,610
Now, this is how it looked

303
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:53,740
once we've managed to
hack into this machine.

304
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:57,150
we managed to get access
to the medical records

305
00:14:57,150 --> 00:15:01,130
that were store inside
this ultrasound machine.

306
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:04,030
We also managed to get
access to the DICOM protocol

307
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:07,400
that we're going towards
the (indistinct) sender.

308
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,050
Now, if you will go to the vendor,

309
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:11,310
in this case it is Phillips

310
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,040
and you will ask them what to do.

311
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,790
They will tell you, what do you want?

312
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,920
This machine is end of life.

313
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,439
You need to go and replace this machine.

314
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,520
But this is a perfectly working machine

315
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,699
and we have budget limitations
and operational limitations.

316
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,920
And we would like to
keep using this machine.

317
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,660
And this is exactly what's
going on inside hospitals.

318
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,930
They're using legacy machines

319
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:37,290
or machines that are based
on legacy operating systems,

320
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:40,110
and those are perfectly working devices

321
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:42,793
that have been used
inside hospitals networks.

322
00:15:46,268 --> 00:15:50,830
About a year ago, there
was a cyber attack attempt

323
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:53,193
against the water system here in Israel.

324
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:57,219
Now, nothing seriously really happen

325
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,943
but of course it was all over the news.

326
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,829
Looking into a water system,

327
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:08,250
we will notice that there
are many subsystems inside,

328
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:12,050
there are many sub networks
and many elements and devices.

329
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:16,670
And part of this system
can be far water pumps

330
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:20,660
that might be used even by private users.

331
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,699
And in many cases, those water pumps

332
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,280
are connected to the internet

333
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,180
where controllers that is similar

334
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,849
to the controller that
you are seeing here,

335
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:30,850
in this case the model is ADAM-6,000,

336
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:33,130
it can be any other controller.

337
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:35,057
Most of them are based on the same concept

338
00:16:35,057 --> 00:16:37,530
for one side there is a serial interface.

339
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:40,020
And on the other side, there
is the internet connection.

340
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:44,031
I know we mostly can, for
example, open or close this pump.

341
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,870
The interesting thing to see is that

342
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:49,900
you can see I found more
than 1,800 controllers

343
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:53,310
such as this one that are
connected to the internet.

344
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:55,609
And specifically this controller

345
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:58,090
comes with a default password

346
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:02,070
zero zero zero zero zero zero zero seven.

347
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:05,140
Also a known CVE for this controller.

348
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:08,650
And I can ensure you that
most of those controllers

349
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:10,760
are still based on this default password.

350
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,477
Think about the farmer
who using this controller,

351
00:17:12,477 --> 00:17:15,943
and doxing he's going and
changing those passwords.

352
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:20,139
So as probably you've
guessed it is quite easy

353
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,633
to crack this password,

354
00:17:22,588 --> 00:17:25,832
and to get control over the water pump.

355
00:17:27,467 --> 00:17:30,700
And this bring us to the challenge itself.

356
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:34,200
The question is, okay, so
what done, what should we do?

357
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:38,480
You have a huge number of IOT
devices inside your network

358
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,800
and those devices are unmanaged
and invisible devices.

359
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,370
If you will go, when you
would search for those devices

360
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:49,159
in your existing security
management system

361
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,690
you will not find those devices.

362
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:55,230
Those devices are very
easy to access as you seen,

363
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:57,990
and those devices are
very easy to hack into.

364
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:02,399
So we going to switch now to Justin,

365
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,760
who is going to present what
should be the right solution

366
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,730
in order to address this challenge.

367
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:12,750
- All right, thank you
Itzik for that introduction.

368
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,020
Again, my name is Justin Sowder.

369
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:18,348
I'm a Solutions Architect for
Check Point for the Americas.

370
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:21,370
A reminder, there's a live
Q and A happening now.

371
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:24,229
I think these stories are all
fascinating and interesting,

372
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:25,770
and certainly some of the scenarios

373
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:29,250
that Itzik laid out there
are thought provoking

374
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,660
for the various different industries.

375
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:35,460
So laying out what Itzik has done here

376
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:40,070
with a bunch of examples
of how things can go wrong.

377
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:42,050
I wanted to take this and
turn it into a discussion

378
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:45,240
about what we can do from
a cybersecurity perspective

379
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,430
to help minimize the risk here.

380
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:50,430
And really it breaks down
into four different pillars.

381
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:54,010
The first of which is that
discovery and risk analysis.

382
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:56,490
How do we find out what's there?

383
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:59,070
How do we find out how
many devices are out there?

384
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:02,560
How much shadow IT is
happening through acquisitions?

385
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,889
We have non standards in different sites

386
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:07,950
and really just mapping out,

387
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:10,670
what we don't know is the first part

388
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:13,500
and getting as close to possible as we can

389
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,950
to an accurate representation
of what's in our environment.

390
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:20,100
The second piece of that
is the zero trust model,

391
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,669
moving into some form of that

392
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:23,810
where we start isolating these devices

393
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:26,950
from the rest of our
network and from each other.

394
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:31,270
By doing that we reduce the
risk of east-west exploitation.

395
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,610
We reduce the risk of some of the things

396
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:36,592
that Itzik talked about
in that in his portion.

397
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:41,980
Aside from just a basic
firewall prevention,

398
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,410
what we also wanna do is look at

399
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:45,670
what we can do from a
threat prevention side.

400
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:47,840
How do we keep these devices functioning

401
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,760
in their designed roles
while preventing traffic

402
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,660
to things like command the control servers

403
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:57,680
or other malicious activity
that they might be doing.

404
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,850
Crypto mining reporting,
things along those lines.

405
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:03,110
It's important to not necessarily

406
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:04,889
take a heavy cybersecurity hand

407
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:07,630
and say we just wanna
purely isolate that box

408
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:09,650
that might actually have a bigger impact

409
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:12,300
than letting it continue in that fashion.

410
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,430
And that ties directly into the detection

411
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:15,930
and response piece of this,

412
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:18,890
which is now that I know
what my devices are,

413
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:21,100
now that I have visibility into 'em,

414
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,050
how do I respond to incidents?

415
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:26,950
And how do I detect detect those incidents

416
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:28,340
and get the right people involved

417
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:30,589
to take the right action with those?

418
00:20:30,589 --> 00:20:32,560
(Justin clears throat)

419
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:35,480
And that comes down to a
fundamental design here,

420
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,250
you'll see three basic components.

421
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,760
The first of which is
the IOT Discovery Engine.

422
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,250
Other, there are some examples here.

423
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:45,580
Those are not meant to be a all inclusive.

424
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:47,669
This might be a tool of your making.

425
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:49,720
This might be some repository

426
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,760
where you're doing that first piece,

427
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,470
that discovery and analysis
of the data that's out there

428
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:58,380
of the devices and things like that.

429
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,490
The second piece of that,

430
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:01,880
all that data has to be fed into a system

431
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,430
that can take that data,

432
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:07,270
use it in a fashion, extract information

433
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:11,700
and use that to enforce policy later on

434
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,010
into the third piece of this,

435
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:15,600
which is that security gateway itself.

436
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,689
And these can be deployed in a
couple of different fashions.

437
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:19,580
I'll talk about that in a little bit,

438
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,570
but the idea here is that this flow

439
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:23,770
should be completely automated.

440
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:25,650
From a new device being connected

441
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:27,740
or an existing device being discovered

442
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,840
to this IOT security management

443
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,280
that will extrapolate the data,

444
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,090
extrapolate relevant tags to your policy.

445
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:36,300
And then down to an enforcement point,

446
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:40,760
then makes this again, not that
heavy handed cybersecurity.

447
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,730
We're gonna dictate
that we drop everything

448
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:44,380
and all new devices have to have

449
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:46,000
a ticket associated with them.

450
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,610
And it's a slow process that
encourages your shadow IT,

451
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:51,949
but that this is automated,

452
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:55,850
and that the users don't
see an impact to this flow

453
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:57,300
from a new device coming on

454
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:00,653
to it being protected and
enforced in the security realm.

455
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:04,660
And as Itzek laid out there
are four different areas

456
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,460
that we tend to focus on here.

457
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,700
And I wanna go into those
in a bit more detail.

458
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,690
The first being Smart Office.

459
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:12,780
This has become very important for us,

460
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,760
certainly as a lot of us
have been working remote

461
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,790
over the last year that's
actually expanded the footprint

462
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:21,139
into devices that we no
longer have control of

463
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,110
from a corporate side.

464
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:24,697
Our kids' laptops, anything like that

465
00:22:24,698 --> 00:22:28,040
that might be another vector to get in

466
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:28,970
through a corporate machine

467
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:30,780
that's running on a home network.

468
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:33,540
Smart Building has been
emphasized here as well.

469
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:37,280
There's been a major
push for energy concerns

470
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,250
and things like that with
buildings to automate reactions

471
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:43,710
in the building from
movement to eight-track

472
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:45,070
to any of these things.

473
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,939
And there've been several vulnerabilities

474
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,840
that have been exploited in major breaches

475
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,810
that have gone in through these systems.

476
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:53,550
They typically do need to have
some kind of remote access

477
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:57,730
and to do maintenance or
scheduled work for those.

478
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:02,623
And those can be another vector
for threats to infiltrate.

479
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:06,250
Industrial also has its own
unique set of challenges

480
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:08,250
from very short downtime windows,

481
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:11,220
maybe once a year, maybe twice a year,

482
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,930
to these machines being designed

483
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:15,570
to run an environment for 20 years

484
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:17,360
and with minimal interaction,

485
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,010
people that have implemented
them have been gone

486
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:22,200
from the company for some period of time,

487
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,240
there may be very little documentation

488
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,790
other than we just know
that this environment works

489
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:28,250
and we don't want to touch it

490
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:31,070
and potentially break our process.

491
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:33,780
And last medical, probably
one of the front and foremost

492
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:34,620
over the past year,

493
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:37,600
as we've seen everything
happened in the world,

494
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,939
these devices have an
impact on patient care.

495
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:43,370
Again, back to the point of
we wanna monitor everything

496
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:45,270
about a patient we wanna see it live.

497
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:47,379
We want doctors to be
able to pull things up

498
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:51,320
in different environments,
immediately or remotely.

499
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:55,270
And these devices are hampered from FTA

500
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:57,620
or other body regulations that say

501
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:59,610
you cannot run antivirus on this,

502
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:01,879
or we have certain versions.

503
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:05,140
As you know, I've also seen
some windows 95 machines

504
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:09,070
out there, some very old
cryo freezer controllers

505
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:09,939
and things like that.

506
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:13,590
So all of these have their
own unique challenge.

507
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:16,000
And the important part here is that

508
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:16,870
when you're looking at this

509
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:18,610
from your environment perspective

510
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:20,979
to identify which one of these

511
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:23,110
is the most important for you.

512
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:25,719
Which is the most
relevant to your business

513
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,810
and which is the largest threat factor

514
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:29,450
and the most exposure.

515
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:31,670
It might be a combination of these

516
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:35,820
for instance a hospital certainly
is also a Smart Building.

517
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:38,700
So as an industrial maybe
has remote office workers now

518
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:39,720
or something like that.

519
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:43,060
So it doesn't necessarily
just fall into one of these.

520
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:45,193
It might be multiple to consider there.

521
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,220
As we're getting into device details,

522
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:51,050
and this goes back to kind of that first

523
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:53,540
and second phase of my mapping,

524
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:56,230
it's important to gather
as much information

525
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:58,130
as possible about the device.

526
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:01,280
Certainly saying that it's
an IP camera for instance,

527
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,780
is a good start and we're gonna

528
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:04,899
start building things with that.

529
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:07,940
But we also wanna do some
kind of risk scoring here.

530
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:12,940
We wanna be able to say
based on a firmware version

531
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:15,010
or based on anything like that,

532
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:18,129
that this device is
more or less vulnerable.

533
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:21,370
And we do that by comparing
known CVEs to certain firmwares.

534
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:23,419
A lot of these vendors are getting better

535
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:26,550
about publishing those
details and comparing them.

536
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:29,820
And so you know, as you're
deploying this IP camera

537
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,220
into your network, what the risk is of it

538
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,710
based on that firmware version.

539
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:38,600
Other details MAC addresses
are pretty fundamental

540
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,070
from a starting point,

541
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:42,250
they don't get you much beyond that.

542
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:45,070
As we're looking through
different vendors,

543
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:48,149
there tends to be a lot more
deeper protocol analysis

544
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:51,260
and baselining that is very
relevant to the devices

545
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:53,460
more so than just the MAC address.

546
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:56,400
But any information that you
can pull in is important,

547
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,480
it may be its NetFlow data,

548
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,920
maybe its integration with
a wireless controller,

549
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,210
maybe its integration
with your NAC solution,

550
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:04,820
whatever the case may be.

551
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:07,610
The more protocol and analysis

552
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:11,050
that you can get on a
device to build that profile

553
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:14,750
is gonna help you in
developing an accurate policy

554
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:17,713
that is minimally impactful
to the environment.

555
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:22,140
And when we take that
data, all that information,

556
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:25,570
we wanna build it into a
policy that actually lets us,

557
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:27,340
again get into this dynamic piece

558
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:30,840
where a security administrator
is not overburdened

559
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,810
with requests but also that provides

560
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:34,830
an important

561
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:39,400
proper layer of security

562
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,280
versus just a let's let
anything out to the internet

563
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:45,240
and make sure that it does that.

564
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,850
So an example would be here.

565
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:49,610
These are some tags that we've inserted

566
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:51,370
into a couple of different pieces,

567
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:52,879
and you can see in that source column,

568
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,860
and in a couple of other pieces.

569
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:59,310
We're able to tag that data and
use that into policy itself.

570
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:01,480
And this should be something
that should be done

571
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:04,760
via an API with any vendor
to be able to build this out

572
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,970
and map these components.

573
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:08,690
So you can see an example here
of a taken security camera,

574
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:10,950
any security camera we find,

575
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:12,890
we're gonna permit these protocols,

576
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:15,630
but if you'll see you later,
if that risk level is critical

577
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:18,400
maybe we've identified that
by the firmware version.

578
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,770
Maybe we've identified
that by some other piece,

579
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:23,760
it will actually prevent that traffic.

580
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,680
And so we're doing some
risk management right here

581
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:29,070
in the blue section,
the middle blue section,

582
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:30,530
whereas on the top in the red

583
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:32,710
we're actually permitting
the proper traffic

584
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:34,083
that we need too for that.

585
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:36,970
And another example that's hugely popular

586
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:39,130
is using manufacturer tags.

587
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:40,280
That's where that MAC address

588
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,110
tends to come in a little more.

589
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:44,139
What that does is it gives us the ability

590
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:46,570
to restrict the domain level access

591
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:48,950
to what those devices have access to.

592
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:50,840
You'll see that some of
these are very chatty,

593
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,770
as you start looking at net flow data

594
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:55,950
with various connections
that they're making.

595
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:58,720
A lot of vendors are getting
better again on publishing

596
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,270
exactly where device should be talking to,

597
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:03,379
what it should be talking to for updates.

598
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:05,610
If you wanna allow that at all,

599
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:08,580
is another concern that you
wanna take into account,

600
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,530
but those domains you can restrict

601
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:13,200
and you can be careful
about what's going out,

602
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,130
and any deviation from that

603
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:17,520
you then choose ultimately
as your cleanup.

604
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,120
Do I want to still permit this

605
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,689
and put it in a detect mode

606
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:23,270
and look for deviations
and alert on those?

607
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:26,930
Or do I want to drop traffic
that doesn't meet my baseline?

608
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:29,080
That's gonna depend on your comfort level

609
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,480
with the policy that
you've built above that.

610
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:34,750
That's gonna depend on
the potential impact

611
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:37,180
for health care for instance,

612
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:41,570
of drop packets and the
implication that that may have

613
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:43,423
or anything along those lines.

614
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:48,260
So building that policy
little easier said than done,

615
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,650
and a lot of cases those
tags are great to do that,

616
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:52,350
but these are some areas
that I'd encourage you

617
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:54,850
to take advantage of as
you're looking for this,

618
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:58,520
and this should all be part
of an API driven exercise

619
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,710
to go through.

620
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:00,960
Profiling the device.

621
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,430
There's a lot of tools out there
that you can actually take.

622
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:05,790
And some of those I showed earlier,

623
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:08,290
will actually build profiles of devices,

624
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:09,740
mapping out the protocols,

625
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,550
mapping out where it's talking to,

626
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:14,600
what's relevant and alerting on that,

627
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,240
building that out for you.

628
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,010
And that ties directly
into the traffic baseline.

629
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:21,550
I wanna make sure that
I capture all traffic

630
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:23,770
that's relevant for that device.

631
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:28,240
Maybe it does one thing for
29 out of 30 days in a month

632
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,500
but that 30th day there's a
batch that deviates from that.

633
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,650
I need to make sure
that I account for that

634
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:35,490
and decide in that baseline,

635
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:38,060
how I want to handle that piece.

636
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,800
Crowdsourcing another great spot.

637
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,139
There's a ton of data out there

638
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:45,240
for various pieces of devices.

639
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,490
And when selecting these
IOT devices, you know,

640
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:49,190
that may be a consideration for you.

641
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:51,180
How active is the community on that?

642
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,610
What kind of data is out there?

643
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:55,729
How well do they integrate
with your other solutions

644
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:58,680
in the security realm and in
the rest of the network realm?

645
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,610
I said I'll talk a little bit more

646
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:05,850
now we're going to the
enforcement piece of this.

647
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:08,580
North-south, that's the
traditional starting point

648
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,350
for most customers looking at that data

649
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,560
that's going out to the internet.

650
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:15,919
Looking at traffic like
Anti-Bot traffic, you know,

651
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,840
known CNCs is a very easy way to find

652
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:22,179
and capture devices that
have been compromised

653
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:24,610
and doing whatever it is
that they're doing there.

654
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:27,060
East-west is kind of the next generation

655
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,120
of where we're going out here.

656
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,580
What does that look like?

657
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:31,560
And it's a bit more of a challenging task,

658
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,879
because traditionally we've
just dumped these devices

659
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:36,480
on the VLANS and we've let them go through

660
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,540
and do whatever they want to

661
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:40,570
without any mapping of the
communication between it.

662
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:42,770
That's great from a
functionality perspective,

663
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:44,740
it really hurts us from the security side

664
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:47,910
as we can get that lateral
movement between devices

665
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:50,560
and then potentially
exploiting north-south.

666
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:53,050
So, we know there's a
lot of different ways

667
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:55,040
to approach this, really again,

668
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,149
it's assessing your risk level, you know,

669
00:30:57,150 --> 00:30:59,070
what fault domains you
wanna have in there.

670
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:02,500
How do you isolate
machines in your network

671
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:05,920
and looking at what kind
of block choke points

672
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,750
that you can put in to your
environment at that point

673
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:12,713
to make sure that you've
minimized your risk there.

674
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:17,010
Virtual patching just
like has been traditional

675
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:19,940
in the server world for a long time.

676
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:22,530
Also absolutely important in the world

677
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:24,520
of IOT devices as well,

678
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:27,730
understanding again, like in
the industrial world you don't,

679
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:28,940
you cannot patch right away.

680
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:31,760
You've gotta wait for a
different change window

681
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,370
that might happen once a year.

682
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:34,879
Medical's a very similar thing.

683
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,150
You've gotta roll devices in

684
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:38,480
when they're not taking care
of patients for these things.

685
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,210
So being able to use
technologies like an IPS

686
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:45,450
to block that in that
virtual patching model,

687
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:47,720
hugely important as a first step.

688
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,320
It's not a get out of jail free card

689
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,810
to avoid ever touching and
upgrading these devices.

690
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:53,780
You absolutely still should.

691
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:55,030
But it's important to think about

692
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:58,410
where you're positioning
this IPS device as well

693
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:03,290
to make sure that it is also
blocking lateral movement

694
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:04,670
between those devices.

695
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:06,630
But still permitting
that authorized traffic,

696
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:10,020
again, these devices do
have a significant number

697
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:14,210
of important functions
that may keep people alive

698
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:15,630
or keep the business running.

699
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:18,830
And in that case, it's
important to go through

700
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:21,189
and make sure that that authorized traffic

701
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:23,853
is still permitted in those scenarios.

702
00:32:25,791 --> 00:32:27,360
(clears throat), excuse me.

703
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:32,360
On the topic of identifying these devices,

704
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:34,330
Itzik talked about Mirai as well.

705
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:36,800
It's important to look at these pieces

706
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,270
of the CNC connection.

707
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:40,139
You see the camera example here

708
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:41,550
as we're going through,

709
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:45,250
and feeding that data in
to some kind of solution

710
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:47,530
where you're building that profile up

711
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:50,340
to know that this is a bad connection,

712
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:53,149
whatever that technology looks like

713
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:56,380
there are a lot of good
third party threat providers

714
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:58,180
out there that will provide data for you

715
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:01,350
to feed into your
systems, to look for this.

716
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:05,679
You know, there are constantly
updated lists of CNCs

717
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:09,650
and various other known bad
entities out there in the world

718
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,400
that are provided from governments,

719
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:16,640
from private firms, from paid feeds.

720
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:20,090
Any of these things you should
be considering these feeds

721
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:23,560
and looking at indicators of
compromise in your environment

722
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:28,560
to make sure that the
devices in your network

723
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:33,630
are not reaching out to any
of those known variables.

724
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:37,240
And that ties me into another
interesting piece here

725
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:41,650
that goes into what do
we do with the unknown?

726
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:43,990
What do we do with the devices themselves

727
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:47,250
and how do we prevent
these from doing anything

728
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:49,750
that we don't want them to?

729
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:51,580
And this is kind of
something new and interesting

730
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:52,889
that we're working on as well,

731
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:56,548
as looking at the firmware
level of the devices themselves.

732
00:33:56,548 --> 00:33:58,780
Itzik told the story
earlier of crypto mining

733
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:00,520
becoming more and more popular.

734
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:04,010
It's very very easy to do
in a lot of these devices

735
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:06,050
running a basic Linux
kernel to install these

736
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:09,139
especially if they're
compromised at that point.

737
00:34:09,139 --> 00:34:11,120
And the idea behind that is

738
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,370
I don't care if I burn this device out.

739
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:15,409
I want to run every processor,

740
00:34:15,409 --> 00:34:18,239
every piece of compute resource on this,

741
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:20,429
as hard as I can, for as long as I can

742
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:25,429
to extract the maximum amount
of cryptocurrency from it

743
00:34:25,929 --> 00:34:28,739
before it basically melts.

744
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:30,580
So what we're actually doing in this space

745
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:33,389
and this is a combination
of working directly

746
00:34:33,389 --> 00:34:37,359
with IOT manufacturers
and working with customers

747
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,690
who are deploying these devices,

748
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:41,590
is looking at this concept of a nano agent

749
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:46,480
where we'll actually look
at the code of the firmware

750
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:50,650
as it's executed to determine
if, is it doing anything bad.

751
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:53,440
Is it doing any control flow hijacking?

752
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,100
Is it doing, is there
any memory corruption

753
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,120
taking place on this device?

754
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,970
And if so, block that in real time

755
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,560
and prevent it from happening.

756
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,880
Now, the challenge with
that is how do we do that

757
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,380
with a very small footprint?

758
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:09,330
A lot of these devices as Itzik said,

759
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:12,360
don't have a lot of
compute on them themselves.

760
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:16,350
They're made very specifically
for a very specific task

761
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:20,630
and having a massive security footprint

762
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:23,350
or sticking a firewall of some type

763
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:27,133
in front of every IP camera
simply isn't feasible.

764
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:30,040
The way that can be done

765
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,680
is at the very very
very small light agent,

766
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:36,629
that agent sitting as part
of the compiled firmware,

767
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:39,420
phones homes to then get
its profile signature

768
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:41,240
of what kind of device it is,

769
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,970
and what kind of protections
we want to run on it.

770
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:45,799
It is important for this to be tuned

771
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,130
to very specific devices.

772
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:50,660
And in such a way, we make sure that

773
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:53,230
there isn't a lot of extra
overhead on the device

774
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:56,530
that is not impactful to the
device itself and what it does.

775
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:59,300
Again, these are potentially
life-saving devices

776
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:03,160
that we do not want to
input any other overhead

777
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:06,113
on them to prevent them from
performing their function.

778
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:11,830
So with that, hopefully, Itzik
scared you in the beginning

779
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:13,290
with some of the stories,

780
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:15,500
I talked a little bit
about some of the solutions

781
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:18,070
and some of the design
considerations to have,

782
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:21,160
as we said IOT is coming, it's here

783
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,859
and hopefully you're
more ready for it now.

784
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:25,680
Thank you again, everyone for attending,

785
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,140
it's been our privilege to
present in this virtual expo.

786
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:31,960
Look forward to the next time.

787
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:32,950
Thanks a lot for your time

788
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:34,640
and enjoy the rest of the conference.

789
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,473
Thank you.
