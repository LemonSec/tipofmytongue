00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:03,190
- Hello everyone, my name is Jen Trahan.

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:05,550
I am a VP of Product Security,

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:08,050
and I'm here with Wiktor Szymanski.

4
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:10,910
We wanna say a big thank you
for coming and joining us.

5
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,160
We're gonna go ahead and talk about

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,210
information security
make-over and specifically

7
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:16,700
we wanna dig it into product security.

8
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,810
If you have any questions
during your presentation,

9
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:23,273
please feel free to ask them
in the chat during our talk.

10
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:28,230
So when I told a friend I
was going to be presenting

11
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,100
on product security, they asked
me a really great question

12
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,940
and it turns out I didn't
know the answer to it.

13
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,610
So what they had asked
me is how many companies

14
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,019
are actually doing product security.

15
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:40,150
And while I've heard of product security

16
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:43,220
for the last decade, and
certainly it's hit a fever pitch

17
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,720
here in the last four or five years,

18
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,269
I actually have no idea how many companies

19
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:49,780
are doing product security.

20
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:52,680
So I decided I try to measure that myself.

21
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,067
So, I went and looked at
the fortune 100 companies,

22
00:00:56,067 --> 00:00:58,240
and I put them all in a spreadsheet,

23
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,050
that's right, science by
me, and then I decided,

24
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,239
I estimate who's doing product security

25
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:07,040
by looking at their active
recruiting positions.

26
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,590
And I was looking for
anyone who was hiring

27
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:10,280
product security at any level.

28
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,500
And what I found when I
added them all in my very

29
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,480
official spreadsheet, was
that 19 out of the 100,

30
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,280
we're actively hiring product security.

31
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,320
So that's roughly 19% obviously.

32
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,509
So it's safe to say that 19%
of the fortune 100 companies

33
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:28,720
are actively hiring somebody
for product security right now.

34
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,310
Additionally, when I
looked in certain tech,

35
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:34,550
mainstream tech companies, I
found it was somewhere closer

36
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:37,039
to 50% are actively
hiring product security.

37
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,203
So we know that the number is
probably even more than this.

38
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,450
Since we know one in five companies

39
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:45,410
is doing product security,
let's talk a little bit

40
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:46,693
about what it is.

41
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,550
Truth is, there is no consistent
or standardized framework

42
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:56,250
for what makes product security.

43
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,870
I'd say that there are a lot of emerging

44
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:01,037
and working definitions
on product security,

45
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:03,090
so if you were to go out
and look on the internet

46
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,423
you'd see a number of
them, I've got them here.

47
00:02:05,423 --> 00:02:07,280
I think the big things is
we wanna call out some key

48
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,970
important aspects at all of
these definitions call out.

49
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:14,800
So in this case, a super set of security,

50
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,150
a particular product and
system, and then a partnership

51
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:22,110
with all the stakeholders
as well as across

52
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:25,660
the entire product life
cycle, and then lastly,

53
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:28,000
you know, cross-discipline endeavor.

54
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,710
And I think I would add, to though

55
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:33,900
all those great definitions, I
would add that in my opinion,

56
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,200
product security is an
approach for structuring

57
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,869
your security program around
the threat model of a product

58
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,720
and the entire scope of that product.

59
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,500
So now while we have a
definition of product security,

60
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,530
let's talk about some frequent questions

61
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:50,680
or some confusing areas
that I've definitely

62
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,280
had some heated debates
with some coworkers about.

63
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,780
One of them is what
about enterprise security

64
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,170
and how does that relate?

65
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:59,303
And the other one is about application.

66
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:04,100
So let's walk through the main
components of an enterprise

67
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:08,920
and what it takes to enable a
business to go about its day.

68
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:12,989
So we've got data centers,
laptops obviously,

69
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:17,480
physical offices, things like
email, wireless networks,

70
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,540
sensitive data, mobile
devices that your employees

71
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:24,070
might have as well as
other systems like VTC.

72
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,820
And all of these are
something that bad actors,

73
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:30,222
including sharks are very
interested in taking advantage of.

74
00:03:31,074 --> 00:03:34,150
And enterprise security is
really focused on all the aspects

75
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:36,480
of it enterprise and
really about protecting

76
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,730
the enterprise as a whole

77
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,870
So let's walk through a
product and the aspects

78
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,080
that we need to consider for that.

79
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,650
In this case, let's talk about a product

80
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:47,940
that might be an e-commerce
product, for example.

81
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:48,773
And we're going to look at this

82
00:03:48,773 --> 00:03:50,720
from the consumer's point of view.

83
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,630
So if we look here, we've got
our product in the center,

84
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:56,329
and let's think about what a
consumer might interact with.

85
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:59,700
So the likely interact with
some of our applications,

86
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,980
they may call our customer care providers,

87
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:05,010
they are likely gonna provide
us with sensitive data

88
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,983
so that we can ship them
a product, for example.

89
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:10,989
They're gonna be thumbing
through our applications

90
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:15,030
and we have content that's
feeding into those applications.

91
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:17,300
Behind the covers, a lot
of this is probably hosted

92
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:20,200
maybe in our example
in a cloud environment.

93
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,080
They're developers who work
with all of those different

94
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:26,159
applications and content pipelines.

95
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,230
We have lots of different
types of operational tools

96
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:30,230
that tell us from a how
the consumer metrics

97
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:32,300
how they're enjoying our product
all the way down to whether

98
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,350
or not our systems are up and
running as we expect them.

99
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:37,740
And just under all of
that, the source code

100
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:41,290
in the application
development side of things.

101
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:44,240
So all of this makes up
the product surface area

102
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,660
and all the different
components that make up

103
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,110
for what I would consider to be a product.

104
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:51,840
And again, just like an
enterprise environment,

105
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,289
there are bad actors,
fraudsters, bots, aliens,

106
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:58,910
they're all looking to do
something potentially to exploit

107
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:01,910
these systems and product
security is really focused

108
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:04,843
around the end-to-end of
security, these products.

109
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,960
And so, as you can see from an enterprise

110
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,630
versus product security,
there's a very significant

111
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:13,640
surface areas in both
of these circles here.

112
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,860
They likely both require very
robust security controls,

113
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,220
but they might have very
different information

114
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,200
security capabilities needed.

115
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,170
And so, they're both very
important but they may have

116
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:26,020
very different security requirements.

117
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,099
So now let's talk a little bit
about application security.

118
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:33,430
Application security is focused primarily

119
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:38,090
on historically on the top
half of what we have here

120
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:39,469
for our example product.

121
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:42,350
So things like the applications,
the sensitive data,

122
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:44,540
the source code, and
the development pipeline

123
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:47,640
for getting those
applications to our consumers.

124
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,969
And as you can see, that
leaves a lot of other things

125
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:53,700
kind of out in the cold
and our favorite aliens

126
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,289
are coming in and they're not protected

127
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,310
by application security, 'cause
we've got some other things

128
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:00,450
that are out of scope
that aren't protecting

129
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:01,300
the product here.

130
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:06,080
Just to kind of double click
into that a little bit more,

131
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,310
application security is
usually focused a lot

132
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:10,470
on the analysis, and
then we had our big wave

133
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,890
of shift left and that was
great, that's really about

134
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:15,828
putting security more into how
we're building the products,

135
00:06:15,828 --> 00:06:18,739
and I think that that has
really moved the needle a lot,

136
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,870
but there are other
areas like for example,

137
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:24,170
an AppSec team is generally
working really closely

138
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:26,700
with the engineering
teams to prevent things

139
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,360
like account takeover
attacks, for example,

140
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,090
for something like a
consumer, e-commerce product.

141
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:34,450
They're creating strong passwords,
all these great controls,

142
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:37,010
but generally speaking, an
AppSec team, isn't interacting

143
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:39,830
with the customer care
department, for example,

144
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:42,030
to walk through their manual playbooks

145
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:45,059
and you know maybe not
working with them for things

146
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:48,030
like social engineering attacks
that might actually present

147
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:51,109
a real security risk to the
consumer data coming through

148
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:54,470
a more manual customer
service representative path

149
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:56,900
that's not coming through
an application for example.

150
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,419
Or other areas like operational readiness.

151
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,640
Application security teams
are rarely held accountable

152
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,419
for the entire operational readiness,

153
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:07,320
getting the security relevant
logs, et cetera, into the SIM

154
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:10,670
ensuring that we have things
like cloud and infrastructure

155
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:13,970
logs are in the SIM,
that's generally not been

156
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:16,050
the purview of an AppSec program.

157
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:18,500
So we've talked a little
bit, I kind of threw out

158
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,460
e-commerce product out
there as an example,

159
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:24,120
but let's talk a little bit
about what a product might be.

160
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,570
And I'd say at a very high
level, just think about anything

161
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:29,650
that is built by your
company that is important

162
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,380
to the success of your organization.

163
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:34,943
Obviously, I'll walk through
some very specific product type

164
00:07:34,943 --> 00:07:36,750
that you can think about,
but you know really

165
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,810
at a high level, something
that's built by your company,

166
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:39,940
that's important to the success,

167
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:42,100
so it might just be completely internal.

168
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,590
So obviously things like video games

169
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:46,380
and video game platforms,
maybe some more traditional

170
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,337
products coming off a factory line.

171
00:07:48,337 --> 00:07:51,280
You can think about cars
and subsystems of cars,

172
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,770
distributions systems, a software
for drop ship for example.

173
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:58,750
Perhaps you have a brick and
mortar portion of your company

174
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:02,100
and they have a consumer
merchandise and in store digital

175
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:05,300
experiences thinking
about those as products.

176
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:08,080
Medical equipment and
things like embedded devices

177
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,433
are becoming, implanted devices,
are becoming more and more

178
00:08:11,434 --> 00:08:15,680
popular and more and more
important to consumer,

179
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,500
so that would be a really
interesting area to look into.

180
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,660
Hospitality companies
while they have consumer

181
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:23,550
reservation systems, they
might also have very robust,

182
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,460
internally built critical staff.

183
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,489
Scheduling software that
might be really critical

184
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:29,960
to the operation of the business,

185
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,770
and I would consider that to be a product.

186
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:36,000
With the factory equipment,
other things like data science

187
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,780
and business intelligence
systems, ETL, ML, all of those,

188
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:42,110
those drive business
drive business decisions,

189
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:44,150
they would likely be considered a product

190
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:47,240
that you might need to
focus security area around.

191
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,920
And last but not least, obviously
things like IoT devices.

192
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,599
So really again, think
about it as something

193
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,150
that's significant that's
built by your company,

194
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:57,750
that is you know, really
important to the success

195
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:58,720
of your company.

196
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,370
And equally, I sometimes
think about it as a brand.

197
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:04,550
I'll think about a
product as a total brand.

198
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:06,990
I'll think about not only
the consumer applications

199
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:09,150
but is there a marketing
site that's also teasing

200
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:11,069
that application to come
out to market, et cetera.

201
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:13,220
So, you can also think
about it as a brand.

202
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:17,830
Great so now we considered
the entire scope

203
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:19,370
of what makes up a product, in our case,

204
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:21,730
we've got our example, consumer product,

205
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:24,660
an e-commerce product,
that might be a collection

206
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,100
of products in your world, but you know,

207
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,230
now we've kind of
considered what that makes,

208
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:29,550
what makes up that kind of product.

209
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:31,699
So let's consider what kind
of information security

210
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,540
capabilities it would be
required to have to secure

211
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,310
each of those different areas.

212
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:38,276
So here we have our example product again,

213
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:40,500
and what we're gonna do is an exercise

214
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,170
where we're going to determine
what kind of information

215
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:45,240
security organization and
capabilities we would need

216
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,870
to secure this product.

217
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:49,880
We wanna do this very
objectively, don't consider

218
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,640
what's already in your
security organization,

219
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,130
just consider what you
would do from scratch.

220
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:55,640
Pretend you were hired
to do this just to secure

221
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:59,590
this product or these product
types, what would you build?

222
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:02,160
So working with our example
here, let's start with the fact

223
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,170
that it's hosted in the cloud.

224
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,610
I think that's a good
place for us to start.

225
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:08,040
So, we'd wanna make sure
that we have a robust cloud

226
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,860
security program that would make sense.

227
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:13,550
So we want things like detection
catalog, anomaly detection,

228
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:17,359
audit logs, identity
management, IM et cetera,

229
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,220
as well as configuration
clients, et cetera.

230
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,800
So we definitely want
to make sure we've got

231
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,693
a robust cloud security program.

232
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,670
Moving into the more
DevSecOps side of things,

233
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:31,110
this is where we'll find more
of the basics of, you know,

234
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:34,500
classic application security
and a lot of the DevSecOps

235
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,570
shift left type of application security

236
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:38,210
that everyone's talking about.

237
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:40,560
But there are a couple other
areas that historically

238
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,430
I haven't seen more in the
DevSecOps side of things

239
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:45,699
specifically, I wanna call
out operational security

240
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:50,060
because things like monitoring
and alerting and dashboards

241
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:53,989
on the application layer and
beyond, is really important,

242
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:56,890
and we wanna make sure
that that's baked in.

243
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:59,210
And then let's think
about what our inventory?

244
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:00,470
What is the footprint?

245
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:03,000
What makes up this product or brand?

246
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,550
So thinking through an external inventory,

247
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:07,510
what does it look like
from the outside world?

248
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:09,390
What kind of data is
it collecting and what

249
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:11,930
in classifying that data,
as well as other things

250
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:14,699
related to our cloud account inventory.

251
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,620
And an obviously a robust
vulnerability management program

252
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,620
would be something that you wanna build.

253
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:23,470
And last, but certainly not
least, let's talk a little bit

254
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:24,660
about secure by design.

255
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,780
This would be something we'd wanna do

256
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,980
for a product like this, we'd
wanna make sure we include

257
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,340
all of the aspects that you'd have

258
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,240
in a mature application security program,

259
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,380
but then we wanna make
sure we expand beyond that,

260
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:36,220
to other avenues that
present risk to the products.

261
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:39,760
So things like I said, customer support

262
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,840
and we have other things
about feature design

263
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:45,370
and threat modeling, as well
as technical assessments.

264
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:50,140
And we'll wanna, you know,
pull all of that together,

265
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:53,300
and what you would end up
with is something very large,

266
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:56,020
that would be the end-to-end
of everything it would take

267
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,280
from a capabilities point
of view for an information

268
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:01,870
security organization to
properly secure a product

269
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:04,130
such as the one we have
here as an example.

270
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:06,500
And one of the notes I'd
like to kind of call out

271
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,620
is that if instead this product
wasn't an e-commerce product

272
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:12,580
you know, perhaps this product
was an embedded product.

273
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:15,600
You might have a whole
section on physical security

274
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,310
and your physical supply
chain, and how you get

275
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:21,060
your firmware burned into
your embedded device.

276
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:23,359
That would be totally appropriate
for that type of product.

277
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,020
So this is really meant to
be an exercise of thinking

278
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:28,670
about the different surface
areas, the threat model,

279
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:30,250
and how that maps to the capabilities

280
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,300
of how you would protect and defend that.

281
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:37,270
Now we've completed what I hope
to be a very objective view

282
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:39,990
of what it would take to
secure a product like this.

283
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:42,610
And let's bring it back
to your existing org.

284
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:45,030
So in our exercise, I'm gonna go through

285
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:48,240
and talk a little bit about
if I had an organization

286
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,410
that had a product that
we've been talking about,

287
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:53,260
and then taking that based on what I have

288
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:55,620
in my existing organization,
and looking at places

289
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:58,330
where I have some gaps.

290
00:12:58,330 --> 00:12:59,790
So we're gonna walk through this mind map

291
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:02,810
from the previous slide,
and in each aspect of it

292
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:06,119
really assess whether or not
your program's capabilities

293
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:10,060
are denoted here and
actually do they exist?

294
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:13,250
And so in this case, what I've
done is anything that's red

295
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:16,060
with a bold edge, are
true gaps in capabilities.

296
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:20,910
I means I'm missing tools, process, people

297
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:23,730
that know how to do these
types of security capabilities.

298
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:26,250
For the things that are
gray, there are more things

299
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:28,520
that exist as capabilities
within my organization,

300
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,340
but maybe I currently don't
use them for products.

301
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:33,820
Maybe I use them more for IT,
so if you think of something

302
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,880
like vulnerability management,
maybe I have a very

303
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:40,880
robust program for a enterprise,
IT laptops, for example,

304
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,390
but in a vulnerability
management program for that,

305
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:46,225
but I don't have that applied necessarily

306
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:49,600
to the infrastructure that that makes up

307
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,090
a product, for example.

308
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:55,110
So going through and
identifying gaps for areas

309
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:56,700
where I just don't have those capabilities

310
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,460
or areas where I'm not
leveraging what I already have.

311
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:02,960
And so this exercise is
really important to determine

312
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:06,290
you know, how well you are
positioned to be protecting

313
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:09,113
your products as you go
through this exercise.

314
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:14,920
So far, we've talked about
what a product security is

315
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,229
and how it right relate
to enterprise security

316
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:20,490
and how it is a super set
of application security.

317
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:24,280
We have gone over what the
concept of a product might mean

318
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,920
in your world, and then
we've done that lightweight

319
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,099
brainstorming exercise for end-to-end.

320
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,290
What kind of security
program would you need

321
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:33,030
to secure that product?

322
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:36,170
And then finally, kind of how
to think about highlighting

323
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:38,589
gaps based on that brainstorming model

324
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:41,163
for what kind of security
capabilities you have.

325
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,979
Now I want to transition more
into focusing on the people

326
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:47,023
that make up a product security program.

327
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,920
So recently, I've had a
major construction happening

328
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,469
in my house, which has been
very educational for me.

329
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:57,840
And there are many aspects that make up

330
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:02,840
a large remodel program
and project in my house.

331
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,140
I worked definitely
closely with an architect,

332
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:09,050
we have framer and builders
as well as everybody loves

333
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:12,699
their, you know, city
inspectors, we have painters

334
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,510
and dry wallers and
electricians and plumbers.

335
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:17,850
But thankfully I also
have a security contractor

336
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:20,980
and they're amazing, and
their fantastic company,

337
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:23,330
who's done a really great
job of making everything work

338
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:24,710
really, really smoothly.

339
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:26,810
And I'm really thankful for
that as I start to think

340
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:29,290
of all the other subsystems
that make up my house

341
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:32,650
in the parts of my house that
that need to be taken care of.

342
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:35,069
So things like physical security
and making sure all of that

343
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:37,990
is set and egress for a window,
and those kinds of things

344
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:39,340
I would never know about.

345
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:41,650
Smoke detectors and fire extinguishers

346
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:44,329
and other kinds of CO2 alarms, et cetera.

347
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:48,450
So, you know, they work
with other repair people,

348
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:50,820
safety specialists, and they
ensure that we're compliant

349
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,500
with the fire department, et cetera.

350
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,770
And as I was thinking through
this, it came very clear

351
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:57,890
to me the importance of
my general contractor

352
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:01,230
when he ended up having a small surgery

353
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:03,050
and he wasn't going to
be able to be on site

354
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:05,490
for about a week and a half.

355
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:09,260
And during that week and a
half, we had a very well-meaning

356
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:14,260
and eager dry waller, who was
trying to get their job done.

357
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,910
And they waited for the
plumber and the electrician

358
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:19,089
to finish their work, and they were about

359
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:20,740
to basically dry a wall over everything

360
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:23,250
as they're supposed to,
but the problem was is that

361
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,880
the inspection hadn't happened yet.

362
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,450
And so we almost had a huge
issue where the inspector

363
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:31,840
hadn't had a chance to sign
off on all of the plumbing

364
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:36,580
and the wiring before the dry
waller had covered it all up.

365
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:39,410
And thankfully this, you know, was caught

366
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:42,170
before it became a huge financial problem,

367
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:45,219
but it was during this
time I became acutely aware

368
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:48,110
of the value of my general contractor.

369
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:51,880
While he's great at
fabricating things himself,

370
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,780
I've seen him build full walls
and do plumbing, et cetera.

371
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:58,040
He also understands the
scope of the project

372
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,260
and he has a keen eye
for all of the different

373
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:03,569
cross-discipline requirements
and why they're important

374
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:05,960
and what feeds into what area.

375
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,609
And so, that was almost a
costly mistake and it made me

376
00:17:08,609 --> 00:17:11,209
think a lot about the value
of a general contractor.

377
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:16,109
And so I started thinking,
what is the general definition

378
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:18,060
of a general contractor?

379
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:22,899
And it is exactly what my
contracting company doing,

380
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:27,020
they're really responsible for
the end-to-end material labor

381
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:29,780
for the construction
project, and they might bring

382
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,200
specialized, talented
and specialized people

383
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,200
to do things like HVAC, et cetera.

384
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,320
But, you know, for the most part,

385
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,189
they run everything themselves.

386
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:41,210
And when I started thinking
about product security,

387
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:43,170
I realized that product
security is actually

388
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:47,620
just the general
contractor of, of InfoSec.

389
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:50,350
And so, product security
team is responsible

390
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:53,260
for all of the labor and
materials and equipment

391
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:56,790
and engineering tools
for securing a product.

392
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:59,159
They might work with
specialized subcontractors

393
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:03,360
or SMEs to perform parts
of the security program,

394
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,740
but ultimately, there are a lot like

395
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:09,123
a general contractor of InfoSec.

396
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,730
So if we go back to our
house construction this time

397
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:14,040
instead of a house, let's think about it

398
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:17,060
as our company's product
that we're building.

399
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,669
There's still an architect
'cause we all overuse that word.

400
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:23,720
But there's still an architect,
there's developer compliance

401
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,780
as well, we've designers
and business owners

402
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:30,460
as well as DevOps organizations.

403
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,850
Here's our lovely product
security professional.

404
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:35,459
And they are the interface
between a lot of the other

405
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:38,120
subsystems that help
keep the product safe.

406
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:41,520
Such as the SDLC, Secure
Development Life Cycle,

407
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,500
logging and monitoring,
things like firewalls alerts,

408
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,020
And then they work with
a lot of the other areas

409
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:51,150
within the organization, such
as a security engineering,

410
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:54,480
the AppSec team and the stock
and incident response team.

411
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,900
So as you can see, they
really are sitting right

412
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,720
in the middle where there
are general contractor

413
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,694
capable of doing a lot of the InfoSec

414
00:19:02,694 --> 00:19:07,310
for a specific product, but they also work

415
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,950
really, really closely with the SMEs

416
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:11,080
in their InfoSec division.

417
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,840
So we'll go quickly through
kind of the key areas

418
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:17,649
of what makeup product
security professionals

419
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:19,879
re-mention kind of day to day.

420
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,190
So they are obviously,
they work really closely

421
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:23,130
in relationships.

422
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:26,520
So business relationships
with the product business,

423
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,889
engineering teams with the engineering

424
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:32,300
that is actually doing all
of the product development,

425
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,540
as well as the InfoSec
team, their own InfoSec team

426
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,870
they have to build really
quality relationships there.

427
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:40,803
And they store as part of
that, they share procedures,

428
00:19:40,803 --> 00:19:44,520
they help draft standards as well.

429
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,920
And then their job is to
onboard to security tools

430
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,870
and programming, so you
think about things like

431
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:53,110
cloud tools and intrusion detection tools

432
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:56,120
and anomaly detection tools,
their job is to onboard

433
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,560
the products that they
work with into the rest

434
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,190
of the information security program.

435
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:06,210
They also are capable and
responsible for ensuring

436
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:09,480
security assessments
happen on that product.

437
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:13,980
And they are also from a
dashboards and metrics.

438
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,960
There's no one in the organization

439
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,660
that should know the security
layout of that product

440
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,910
more than not product
security professionals.

441
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:25,000
So, they're a great
person to actually come up

442
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,550
with good dashboards and
metrics for measuring

443
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:30,040
the security of that product end-to-end.

444
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,490
And then additionally, they are supposed

445
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:35,600
to manage expectations, be
the main point of contact

446
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,314
for security for that product,
so when they have a question

447
00:20:39,315 --> 00:20:42,830
and they need to get some consultation

448
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:46,610
and, you know, in an
assessment, they manage that

449
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:48,719
with the product themselves.

450
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,970
They assist in any of the
automation that might be needed

451
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:52,440
for things like continuous integration

452
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,160
and continuous deployment.

453
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:57,720
And last, but definitely not
least, they prepare the product

454
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:01,840
for logging and SIM
integration, and they help work

455
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,840
with threat modeling to
create a threat model

456
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,360
based alerting and run books.

457
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,429
So that's a lot of product
security professional.

458
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:12,220
Is a lot like a general
contractor, they have to be able

459
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,260
to do a lot of the
different sub-disciplines

460
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,800
and cross-discipline work

461
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,800
of an information Security professional.

462
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:21,379
So we just talked a lot
about how product security

463
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,860
individuals have a lot
of responsibilities,

464
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,659
but one of the big burning questions

465
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,990
might be how to structure
those products security

466
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:29,450
professionals within your organization,

467
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:32,610
and whether you create a
team or not within your org.

468
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:35,479
And unfortunately I have to say it depends

469
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:38,220
and I really hate to say
it depends, but it does.

470
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,550
It depends very heavily
on what kind of products

471
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:44,159
your organization and company
is and how big of a focus

472
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,980
you have on those products.

473
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:49,590
And so I think the best way
to go is to start by looking

474
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:51,639
through the unique capabilities
that you might need,

475
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:54,510
and using that mind map
that we created earlier

476
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:56,940
to think about where you
might have some gaps,

477
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,740
and where you might need to structure some

478
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,360
of your organization around those gaps.

479
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,610
So did you have a lot
of gaps or did you have

480
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:05,673
like one or two and you can
just, you know flush out

481
00:22:05,673 --> 00:22:08,050
one of your programs a little bit more

482
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:11,020
and just start applying it to a product.

483
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:13,700
And therefore you would
have a pretty good set

484
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,750
of products security coverage

485
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,450
from a capabilities point of view.

486
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,929
Additionally, from a structure
I've seen a lot of teams

487
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:23,150
since we were talking about this earlier,

488
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:25,660
so I've seen a lot of teams
and organizations build up

489
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,760
their applications security,
and just extend that

490
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,780
to be called the product
security organization.

491
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:32,980
I this is a valid approach,
but the important point

492
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,420
I'd wanna make is that we wanna make sure

493
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,520
that the application
security as it extends

494
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:39,290
to be a product security
is truly not a rename,

495
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:43,270
but really is taking into
everything beyond your SDLC,

496
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,810
everything beyond the application

497
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:47,770
and really thinking about
it from a holistic product

498
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:50,120
and brand point of view, to
make sure you're not missing

499
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:53,360
other manual areas, other
places that present risk

500
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,709
that have nothing to
do with an application

501
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:58,200
or the application development life cycle.

502
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,050
Also, you should consider
whether you want to avoid

503
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:05,950
spreading your apps team to
thin when you expand their scope

504
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:08,190
to include these other areas.

505
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:11,670
So instead I would encourage
you to consider leaving

506
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:14,870
your AppSec team as a
specialized skill area,

507
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:18,790
and instead of build out a
sub set of product security

508
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:21,350
specialists as a team and then assign

509
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:23,929
those products security
specialists to specific areas,

510
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:25,190
maybe based on product type.

511
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:26,230
So if you have a lot of embedded,

512
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:28,700
maybe have a couple of
products security professionals

513
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,690
around those embedded products,
and if you have e-commerce

514
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:34,240
maybe a couple around
that, or you could do it

515
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,360
based on brand or you
could do based on locale.

516
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:39,550
And you know, it really
depends on how your company

517
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:41,490
is organized and how your
products are organized

518
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:43,040
and your business is organized.

519
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,360
So at this point, we have
talked about product security

520
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,820
and what it is, we've
discussed kind of what

521
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:52,220
you can think of a product might be.

522
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:53,810
And we thought about
what kind of capabilities

523
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:58,159
it might take to secure a
product and looked at all

524
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,480
the potential gaps that you might have

525
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,070
in your existing information
security organization.

526
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:03,980
And finally, we talked about
what a product security

527
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:06,080
professional is and how they might fit

528
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,510
into your overall
information security program.

529
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:11,900
And since product security,
as I've said before,

530
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:14,280
it depends greatly on what
kind of products you're making,

531
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:17,910
there truly is
no-one-size-fits-all structure,

532
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:20,170
but I hope that I've
given you some approach

533
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:22,970
for thinking about product
security and how it might fit

534
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:25,360
into your organization and
kind of how you would go

535
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,419
about determining that
and working out whether

536
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:31,130
than how you might add product
security as a focus area

537
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:33,543
within your information
security organization.

538
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,379
And so now I'm gonna hand it off to Wiktor

539
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:38,010
so he can walk you through a case study

540
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:42,460
of hiring product security
professionals within Europe.

541
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:45,010
And with that, Wiktor,
can you take it away?

542
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:48,010
- Hello, everyone, I would
like to briefly share with you

543
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:51,230
my experience from hiring for
a product security position

544
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:54,230
in central Europe, which
hopefully will make

545
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:56,430
this process easier for you in the future.

546
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:58,410
Well, naturally, each company is different

547
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:01,420
and your mileage may vary
depending, for example,

548
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:04,023
on your location and organization type.

549
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:09,070
So, my story dates to September,
2020, when I was informed

550
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:11,530
by my co speaker, Jen, that the head count

551
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:14,810
for the product security team
will increase, great news.

552
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:16,360
Well, life couldn't be better.

553
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:19,080
And we were looking for
a candidate in Poland

554
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,990
for the role of product security engineer.

555
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:25,410
And to be honest, I felt that the hiring

556
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:28,100
of a skilled individual for
that particular position

557
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,149
will be a piece of cake, why?

558
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:32,640
Well, mostly because there's
a lot of technically skilled

559
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,040
and motivated people in
Polish InfoSec Community.

560
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,290
And the role is interesting,
and in my opinion

561
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:40,730
it allows a candidate
not only to demonstrate,

562
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:45,343
but also to develop new skills
in many areas of InfoSec.

563
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,140
And our job offer was
similar to those published

564
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:54,650
by the industry leaders,
Amazon AWS, Tesla or Facebook.

565
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:57,410
It basically required
the knowledge in the area

566
00:25:57,410 --> 00:26:00,390
of application security,
penetration testing,

567
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:04,370
IT architecture, where
DevOps and container security

568
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:06,199
knowledge were nice to have.

569
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:11,380
The offer looked really
solid, and after publishing,

570
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:14,420
there was nothing more to do than to wait.

571
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:17,340
And time went by one week after another.

572
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:20,490
And until this moment,
everything was straight forward,

573
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:25,070
but things started to go South from here.

574
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:27,120
And it wasn't even the
fact that the applications

575
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,639
that were sent to us did
not match the job position.

576
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,020
There were no CVS or resumes at all,

577
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:36,940
and it looked like we were
heading for a bumpy ride,

578
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:39,650
and obviously we needed
some troubleshooting

579
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:41,073
to discover the problem.

580
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:45,260
And naturally when you
troubleshoot you check

581
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:48,143
the most obvious things
first and step by step,

582
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,419
you get to the bottom of the problem.

583
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:53,810
Well, I started by checking if the pages

584
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:56,700
through which people send their CVS work.

585
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:00,950
And I had asked HR for help
and they said that everything

586
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:03,420
works fine from their perspective,

587
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:06,000
and for this particular
recruitment process,

588
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,720
and they use the same
applications and services

589
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,843
as for other ID and
security related positions.

590
00:27:13,241 --> 00:27:16,300
And they did not notice
any problems with the flow.

591
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:20,330
So, I'm an InfoSec person
I trust, but verify.

592
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:23,230
And I like to believe that I did what most

593
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:25,390
of the InfoSec community would have done

594
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:26,223
in being on my place.

595
00:27:26,223 --> 00:27:28,860
So, I created a fake online profile,

596
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:31,340
I generated a fake follow
using one of the available

597
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:33,139
websites designed for that.

598
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:35,040
I made up a pretty nice resume,

599
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:38,780
which included a technical
university abroad,

600
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:41,639
four years of application
security experience,

601
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:46,640
some industry certificates and I sent it

602
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:51,160
and you wouldn't have guessed
what happened, it worked.

603
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,900
The HR department was
indeed in there was right

604
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:57,600
and the tools they used for
the recruitment were working.

605
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,090
So this wasn't the issue,
it was something different.

606
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:03,709
Now, the only thing I needed
to do was to explain HR

607
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:06,220
why he didn't want to
invite the only candidate

608
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,880
that applied for this position.

609
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,600
but luckily they were quite understanding.

610
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,820
So, since the last
approach wasn't that then,

611
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:14,360
I needed to try something different.

612
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:18,199
And I decided to ask my
friends without looking

613
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,950
at the description of the position,

614
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:23,840
what do they think of
when they hear the name

615
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,433
product security or
product security engineer?

616
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:30,490
Just for you to know, each
of them had five plus years

617
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:33,470
of experience in the field
of information security,

618
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:37,660
and to be honest, their
answers surprised me.

619
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:41,560
One of them said that
product security is probably

620
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:46,560
a recruitment to an antivirus company.

621
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:50,680
And others said that if the
product we sell is security,

622
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:54,570
then this must be outsourcing.

623
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:58,010
I've also heard that this must
be a tech support job focused

624
00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:01,879
on security issues, like
helping to do backups

625
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:05,707
or configurating at two 2FA.

626
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:11,160
And one of my friends even
said that, this is a buzzword

627
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:14,540
he never heard about
and he doesn't know it.

628
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:19,373
So, ouch, this is what was
even worse than I thought.

629
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:23,899
And at least we started
to realize that the issue

630
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:28,580
we are dealing with is the
problem with recognizing

631
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:29,822
the name and the brand.

632
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:34,450
So we started to approach
potential candidates

633
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:38,270
not only to ask them if they
were interested in our offer,

634
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:41,120
but also to talk with
them about the thoughts

635
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,889
they have about the position,

636
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:46,390
and their responses were
also really interesting.

637
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:48,490
So some people said that the job position

638
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:52,270
is really interesting but
not for the particular point

639
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:54,460
in their career they are right now.

640
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:57,420
So they might be interested
in this position in the future

641
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,610
when they get more experienced.

642
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:02,209
A penetration tester, we tried to hire

643
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:06,260
said that we are looking for
an IT security Kung Fu master,

644
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:08,920
a developer interested
in moving to Infosecurity

645
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,400
told us that we were probably searching

646
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,850
for a cybersecurity wizard,
and a consultant thought

647
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:17,510
that we were looking
for an InfoSec commando.

648
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:21,330
And this is interesting
because this was a compliment

649
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:23,580
from his side, he thought it was great.

650
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:27,120
So, generally they all
thought that we were looking

651
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,533
for a unicorn.

652
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:33,730
Okay, so we knew what
we were dealing with.

653
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:37,220
We went back to our HR
with all those opinions,

654
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:40,060
information and knowledge
that we gathered.

655
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:42,850
We sit down and modified
our job description.

656
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:45,980
We also focus more on
explaining to our candidates

657
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:50,980
what was the role about and
what opportunities it brings.

658
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:54,179
And finally, after some twists and turns,

659
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:56,670
we found our candidates.

660
00:30:56,670 --> 00:31:00,240
And you might ask who fits this role?

661
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,910
Well, from our experience
and in a community

662
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:06,130
which is not very
acquainted with the concept

663
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:08,470
of product security, the best candidates

664
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:11,650
come from consulting
firms, where they were used

665
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:15,970
to do various projects
and have broad experience

666
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:18,180
in various InfoSec domains.

667
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:20,510
And also people from small companies

668
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:23,150
where there's not a lot
of InfoSec personnel,

669
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:27,420
and you need to get
familiar with security stuff

670
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:30,073
and handing security things as you go.

671
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:35,400
So, what I've learned from
that experience and what I wish

672
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,550
I knew when I was starting
the recruitment process

673
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:42,550
is that product security,
although it being on the market,

674
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:48,110
let's say from 2013, is still
in its infancy level or stage,

675
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,909
at least in Poland.

676
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:55,320
And it will take some time for
people to associate the name,

677
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,810
product security, with
what it really means.

678
00:31:57,810 --> 00:31:59,879
And since the concept of product security

679
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:03,540
is not well recognized at least
outside the United States,

680
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:07,180
the recruitment process
can be a real wild West.

681
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:09,070
Good candidates that match the profile,

682
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:12,669
don't have their Job
searches, alarms triggered

683
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:16,050
to product security and
hand of candidates apply

684
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:20,490
for the position but they don't
fully grasp what it's about.

685
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:23,870
And because of that, you will
probably devote more time

686
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:25,540
and energy than expected.

687
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:28,770
Basically more time and
energy if you would compare

688
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:31,430
this recruitment process to
a process where you recruit

689
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:35,140
an application security specialist
or a penetration tester.

690
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:39,240
And to be honest, I don't
see this situation to change

691
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,050
without more awareness being spread

692
00:32:41,050 --> 00:32:43,970
about what product security is during

693
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:45,870
a local meetups and conferences.

694
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:49,570
And I think that knowing
all of that would allow me

695
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:53,419
to approach the situation
differently in the past

696
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:55,550
and make better decisions,

697
00:32:55,550 --> 00:33:00,113
and I would find the
ideal candidates faster.

698
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:05,710
So, to sum up, both Jen and
I have been talking about

699
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:07,420
during this presentation.

700
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:10,320
If you would like to
apply product security

701
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,710
to your program, right now
you should compile a list

702
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:16,200
of the most important
product types you have

703
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,460
and numerate the scope
and create a mind map,

704
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:21,563
with gaps is that you found.

705
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:24,250
Try looking for suitable candidates

706
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:27,703
within the existing team, there might be

707
00:33:27,703 --> 00:33:29,770
some InfoSec talents that will make

708
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:32,010
great product security professionals.

709
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,600
Within the next three
months, try to develop

710
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:38,382
one full-time employee to
product security area only.

711
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:43,590
Make him address highest
risks and your company.

712
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:47,090
After six months, think
about this experiment

713
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:49,889
and decide whether this
was a good approach

714
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:53,200
and you should divide more
resources to product security

715
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:57,410
or maybe product security
is not well suited

716
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,160
for your company.

717
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,640
On the other hand, if you are hiring

718
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,510
for a product security
position outside the US

719
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:07,590
in the nearest future, you
should write a job description

720
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:10,299
that attracts people that in your opinion

721
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,389
will fit this role.

722
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:15,560
In our case, those were consultants
and InfoSec team members

723
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,060
from smaller organizations.

724
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:20,330
And what I mean by that,
is that you should put

725
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:21,949
in your job descriptions keywords

726
00:34:21,949 --> 00:34:24,009
that will attract those people.

727
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:27,224
Something like fast-paced
company, learning opportunities

728
00:34:27,224 --> 00:34:32,224
which bring cooperation with
developers, business owners

729
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:35,120
and other InfoSec teams.

730
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,690
There is a possibility
to do cross disciplines

731
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:39,650
between Infosecurity.

732
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:42,480
And then instruct headhunters
and HR managers to look

733
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,070
for the people who are
interested in those offers.

734
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:49,449
Within the next three months,
if you don't get any hits,

735
00:34:49,449 --> 00:34:51,370
try updating your job description based

736
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:54,603
on the candidate's feedback,
and do some troubleshooting.

737
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:57,930
Let's hope that after six months

738
00:34:57,930 --> 00:35:02,359
you'll enjoy your new employee,
and if you have some time,

739
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:05,470
please spare it, and share
your recruitment experience

740
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:08,323
during an online meetup or a conference.

741
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,470
Thank you very much.

742
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:14,580
If you have any questions please
join us on the Q&A session,

743
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:16,317
following this presentation.
