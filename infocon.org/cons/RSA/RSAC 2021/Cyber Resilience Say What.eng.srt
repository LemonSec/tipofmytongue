1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:03,550
- Hello, my name is Kristy Westphal

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:06,029
and I'm so glad that you're here today

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,680
to talk with me about cyber resilience

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,900
and what that means and how
to build a program around it.

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,980
So let's go ahead and get started.

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:14,930
Here we go. All right.

7
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:17,350
So what are we gonna talk
about in this session?

8
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,990
First. We're gonna take a quiz.

9
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:20,139
What? I know.

10
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:22,050
Yes, I'm making you take a test.

11
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,090
Don't worry, it's not graded.

12
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:25,450
Then we're gonna take a pause

13
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:28,509
and we're gonna define
what cyber resilience means

14
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:30,140
but we're gonna do this together.

15
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:33,170
So there is a Q&A live function going

16
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:34,720
while you're listening to this.

17
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:38,820
So please chime in at any
point that you have feedback on

18
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,900
on what I'm talking about.

19
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,160
But the quiz is also gonna help

20
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,839
put the whole problem of cyber resilience

21
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,513
in the context for all of us.

22
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:50,132
Then we'll define
together, we'll take that.

23
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:52,300
Don't do this.

24
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:56,260
These are areas where I
could have done better.

25
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:57,580
And I've had past mistakes

26
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:00,410
that I would like to help you learn from.

27
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:03,129
So then I have the do this

28
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:04,550
or at least consider doing this,

29
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:06,289
my recommendations for you.

30
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:09,140
And at the very end, I'll
show you how to tackle this

31
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,910
within your own organization right away

32
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:14,550
and then a little bit longer term as well.

33
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:17,179
So before I go on and we take our quiz,

34
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:20,600
I wanna talk a little bit
about why I chose this topic.

35
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,199
I had the pleasure of
being volunteered to do

36
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,520
and own a cyber resilience program.

37
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,759
It was a painful experience
and I learned a lot from it.

38
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:33,340
So I wanted to try and accomplish
two things with this talk.

39
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,610
Number one, I wanna start a conversation

40
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:39,580
about what a cyber resilience
program really means

41
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:40,810
and should be,

42
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:44,060
and also to help others
who also get volunteered

43
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,253
into this situation.

44
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:49,660
So with that, let me do a little
bit more introduction here.

45
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,093
So why am I here?

46
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:54,780
I've been in information
security for a very long time,

47
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,030
and now I've really focused
on leaderships areas.

48
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:01,190
But I've done a little bit
of everything over my career.

49
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:03,240
Security's painful all around.

50
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,000
So I like to make sure
that anything that I do,

51
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,220
where I can share my pain

52
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:12,150
and better my experiences, I will.

53
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,603
So that's one of these examples today.

54
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:17,380
So let's share the knowledge

55
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,050
and make it less painful all around.

56
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:22,470
Oh, and I also put in random cat pictures,

57
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:25,090
mostly for my amusement,
but also to make sure

58
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:26,793
that you are paying attention.

59
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:30,230
All right, oh, and I'm random
baby outer pictures too.

60
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:31,662
So you'll see those as well.

61
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,190
Okay. So let's take a quiz.

62
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:36,920
Again, this won't be graded.

63
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:40,500
But in order to put this
cyber resilience concept

64
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,870
into context,

65
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,990
we'll run through some
very public examples

66
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:47,470
of situations that may or may not prove

67
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:49,120
to be cyber resilient.

68
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,190
You decide.

69
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:53,373
So definitely leverage
the Q&A in this situation.

70
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:56,360
And you get extra bonus points

71
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,900
if you get the reference of my title there

72
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:02,730
to very old kid show for
those of you who may not know.

73
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:05,220
Anyway, we are talking about Zoom,

74
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,690
and maybe you didn't know, other than...

75
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:09,880
In my opinion, Zoom was kind of the hero

76
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,470
of the whole pandemic

77
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:13,450
was that they also had at one point

78
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:15,423
half a million passwords stolen.

79
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:19,560
And then they were subsequently
offered up for sale.

80
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,050
But what was even more interesting

81
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:22,870
was how they got those passwords.

82
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,880
So let me tell you a little bit about

83
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,363
how this actually happened.

84
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:32,310
The attackers that ended
up with the credentials

85
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:34,580
actually employed a
credential stuffing attack

86
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:38,290
that use multiple bots to
avoid the same IP address

87
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:40,929
being used for multiple Zoom accounts.

88
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:43,010
And that was to prevent
from being attacked

89
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:45,090
or detected as a denial of service attack.

90
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:48,110
'Cause typically those of us
who have been fortunate enough

91
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:50,820
to experience a credential stuffing attack

92
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:54,870
know it's loud and it's like
a denial of service attack.

93
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,700
So it's very easy to recognize.

94
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,149
So this is a very low and
slow way of doing that.

95
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,700
They ended up employing a firm

96
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,149
that helped them shut
down thousands of websites

97
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,960
that were attempting to trick users

98
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,530
into downloading that malware

99
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:10,340
or giving up their credentials.

100
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:13,610
And they also were continuing
as this was going on

101
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:16,320
to investigate, lock accounts,

102
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,293
and have users change their passwords.

103
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,039
And then they were also,

104
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,840
again, looking at some more technology

105
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:27,030
to help control future attacks.

106
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:28,169
So the question here is,

107
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:30,000
do you think that that's really

108
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,263
a cyber resilient organization?

109
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:37,650
They did cover quickly, so
that may give us some clues

110
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:40,229
into whether they're
cyber resilient or not,

111
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:43,370
but please chime in here.

112
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:45,661
So how about this one?

113
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:46,494
Have you ever heard of Finastra?

114
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:48,370
I hadn't until I read this article,

115
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:51,490
but they were hit by ransomware last year.

116
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:54,560
This actually resulted
in disrupted operations.

117
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,010
They actually had to disconnect
servers from the internet.

118
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:00,440
And then as the story kinda came out,

119
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,770
there were mixed messages
on the true impact

120
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:04,490
of what happened there.

121
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:06,963
But there were rumors going around

122
00:05:06,963 --> 00:05:09,180
that they had to close offices,

123
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,770
and there were impacting
North American customers

124
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,370
while they cleaned up the situation.

125
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:16,330
But the key interesting thing here

126
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:19,140
is the attack went
unnoticed for three days.

127
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,320
This happened early in the pandemic.

128
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,580
So there was a lot of trying to get people

129
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:26,810
that work from home and
a lot of things going on.

130
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:29,740
So perfectly reasonable,

131
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:32,260
unfortunately, that it happened like that

132
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:36,803
but it was a little bit tricky
when they had to handle it.

133
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,300
So in this situation,

134
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,863
would you say they were
cyber resilient or not?

135
00:05:42,882 --> 00:05:47,093
They had to close down
things while they cleaned up

136
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:50,640
and it was unnoticed for three days.

137
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,332
So hold that thought and
we'll go through one more.

138
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:58,260
One more example here,
one more test question.

139
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:01,070
And this one, I think it
kinda introduces itself,

140
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,840
and yes I know we're
probably talking a lot

141
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,080
about Solarwinds this year,

142
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,849
but I love this diagram

143
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:08,820
because it just kind of says it all.

144
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,280
This was a super
complicated attack, right?

145
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,460
There were a lot of things going here.

146
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:16,190
And by the way, this is from...

147
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:18,900
You can see the link there
from a FireEye blog entry

148
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,969
that detailed what really happened.

149
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:23,723
So from that perspective,
it's really fascinating.

150
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:27,063
But describing the true impact here,

151
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:31,750
it could take years for us to
really truly understand that.

152
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:35,750
So it's kind of interesting
that we have this example

153
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,760
to look at here today.

154
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,840
I have the link there.

155
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,570
If you want the full slides,

156
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:43,950
my email is at the very end of the deck.

157
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,750
So please feel free to reach out to me

158
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,140
and I'm happy to send you those slides

159
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:50,800
with all my notes and all the links.

160
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,800
So we all know what
happened the Solarwinds,

161
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,220
I'm not gonna go into details,

162
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:57,200
but would you say that
that is a cyber resilience

163
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,050
situation or not?

164
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:01,073
You decide.

165
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:05,130
All right. So let's
take just a brief moment

166
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:08,883
and try to define what cyber
resilience is together.

167
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,690
So is it testing controls?

168
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:15,870
Is it disaster recovery of those controls?

169
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:18,610
I found this definition,
and I really like it

170
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:22,210
because it's so simple and
it's so understandable.

171
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:24,010
When I was handed the program,

172
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:26,740
the definition was already given for me.

173
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:29,080
So it was a little bit
difficult to dig out

174
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,070
from underneath that

175
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,969
and it had to do with a
little bit of those concepts

176
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:34,090
I talk about in those first two bullets

177
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:37,010
but this definition really
drives it home for me.

178
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:40,039
Cyber resilience refers
to the system's ability

179
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:43,170
to recover or regenerate its performance

180
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:46,400
after a cyber attack
produces a degradation

181
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,799
of its performance.

182
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,120
Boom, right? Very simple.

183
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,810
And where I got this particular quote

184
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:56,220
was from a chapter on resilience.

185
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:59,890
And they mentioned too, that
resilience is often confused

186
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:04,300
with other concepts that
are related but different,

187
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,870
like risk, robustness, and security.

188
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,420
And that's what I kept running into.

189
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:13,420
So I thought this was very,
very appropriate for this slide.

190
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:16,460
Resilience is really a different concept.

191
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,880
It defines the capacity to recover...

192
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:22,250
It's defined as the
capacity to recover quickly

193
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,820
from difficulties, period, right?

194
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:27,780
And so that can mean a
lot of important things

195
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:31,323
and nuances as you kind of go
down this path a little bit.

196
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:36,383
I really love this diagram
because it's simply shows

197
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:42,799
what a resiliency in general means, right?

198
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,810
It's about sustaining an impactful event

199
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:49,650
or the end of the right of
boom, as we like to say.

200
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:51,540
But it's also about the left of boom,

201
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:54,640
it's preparation, things
you can do ahead of time

202
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,530
to be ready for that.

203
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:58,270
And a lot of it is really truly

204
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:00,520
like our friend's SpongeBob here.

205
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,840
It's absorbing that attack

206
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,600
and being able to recover
from that quickly.

207
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,250
So I think some of
these references really,

208
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,853
again, put it into context
pretty, pretty clearly.

209
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:18,060
I wish I had some of
these wonderful references

210
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,589
that I found for this particular talk

211
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:22,110
when I was doing the program,

212
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:24,530
because it really would
have helped me at the time.

213
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:27,170
So I was excited to find these.

214
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:29,680
This one in particular, when
you start to think about it,

215
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,560
resiliency truly just
adds other dimensions

216
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,849
to your typical security control set.

217
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:40,170
Notice here, specifically the
emphasis on the left of boom,

218
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:41,510
the cyber resiliency,

219
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:45,210
but also this notion of
continuity of operations.

220
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,790
This shouldn't be rocket science

221
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,920
which kind of was amazing to me,

222
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,099
but depending on your organization,

223
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,700
this may be new concepts for them.

224
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,160
Also, this should be a huge relief

225
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,120
to those who understand this
is not a siloed effort, right?

226
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,890
And it helps with the ownership argument

227
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:05,143
that we're gonna talk
about in a later slide.

228
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:08,940
So we have a little bit of that

229
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,540
and then we have a lot of this.

230
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,780
Now we can sprinkle in a framework.

231
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,260
Now we start getting some
more detailed formality

232
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,360
to begin your planning journey.

233
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,930
Once you get that definition
of resiliency down,

234
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:22,589
you start moving towards that conversation

235
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:25,847
of, "Okay, do we have what we consider

236
00:10:25,847 --> 00:10:28,310
"to be a part of this program
already somewhere else?"

237
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:31,140
Because no doubt you have pieces of this

238
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,290
but it may not be organized

239
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:36,510
into a cyber resiliency program yet.

240
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,010
You start setting your objectives

241
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:39,580
that fall under the categories

242
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:43,340
that are in the figure here
in the middle in the purple.

243
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:47,190
And then you start matching
those up with the techniques.

244
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:49,910
What do you already have
in your organization?

245
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:53,579
And then you start figuring
out what should we be using.

246
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,640
And once that exercise is complete,

247
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,150
you'll have a beginning
roadmap that you'll flesh out

248
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:01,380
with more pieces that we'll
talk about in the next slides.

249
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:05,260
Consider this piece for
your gap assessment.

250
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:08,900
So one note here, you should
not be doing this in a vacuum.

251
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,863
I'm gonna say that several
times to really drive that home.

252
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:16,220
This should be some sort of
governance structure in place

253
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,900
where the collaboration happens

254
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,670
between your security organization

255
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:23,910
externally as well,
though, roping in folks

256
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:27,110
like technology development, leadership,

257
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:29,290
continuity, and risk.

258
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:32,150
I prefer to sketch out
my recommendations first

259
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,360
and then try to socialize them,

260
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,230
especially when I'm
working on something new

261
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:39,600
to the organization, because
then you have as a solid

262
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,530
kind of grounding of what
your message should be,

263
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:44,730
and we'll talk about that too,

264
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:46,940
but you wanna make sure
you have that all in place

265
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:50,070
before you start tryna
get others on board.

266
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:51,500
And then before I leave this slide,

267
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,330
I wanna give an example of
what you already have in place

268
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:57,440
that you might wanna consider
for this overall program.

269
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,180
Do you already do tabletop
testing for cyber topics?

270
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,930
I bet you do.

271
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,829
That'll definitely fit in here.

272
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:07,290
What about disaster recovery testing?

273
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:08,900
Probably so, right?

274
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,560
I would hope at some level you've got that

275
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,849
whatever size organization you are.

276
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:15,560
The trick will be in
weaving all these together

277
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,689
but hold that thought and we'll get there

278
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:21,308
and I'll show you how to do that.

279
00:12:21,308 --> 00:12:22,450
All right.

280
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:26,143
This model is gold, which
is why it chokes me up.

281
00:12:27,116 --> 00:12:29,060
And I'm a little
sarcastic, as you can tell.

282
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:32,310
If you can take these
techniques that you decided upon

283
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:33,719
during your gap assessment

284
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,400
and leverage this to map
them to the cyber kill chain,

285
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:41,040
then you're starting to
get to kind of that weaving

286
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,770
that I was talking about.

287
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:45,180
Then you start plugging
in your security controls,

288
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,390
like your intrusion detection system,

289
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:50,920
your Endpoint Detection
and Response or EDR tool,

290
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,969
anti-virus or your SIM.

291
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:54,880
And then you're gonna start quickly seeing

292
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,020
where your holes are, right?

293
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:59,380
You're gonna see where do
my controls cover things

294
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:02,250
from not only the kill chain perspective,

295
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,910
but also from the resiliency perspective.

296
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:09,069
Then the discussion goes to,
do we wanna fill those holes?

297
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:10,830
Do we accept that risk?

298
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:13,260
How do we fill them if you want to?

299
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,890
And so on, right?

300
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:16,840
This is all about building up the details,

301
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,773
you'll need to justify your entire effort.

302
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:22,950
And also while you're doing this,

303
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:25,030
don't forget leverage that gap assessment

304
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,860
because that's gonna help guide you

305
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,593
as you start doing this mapping.

306
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,790
All right. So let's take another pause

307
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:35,680
and talk about sustainability.

308
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,030
This concept was kinda
the bane of my existence

309
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,589
while I was trying to build a program

310
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:43,983
that didn't have organizational support.

311
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,449
But it's really important.

312
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,740
I wanna talk about it here

313
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:51,140
because what does that really mean?

314
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:55,430
Really, it is kind of be
more organic in your planning

315
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:58,930
because you're gonna need
to build into a component

316
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:02,319
in your program that lives
year after year, right?

317
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,270
You're not gonna just be one and done.

318
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:08,600
It means planning, it means
organizational support.

319
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,470
It means working on a maturity level goal,

320
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:15,090
but ultimately it's evidence
that this program will continue

321
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:17,420
and will help both the
left and right of boom

322
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:20,380
even as the organization shifts and grows.

323
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:22,070
So let's take an example.

324
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,090
Do you want maybe a two year planning

325
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:26,840
of all the pieces that you end up with,

326
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:30,520
like exercises, reviews,
functional exercises,

327
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:33,880
along with a personnel who are
gonna support these efforts.

328
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:37,740
And I say two years,
because I find in our space

329
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:41,840
it's very difficult to
plan further out than that.

330
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:45,840
So I think two years is a nice medium

331
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,400
that you can start showing repeatability.

332
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:52,090
This reflects thought and
evidence once you have that,

333
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:54,200
that the organization
will continue the program

334
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,660
on an ongoing basis,
which is a good thing.

335
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,310
And we'll show why here in a few.

336
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:03,550
All right. So don't do these things.

337
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:05,103
I highly recommend you don't.

338
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,370
Don't piecemeal the program.

339
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:10,460
When I say piecemeal,

340
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,180
I mean that you shouldn't cobble together

341
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:15,319
a bunch of unrelated things
with no gap assessment

342
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,280
and call that your program.

343
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,540
You need a gap assessment
because otherwise

344
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:21,719
you may be just, again, checking the box

345
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:26,410
and not truly performing or
putting together a program

346
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:28,350
that will help the organization,

347
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:30,833
which really should be
the entire goal for this.

348
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:35,130
And depending on how
you scope it ultimately,

349
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:38,130
but the key is to have it
support it specific program

350
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:42,210
that is not the partial
responsibility of just one person,

351
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:46,300
unless the scope is that
small, where it is sustainable.

352
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,410
And it's just really gonna depend.

353
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:50,290
The key here is to take some of the steps

354
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:52,860
in the next section of this talk

355
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,950
and then properly define that program,

356
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:56,650
understand what gaps exist,

357
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:59,040
and then put together a remediation plan.

358
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,449
This can be a temporary
assignment for a person

359
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:02,950
or a team to define,

360
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:05,250
but operational resources
are going to be needed

361
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,340
to support it.

362
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:10,000
So for example, if you find
that you have all the pieces

363
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,230
already available in other
parts of your organization

364
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:15,550
and you just need to monitor what they do

365
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:19,140
and collect that evidence,
kind of like an audit,

366
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:22,439
this may be a quarter of a
resource on an annual basis.

367
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,470
However, if you realize
that you're missing

368
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:26,550
large chunk of the requirements,

369
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:29,040
then that may be one to
two dedicated resources

370
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,270
to execute the implementation
and maintain it directly.

371
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:35,223
So that's a little bit on resourcing.

372
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:39,260
Let's talk about length of implementation.

373
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,770
It's gonna also depend on
your scope of your effort

374
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:43,699
and the level of gaps you have.

375
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:46,190
This should be driven based on risk

376
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:49,130
and shouldn't be considered
that one and done effort

377
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:51,420
going back to that sustainability.

378
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:54,680
This should be built in, and
I recommend incrementally,

379
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,770
don't say you've got
to do the kitchen sink

380
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:59,189
all at once 'cause that never works.

381
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:01,470
You wanna do it incrementally
to existing efforts

382
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:03,070
and matured over time.

383
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:06,290
This will help alleviate
that chicken little approach

384
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:09,300
where you claim that you need an army,

385
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:12,542
when really you may just need
a part of a dedicated soldier.

386
00:17:13,849 --> 00:17:16,290
And one more thing on this tooling.

387
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:18,970
I'm not a big fan of making
it all about the tool

388
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:21,400
but I'm more focused on the information.

389
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,180
So if you're in a large organization

390
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,970
with a lot of moving parts,

391
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:28,060
something more sophisticated
than a spreadsheet

392
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,290
might be warranted.

393
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:31,879
But honestly, I don't think
there's a specific tool

394
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,720
for this work that you can...

395
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,950
You have to largely create it on your own

396
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:39,010
based on your requirements.

397
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:42,513
The key is to support your
investment whatever you do,

398
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:46,449
and make sure that you
can tell that story.

399
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:50,120
There are freely available
tools from sources like CISA

400
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,659
but you likely can leverage
your own disaster recovery

401
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,920
and business continuity tools.

402
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,170
They may just take some
additional tweaking

403
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:59,890
or maybe you can kind of
wedge the cyber requirements

404
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:01,580
in there for tracking.

405
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,810
The testing piece may not warrant a tool

406
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:05,610
or it could be leveraged
with something as simple

407
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:07,290
as a SharePoint site.

408
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:08,740
So those are just some ideas.

409
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,879
on the failure to obtain
leadership support side,

410
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,570
this is going to come
through your messaging

411
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:17,230
which is going to be the branding effort.

412
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:19,380
I'm gonna talk about here in a few slides.

413
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,890
So keep that in mind.

414
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:25,550
And then again, don't make
this a cyber only problem

415
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:29,123
and don't forget that
this should be risk-based.

416
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,583
So let's consider some
things to do instead.

417
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:38,010
And I love this as well,

418
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:40,340
because this really says it all

419
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:42,449
in regards to ownership, right?

420
00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:45,210
It's a combined effort, right?

421
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:48,140
Whenever the word cyber
is used in anything,

422
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:51,760
the security team gets pointed
at and say, "You own this."

423
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,160
So not so in this case,

424
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:56,240
because again this effort is really woven

425
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,860
into the overall organization

426
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,729
and not just owned by cyber,

427
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:02,670
even if cyber has a large stake in it.

428
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:04,190
Cyber may not have the business

429
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:07,260
or technology expertise to
flesh out the pieces needed

430
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:09,210
in the business continuity plan,

431
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:11,320
so a partnership is needed.

432
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,852
So then who's accountable?

433
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:16,870
My opinion is that the
business continuity team is,

434
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:19,830
because again, they kind
of own that larger effort

435
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:22,570
and that cyber is just one aspect of it.

436
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:23,970
Does that mean business continuity

437
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:26,143
owns the cyber resiliency program?

438
00:19:27,021 --> 00:19:28,853
Not necessarily, but they might.

439
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,540
Cyber is most certainly
responsible for their own controls

440
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,639
and testing those security controls.

441
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,130
But my view is that those pieces roll up

442
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:39,283
to the larger business continuity plans.

443
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:45,820
All right, so here's my favorite
slide, the brand, right?

444
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,850
So you've got this program scope,

445
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:51,060
you know who owns what,
now what do you do?

446
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,629
You come up with a slogan on a website.

447
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:55,950
Kidding, sort of.

448
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:57,820
You don't need to be fancy,

449
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:59,760
but you do need a consistent message

450
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,860
supported by facts and not fear.

451
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:05,320
When I say don't dilute the message,

452
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,669
that's what I'm referring to

453
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:10,700
when you're getting cutesy
with say cat pictures

454
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,830
that detracts from the real message.

455
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:15,580
You don't wanna get too
cutesy in this case.

456
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:18,840
So let's go over some messaging tips.

457
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,362
Tie this back to a regulatory
or some compliance efforts.

458
00:20:23,293 --> 00:20:25,199
And then you got a whole lot of support.

459
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,460
If you're in a highly
regulated organization,

460
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,690
you'll be tasked by regulators
for this information

461
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:31,970
sooner or later.

462
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:34,770
Auditors, whether they're
internal or third party,

463
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:36,910
will also start to ask about this

464
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:40,760
as the concept catches on more
and more, because trust me,

465
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:44,233
cyber resilience is
coming quite the thing.

466
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:48,550
A really helpful technique
that like to employ

467
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:51,040
are diagrams that tie back to frameworks.

468
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,889
So you can use NIST,
cybersecurity framework,

469
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:55,960
or simply mapping to your existing

470
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,070
internal controls framework.

471
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:00,129
That includes tools.

472
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:02,580
And when I say that again you plug that in

473
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,610
what tools do you have
to cover what pieces

474
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:07,820
of your framework and then start there.

475
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:12,149
I also recommend a
trick where you can take

476
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:14,430
applicable threats to your organization

477
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:16,890
and map those to your security controls.

478
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:19,520
And I use controls and security tools

479
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,460
kind of interchangeably here.

480
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,670
That helps you determine the cyber gaps,

481
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:25,330
and then you can start exploring

482
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:28,060
and testing these through the DR Plans

483
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:31,280
of the organization to
see how the cyber attacks

484
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,889
impact technology recovery.

485
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:36,730
Essentially, the DR Plan
should be all encompassing

486
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:40,603
and not operational or
cyber specific in nature.

487
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:44,060
So we'll talk about how to
get that resourcing number

488
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,000
in a moment,

489
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,650
but make sure that that is
part of your branding effort.

490
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:50,860
Whatever your estimate
is may not be perfect,

491
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,919
but make sure you are comfortable

492
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:57,160
supporting whatever degree
of army that you're after.

493
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:02,310
You may also try to get creative here.

494
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:05,530
One thought is, if this looks
something like very large

495
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:08,320
and complex and going to
take a lot of resources,

496
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,649
then perhaps suggests
repurposing existing resources

497
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:14,930
temporarily to get certain
chunks up and running,

498
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:16,840
and then put them back full time

499
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,360
once that piece is done.

500
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:21,280
So for example, if a key gap ends up being

501
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,399
that there's no control testing.

502
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,430
But you have staff that already do this

503
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:28,150
in other areas of your organization

504
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:29,500
borrow them for a while, right?

505
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,100
Or periodically and do the testing.

506
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,572
And I'll talk about one
example here as we go.

507
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,210
So let's talk about resourcing.

508
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:41,030
This all ties back to the
scope of your program, right?

509
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:43,740
You definitely wanna
leverage that gap assessment

510
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:46,240
to show the scope.

511
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,400
If you find that you need
only a few things done

512
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,350
to shore it up,

513
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:52,129
this may be a part-time person over time.

514
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:55,450
If you find major holes, you
may need a project manager

515
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:57,630
or other volunteer to organize

516
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:59,433
and drive that implementation.

517
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:02,700
You may need dedicated engineers

518
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,320
to implement those controls,

519
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,720
and you may need a penetration
type person to test them.

520
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,810
And you may need that disaster recovery

521
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:11,560
and business continuity resource

522
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,320
to help do a broader
test of system recovery

523
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,980
and deploy the business continuity plan.

524
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:19,140
One resource thing to keep in mind.

525
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:22,040
You will need business
folks not involved directly

526
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:27,040
in the program to participate
periodically at some level.

527
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:29,380
This just means that
when you do tabletops,

528
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:31,480
you will have to have business operations,

529
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:34,440
leadership, human resources, legal,

530
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,960
and other non-technology folks

531
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,260
to really talk through how to respond.

532
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:42,879
Because again, this is definitely
a collaboration effort,

533
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,570
and you definitely wanna
also include these ideas

534
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:48,960
in your branding effort,
as I mentioned before,

535
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,773
so that you can get support for it.

536
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:57,490
All right. So now you got all this stuff.

537
00:23:57,490 --> 00:23:59,600
What exactly are you implementing?

538
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,320
Your implementation/remediation plan

539
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,693
might include some or
all of the following.

540
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:08,460
You definitely wanna have some
sort of selling of the plan,

541
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:11,960
some sort of communication
plan across your organization

542
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,440
should you include getting...

543
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,210
And which should include
getting management buy-in.

544
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:18,740
That's definitely key.

545
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,720
You want to design a test plan

546
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,230
to take into account what's on the slide

547
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:27,080
and you wanna do testing
both functional and tabletop.

548
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:30,550
I think I've glossed on functional
testing just a little bit

549
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:34,440
but I wanna make sure we
understand what that means.

550
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,320
That means actually testing the controls

551
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,730
that they work under a
cyber attack, so to speak.

552
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:43,580
And so that means getting
in there and testing them.

553
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,210
And I'll talk about...

554
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:48,130
I mentioned penetration
testing type resource

555
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:49,180
on the last slide,

556
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,930
we'll get there in just a second, though,

557
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:53,443
on why that can be important and helpful.

558
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:59,820
You want to include also making sure

559
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:03,060
you include everything here
on the slide in that test plan

560
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,889
including what kind of operational risks

561
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:06,130
are you trying to cover?

562
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:09,100
You want critical assets
in those interconnections,

563
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,669
because this is where
you're actually starting

564
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:14,300
to weave it into disaster recovery.

565
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,040
You wanna make sure you try to attack

566
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:20,690
or touch on critical asset
operation during this,

567
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:23,150
because that's really
where it's gonna show value

568
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:24,700
to your organization.

569
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,320
And I talked about communication

570
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,020
but you also want some level of training.

571
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:31,610
You're gonna want teams trained

572
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:33,229
while they're a part of this program

573
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:35,650
so that they understand that
they're a part of the program,

574
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:37,650
what their expectations are.

575
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:40,680
And then you have to also balance that

576
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:44,050
with not having too much
going on with the program

577
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:46,030
and overburdening resources.

578
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:48,950
But again you want people
to understand their roles

579
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:52,690
should something of this
large nature happen.

580
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:56,090
And then one other thing
you wanna make sure...

581
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:57,220
Or two other things.

582
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,780
You wanna make sure you have control gap

583
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:02,250
remediation planned for as a milestone.

584
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:04,970
And that could be involving finding a tool

585
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:09,150
or a solution implementation
of that and testing it.

586
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,940
And that takes time, right?

587
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,870
That does not happen overnight.

588
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:16,399
And then ongoing evidence
capture is also very critical

589
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,610
because we don't often consider that

590
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:22,399
as we plan for resourcing,
but it takes a lot of time.

591
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,840
So make sure that that is also

592
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,610
included in your resource planning

593
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:30,740
or in your implementation plan.

594
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:31,833
So how to measure.

595
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:34,480
Everybody's favorite topic.

596
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,660
Metrics are always a difficult thing.

597
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,820
Here are some suggestions, and of course,

598
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:41,520
they make it sound so easy,
you know, dashboards, right?

599
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,970
These are some general ideas.

600
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:45,290
I would also like to point out

601
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:47,570
that the NIST documents
also have extensive

602
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:49,790
suggestions on metrics.

603
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:51,940
So you might wanna dig
through those a bit.

604
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:55,600
But let's talk about some ones
you might not have considered

605
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,219
for this specific effort.

606
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:59,870
What about security incident metrics?

607
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:03,020
Those might help bolster your
cyber resilience program.

608
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:06,560
What about metrics for your
actual tabletop exercises

609
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,659
or other functional exercises?

610
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:11,380
Are there any lessons learned
that you were tracking, right?

611
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,160
That shows continuous improvement

612
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:16,390
and sustainability that
we mentioned earlier.

613
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:18,520
What about tracking the
efforts for remediation

614
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,670
of your gap assessment?

615
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:23,490
Improving your just
overall project tracking,

616
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:26,390
improving your resiliency
by closing those gaps

617
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:28,790
in those controls is
a great thing to show.

618
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:30,320
And then metrics on the effectiveness

619
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,240
of your control testing
by a penetration testing,

620
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,660
which I'll get to on the next slide.

621
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:38,200
You can even do some
before and after metrics.

622
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:41,720
So before an exercise, take
a survey of your participants

623
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:44,160
and say, "Where do you expect gaps to be?"

624
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:48,417
And then afterwards, "Did we
hit on those expected gaps?

625
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:49,610
"Did we find other gaps?"

626
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:50,550
Those kinds of things

627
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:53,173
so you can have some
qualitative metrics there.

628
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:58,263
All right. How can penetration
testing save the day?

629
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:02,450
You wanna touch your
controls under duress, right?

630
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:05,720
But you want to do so
as safely as possible.

631
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:09,220
And it also helps support
the purple theme approach

632
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,763
that everybody wants to do.

633
00:28:11,971 --> 00:28:14,483
And sometimes you need that extra support,

634
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:19,210
not just because it's the
right thing to do and it helps

635
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:22,440
but this is a good excuse to
help kinda tie that in there.

636
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,583
So how would you scope these exercises?

637
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:28,610
I'm gonna leverage that applicable threats

638
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:30,610
that I mentioned earlier again.

639
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:32,429
If you know what applicable threats

640
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:34,610
that you're worried about
for the organization,

641
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:36,949
and they can be very high level

642
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:41,950
from insider threat to cyber criminal...

643
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:44,810
You know what are they
after in your organization?

644
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:46,530
Map those to MITRE.

645
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:48,260
And then you build scenarios

646
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,660
based on where you think
your controls cover them

647
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:51,853
and see if they work.

648
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:55,520
Can you track lateral movement?

649
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,330
The ultimate question
for many organizations.

650
00:28:58,330 --> 00:28:59,760
So let's take phishing 'cause everybody

651
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,270
has phishing apply to them, right?

652
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:06,230
Phishing. Do you wanna test that in prod?

653
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:07,670
Absolutely. Why not?

654
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:09,390
Have a malicious appearing

655
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:13,090
yet harmless email
crafted by a professional

656
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:15,179
and send it to some of your employees.

657
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:18,750
This would actually cover
several controls along the way,

658
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:21,210
including your email gateway solution,

659
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:23,290
your security awareness program,

660
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:25,110
your end point, your EDR solution,

661
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:27,779
or maybe even antivirus,

662
00:29:27,779 --> 00:29:29,800
and then your outbound proxy

663
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:33,240
and maybe some others
that I haven't thought of.

664
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,960
Then you cycle through these tests

665
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,130
and your threats until
you hit all your controls

666
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:39,940
and you see what gaps you have,

667
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:43,180
and you continue to build
your testing program

668
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:44,650
based on those.

669
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:47,530
One that I do suggest that's
also pretty applicable

670
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:49,690
to many organizations that you probably

671
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:52,370
don't wanna test in
production unless you have to

672
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,420
at some level, your DDoS,

673
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:59,470
your distributed denial of
service attack controls.

674
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:02,210
You hope you don't have
to test that in real life

675
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:04,273
but sometimes it just happens.

676
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,930
Or there may be other
ways you can test that

677
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:10,238
without completely
trying to denial service

678
00:30:10,238 --> 00:30:11,720
your organization,

679
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:15,160
but it is important to make
sure it works at some level.

680
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,470
Okay, next steps.

681
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:19,550
Now that I've done this massive brain dump

682
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:20,720
on cyber resilience,

683
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,820
let's take a look at what you can do now

684
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:25,653
and in the next 90 days and beyond.

685
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:29,630
So what to do in 30 days?

686
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:34,630
I have a ton of resources in
the resources coming up slides

687
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:36,879
that's not to light reading.

688
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,710
Do some reading, get some ideas

689
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:43,060
on how to kind of nuance
what I've suggested here

690
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:43,970
for your organization.

691
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:45,650
And whatever's gonna work.

692
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:47,193
Assess the risks, right?

693
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:52,550
You're gonna need to make
sure that this is risk-based

694
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:55,450
because you're gonna find a
lot of gaps as you go along.

695
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:57,330
Everybody does, it's okay,

696
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:59,220
but you can't do everything all at once.

697
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:02,600
So prioritize based on what's
gonna have the largest impact

698
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:05,429
to your organization if not remediated.

699
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:08,350
Make sure you assign that ownership

700
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:11,320
and the accountability
as clearly as possible.

701
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,510
If cyber ends up with it, I'm sorry,

702
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:16,160
but at least we're working on it

703
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,750
and hopefully you're
building that partnership

704
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:20,210
so that you're not trying to do it alone.

705
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:21,370
Outline the structure.

706
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:23,939
That's gonna include your
plan for socialization,

707
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:26,760
collaboration, leveraging
many teams resources,

708
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,740
again, not to be done on your own.

709
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:31,700
And then keep going, right?

710
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,990
It's one of those things,
just do it, right?

711
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:37,863
Because that's really important
to just get started on it.

712
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:41,140
And then in 90 days where you start doing,

713
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:43,370
you got all these pieces
and parts together,

714
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:45,330
start getting support
from your leadership.

715
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:47,800
If you don't do this,
you're going to struggle.

716
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:51,530
And your program's probably
not gonna go very far.

717
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:54,843
So get that support,
socialize and collaborate.

718
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,040
This is a team effort,

719
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:01,090
don't forget to leverage that
and make it a team effort.

720
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:05,020
Plan and do your first test, just do one.

721
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,690
Tabletop or functional.

722
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:10,070
That may help, not only
get support for your plan,

723
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:12,330
but it's also gonna probably
have things to be built

724
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:14,149
into your implementation plan.

725
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:17,000
And then follow up on those test results.

726
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Every test you do should
have some follow-up

727
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,740
and should ensure that
those things are remediated

728
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:25,460
'cause otherwise, why do you do tests?

729
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,670
You shouldn't do them.

730
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:28,930
And then lather, rinse, repeat.

731
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:30,360
You have to keep doing this

732
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:33,280
and you do really need
to do functional testing.

733
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,760
You need to make sure
your controls are working

734
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,000
as expected in all capacities, right?

735
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,580
Because everybody says, "Oh,
we have this great coverage."

736
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:42,980
Great. Have you ever tested it?

737
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:44,163
This is a way to do it.

738
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:47,770
All right. So that's your plan.

739
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:51,870
Here's some resources,
here's some more resources.

740
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:53,780
And again, they're all in the slides.

741
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:57,253
If you want the notes, you'll
have to contact me direct.

742
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,770
And there is where you do it.

743
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:04,270
So I really enjoyed putting this together.

744
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:07,540
I really appreciate the
concepts of cyber resilience

745
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:09,740
even though they were
kind of introduced to me

746
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:13,730
at a painful level, I do appreciate it.

747
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:17,410
And it makes sense,
again, not rocket science.

748
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:19,400
I hope that you found the topics

749
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,940
that I've covered here useful

750
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,890
and I wish you much success

751
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:25,250
in your cyber resilience efforts.

752
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:26,097
So thank you.
