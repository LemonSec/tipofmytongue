1
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:02,760
- Hi.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,490
Welcome to responding to disinformation

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:07,340
and influence campaigns,

4
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:12,340
session AIR-T08 RSA for 2021.

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,200
We're very excited to be here.

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,379
I'm Todd Inskeep,

7
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:18,750
I'm longtime information
security professional.

8
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:23,710
And longtime leader and
speaker here at RSA.

9
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:27,860
Been working in information
security for well over 25 years.

10
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:29,860
With me today, I've got three panelists

11
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:32,200
I'm very excited to be talking to.

12
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,600
Mark Aysta is the managing director

13
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,400
at Duke Energy and former FBI Agent,

14
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,480
with a long history in
information security

15
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,330
and protecting systems.

16
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:45,750
Melissa O'Leary is here
from Fortalice Solutions.

17
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,043
Melissa has been working as
the chief strategy officer

18
00:00:48,043 --> 00:00:51,100
and working with several
of the clients in Fortalice

19
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:54,910
on this problems of
misinformation and disinformation.

20
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:58,529
Finally, I've got JD Work, a
former intelligence officer,

21
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:01,420
giving us a different
perspective from his experience

22
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:05,319
and his position at the
Marine Corp University.

23
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:06,740
Thank you guys for being here.

24
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:09,479
I'm very excited to get
started talking about this.

25
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,850
So as we think about this idea

26
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:17,640
of talking about responding
to disinformation,

27
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,690
understanding and thinking
about misinformation campaigns,

28
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:24,240
one of the things that
I think is really tough

29
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,179
for people to understand,

30
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:30,220
is that these campaigns really do affect

31
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:34,230
individual companies and
attack individual products.

32
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:37,610
So one of the first things
I think about in this is,

33
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:42,120
how do you identify
these kinds of campaigns?

34
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,030
Melissa, why don't we start with you?

35
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:46,960
Can you tell us a little
bit about what you see?

36
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,029
- Sure, you know,
unfortunately in our practice

37
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:51,860
I think that folks identify
it when it's too late.

38
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:54,270
So there's certainly a
very large human element

39
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:57,350
and human reaction to campaigns.

40
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:59,149
To give you a case study,

41
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:01,040
we worked with a high profile lawyer

42
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,160
who was targeted by a former employee

43
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,869
who essentially created a false narrative

44
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:09,229
about the lawyer's background.

45
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:11,880
And it was actually very easy to do that.

46
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:18,360
He found essentially another
individual with the same name

47
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,080
that had a sordid history
and was able to align

48
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,011
that with the high profile lawyer,

49
00:02:24,011 --> 00:02:26,070
publishing things on a blog,

50
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:28,260
and then top level searches,

51
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:33,000
were kind of right out there, disparaging

52
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,070
the high level lawyer.

53
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:38,220
So we had to go through
a take down process,

54
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:42,900
and quite a bit of work
to assist this person.

55
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:47,040
And, as you mentioned, there
was a high emotional toll

56
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,820
on the high profile lawyer
working on many important cases,

57
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:56,370
completely preoccupied with
this misinformation campaign

58
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:57,686
that was going on around him,

59
00:02:57,686 --> 00:03:00,380
that totally misdirected
his work and his life

60
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,370
for a period of time.

61
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:04,295
And unfortunately, the
way it was identified was,

62
00:03:04,295 --> 00:03:06,662
you know, through just
searching for himself.

63
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,770
- Yeah.

64
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:11,710
Mark, how does this impacting
like the energy sector

65
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:14,340
where there's always a
lot of discussion about

66
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,233
different topics in energy.

67
00:03:18,087 --> 00:03:19,972
What happens in your world?

68
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,033
- Yeah, sure.

69
00:03:22,033 --> 00:03:22,928
Thanks, Todd.

70
00:03:22,928 --> 00:03:25,368
We have to respond to disinformation.

71
00:03:25,368 --> 00:03:27,218
We have to respond to
information that comes in

72
00:03:27,218 --> 00:03:28,070
or intelligence that comes in

73
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:30,530
and we have a responsibility to vet it.

74
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:33,190
Is this legitimate, or is it not?

75
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:35,130
But even in the case of misinformation,

76
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:37,130
where something may not be accurate,

77
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:40,010
it could still be perceived as a threat.

78
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:43,890
My role is to maintain our assets,

79
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,450
protect our customers, our employees,

80
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:47,769
and our ability to power our communities.

81
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:50,970
And so when there's a
disinformation campaign

82
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:52,500
that is engaged,

83
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,500
we have an obligation to
find out the facts quickly

84
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,713
and then respond to it.

85
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:58,989
- Yeah.

86
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:02,040
And how do you do that?

87
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,049
How do you kind of go about looking

88
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:07,750
for misinformation
campaigns in your sector?

89
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:08,800
- Sure.

90
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,300
So it starts with a robust
intelligence program.

91
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,697
Both a physical security
or a physical intelligence

92
00:04:12,697 --> 00:04:15,760
and a cybersecurity intelligence program,

93
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,579
vetting out what is accurate, what isn't.

94
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:21,399
We've got a number of vendors
and tools that we use,

95
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:24,849
that helps us determine the
veracity of the intelligence.

96
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:27,023
And then based on that we have to respond.

97
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,020
- Yeah.

98
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,844
And JD,

99
00:04:30,845 --> 00:04:35,130
how does this influence
what kind of organizations

100
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:35,963
and sectors?

101
00:04:35,963 --> 00:04:38,840
So when you think about
where you're working

102
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,109
from in kind of a broader
intelligence community

103
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:44,523
and broader community perspective,

104
00:04:45,559 --> 00:04:48,130
how should organizations be thinking about

105
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:51,430
identifying this kind of activity,

106
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:53,463
and what should they be doing about it?

107
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:57,754
- So when we think about the
problem of malign influence

108
00:04:57,754 --> 00:05:00,030
by hostile foreign intelligence services,

109
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:03,434
I'll confine my remarks
to overseas problems,

110
00:05:03,435 --> 00:05:06,210
there are a number of domestic issues

111
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:08,322
but not simply outside of my remit.

112
00:05:08,322 --> 00:05:09,720
It does help to understand

113
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,170
how these foreign intelligence services

114
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:12,640
approach the mission,

115
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,969
because it really is a
mission for those players

116
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:17,490
and the contractor ecosystem
that supports their operations

117
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:19,360
and the information environment.

118
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,050
Russian Intelligence
doctrine in particular,

119
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:24,600
is very important for us to unpack

120
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,890
when we're looking at

121
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:28,630
both how that's those
services are engaged in it

122
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:31,490
and how other services that
are copying their successes

123
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:33,023
or going about this.

124
00:05:33,023 --> 00:05:36,150
Their doctrine does not split cyber

125
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:38,849
from influence operations.

126
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:41,040
they consider both within
the overarching concept

127
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,050
of information confrontation.

128
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:43,980
Now, how do we know this?

129
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,530
Well, the Russian Intelligence
Services has been kind enough

130
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:48,340
to talk about this for many years.

131
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,440
They watched the development
of our Western doctrine

132
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,830
for information warfare

133
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,919
throughout the early period of the 1990s,

134
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,242
and pursued their own
version of those ideas.

135
00:05:56,242 --> 00:05:59,260
It coincided with a very
rare period of openness,

136
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,780
where much of their strategic literature

137
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,419
was becoming available for the first time

138
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:05,210
outside of Soviet era
classification restrictions.

139
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:07,280
Previously to obtain
copies of these journals

140
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,340
and other papers,

141
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,679
in which these ideas were talked about,

142
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,740
the West had the leverage
human intelligence assets

143
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,060
penetrating Soviet Intelligence.

144
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:18,200
We know from declassified
histories that touch documents

145
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,870
were among the many
valuable things provided

146
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:21,770
to Western intelligence services

147
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:26,770
by several key assets
in the Cold War period.

148
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:30,000
Some of whom died
bringing us that insight.

149
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,639
Things got a lot easier
on the post Soviet year.

150
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,690
Unfortunately, it's become
much more complicated

151
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:37,870
with return of great power competition.

152
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,500
When you look at these writings,

153
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:43,800
you see that they're explicitly
seeking to disorganize,

154
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,140
a series of targets.

155
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:47,570
Including traditional government
and military elements,

156
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:50,200
but also transnational
entities, including corporations

157
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,150
of international and non
governmental organizations,

158
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:54,900
and network activists.

159
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:55,880
They're pursuing these

160
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,469
for a variety of strategic objectives.

161
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:01,360
And the operations themselves
may have little to do

162
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,870
with the targets that they're leveraging

163
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,660
and seeking these objectives.

164
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,890
These victims are rather
than merely instrumental

165
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:11,030
to some perceived advantage
that these services carry up.

166
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,320
So it's really about understanding

167
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,840
the foreign government objective involved,

168
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,700
what they think they can gain,

169
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,360
what they think they can disorganize

170
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,543
within our Western targets,
and how they're going about it.

171
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:26,280
- I wanna dig into that just a little bit.

172
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,719
How does that unpack in two ways?

173
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,340
First, how does it unpack for
other foreign governments?

174
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:36,229
So you mentioned the Russians actually do

175
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:39,010
consider targeting
transnational organizations,

176
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:41,570
so large global companies

177
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:44,120
headquartered in the US and elsewhere.

178
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:48,340
Do other countries target in the same way,

179
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:52,217
if I think about the Iranians,
that Iraqis, the Russians,

180
00:07:52,217 --> 00:07:55,400
(indistinct) the Chinese
and North Koreans,

181
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,506
is it kind of a global problem,

182
00:07:57,506 --> 00:07:59,210
and when you think about

183
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:01,650
national intelligence organizations,

184
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:03,363
kind of attacking companies?

185
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,909
- Very much.

186
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,420
It is a global problem.

187
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,790
We've seen multiple other actors

188
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,120
that have been watching the cycle

189
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,000
of operational experimentation
by the Russian services,

190
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,020
particularly through these new online

191
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,979
and social media mediated campaigns.

192
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:21,280
And they're learning from the lessons

193
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,570
the Russians have
demonstrated in practice.

194
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,040
Both through hacking leak operations,

195
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,681
as well as through large scale

196
00:08:27,681 --> 00:08:31,032
coordinated inauthentic
persona development.

197
00:08:31,032 --> 00:08:33,360
What we considered core Russian doctrine

198
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,289
has actually been copied in practice.

199
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:36,849
And indeed, perhaps with some degree

200
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:40,309
of the same strategic
thinking in new campaigns.

201
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:43,103
We've seen this in a variety
of less mature actors.

202
00:08:43,104 --> 00:08:45,970
The recent office Director
of National Intelligence

203
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:51,240
reporting called out the
declassified reporting,

204
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,550
called out the Venezuelan campaigns.

205
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:55,870
We've seen extensive industry reporting

206
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:58,088
around Iranian campaigns.

207
00:08:58,088 --> 00:08:59,780
Of particular interest is,

208
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:04,780
a campaign that was done
by industry Endless Mayfly.

209
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:08,760
It mattered to me personally,

210
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,720
because in July 2020,

211
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,360
as a fire that destroyed
a US amphibious warship

212
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,020
at Port in San Diego, we still smoldering.

213
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,710
This campaign was actually
circulating forged documents

214
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:21,660
impersonating a prominent US lawmaker

215
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:25,530
to advance frankly,
racist and unborn themes.

216
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:26,870
This messaging and the persona

217
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,540
associated with this messaging,

218
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:31,488
this forged document, have
actually been attributed

219
00:09:31,489 --> 00:09:33,877
to this Iranian winter campaign.

220
00:09:33,877 --> 00:09:35,910
It was not terribly effective.

221
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:38,660
It was rapidly countered,

222
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:41,900
and the persona is taken down by Twitter.

223
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:46,182
But we've seen quite
serious developments in that

224
00:09:46,182 --> 00:09:48,290
from that service.

225
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:49,860
We've also seen Endless Mayfly

226
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,140
promote messaging attempting
to stop racial divisions

227
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,199
around the COVID vaccination research

228
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,230
and the rollout of candidate
injections in the US,

229
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,790
in mid 2020.

230
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:03,640
Clearly seeking to discredit
the vaccination process

231
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,563
in the minds of the general public.

232
00:10:06,413 --> 00:10:07,322
- Yeah.

233
00:10:07,322 --> 00:10:08,443
So the other way I wanna unpack it,

234
00:10:08,443 --> 00:10:11,520
and I'm gonna ask Melissa
to comment on this

235
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:15,130
is, this is nation state
against corporation

236
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:17,140
and certainly there are
some big corporations

237
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,550
with the big budgets.

238
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:23,300
But is it reasonable for
an individual company

239
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:27,806
to be thinking about how
to identify and counter

240
00:10:27,807 --> 00:10:32,490
national resources, national level attacks

241
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:35,240
around misinformation and campaign things

242
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,863
that national level attack might be doing?

243
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,989
- Yeah, you know Todd, it's
an interesting question.

244
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:44,670
And in my opinion, it is,

245
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,250
there is a certain responsibility

246
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,940
that the companies and
individuals and others

247
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,740
hold to protect themselves,

248
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,350
I wish that didn't exist.

249
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:55,210
However, when you're going
up against a nation state,

250
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:58,370
you're not going to be
able to defend yourself

251
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:01,400
with just the assistance of one party,

252
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,300
it takes really the
public private-partnership

253
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:09,300
to assist companies and the
government in our democracy,

254
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:12,750
and moving ahead in this area,

255
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,610
and being able to counter the threat.

256
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:19,360
Companies as end users
certainly should have

257
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,330
more robust intelligence centers.

258
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:25,450
You know, Mark mentioned that, you know,

259
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:28,010
as part of his work, he has that in place.

260
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:30,390
Many of the companies that we work with

261
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,330
do not have that in place as of now,

262
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:33,530
because they haven't, you know,

263
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:37,117
had that moment of nation
states coming at me.

264
00:11:37,118 --> 00:11:41,120
And I certainly wouldn't
advocate for any company

265
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,270
going from zero to 100 in that area,

266
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:46,189
and, you know, diverting resources

267
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:49,040
to a robust intelligence center.

268
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,329
But there are certainly
things that companies

269
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:52,290
can and should be doing

270
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:54,160
just to baseline the information out there

271
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,920
and to determine if they are threat.

272
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:01,683
And then to augment that or support that.

273
00:12:01,683 --> 00:12:03,120
Now, we certainly need

274
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,085
a more robust national
and global framework

275
00:12:06,085 --> 00:12:07,730
for how we deal with these issues

276
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:12,730
that harnesses various
constituencies to help the companies

277
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,240
and the end users.

278
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,450
- Yeah.

279
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:17,690
- I would like to jump in.

280
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:19,370
- (indistinct) Mark.
Yeah.

281
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:21,080
I wanna stress that

282
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:24,240
even though we've been talking
about foreign threat actors,

283
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,230
this is very much alive
and well here domestically.

284
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:31,700
And I will talk a little
bit about my time in the FBI

285
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,100
before I retired and came
to the private sector.

286
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,040
I spent the majority of my
career doing undercover work.

287
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,069
And I recall one case that I worked,

288
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:43,080
it was an anti government case,
a sovereign citizen group,

289
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,460
that I spent three years in infiltrating

290
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,530
in order to gather the evidence

291
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:48,959
of their illegal criminal activity.

292
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,460
And at the end of the day,

293
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:53,720
they wrapped all this
ideology around the fact

294
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,750
that they were in it for the money,

295
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,657
there was a fiduciary game.

296
00:12:56,657 --> 00:13:01,260
They would handpick
sections of US Federal Law,

297
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:04,939
Uniform Commercial Code,
Maritime Laws, State Laws.

298
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:07,070
And they would piece together a narrative

299
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:10,110
that when they weigh it
out made a lot of sense.

300
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:12,690
But when you go back
and look at the origins

301
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:16,100
of each one of those pieces of
evidence that they provided,

302
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,870
they had nothing to do with the context

303
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,580
in which they were putting it.

304
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:21,730
And then they use that narrative

305
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:23,840
to convince people that the
United States government

306
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,210
was not a government at all,

307
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:28,770
it was, in fact, a private US corporation.

308
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:32,100
And that if you could find
go through their process

309
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,190
and monetize your birth certificate,

310
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:37,870
you could use those funds
to eliminate your tax bills,

311
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:40,950
your mortgage, pay off your costs.

312
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:44,490
Well, the result was, people
ended up getting prosecuted

313
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,490
and going to jail for this.

314
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:47,990
Well, at the end of the day,

315
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:50,610
the leaders of this misinformation

316
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:52,800
that were propagating this
across the United States,

317
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,530
they knew it wasn't accurate,

318
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:56,750
but they'd become so accustomed

319
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,910
to the amount of money
they were making on it,

320
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:00,260
that they continue to do it.

321
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:03,390
So there are some very ideological,

322
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,860
international threat actors

323
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:07,300
that are targeting American corporations.

324
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,170
And there are individuals

325
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:10,709
who are just making a
buck out there often.

326
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:13,800
So, that's why I said,
it's really important

327
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:18,099
you use intelligence tools,
and people that understand

328
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:21,050
how to get the veracity
of this information.

329
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:24,392
And because as I said, when
they explain it to you,

330
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,800
it can seem very legitimate.

331
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,150
- Yeah.

332
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:30,807
I was gonna ask you a little
bit different question.

333
00:14:30,807 --> 00:14:33,010
But I think on that note,

334
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:35,490
JD, one of the things
we talked about early on

335
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:38,170
was trying to understand motivations

336
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:41,439
and figure out the motivations
of some of these actors

337
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,580
as they're propagating, distributing

338
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:46,640
and creating misinformation,
disinformation.

339
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,100
Can you talk a little bit more about that?

340
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,110
- Sure.

341
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:52,370
When we're looking at

342
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:56,140
particularly folks that
were either influenced by

343
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,970
or copying an operational practice,

344
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:01,378
this original Russian information,

345
00:15:01,378 --> 00:15:04,310
confrontation or active measures doctrine,

346
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:06,670
we're seeing a variety of
these strategic objectives

347
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,000
coming to the forefront.

348
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,700
Either they're seeking to
shape decision making an action

349
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:14,420
by targets of influence in the
interest of these planners,

350
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:18,020
in the interests of the mission
that they're supporting,

351
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,140
or

352
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:23,600
if they're not seeking to shape
a specific decision outcome,

353
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,140
they're perhaps undermining

354
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,699
the legitimacy of political power

355
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,921
and the international authority
of the targeted country.

356
00:15:29,921 --> 00:15:32,220
They may be seeking to destabilize

357
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,970
a situation in the country
to use the Russian term,

358
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,982
provoking political protest,

359
00:15:36,982 --> 00:15:39,550
exacerbating societal conflict.

360
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:41,620
They may be provoking the
emergence and development

361
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,370
of other negative social phenomena,

362
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,591
seeking to reduce the
resilience of the country.

363
00:15:47,591 --> 00:15:49,750
Russian doctrine also speaks extensively

364
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,950
about targeting the morale

365
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:54,420
and the psychological
state of the population,

366
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,270
which is something we've
done that but think about

367
00:15:56,270 --> 00:16:00,545
in the West, we consider our
population a rather diverse

368
00:16:00,545 --> 00:16:02,400
and resilient lot,

369
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,079
but the adversary seeking

370
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:07,690
sometimes simply to cause
us pain in that population.

371
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:09,520
We also see some very specific things

372
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:13,520
targeting the identity of national values

373
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,319
and the foundations of those values.

374
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:18,099
- Melissa, can you talk a little bit more

375
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,020
about the profit motive,

376
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:23,333
as you think about the some
of the experiences you've had,

377
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:28,484
working with customers and
people attacking those customers.

378
00:16:28,484 --> 00:16:31,323
How does that profit motive start to play?

379
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:35,079
- I think it really starts to play out,

380
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,331
and I really think that
it's dominating the cases

381
00:16:37,331 --> 00:16:41,350
that we see, you know, the
cases that JD is talking about.

382
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:44,000
I think it's more of an undercurrent,

383
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,190
that's occurring across
the various domains.

384
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:50,410
But for us, one of the things that we did

385
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,230
five or so years ago

386
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:55,060
was we started to see misinformation

387
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,439
coming into our practice.

388
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:00,300
As I mentioned, we had folks
like a high profile lawyer

389
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,793
coming in and saying, what's happening?

390
00:17:02,793 --> 00:17:05,940
I can't believe that, you know,
being defamed in this way.

391
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:08,612
And our CEO, Theresa Payton
wrote a book on the topic.

392
00:17:08,612 --> 00:17:13,612
And as part of her
research, Matt was a hacker

393
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:18,550
that was basically hired
by a conservative group

394
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:21,483
to monetize,

395
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,790
essentially, kind of news.

396
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:27,200
So he set up a whole operation

397
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,620
and communities and notes of people,

398
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:32,989
that were perpetuating information,

399
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:37,460
serving information up
to various stakeholders

400
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,650
and demographics.

401
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:41,850
So you know, a lot of
people like in the morning

402
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:43,419
to have the soft and easy news

403
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:46,430
and then they like the conspiracy
theories in the afternoon,

404
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:49,240
and then at night, they might
navigate to the dark web,

405
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,203
and then 4chan.

406
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:54,400
So he was customizing
information and sending it

407
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,700
to legitimate people,

408
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,100
but then also kind of
communities of trolls,

409
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,370
that would click on the information

410
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,189
and they would make a buck off it.

411
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:05,700
So not only was this
campaign serving the purpose

412
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:10,700
of perpetuating really kind
of right leaning propaganda,

413
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:13,290
but then also monetizing that.

414
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:15,360
And, you know, kind of lining the pockets

415
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,763
of the people that were
running the campaign.

416
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:20,820
- It's one of the interesting elements

417
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:23,830
of the way we build out
our systems networks,

418
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:26,909
kind of social media and online media,

419
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:30,790
that you can monetize a lot
of things by selling ads,

420
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:33,060
if you can get people to click to content.

421
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:38,060
And it's really whatever the
content is that creates clicks,

422
00:18:38,415 --> 00:18:40,580
these clicks generate ads

423
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,622
and generate ad revenue for people.

424
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,280
- Exactly.

425
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,580
- So the other piece that
I've seen in my experience,

426
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:52,360
is that there's an international
competition element

427
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,783
for companies.

428
00:18:53,783 --> 00:18:56,100
I may be selling a product globally,

429
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:59,629
that faces competition that a
particular part of the world,

430
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:02,050
and my competitors may be more local,

431
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:06,180
and taking advantage of local
media, local opportunities,

432
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:10,270
to disparage my product
just in a particular market.

433
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:13,763
Maybe someplace in the far
East, maybe someplace in Africa.

434
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:19,070
That feels like an
opportunity to really expand

435
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:21,340
my intelligence to try and see

436
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,550
not just what's going on in news

437
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:25,570
or in the traditional dark web,

438
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:29,210
but really looking at and
looking for discussions

439
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,490
of my products and my company,

440
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:34,443
in all kinds of media,
especially social media.

441
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:40,000
- Yeah, I think that's a valid point.

442
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,283
And, you know, essentially
it comes down to, you know,

443
00:19:45,304 --> 00:19:48,300
kind of reading sentiment across the globe

444
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,960
and doing it at a larger scale.

445
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,360
So the downside of that can
be just the pure cost of,

446
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,409
you know, ingesting data and
analyzing the information.

447
00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:00,930
So it takes in my opinion,
partially, you know,

448
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:01,990
having the right tool sets,

449
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:05,000
but then also having
the right investigators,

450
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
and the right team in place
that can help to identify

451
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:12,260
where the true misinformation is occurring

452
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,670
versus a couple of people

453
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:16,570
that were dissatisfied with a product.

454
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:17,403
- Yeah.

455
00:20:17,403 --> 00:20:19,700
- Well, I think Melissa brings
up a really valid point,

456
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,170
that you have to have
those components in place.

457
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:23,593
I would also add on,

458
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:28,380
that you need to be able
to package that information

459
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,760
and give it to decision makers,

460
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,460
senior leadership in the company,

461
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,580
so that they can read it in
a way that they understand

462
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:36,480
what it is, and that
have that relationship

463
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,980
with your corporate communications,

464
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:41,440
so that they can then
craft messaging, right?

465
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,470
We as security professionals

466
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:45,100
are probably not gonna be the
ones and shouldn't be the ones

467
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,899
to craft that messaging.

468
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,485
But by giving the intelligence

469
00:20:49,485 --> 00:20:53,199
we give decision makers then
the information that they need

470
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,650
to make an informed decision.

471
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:57,520
- Yeah, I was gonna ask
you about that Mark.

472
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,620
Because sentiment analysis,

473
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:04,080
it feels like much more like
a marketing kind of function

474
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:04,913
and job thing.

475
00:21:04,913 --> 00:21:09,870
So it feels like integrating
between your intelligence team,

476
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:13,212
your marketing team,
your communications team,

477
00:21:13,212 --> 00:21:15,362
it feels like it added
some confusion here.

478
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:20,209
- Well, this is where
if you're thinking about

479
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:21,520
how do I avoid this in the future,

480
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,760
maybe I haven't been subject

481
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,660
to a misinformation campaign yet.

482
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:28,204
How do I prepare my company
in that eventuality?

483
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:29,830
Well, these are the conversations

484
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,379
you should start having now.

485
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,030
And engaging in these conversations

486
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,930
with your marketing staff,

487
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:37,510
with your corporate
communications and saying,

488
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:40,810
how are we going to combat this?

489
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:42,530
Are we gonna have monthly meetings?

490
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:43,620
Do we have bi weekly meetings?

491
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:46,629
You meet under blue sky conditions,

492
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:49,050
and you run through some scenarios.

493
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:52,899
You can even tabletop
those types of discussions.

494
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:55,300
But the first time you
start talking about it,

495
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:58,870
ought not when you're subject
to a misinformation campaign.

496
00:21:58,870 --> 00:21:59,780
- Yeah.

497
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:02,478
Yeah, I know I think it's critical

498
00:22:02,478 --> 00:22:05,490
that you that you plan
ahead and think about it.

499
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:10,490
For any of you, is it easy
to make a campaign worse,

500
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:14,154
if somebody is targeting your products,

501
00:22:14,154 --> 00:22:16,310
or your company?

502
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:18,193
Are there things you should never do?

503
00:22:22,231 --> 00:22:25,057
- I'll take that one.

504
00:22:25,057 --> 00:22:28,170
(indistinct) a little bit
of fun, what Mark just said.

505
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:30,800
I have another example from our practice,

506
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:34,480
we worked over during
the kind of the COVID.

507
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,570
We're still in the middle of COVID

508
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:37,659
but during the the worst times of COVID,

509
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,700
with a large health organization

510
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:43,240
that was very forward
leaning about its response

511
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:47,490
to determining how to
roll out the vaccine.

512
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:50,133
The very rural community, and you know,

513
00:22:50,133 --> 00:22:53,191
in probably last summer was looking at

514
00:22:53,191 --> 00:22:56,290
where can we vaccinate people?

515
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:59,960
How can we do it for free before
the vaccine even occurred?

516
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:04,250
And some of the people in the
anti vaccination community

517
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:07,520
caught wind of it and started, you know,

518
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,730
essentially going online

519
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:14,570
and giving the hospital
organization bad reviews.

520
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:19,570
Again, disparaging, and kind
of issuing fraudulent things

521
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:21,350
around the executives.

522
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:23,958
And, you know, when we
kind of stepped in there,

523
00:23:23,959 --> 00:23:25,990
it is a question of

524
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:30,220
you don't want to give the
people orchestrating this

525
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:31,530
more gasoline.

526
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:34,220
You don't wanna incite them even more.

527
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:36,680
So, you know, we kind
of initiated a campaign

528
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:41,270
of just a very kind of quiet, deescalation

529
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:45,750
of the situation without necessarily,

530
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:50,030
you know, calling into public domain

531
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:50,990
that this was happening,

532
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:54,050
but just kind of issuing some take downs,

533
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:56,683
repairing reputations
and doing it quietly.

534
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:59,170
That of course creates attention,

535
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:01,640
where many folks in the
community would say,

536
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,537
we need to shine a light
on what's happening.

537
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:07,540
We can't let people just
kind of live in the shadows.

538
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:10,170
But for some of the organizations

539
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:11,470
that are dealing with this,

540
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:15,300
at the outset of this
becoming a major issue

541
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:18,600
in the private sector,

542
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,350
it's kind of, in my opinion,
the best course of action.

543
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:23,480
And you certainly need
that fusion approach

544
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:26,490
where it's not just just
the chief security officer

545
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:28,220
and the chief information security officer

546
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,400
trying to figure out what to do,

547
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,920
but there's close collaboration
with communications,

548
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:35,580
legal and any other
stakeholders in the organization

549
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:37,669
that should have a seat at the table.

550
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:39,970
- I think that kind of
brings us back around

551
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:43,390
to that discussion of what
are some of the levers?

552
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:46,590
JD, were you gonna comment
on that last question?

553
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:48,601
- Oh, was actually just going to agree.

554
00:24:48,602 --> 00:24:50,030
I would also add that

555
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,670
one of the key early intelligence needs

556
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:53,200
is understanding the actual reach

557
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,880
of a malign influence campaign.

558
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,880
Adversaries are often far more ambitious

559
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,220
than they can execute,

560
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:00,320
and a number of cases
the messaging received

561
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,919
will quickly fade as a
fail to gain traction.

562
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,170
They will double down on bets

563
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:05,890
where they can actually achieve something

564
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:08,800
that will circle back around
to targets that have proven

565
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,637
proven vulnerable to the messaging.

566
00:25:12,637 --> 00:25:15,159
Unfortunately, Western
media can often provide

567
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,670
very substantial boosting

568
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:20,400
to what would otherwise
be a limited campaign.

569
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,600
And a major corporate
response that's very open

570
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,919
and very heavily engaged,
may well be the hook

571
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,700
that makes what is otherwise
a fringe conspiracy theory

572
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:32,450
newsworthy for a mainstream publication.

573
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:33,283
So unfortunately,

574
00:25:33,283 --> 00:25:35,389
the story often becomes
about the company's response

575
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:38,783
as much as the the problem itself.

576
00:25:39,797 --> 00:25:41,320
- That's right.

577
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:45,889
I do come back to thinking
that planning your responses

578
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:47,790
and thinking about kind of the levers

579
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:52,770
that you can play with early,
really becomes important.

580
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:55,670
Mark, can you maybe
talk a little bit about

581
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:59,360
some of the things that
you think about as levers

582
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:03,530
that you can use to push back on

583
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:06,983
or to counter a misinformation campaign?

584
00:26:08,883 --> 00:26:11,533
- Yeah, Todd, good question.

585
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,433
As a security department again,

586
00:26:15,319 --> 00:26:18,909
we follow our motto, which
is protecting our people,

587
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:21,260
our assets, our ability
to power communities.

588
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:24,167
So when there's this
disinformation that's out there,

589
00:26:24,167 --> 00:26:26,379
as Melissa was saying, she's spot on

590
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:28,870
that this is a collaborative team

591
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:32,620
that you need to engage with,

592
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:34,500
which includes legal and
corporate communications,

593
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,731
and all these things.

594
00:26:35,731 --> 00:26:40,731
Now, the levers I have to pull
when there's misinformation,

595
00:26:41,002 --> 00:26:43,440
I'm not so much concerned about

596
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:46,180
how we're gonna respond to it,

597
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:48,020
because we've got really,
really smart people

598
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,280
that are gonna do that.

599
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,860
I'm concerned with how
do I protect our assets?

600
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:55,040
Because if this misinformation
campaign is out there,

601
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,170
and somebody acts on it,

602
00:26:57,170 --> 00:26:59,113
then I have to do something about it,

603
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:01,790
whether it's true or not, right?

604
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:04,760
It's helpful to let our leadership
know if it's true or not.

605
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,311
But I'll give you a recent example.

606
00:27:06,311 --> 00:27:08,689
We all know what happened
with the insurrection

607
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:13,690
and the whole narrative around
of the election being stolen.

608
00:27:14,127 --> 00:27:17,100
And there was this misinformation

609
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:20,500
that if they could stop the certification

610
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,540
of the Electoral College,

611
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,420
then it would stop the turn
of the peaceful turnover

612
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,253
of power.

613
00:27:25,455 --> 00:27:27,320
Well, as a result of that,

614
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,708
the social media companies somehow

615
00:27:29,709 --> 00:27:32,120
were included being culpable,

616
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,889
and now there were calls
for physical attacks

617
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:37,480
on the social media companies,
on their data centers.

618
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,690
Well, we have several these data centers

619
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:40,980
in our area of responsibility.

620
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:45,810
We supply a great deal of
electricity and energy to them.

621
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:49,409
So now, the brunt of the attack,

622
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:52,940
is not only against the
social media companies,

623
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,620
but they're against our assets.

624
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:55,870
So what does that mean for me?

625
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:56,750
What levers do I pull?

626
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:58,840
Well, I have to increase security patrols,

627
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,889
whether there be airborne
or ground patrol,

628
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:03,250
I have to bring in additional
surveillance assets,

629
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:05,623
cancel vacations for my employees,

630
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:10,710
bring in additional staff
into our sock to monitor,

631
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:12,620
coordinate with across sectors

632
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:14,649
with these companies, security directors

633
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:17,360
to ensure that we have a
unified security response.

634
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,808
So there's a lot of levers that get pulled

635
00:28:20,808 --> 00:28:23,590
that I have to pull as a
result of the misinformation

636
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:24,423
that's coming in,

637
00:28:24,423 --> 00:28:27,490
while we're attempting to
validate the truthfulness,

638
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:30,840
and the accuracy behind
the misinformation.

639
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:31,673
- Yeah.

640
00:28:34,166 --> 00:28:39,149
It sometimes feels like
everything is misinformation now

641
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:43,123
that people are are constantly
trying to twist things.

642
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:48,280
How do you think about
trying to figure out

643
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:51,879
kind of whether someone's
purposely trying to twist things

644
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:56,140
or whether it's really just a matter

645
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:58,003
of different perspectives?

646
00:29:01,358 --> 00:29:03,230
- I think it's really difficult.

647
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:05,180
You know, I was taught that dissent

648
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:07,800
is the cornerstone of democracy.

649
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,840
And, you know, you're really
getting into some gray areas

650
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,730
by potentially curbing free speech

651
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:16,620
or taking away the ability
of people to descend

652
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:19,723
or to have an opposing opinion
to the popular opinion.

653
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:22,193
So again,

654
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:26,970
you get into the the topic of meeting

655
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:28,754
kind of a top down principled approach

656
00:29:28,754 --> 00:29:33,409
to how the nation and
how the world will manage

657
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:35,290
this issue moving forward.

658
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:36,610
And how do you do that,

659
00:29:36,611 --> 00:29:39,360
with preserving things like free speech

660
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,750
and the ability to dissent is something

661
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:43,500
that I think really needs to be unpacked

662
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:47,423
by a variety of people
in different positions.

663
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:52,620
- As we think about
identifying these campaigns,

664
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:54,791
identifying activity,

665
00:29:54,791 --> 00:29:58,139
are there some particular
ways that we should approach

666
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:00,883
or think about talking to executives?

667
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:05,449
Is there something we need
to do to plan specific ways

668
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:09,670
to highlight misinformation,
disinformation campaigns

669
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:10,753
through executives?

670
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:16,630
- Yeah, I think when
it comes to executives,

671
00:30:16,631 --> 00:30:20,170
the most effective approaches
are showing, not telling.

672
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:23,530
So, you know, starting to look across

673
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:26,920
what's kind of in front
of your corporation

674
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,340
and base lining the information,

675
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:31,320
collecting the information and determining

676
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,810
is there an issue,

677
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:37,801
looking at competitors or
looking at other organizations

678
00:30:37,801 --> 00:30:42,310
in your industry to see are
they facing this issue yet?

679
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:43,590
If they're not facing the issue

680
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:46,840
I personally would advocate for, you know,

681
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:49,709
if you have a memo that goes
up to the CEO quarterly,

682
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:51,760
or up to the board quarterly,

683
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,200
spend a couple of sentences
saying I baseline this,

684
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,720
I looked at it, and
we're good to go for now,

685
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,600
here are the things that
I'll be looking out for

686
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,838
and I'll update you.

687
00:30:59,838 --> 00:31:04,040
If, unfortunately, you find
something that's problematic,

688
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,113
then you know that's where as Mark and I

689
00:31:06,113 --> 00:31:08,160
have been kind of talking about you,

690
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:11,363
you move forward with that
collaborative approach

691
00:31:11,363 --> 00:31:13,910
and kind of work horizontally
across the organization

692
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:18,510
to further define the problem, the threat,

693
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:22,730
the risk and elevate
that up to the C suite.

694
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:25,130
But I do think it's very
important right now at this stage

695
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:27,479
to just start a dialogue.

696
00:31:27,479 --> 00:31:30,150
And start, you know,
kind of thinking about,

697
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:31,480
what is your company?

698
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:35,020
Is it situated to defend
and protect itself?

699
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,220
- Yeah.

700
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:39,420
JD, when I think about
other kinds of attacks,

701
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:42,290
if I think about ransomware,

702
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:47,290
if I think about typical financial
attacks on my financials,

703
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,840
typical kinds of attacks,

704
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,820
a lot of organizations kind
of know when you call the FBI,

705
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:56,429
when you call the Secret Service,

706
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:58,113
when you call local police,

707
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:02,169
where do you go in the government?

708
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:06,560
Like kind of where do you
go for misinformation,

709
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:09,040
and for help with misinformation

710
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:12,253
from a public private
partnership perspective?

711
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,016
- Challenging question.

712
00:32:16,016 --> 00:32:17,160
(Todd laughs)

713
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:20,340
Necessarily, well postured
to address these questions.

714
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:21,820
When there are specific threats,

715
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:24,830
when there are specific economic impacts

716
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:27,040
there are various law
enforcement mechanisms

717
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,399
that can be brought to bear.

718
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,100
If it's an overseas diplomatic issue

719
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,781
or foreign intelligence issue,

720
00:32:31,781 --> 00:32:35,057
the state department has a
Global Engagement Center,

721
00:32:35,057 --> 00:32:37,360
they have the overseas
security Advisory Council

722
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,379
to have those conversations
with a variety of entities

723
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:42,023
to think about that problem.

724
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:45,060
But increasingly,

725
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,870
that's not something
that the US government

726
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:50,719
is even necessarily in
the mix of addressing.

727
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,960
There are certain foreign governments

728
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:55,720
that are attempting to become
more substantially involved

729
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,130
in their information environments.

730
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:00,720
We can look to the
information hygiene efforts

731
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,040
of the Nordic countries for example,

732
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,800
that are looking for these
very strong civic engagement

733
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,350
under their models government.

734
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:09,490
We've seen some efforts
in the European Union

735
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:10,323
to address this.

736
00:33:10,323 --> 00:33:14,640
But there's not as much a role.

737
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,580
Now, of course,

738
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:17,510
when you see some certainly like

739
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:19,200
particularly egregious actions,

740
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,740
I'll call out the Iranian
backed disinformation

741
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:25,670
and propaganda campaigns
targeting specific voters,

742
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,713
specific election,

743
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:30,240
messaging themes and election,

744
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,970
infrastructure, software vendors,

745
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:36,330
during the 2020 federal elections,

746
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:38,939
where they impersonated a
domestic extremist group

747
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:41,710
to threaten officials and voters.

748
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:43,750
That was very clearly
law enforcement response,

749
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:47,360
it was very clearly a government action

750
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,340
that happened with stunning speed.

751
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:53,072
Incredible in the history of attribution.

752
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:54,610
But oftentimes,

753
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:56,250
when you're dealing with these problems

754
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:58,490
as a corporate organization,

755
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:00,149
you're not in the first hours,

756
00:34:00,149 --> 00:34:02,870
going to have strong attribution.

757
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:04,340
Attribution does matter,

758
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:06,590
attribution that will
matter to your C suite,

759
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:08,100
and it will matter to your board.

760
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,918
Even if it doesn't matter
in the immediate response

761
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:13,290
to the first crisis
communications message,

762
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:17,230
the first set of calls
you're going to have to make,

763
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:19,690
it will shape the scope of your response

764
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:21,210
in weeks to months to come,

765
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:23,693
particularly as adversaries
will revisit targets

766
00:34:23,693 --> 00:34:25,493
that are perceived to be vulnerable.

767
00:34:26,929 --> 00:34:28,699
But that's something
that is only developed

768
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:30,409
unfortunately over some time.

769
00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:33,629
Attribution is hypothesis
that you build observables

770
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:37,270
from evidence over that period of time.

771
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:38,103
In many cases,

772
00:34:38,103 --> 00:34:40,510
you're going to have to
be working from playbooks

773
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:44,989
of prior planning that anticipates

774
00:34:44,989 --> 00:34:47,750
areas in which your
company may be entangled in

775
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:49,199
a series of issues.

776
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,639
And as those early conversations

777
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:53,129
around the government affairs groups

778
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:54,429
or with the government affairs group

779
00:34:54,429 --> 00:34:55,909
around those entangled issues

780
00:34:55,909 --> 00:34:58,819
that I think will provide
a natural point of contact

781
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:02,160
in government to help you
find who is the partner

782
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:06,850
to be across that table when
something comes to the fire.

783
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:07,683
- Yeah.

784
00:35:07,683 --> 00:35:09,150
- Todd, I will tell you five years ago,

785
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:11,930
the FBI initiated a program

786
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:13,690
called the private sector
coordinator program.

787
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:17,660
And that was a job that
mandated every FBI field office

788
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:19,060
to have one person designated

789
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:23,410
to be the official liaison
between the Bureau and companies

790
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:24,720
within their (indistinct).

791
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,299
That is an excellent place to start.

792
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:27,150
You can pick up the phone,

793
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:28,860
call your local FBI field
office and say, hey,

794
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:31,000
I need to speak to the
private sector coordinator.

795
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,290
Most of us that work for
four to 500 companies

796
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:36,350
already have a relationship
with that person,

797
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:37,250
with that agent.

798
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:39,120
But if you don't, you can pick
up the phone and call them.

799
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:42,397
And that is a great single
point of contact to start.

800
00:35:42,397 --> 00:35:44,080
- Now, that's great advice.

801
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:47,350
I think, believe it or not,
we've run through our time here,

802
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:48,380
pretty much completely.

803
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:51,060
So lemme give each of you a chance

804
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:53,890
for last thought for the audience,

805
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:55,720
things that they should be thinking about

806
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:58,562
to prepare for the future in the space.

807
00:35:59,728 --> 00:36:02,228
Melissa, why don't we go
ahead and start with you.

808
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:05,880
- Sure, thank you for the opportunity.

809
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,780
It's been a great panel.

810
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:09,530
And I've learned from both
JD and Mark along the way.

811
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:11,900
So I've been taking some notes here.

812
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:15,090
You know, I think it's
important to be pragmatic

813
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:18,310
and think about how
your company is situated

814
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:20,210
how you're personally situated.

815
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:22,731
And think about incremental successes.

816
00:36:22,731 --> 00:36:26,260
This can appear to be
a very, very difficult

817
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,990
and hard problem to solve.

818
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:30,620
And, frankly, there are
areas that are not solvable

819
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:32,288
at this point in time.

820
00:36:32,288 --> 00:36:36,430
Again, we need more of a kind of a united

821
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:38,419
problem solving view on this.

822
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:42,570
So be pragmatic and
incremental in your approach.

823
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:43,403
- Thank you.

824
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,752
JD, last words?

825
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,910
- I've enjoyed the
conversation quite a bit.

826
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:50,560
I'll simply note, for a lot of folks,

827
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,230
this is something that
they're not experiencing

828
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:54,480
as much today.

829
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,547
But as we see it expand among
a variety of adversaries,

830
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:58,860
it's something that
will come to the table.

831
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:03,520
So perhaps it is a matter for
features analytic trade craft,

832
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,340
because the developments
are going to have to react

833
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:07,380
to not necessarily the things
we've been talking about,

834
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:09,144
the examples we've been given.

835
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:11,209
And they're going to
challenge us with a variety

836
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:13,580
and frankly, sometimes the uncertainty

837
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:16,306
as they intermix across
modern popular culture.

838
00:37:16,306 --> 00:37:19,350
And having those conversations
early with the business unit,

839
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:21,759
with the C suite, with your
government counterparts,

840
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,080
I will probably surface some things

841
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,543
that will serve you in
good stead down the road.

842
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:28,743
- Thank you.

843
00:37:28,743 --> 00:37:30,519
Mark, last words.

844
00:37:30,519 --> 00:37:34,350
- Lastly, I'll just echo
what JD and Melissa is,

845
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:35,243
it's about collaboration.

846
00:37:35,244 --> 00:37:36,930
Collaboration within your company,

847
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:39,009
within the different
components of your company,

848
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:42,350
with the Bureau and other
intelligence community partners,

849
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:43,924
and within your industry,

850
00:37:43,924 --> 00:37:46,259
because this problem
isn't getting any better,

851
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:47,400
it's only gonna get worse,

852
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:50,190
as there's more misinformation out there.

853
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:51,540
As you get better at deep fakes.

854
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:54,040
It's going to become a
bigger and bigger problem.

855
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,040
You find that with knowing
what the facts are,

856
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,192
and having those relationships beforehand.

857
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,689
- Now, let me just wrap up by saying

858
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:05,570
I think we've seen this continuing trend

859
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:09,390
of things starting with people
that have a lot of money.

860
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:11,917
And that very rapidly moves down to people

861
00:38:11,917 --> 00:38:15,850
who can copy their
techniques at scale on cheap.

862
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:18,990
We've seen that with
the way cloud services

863
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:22,115
that let the bad guys
various kinds of adversaries

864
00:38:22,115 --> 00:38:23,959
scale their activities.

865
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,770
And I think we'll see that
they learn very quickly

866
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:30,070
how to scale and use
misinformation and disinformation,

867
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:31,899
particularly in for profit ways.

868
00:38:31,899 --> 00:38:34,730
So stay safe out there,

869
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:37,670
keep an eye on all the
things that are happening

870
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:41,127
around your company, your
products and your services.

871
00:38:41,127 --> 00:38:43,410
There's certainly going
to be more to come.

872
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:46,759
Thank you all very much
for your time today.

873
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:49,730
Thank you for sharing your
experiences with our audience

874
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:50,820
and thank you to the audience

875
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:53,197

through the conversation.
