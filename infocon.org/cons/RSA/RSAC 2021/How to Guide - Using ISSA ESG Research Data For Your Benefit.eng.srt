1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:02,530
- Hi, I'm Jon Oltsik.

2
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:04,390
I'm a senior principal analyst

3
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:06,699
and fellow at the
Enterprise Strategy Group.

4
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,510
And I'm honored to have my good friend

5
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:13,360
and colleague, Candy Alexander
joining me, hi, Candy.

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,570
- Hi Jon, and I am of
course, Candy Alexander,

7
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:20,503
International President of the ISSA.

8
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,370
- Great, so we are presenting

9
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:29,610
and this is on the ESG/ISSA research,

10
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:32,810
The Life and Times of
Cybersecurity Professionals.

11
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:34,190
We're not strangers here.

12
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:35,860
We've done this several years in a row,

13
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:39,410
and this is our fifth annual project.

14
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:42,669
This year, we had 489 completed,

15
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:46,940
and these are ISSA
members and ISSA partners.

16
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:48,290
Candy, you'll go into that.

17
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,360
These are security professionals

18
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,950
from all types of organizations;

19
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:56,570
small, medium, and large, international.

20
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:58,630
We don't have the numbers
here, but we will have them

21
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:01,320
in the final report, and we
don't filter by industry.

22
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,110
So we have lots of different
industries represented

23
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:06,370
in the final report.

24
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:10,330
We'll also look at any of the
statistical significant things

25
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:11,929
that we find in different industries.

26
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:14,470
So Candy, what did I miss?

27
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:18,760
- So I just want to extend
a heartfelt thank-you

28
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:23,760
to our partners at ISSA who
helped provide the responses.

29
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:28,410
So those partners are CSA
or Cloud Security Alliance,

30
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:32,170
SANS, IAPP, and the ECC Council.

31
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:33,720
So again, thank you very much

32
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,539
for your help and participation
for it really needs to be

33
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:42,540
a cybersecurity professional
response, so thanks.

34
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,730
- Yeah, I concur, Candy,
we couldn't have done it

35
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,050
without you, thank you so much.

36
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:48,759
It really does make this
a worthwhile project

37
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,203
to have your participation.

38
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:54,333
So here is the RSA equation,

39
00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:00,170
and our intent is to educate our audience.

40
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,950
We hope that you can learn
from what we're doing,

41
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:06,650
and we really hope that
you can take this data,

42
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:09,610
which we really have a lot of pride in

43
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:13,170
and apply it to your personal career.

44
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:16,480
And so let me go into
that more specifically,

45
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,030
how can you apply this research?

46
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:21,380
So if you're a cybersecurity professional,

47
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:24,299
you're getting feedback on
what your peers are thinking.

48
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,020
So compare where you are

49
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,920
to where they are and then
assess your opportunities,

50
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,450
and where do you need to spend some time?

51
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:33,380
Where are you doing very well?

52
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:36,560
What insights can you
gather from your peers?

53
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,950
If you're senior executives,

54
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:42,899
you get to understand what the
mindset is of your employees.

55
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,870
So kind of what are they thinking of?

56
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,730
How satisfied are they with their career?

57
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:48,109
Where are they struggling?

58
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,450
Where do they need help?

59
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:53,440
And really important for cybersecurity is

60
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,900
how can you retain them?

61
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,300
How can you make them happy?

62
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,620
And then if you're a cybersecurity vendor,

63
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,860
these are your customers speaking.

64
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,990
Your customers are going
through a lot of stress.

65
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:06,750
It's a stressful, stressful job.

66
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:11,650
So how can this data help
you relate better to them?

67
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,530
And if you can relate better to them,

68
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:16,590
you can probably build
better relationships.

69
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,710
So Candy, what's your thought here?

70
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:23,380
- So my little add to this
is that if you are, you know,

71
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:26,730
either a cyber professional
individual contributor

72
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:29,579
or a manager in an organization,

73
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,850
look for the golden nuggets
'cause they are in here

74
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:37,850
as to help providing
justification back to either HR

75
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:42,300
or business executives or
management for justification,

76
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:46,860
for either additional
training dollars or resources.

77
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,470
So we will attempt to offer those pointers

78
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:53,510
as we go through this presentation.

79
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:58,510
- Good point, okay. So
let's get into the research.

80
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:01,050
This was a new question for this year.

81
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:04,310
It was really driven by a focus
group that Candy and I did

82
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,970
with five different
cybersecurity professionals

83
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:09,210
at all levels of their careers.

84
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:11,280
So we wanted to understand how they found

85
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,040
their current jobs.

86
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,340
And what you see on the
right side of this is

87
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:19,779
kind of old school job
hopping kind of stuff,

88
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:23,250
where either I found a job that was posted

89
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,200
by the organization, or I was
contacted by the recruiter.

90
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,830
The key takeaway to me,
Candy, is that high percentage

91
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:32,080
of people, the biggest percentage said

92
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,479
it's networking with industry contacts.

93
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:38,160
Now, if I'm an entry-level
person that's not possible.

94
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,930
But once I've established myself,

95
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:43,180
I am going to go and look
for those opportunities

96
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,330
where I've worked with people I know,

97
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:46,780
I work with people I like,

98
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:49,090
I work with people I can learn from.

99
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:52,260
And this is a bit self-serving
because networking

100
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:55,320
with industry context
is what you do at ISSA,

101
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,270
but it's clearly working, Candy.

102
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,390
- It is, it is.

103
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:01,400
And you know, I would
counter that point that,

104
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,500
yes, it's difficult for entry-level,

105
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,370
but there's no reason why they can't.

106
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:08,530
You know, get involved in
your local communities.

107
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:11,159
There's tons of meetups, security meetups.

108
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:16,160
Go to an ISSA chapter meeting
locally or now virtually

109
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,970
and/or get involved in any

110
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:22,370
of these professional
organizations like CSA, OWASP.

111
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:26,710
I mean, it's just amazing how
many resources are out there.

112
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:29,430
Start talking to people.

113
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:32,120
- And Candy, with ISSA,
you have special programs

114
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,660
for entry-level people
and people who are trying

115
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,410
to get into their careers, correct?

116
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:39,090
- Absolutely, if there's
anything that I hear

117
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:43,200
as a common message
throughout ISSA memberships is

118
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,360
that I as the same
members want to give back

119
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,060
to the profession, and
that means help grow

120
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,380
the next generation coming in.

121
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:54,230
So you know, if you are
an entry-level person,

122
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:57,400
not yet in the profession,
start talking to folks,

123
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,912
they want to help you.

124
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,832
- That's a wonderful message
from ISSA to the community.

125
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:08,290
In this one, this is a
repeat from last year,

126
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:10,490
but it's really important
to hammer this home.

127
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:15,200
So we asked these 400-plus
cybersecurity professionals,

128
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,159
how long does it take
to become proficient?

129
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,890
And what you see here is
that the bulk of people

130
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:26,270
that we surveyed think it's
somewhere between two years

131
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:28,419
and five years.

132
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:32,000
So it's a lifelong commitment.

133
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,580
It's a lifelong profession.

134
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:36,409
And Candy, I is acquainted
with being a physician.

135
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:39,470
If you become a physician,
you've gone to medical school,

136
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:41,260
that doesn't stop your education,

137
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:43,150
you have to continually keep up

138
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:47,330
with different medical
innovations, different research.

139
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:49,580
And it's the same for cybersecurity.

140
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:52,300
- Absolutely, if not
more so, because I mean,

141
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,390
you look at our world today,

142
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:55,490
everything's based on technology.

143
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:58,450
And you know, years ago when
I first got into technology,

144
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:02,159
I was told technology back in the 1800,

145
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,520
even first part of the 1900s,

146
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:08,640
they changed every 50 years,
technology innovations.

147
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,310
You look at what's happening today.

148
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:14,100
It's changing yearly,
monthly, it's just insane.

149
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,620
And everything we do in the cyber,

150
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:21,100
you know, realm is, you know,
to support that technology.

151
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,180
So how else can we keep up

152
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,100
with what's going on in technology

153
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:28,400
if we aren't constantly
learning, and you know,

154
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,750
we're not even talking about mastering.

155
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,900
So you know, when we look at this slide,

156
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:36,299
it's really important to
understand as you mentioned,

157
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,070
this is a lifelong investment.

158
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:42,200
And that's why when we talk
to cyber professionals,

159
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,719
they are all passionate about learning.

160
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,800
And that's what we need,
is to continuously learn.

161
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,010
It doesn't happen overnight.

162
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:52,143
- No, it does not.

163
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:56,049
So this is new and this
is really important.

164
00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:00,230
So we asked again, our panel,
what advice would you give

165
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:03,920
to someone who's interested
in getting into cybersecurity?

166
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,450
And I'll just focus on a couple of things.

167
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:06,860
So get a basic.

168
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:09,170
And the key is basic certification.

169
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:12,040
So get a baseline that
will be requirement.

170
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,810
Don't dwell on certifications,
which we'll talk about,

171
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:16,720
but get a basic certification.

172
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,970
Once again, join a professional
industry organization,

173
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:24,600
network with your peers,
and then find a mentor.

174
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:29,000
So this has been key in my
career in different roles,

175
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,230
but find a mentor, just
track your progress.

176
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:35,380
People are there to help, Candy.

177
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,900
- Absolutely, and you
know, I'll say something.

178
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,140
And for those of you,
who've seen me speak before

179
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,330
on this topic, don't get caught

180
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:44,550
into that certification game.

181
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,199
You know, again, the whole key is

182
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,620
basic cybersecurity certifications.

183
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:52,720
There are five that our
members constantly say are

184
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,375
the top ones to go for
that are more vlauable,

185
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:58,875
that's CISSP, CISM, CISA, CompTIA A+,

186
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,350
and Certified Ethical Hacker.

187
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:07,600
So you know, to help you decide
which route you want to go,

188
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,140
get somebody, you know, who's
already in a profession.

189
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:14,180
And as Jon mentioned,
you know, find a mentor.

190
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:16,420
And it's not just one mentor, by the way.

191
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:20,490
I have many mentors,
according to what my need is

192
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:23,070
for information or knowledge or learning.

193
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:25,680
So you know, don't get
stuck on the traditional,

194
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,089
you know, "You want to be my mentor,"

195
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:28,940
'cause that doesn't work.

196
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:31,680
Look at the diversity
of the knowledge we need

197
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,810
and then the diversity of mentorship

198
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:35,453
to happen to accomplish that.

199
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,860
- Good points, and Candy, I know this is

200
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,630
really important to you.

201
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,660
Again, this is something
we've looked at in the past,

202
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,150
but go ahead.

203
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:49,020
- So again, certifications
versus hand-on experience.

204
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:52,140
It's really important to understand

205
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:55,569
the whole purpose of the
certifications in the first place.

206
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:58,800
The whole reason why they
were developed many years ago,

207
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,963
starting with the most notable one, (ISC)²

208
00:10:01,963 --> 00:10:06,963
and the CSSP is we as a
profession, had really no way

209
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:11,719
of articulating what that we
have a baseline of knowledge,

210
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,880
or what that, you know,
baseline of knowledge is.

211
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,060
So the certifications began with that.

212
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,439
It's a means to articulate

213
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:24,180
our starting point of what our
experience and knowledge are,

214
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:27,750
but the key is their
experience and knowledge.

215
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:32,730
So you know, again,
really, I caution folks,

216
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:35,030
don't go after every
certification out there,

217
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:37,040
because that's not going to help you.

218
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,500
You know, you can see
here through our data

219
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,990
that it is experience,

220
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:45,170
in conjunction with that certification,

221
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:47,240
that's going to give you what you need.

222
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,993
So they really are hand in hand.

223
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:54,950
- Good point, this is an important slide.

224
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:56,950
And this is the first
time we've done this.

225
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:58,730
And next year, I think we'll go deeper.

226
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:01,300
But we wanted to
understand the relationship

227
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,089
between security teams and other teams,

228
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:08,550
other functional groups
within organizations.

229
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:09,750
Security is a team sport.

230
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,090
So this is really important

231
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:13,670
on how these organizations collaborate.

232
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:16,430
Now we'll go a little bit
deeper into the IT relationship

233
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:18,229
and the business relationship,

234
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:20,080
but a couple of things stand out,

235
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:23,960
the fair or poor relationships
with people like the board

236
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,960
or groups like the board of directors, HR,

237
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,523
lines of business.

238
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:32,760
Security needs to be embedded
into the organization.

239
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,880
We need a culture of cybersecurity.

240
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,110
That means the business
has to meet us halfway,

241
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:41,662
but that means that security
needs to be proactive, Candy.

242
00:11:41,662 --> 00:11:45,810
- Absolutely, this has been
(laughing) my soapbox item

243
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:46,880
of this past year.

244
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,980
You know, oftentimes,

245
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:52,160
we talk about we need
to support the business,

246
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,839
we, security folks.

247
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:57,280
So we wanna teach them about security.

248
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:02,010
Do we really want our CEOs to
come to a security conference?

249
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:04,840
Do we really want them to understand

250
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,120
the ins and outs of security?

251
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,850
I would argue not.

252
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:11,120
We want them to run the business,

253
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,830
but we want to be able to have

254
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:17,140
that knowledge-based discussion with them

255
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:21,460
as to what's the business and
how can we best support that?

256
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:26,460
When we look at this data, we
can most certainly identify

257
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:30,020
those target groups that
I would suggest we go

258
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,750
and have a conversation with,

259
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,470
and the conversation isn't in regards

260
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:37,550
to educating them about security.

261
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:40,109
The conversation is us getting educated

262
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:42,640
as to what their business is.

263
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,810
For when we have that conversation, we,

264
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:48,939
as the cybersecurity professionals
are able to articulate

265
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:53,600
or understand the business risk, and then,

266
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,600
we are able to mitigate that
risk through security measures.

267
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,717
So you know, when we walk in and say,

268
00:13:00,717 --> 00:13:04,210
"Well, we need to, you know,
comply with X, Y, or Z,"

269
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:06,300
that's the wrong conversation.

270
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:09,120
We need to understand the business,

271
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,060
so we can understand the risk

272
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:14,959
and then propose the mitigation
through security controls.

273
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,200
So this is your target list.

274
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,033
This is the target list of
who you wanna talk with.

275
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,439
- Well said, Candy, I
mean, it's understanding

276
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,330
the business process,
what data is being used.

277
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:30,170
And like you said, the threat models.

278
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:31,923
- Yes, absolutely, Jon.

279
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:37,199
- So now this year, we were
very cognizant of getting,

280
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,200
not just understanding the problems,

281
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,320
but proposing some solutions.

282
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:45,600
So we asked our panel of
cybersecurity professionals,

283
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,890
what advice would you
give your organization

284
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:52,439
to improve the relationship
between cybersecurity and IT?

285
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,200
And this is the data that you see.

286
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,400
And there's a couple
of themes here, Candy,

287
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:01,400
without even going into the
data, it's mood shift-left.

288
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,849
So get security involved
earlier in the process.

289
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:08,323
And then it's cross-functionality,
if there's such a word.

290
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:12,069
The IT people need to understand security.

291
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:14,540
The security people need to understand IT.

292
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:17,449
They need to work together
as a team with common goals

293
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:21,460
and common metrics,
not against each other.

294
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,890
- Right, and it goes back to the age-old,

295
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:27,520
you know, statement.

296
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:31,180
It's more expensive to bolt
security on the beginning.

297
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,770
I mean, we've all heard that.

298
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:35,189
But, you know, what does that really mean?

299
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:37,170
And it does mean shift-left.

300
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:40,209
When you look at the different
models that are out there

301
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:43,184
from a security maturity perspective,

302
00:14:43,184 --> 00:14:46,860
it all states bring us in security,

303
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,630
that is, in at the beginning,

304
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:51,390
when you're doing your
requirements, you know,

305
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,840
collection and things like that.

306
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:56,880
So you know, often in
the past couple of years,

307
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,330
we've heard the whole thing about DevOps.

308
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:01,163
What is DevOps?

309
00:15:01,163 --> 00:15:04,730
That's the combination and expediting

310
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:07,200
of development into operations.

311
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,460
So they've, you know, shortened that cycle

312
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:12,070
from an agility perspective.

313
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:15,470
We need to do the same thing
from a security perspective.

314
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:18,709
So just as they shorten the DevOps,

315
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,400
you know, to combine those,

316
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,180
we need to really incorporate security

317
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:25,030
into that same mentality.

318
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:29,920
And very much though, from the
cross-functional perspective,

319
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,920
where, you know, you have,
development, you have operations.

320
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:38,130
But also look at it from
a quality perspective.

321
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:41,970
We don't look at quality enough,
and one could really argue

322
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:46,720
that security is very much
a component of quality.

323
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,170
So you know, again, when
we look at making sure,

324
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:54,430
if you will, that all
of the bases are covered

325
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:56,800
from an IT project perspective,

326
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,780
why wouldn't you incorporate
security into that?

327
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:02,980
Because again, when we
talked about understanding

328
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:06,040
the business and understanding the risks,

329
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,699
this is where we're going to mitigate them

330
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:12,490
through cybersecurity and
cybersecurity controls.

331
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:15,710
And that really needs to
be in partnership with IT.

332
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:20,710
So the need for a paradigm shift,

333
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:25,100
if I might use another cliche,
is at the utmost right now.

334
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:28,750
We need to put behind us
the us-versus-them mentality

335
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,200
and look at it as a cross-functional team.

336
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,923
We each have a part to play.

337
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:38,650
- Very true, and that rings
true too when we look at it,

338
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:41,199
look at this slide, Advice
for Improving the Relationship

339
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,000
with Business Management.

340
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,470
Once again, 41% encouraging
cybersecurity participation

341
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:50,570
in all business planning and strategy.

342
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:52,020
There's a typo there, but it should say

343
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:54,860
in all business planning and strategy.

344
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:57,800
And again, it's that shifting left.

345
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,109
The more we understand
about the business planning

346
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:02,370
and strategy, the more that we understand

347
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:05,119
about who's touching the
data or who needs access

348
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,639
to an application.

349
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,020
Is there sensitive data involved?

350
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:12,000
Are we moving that
sensitive data to someplace

351
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,880
where we don't have control of it?

352
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,160
Are we using cloud, are we using SaaS?

353
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,490
So the more we know upfront,

354
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:20,770
the better we can put
together these models,

355
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:25,160
the better cross-functional
processes we can define.

356
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:28,280
- Right, yeah, when we
talk about threat modeling,

357
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:32,840
we have one perception
as a security profession.

358
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,189
But let's really, you know,

359
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:37,700
understand that we need
to understand the business

360
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:41,510
so we can create those threat
models for the business,

361
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:45,620
and then go back and say, "Okay,
you know, business owners,

362
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:50,620
do you really want to expand
into say, for example, Russia

363
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,390
as a business model?"

364
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:54,560
Yes, they might be,
you know, a high demand

365
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,210
for the product service,

366
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:59,800
but let's look at the
pros and cons of that.

367
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:04,210
So again, not using security
terminology, if you notice,

368
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:08,040
but you using common lay
people's terminology.

369
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,820
What are the pros and
cons of going to Russia?

370
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:14,710
And then you lay them out
and of course, put forth

371
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:17,123
the security controls and costs.

372
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:21,450
- Yeah, time is flying by here, Candy.

373
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:24,830
So let's go on to the next slide, so...

374
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:27,990
And this is data that
we've seen year after year.

375
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:31,470
And I called it a
cybersecurity training paradox.

376
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:35,700
91% agree that cybersecurity
professionals must keep up

377
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:39,830
with their skills or their
organizations at a disadvantage.

378
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:43,887
So 91%, but 59% agree,

379
00:18:43,887 --> 00:18:47,210
"While I try to keep up on
my cybersecurity skills,

380
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:50,910
it's hard to do so given
the demands of my job."

381
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:52,390
That's the paradox.

382
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:54,610
Candy, how the heck do we handle that?

383
00:18:55,463 --> 00:18:59,159
- So at the beginning of our
session here, we talked about,

384
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,700
you know, we'll point
out the golden nuggets

385
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,400
to use for justification.

386
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,950
So golden nugget alert here it is, guys,

387
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:07,610
take this slide, take this data,

388
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:10,327
use this for justification
for your training

389
00:19:10,327 --> 00:19:12,123
and/or additional resources.

390
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,040
- Very true and understand
that your people are

391
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,389
under a lot of pressure,
they've got a lot of work,

392
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:19,770
and you have to appreciate

393
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:22,950
that they have to have
time too for training.

394
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:23,783
- Yup.

395
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:28,929
- So this is another one we
asked for the first time.

396
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:32,680
It's basically a best
practice that you get 40 hours

397
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,550
of training per year as a
cybersecurity professional.

398
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:39,340
We wanted to see how people
were doing versus that 40%.

399
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:42,080
And I think there's good
news and bad news here.

400
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,770
So there is good news.

401
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:47,710
At 54% say, "I've had more
than 40 hours of training."

402
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:51,410
24% said, "I've had about 40 hours."

403
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:53,660
But a pretty significant percent say

404
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:58,010
that they haven't had
40 hours of training.

405
00:19:58,010 --> 00:19:59,830
So that's concerning to me.

406
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:02,169
And then the other thing
is let's define training.

407
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:06,220
I mean, if you are
watching videos or webinars

408
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:09,240
for CPE credit, okay, we understand

409
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,750
that you need CPE credit,
but that's not training.

410
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:14,740
This is all about really
understanding your craft,

411
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,330
improving your craft.

412
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:19,409
So I think it's important for
cybersecurity professionals

413
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:22,440
to ask themselves that question, Candy.

414
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,590
- Absolutely, I'll just say, you know,

415
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:29,220
be aware of the infomercial
that we have now adopted

416
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:33,260
with this whole new
COVID-19 pandemic world,

417
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:36,700
just really pick and choose
as to what do you get?

418
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,030
What's your value?

419
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:40,600
If it's more than a CPE, do it.

420
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,409
Because otherwise, sure, put on, you know,

421
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:45,130
that in the background
while you're having lunch,

422
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:47,913
but you know, really look at the value.

423
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,160
- It's true, I mean, it's your career.

424
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:56,160
And to that point, we asked the
21% who didn't have 40 hours

425
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:59,010
of training why?

426
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:00,100
What are the reasons why?

427
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:04,550
And it comes down to not
surprisingly time and money.

428
00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:09,480
So time, 33%, one third said,
"I don't have enough time."

429
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,080
Well, you have to make the time.

430
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,030
And as an employer, as a manager,

431
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:16,070
you have to make sure your
employees have the time,

432
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:19,149
or you can find the time
because their training,

433
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:23,100
their skill development
is equated to your risk

434
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,919
and the risk of your business,
so that's really important.

435
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,410
And then money.

436
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:30,070
Some people say, "Well, my
organization doesn't pay for it.

437
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:31,270
So I can't do it."

438
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:35,379
And certainly, as an employer,
you have to internalize that

439
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,910
and understand whether you can fund

440
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:40,230
or change compensation models to fund it.

441
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:42,280
But also as a cybersecurity professional,

442
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,580
you have to invest in your career.

443
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,300
So sometimes it will cost you,

444
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:50,240
but an investment will pay
ROI dividends over time

445
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,930
because you'll become better,
you'll be more in demand.

446
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:55,720
You'll make more money, Candy.

447
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:59,083
- I agree, and I mean, you
said it all, nothing to add.

448
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:03,033
- Sometimes I do that,
not often, but sometimes.

449
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:07,730
So we're gonna shift over

450
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:09,730
to the cybersecurity skills shortage.

451
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:12,430
So this is a topic
we've covered for years,

452
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:17,430
and Candy, disappointing, 57% still say

453
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,170
that they've been impacted
by the skills shortage.

454
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:23,030
I don't really understand
the 10% who don't know.

455
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:24,610
Maybe they're small organizations,

456
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:28,219
maybe they have multiple
jobs, but once again,

457
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:30,670
more than 50% have been impacted

458
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:33,030
by the cybersecurity skills shortage.

459
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:34,930
Those people who have been impacted,

460
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:37,740
we asked them, what's the impact?

461
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:40,630
And there's always

462
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:43,953
this kind of same things
every year, Candy.

463
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:46,139
But this year it's more pronounced.

464
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:49,760
So 62% said there's an increasing workload

465
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,310
on existing staff,

466
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:56,310
and that's been exacerbated
by COVID, by work-from-home.

467
00:22:56,410 --> 00:23:01,340
So that's concerning to
me, if I'm CSO, as you are,

468
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,939
that's concerning to me
because you can't just pile

469
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:08,120
more work onto people and
expect quality work in return.

470
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,209
The other thing that's
really important here is

471
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:13,760
the percentage of people saying
there's a high burnout rate

472
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,860
or attrition rate for the
cybersecurity staff, 38%.

473
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:20,159
So we're piling more work on people

474
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,000
and they're burning out, Candy.

475
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,640
That can't be a good recipe for success.

476
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,810
- Absolutely not, and yeah, I
think this is just the sign,

477
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:31,340
we really have not identified the solution

478
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,760
and we need to keep working it.

479
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,290
And again, just to emphasize,

480
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:38,280
if your organization is not doing for you,

481
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,730
you need to do for yourself.

482
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:43,960
So go get that skill that you need.

483
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,190
And you know, keep pushing back.

484
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:49,653
Use this information to
get additional resources.

485
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:53,090
- Yeah, again, and if you're a manager,

486
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:54,730
this is what your people
are going through.

487
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:58,110
So how how can you rectify that situation?

488
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:59,260
How can you address it?

489
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:05,210
Has the skills shortage
gotten worse, Candy?

490
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:07,363
44% say yes.

491
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:11,310
And probably the most
meaningful statistic on this is

492
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:16,310
that only 5% say has improved
over the past few years.

493
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:21,670
So there is no cavalry
riding up to save us.

494
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:25,730
There won't be any massive influx

495
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:29,780
of highly skilled
professionals that we can hire.

496
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:32,550
And again, Candy, you
always remind me of this,

497
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:34,770
is the skills shortage
isn't just about staffing.

498
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:36,770
It's about skills.

499
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:39,660
So if the skills shortage has gotten worse

500
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:44,490
over the past few years, you're
probably less able to defend

501
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:46,800
the company to recognize threats

502
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,000
than you were a few years ago.

503
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
- Right, absolutely, and you know,

504
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,810
the thing that, it's
exasperating to me is that

505
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:57,179
it's been getting worse
over the past few years.

506
00:24:57,180 --> 00:25:01,070
And now if we're looking at
this data, since the past year,

507
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:06,020
and it's gotten even worser,
(laughing) then, you know,

508
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:09,590
we need to find a solution, so yeah.

509
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:14,840
- And again, you can't hope

510
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:17,169
that some external force
is going to come in.

511
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:18,840
You have to take this on yourself.

512
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,673
- Yep.

513
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,110
- So the biggest factors,

514
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:26,709
this is from a cybersecurity
professionals perspective.

515
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:29,040
What are the biggest factors contributing

516
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,139
to the skills shortage?

517
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:34,040
My organization doesn't offer
competitive compensation.

518
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:37,129
Well, in a seller's market,

519
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:38,770
that's gonna kill you every time.

520
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:41,950
So you really can't be cheap here.

521
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:46,500
You have to be able to hire
people at a compensation level.

522
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:50,060
That's commensurate with what
everybody else is paying.

523
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:51,790
That's the reality of it.

524
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:53,220
But there's a couple of other things

525
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,990
that are much more interesting to me,

526
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:57,070
because money is always a concern.

527
00:25:57,070 --> 00:26:01,290
So the HR department at my
organization doesn't understand

528
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:03,070
the skills needed.

529
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:04,540
Well, there's a disconnect there.

530
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:07,540
That means the HR department
isn't recruiting well.

531
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,040
And it means that there's a disconnect

532
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,853
between cybersecurity and HR.

533
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:15,600
My organization's not in
an attractive industry

534
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,580
for cybersecurity professionals.

535
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,490
Well, what can you do to overcome that,

536
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:23,060
become a cybersecurity center
of excellence, perhaps,

537
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,960
so that maybe you're not
in the right industry,

538
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,760
but you're offering the right things

539
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:29,110
for a cybersecurity professional career?

540
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:33,370
And then this one kills me,
job postings are unrealistic.

541
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:36,620
And this is what we hear, Candy,
from entry-level people is

542
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:38,800
there's an entry-level job posted,

543
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,840
but it requires three years of experience.

544
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,350
A CISSP, maybe other certifications,

545
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:45,822
just a disconnect there too.

546
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,460
- Absolutely, when I look at this data,

547
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:53,313
this very much is a link to
the previous, how, you know,

548
00:26:54,255 --> 00:26:56,500
it's gotten worse over the past year.

549
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:59,610
So here's my take in my read on this.

550
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:04,129
HR, you're right, they
don't understand what we do.

551
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:07,160
Neither does the business,
because often times,

552
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,247
it is the business that says to HR,

553
00:27:09,247 --> 00:27:11,730
"We need to get a security person."

554
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:14,660
So HR says, "Okay, you
know, what do you need?"

555
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:17,830
And it's all compliance-driven, right?

556
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:22,350
So again, collectively
who are in the profession,

557
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:26,870
we need to educate the business
of as to what our job is,

558
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:28,030
what is our job?

559
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:33,030
Our job is to understand
the risk of the business

560
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,520
and offer mitigation strategies,

561
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:39,129
and then oversee those
mitigation strategies

562
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:41,130
through security controls.

563
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:44,080
That includes, you know, compliance.

564
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:49,080
So you know you can look at
those last three data points

565
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,570
and equate it to that.

566
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:54,879
This is our failure, as
a collective profession,

567
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:59,880
to not have educated the
business as to what it is we do.

568
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:02,800
And therefore they don't invest in us.

569
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,740
They pick the wrong, you
know, job descriptions.

570
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:09,520
They pick bad after bad, they
pick, you know, a resume,

571
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,690
I'm sorry, a job
description on the internet

572
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,580
that has absolutely nothing to do

573
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:16,250
with what they really want
or what they really need,

574
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:17,500
but they post it anyways,

575
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,590
because that's what, fill in the blank.

576
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:22,850
Acme Medical you wanted, or
Acme Manufacturer you wanted.

577
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:24,760
So they must know what
they're talking about.

578
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:27,823
So with bad chasing bad,
we need to stop that cycle.

579
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,950
- Yeah, and the other thing
that you always remind me of is

580
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:32,570
that people need to be more creative,

581
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:35,020
not just look for IT professionals

582
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:38,450
or cybersecurity
professionals, changing jobs.

583
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:41,060
Look outside, or think outside the box.

584
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,639
- Yeah.

585
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,970
- So are organizations
taking the necessary actions

586
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:50,250
to address the impact of the
cybersecurity skills shortage?

587
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:52,010
Candy, Candy, Candy, Candy,

588
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:55,700
59% said, "My organization
could be doing much more

589
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:58,870
or my organization should
be doing somewhat more."

590
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:00,989
So let's hold that thought because

591
00:29:02,747 --> 00:29:06,170
I've got one slide and then
we'll address that specifically.

592
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:09,110
But here are the areas, the acute areas

593
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:11,303
of cybersecurity skills shortages.

594
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:15,410
And Candy, we always see the big three,

595
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:18,330
cloud computing security,
security analytics,

596
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:20,429
and our analysis and investigations

597
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:22,000
and application security.

598
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,360
And just given what's
happened in the last year,

599
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:27,790
work-from-home, that accelerated
a lot of cloud initiatives,

600
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:30,149
digital transformation initiatives.

601
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:33,270
Cloud security came out on
top, but all three of those are

602
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:35,480
just acute shortages.

603
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,313
- Right.

604
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:45,000
- Okay, now back to my
organization isn't doing enough.

605
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,840
So we asked people, "What
could your organization do?"

606
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,280
And there's some suggestions here.

607
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:56,610
So increase the commitment
to cybersecurity training.

608
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:58,560
Candy, we've been dwelling on this,

609
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:02,700
that it's a lifelong pursuit
that organizations need

610
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:06,660
to be sensitive to the training
needs of their employees,

611
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:11,100
and then employees need to
really jump on training.

612
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:14,850
So this is one thing you can
do, is increase your training.

613
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:19,389
Increase compensation, we
talked about provide incentives

614
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:22,230
for certifications and
participation in industry events.

615
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:25,640
You want well-rounded
security professionals.

616
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,810
And then I'll just stop at this one,

617
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:32,060
but create or improve a
cybersecurity internship program.

618
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:33,840
You know, from the ISSA perspective,

619
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,899
there just aren't enough
internship programs.

620
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,540
Now, if you bring in interns,

621
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,800
let's say you bring in summer interns,

622
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,659
they'll turn into full-time
employees if they're good.

623
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:46,200
So it becomes a pipeline for you.

624
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,220
Now, of course, you have to train,

625
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:51,430
you have to dedicate resources
to training junior people,

626
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:56,430
but that creates again an influx of talent

627
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:59,223
that you can then train
and hopefully retain.

628
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:03,260
- Right, so I think when
I look at this slide,

629
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:07,730
what it says to me is that
businesses and organizations are

630
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:12,730
just not investing
properly or appropriately

631
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:16,949
into the cybersecurity
department, if you will.

632
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:18,580
So you know, that means training.

633
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:23,580
That means, you know,
compensation, the feeling of value.

634
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:29,250
So we're talking about
basic investment decisions.

635
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:32,480
So taking the time to really
look at the compensation,

636
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,820
to look at the value add,
and it really comes down to,

637
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:40,780
in my opinion, the lack of investment.

638
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:45,129
You know, we talked
offline about organizations

639
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:48,330
really are hesitant, and
providing that investment

640
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:50,620
of training and compensation

641
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:53,763
and you know, instilling loyalty.

642
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:57,919
- That's very true.

643
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:01,470
- The staff are going to
jump-shift as soon as they get,

644
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:04,350
you know, whatever training
they need or whatever.

645
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:08,340
But I think we really need
to stop that cycle as well,

646
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:13,100
and realize that, you know,
loyalty is based on investment.

647
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:16,590
If I feel valued, then I'm going to,

648
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:18,939
you know, do anything I can from my boss

649
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:20,810
because they appreciate me.

650
00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:24,159
So it really needs to,
you know, be broken down

651
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:27,340
into the very simple perspective

652
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:30,060
of investment builds loyalty.

653
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:33,822
Loyalty builds good skilled people.

654
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:38,990
- So true, okay, we've got
a couple of slides left.

655
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,720
And I know we're getting short on time.

656
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,710
So is the cybersecurity
shortage overstated?

657
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:45,220
Candy, I put this one in this year

658
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,720
because every time I write

659
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,590
about the cybersecurity skills shortage,

660
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:53,236
I get feedback from cybersecurity
professionals who say,

661
00:32:53,237 --> 00:32:55,020
"There's plenty of people out there.

662
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:59,200
We just don't write job
requirements or requisitions well,

663
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,890
or we don't recruit well."

664
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:05,180
And I would say what this
data has as told me, Candy,

665
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:08,430
is that both things can be true.

666
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:12,380
There is a pretty acute
cybersecurity skills shortage,

667
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:15,720
but at the same time, we're not
managing it or addressing it

668
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,892
as well as we could
creating those problems.

669
00:33:18,892 --> 00:33:21,590
So yeah, some people
think it's overstated.

670
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:24,629
Most think that the amount of discussion

671
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:26,540
about it's about right.

672
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:29,899
- I agree, yeah, it's-

673
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:34,560
- Okay, and this kind of reinforces that.

674
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:38,320
So how difficult is it to
recruit new cybersecurity staff?

675
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:41,360
76% say it's either extremely difficult

676
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,540
or somewhat difficult.

677
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:46,060
So again, people aren't just popping in

678
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:48,490
and with the right skill sets,

679
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:50,380
you have to put the work in to find them,

680
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:55,090
and that costs money, and
this reinforces that, Candy.

681
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:57,449
- Absolutely, I have nothing to add,

682
00:33:57,450 --> 00:33:59,270
but let's take a look at your next slide,

683
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:02,700
because I think that's going
to give us an idea of why.

684
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,520
Why recruiting is hard.

685
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:09,210
- Okay, good point, so
where is it challenging?

686
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:10,530
Who is it challenging to find?

687
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:12,250
Now, remember we said

688
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:14,730
that it takes between two
and five years to become

689
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:17,570
a proficient cybersecurity professional.

690
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:19,929
Guess what, big surprise, Candy.

691
00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:23,210
Those are the people that are
really difficult to recruit.

692
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:27,250
71% said, "Those are the
difficult people to recruit."

693
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:30,469
- Right, and again, this
goes back to bad chasing bad.

694
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:34,029
I mean, how can we get
people with experience

695
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:37,230
if our entry-level jobs require three

696
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:38,719
to five years experience?

697
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:42,429
I mean, that is so
ridiculous of a statement.

698
00:34:42,429 --> 00:34:45,379
So we really need to
look at how we are going

699
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:48,469
to get folks that experience.

700
00:34:48,469 --> 00:34:51,230
There's been lots of,
you know, ideas shared

701
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:53,230
in regards to that internship.

702
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:56,020
You know, getting folks to volunteer,

703
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:59,300
to do security projects
through organizations

704
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:03,740
such as CSA, ISSA, and you
know, fill in the blank.

705
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:06,189
So just because you can't get paid for it

706
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:09,790
or just because you can't make $100,000

707
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:13,910
as an entry-level person,
is no reason to be deterred.

708
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:16,879
Go, if this is what you
want, come after it.

709
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,070
It's well worth it,

710
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:23,070
because you will fall into
that, 71% box really quickly.

711
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:26,419
- Yeah, and two quick
things for me, Candy.

712
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:30,650
Once again, this reinforces
that the more you put

713
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:32,970
into your career, the more
you'll get out of your career,

714
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:35,839
because as you increase your skill set,

715
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,570
increase your experience,
you're more in demand,

716
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:39,960
so you can make the money.

717
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,490
So don't think about money upfront.

718
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:42,919
You'll make it over time.

719
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:45,480
And the second thing is if I'm a CISO,

720
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,550
retention, retention, retention.

721
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:49,950
What can I do to retain my staff?

722
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:51,919
Because they're in high demand.

723
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,760
So if I'm not doing that,
someone else is gonna grab them.

724
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:58,000
And we know that from other
research in this project.

725
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,000
So onto the last slide, this
is really just wrapping up

726
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:04,410
and repeating what we talked about.

727
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:06,203
There's organizational friction.

728
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:10,250
So we have to get the cybersecurity
team involved with IT,

729
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:12,830
with the business, with HR, with legal,

730
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:16,290
much sooner and much
more, what did we say?

731
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:19,670
Cross-functionally; the training deficit.

732
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:24,206
We just dwelled on this
because it's really a problem.

733
00:36:24,206 --> 00:36:26,420
And it's sort of a foundational thing.

734
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:29,200
So CISOs, are you allocating enough time

735
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,580
and money to training?

736
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:33,220
As Candy so aptly put it,

737
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:37,180
you use this data to justify
more budget for training

738
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:40,770
because your staffers are
crying out for more training,

739
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:44,250
and you have higher risk
if you don't train them.

740
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:47,860
And the cybersecurity,
shortage skills shortage

741
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:50,690
is not an illusion.

742
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:52,840
There are some aspects
we're not managing well,

743
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,950
but it's real, it's impactful.

744
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:57,740
And so you have to look
at the data we presented,

745
00:36:57,740 --> 00:37:01,303
assess where you're bad, or
where you're not up to speed.

746
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:03,700
And then, like we said,

747
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:06,640
the cavalry isn't coming, what can you do?

748
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,460
And the one other point I'll make,

749
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,110
I'm stealing Candy's point.

750
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:12,820
It's not just about
staffing, it's about skills.

751
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:14,410
And that's a relationship

752
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:17,549
between the skills shortage and training.

753
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:18,963
So Candy close this out.

754
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:22,270
- I think you said it
all, great summation.

755
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:27,090
And I think, again, it's all
up to you, the professional.

756
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:30,910
Get assistance, get guidance, join ISSA,

757
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:34,290
come to a meeting, go to OWASP, go to CSA.

758
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:38,029
There are great professional
organizations out there.

759
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:38,980
You're not alone.

760
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:42,573
If you want it bad enough, go get it.

761
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,703
- Really well said.

762
00:37:46,776 --> 00:37:50,290
And so look forward to
more from this research.

763
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:52,200
This is just a taste of the research.

764
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,569
There's plenty more.

765
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:56,220
We, ESG and ISSA will be publishing it.

766
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:58,359
It's available for free.

767
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:02,100
And so thanks for being here.

768
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,779
This is our contact information.

769
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:06,580
Candy, it's always a
pleasure presenting with you.

770
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:08,130
I always learn a lot.

771
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:10,550
And for the audience,
thanks for being here.
