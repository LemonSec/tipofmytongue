00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:12,330
- [Announcer] Please welcome Founder

3
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:17,310
and CEO of Wabbi, Brittany Greenfield.

4
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,720
- When every company is born,
the founder ask themself

5
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,040
the question, why are we gonna be the ones

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,169
to solve this big hairy problem?

7
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,300
And I definitely double-tapped on that.

8
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,090
I'd been a industry outsider longer

9
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:31,190
than I'd been an insider.

10
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:33,387
And then I remembered Einstein's quote,

11
00:00:33,387 --> 00:00:37,417
"We cannot solve our problems
with the same thinking we used

12
00:00:37,417 --> 00:00:38,890
"when we created them."

13
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:43,670
And it's that same thinking
that has created what I like

14
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:46,900
to call when it comes to
deploying application security

15
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:50,653
in the development pipeline,
the DevSecOps, Hairball.

16
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:54,980
Whether it's shifting
left, securing at speed,

17
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:59,040
security by design, insert
your favorite buzz word here,

18
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,260
enterprises are drowning in
application security data

19
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:04,480
without any information.

20
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,610
And this is where Wabbi comes in.

21
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:10,580
Wabbi centralizes and
orchestrates security governance,

22
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:13,803
so that development can own it
in their day-to-day programs.

23
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:19,279
Wabbi you could even say is
the AB SEC angel on the PM,

24
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,130
who's our real hero in
this story, her shoulder.

25
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:25,500
By facilitating that
contract between development

26
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,540
and security about what's tolerable

27
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,450
and what standards each
project needs to meet,

28
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:33,390
Wabbi guides her automating a lot of it.

29
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:35,780
And when it can't automate
it, telling her what she needs

30
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:40,430
to do down the right path
starting at the beginning

31
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:43,240
with the ticketing
system where we identify

32
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,869
the project attributes
that will then dictate

33
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:48,110
the project security profile.

34
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:51,470
This is like that contract
between security and development.

35
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:54,320
Wabbi then pushes that information out

36
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,970
to all the various
stakeholders, the architect,

37
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:00,390
the developer, the
application security manager,

38
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,360
whether it's a control, a policy

39
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,550
or even notification workflow.

40
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:08,449
And as the results come back
in, automatically analyzes it

41
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:11,350
in the specific context of that project.

42
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:13,720
As you can imagine, an
availability vulnerability

43
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,430
needs something different
for a bill pay platform

44
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:18,950
than it does for a trading platform.

45
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:21,829
And because we're gathering
all this information

46
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:25,790
along the way, we provide the
ultimate go, no go decision

47
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:28,000
for that application.

48
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,370
And as we all know both code and security

49
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:32,030
are living, breathing things.

50
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:34,890
So as changes occur on either side,

51
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:38,809
Wabbi pushes out the most
current security standards,

52
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:42,480
so code is always being
shipped with that in mind.

53
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,609
And while the tools of
the DevSecOps Hairball

54
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:47,990
obviously make this more robust programs,

55
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:51,760
we don't need any of it
because we are focusing

56
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,399
on automating the
application security process,

57
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,220
orchestrating those policies and controls

58
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,390
and integrating with their
existing tools to bring

59
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:03,510
that information for
ultimate process compliance.

60
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:07,730
We're an experienced management
team who is asking you,

61
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:09,850
not just this panel I'm looking at,

62
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:13,790
but the security community
to think differently

63
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:16,650
about how we deploy application security

64
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:18,794
in today's development pipelines,

65
00:03:18,794 --> 00:03:21,713
thank you.
