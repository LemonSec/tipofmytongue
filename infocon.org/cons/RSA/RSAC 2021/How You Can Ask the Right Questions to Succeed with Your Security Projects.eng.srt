1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:02,740
- My name is Lenny Zeltser.

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:04,957
I am the CISO at Axonius

3
00:00:04,957 --> 00:00:07,820
and the faculty fellow at SANS Institute.

4
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:11,060
And over spending more
than a couple of decades

5
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:13,530
in cybersecurity industry,

6
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:16,520
I've realized that the
key for me to succeeding

7
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:20,070
with security projects is
asking the right question

8
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,770
in the right way and at the right time.

9
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:25,230
And that's what I'd like to share with you

10
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,260
in this presentation.

11
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:30,570
Because we often hesitate
to ask questions.

12
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,840
I know I often feel
self-conscious asking questions

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,300
because I don't wanna feel ignorant

14
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,860
or foolish sometimes.

15
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,370
And so I have to keep reminding myself

16
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:42,110
that it is through questions

17
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:44,140
that I can close information gaps,

18
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:47,480
it is through questions
that I can uncover risks,

19
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,650
find interesting solutions
to security problems

20
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:53,620
and very importantly, build rapport

21
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,890
with people whom I am collaborating.

22
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,540
Because as security professionals,

23
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:00,080
we often always collaborate

24
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,220
with other stakeholders in our activities.

25
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:05,580
And it is very interesting that

26
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,130
through the research that
I have read on this topic

27
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:09,399
there's this theme that

28
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,340
if you ask questions in a particular way

29
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:17,340
you will be successful at
getting others to appreciate you,

30
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:19,729
to like you, to respect you.

31
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:22,340
The key is asking questions
in a particular way

32
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:25,500
and that is what I
wanted to share with you

33
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,270
by bringing up a bunch of
examples and sharing with you

34
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:31,880
some stories as well as
the research on this topic.

35
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:36,140
And I'll start out with a
infamous book by Dale Carnegie

36
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,190
when he wrote his famous volume,

37
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:40,410
'How to Win Friends and Influence People'.

38
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:42,840
And he said, "To be interesting,

39
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,210
be interested, ask questions".

40
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:49,940
And there is this key here
to be interested in others

41
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:53,750
when you ask questions, you
genuinely have to want to know

42
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:58,260
what is it they're trying to
say to inform your own ideas

43
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:01,170
and to inform your
participation in discussions.

44
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:06,010
So what I wanted to do
here is to group the types

45
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:09,620
of activities that I think
we all participate in

46
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,240
into three categories.

47
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,340
I'll first discuss with you
what might be the right way

48
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,980
to ask the right questions
at the right time,

49
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,510
when it comes to activities,

50
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,870
where we discover certain things.

51
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:23,160
Then we'll talk about questions related

52
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,170
to planning activities.

53
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:27,519
And finally, I'll discuss
with you questions

54
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,730
that you might need to ask

55
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:31,060
when you're trying to persuade others

56
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,700
to take a particular course of action

57
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,519
or to support your opinion.

58
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,780
So let's get started.

59
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,160
We'll start with discover.

60
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,530
When say discover, I'm talking
about activities such as

61
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:45,220
gaining situations awareness
for perhaps a new position

62
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:48,010
that you have taken on
in your organization,

63
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:49,000
or perhaps in another.

64
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,410
You wanna know what's going on here

65
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:51,630
and what am I doing here?

66
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:55,200
Maybe you want to assess the
nature of security controls

67
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,339
that you're responsible for,

68
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,780
that you're trying to strengthen.

69
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,720
Maybe you're trying to a
vulnerability assessment.

70
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,827
Maybe you're involved in incident response

71
00:03:02,827 --> 00:03:05,359
and you need to understand what's going on

72
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,200
in this environment that
may have been compromised.

73
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,179
And perhaps you're also asking questions

74
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:13,850
in a different capacity
when looking at the vendors

75
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:16,400
that participate in your
company's information technology

76
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,200
and you need to understand what risks

77
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,230
they might pose to your organization.

78
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:23,480
So lots of questions are involved

79
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,290
in activities related to discovery.

80
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:29,519
So let's think about what is the best way

81
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,353
to pose a question.

82
00:03:30,353 --> 00:03:32,030
I wanted to start with this example.

83
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:36,030
So I know that people who
are listening to this talk

84
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:38,990
take on different types of
security responsibilities,

85
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:41,440
but here let's imagine that we're trying

86
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,280
to understand security measures
related to the standard

87
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:51,090
for security programs, ISO 27001.

88
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:53,250
Look at this question and think,

89
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:57,640
how would you determine
whether this is the best way

90
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,679
to pose a question like this?

91
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:05,430
The question is, which
controls support ISO 27001

92
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:10,163
annex requirement 8.2 for
information classification?

93
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,650
How do you know this is the right way

94
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:16,029
to pose such a question?

95
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:20,609
Well, a lot depends on
whether your audience

96
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:24,210
for this question understands
what you're talking about.

97
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:27,140
Are they familiar with ISO 27001?

98
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:31,130
Do they know this thing
called 8.2 annex requirement?

99
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:32,610
Are they familiar

100
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:35,540
with the notion of
information classification?

101
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:40,540
You see if you use a jargon
that alienates the other party

102
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,900
then they will just reject your question.

103
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,120
They might not answer it or even worse,

104
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,120
they might answer your
question incorrectly

105
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,590
and you might not even realize it.

106
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:53,210
On the other hand, you need
to use the right terminology

107
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:56,580
so that your audience, whoever
is receiving a question

108
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:59,590
understands that you know
what you're talking about.

109
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:04,489
So this idea that the way
that you ask your question

110
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:09,090
depends on how your audience understands

111
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:10,330
the terms you're using.

112
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:13,539
That's the key to asking
the right questions.

113
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:15,980
And depending on certain situations,

114
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,820
if you think that your
audience doesn't understand

115
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:20,180
your jargon or if you're not even sure,

116
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,600
what does this person know and don't know

117
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,090
about by the subject matter,

118
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,950
your best bet might be to
ask an open-ended question.

119
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:30,140
So for example, in this
case, in this example,

120
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:32,640
maybe it would be better
if you're not sure

121
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,609
about your audience
knowledge and the terminology

122
00:05:34,609 --> 00:05:35,940
they prefer to use,

123
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,040
maybe it's better to use
an open-ended question

124
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,150
like please tell me about your approach

125
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:42,950
to classifying information.

126
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:46,010
And then depending on how they answer

127
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:47,650
this open ended question,

128
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:51,810
you will hear the types of terms they use.

129
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,550
The way they think about information

130
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:58,490
and their answers will
reveal their with the subject

131
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:01,860
and therefore will shape
your followup questions.

132
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,170
Because you can then mirror to them

133
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:06,440
the kind of terms that use,

134
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,460
the way that they speak
about the subject matter

135
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:11,030
in your followup questions.

136
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:13,777
So remember I said that
Dale Carnegie said,

137
00:06:13,777 --> 00:06:18,430
"To be interesting, be
interested, ask questions".

138
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:21,850
This means listen to the
answers to your questions

139
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:26,130
so that the answer informs
your subsequent questions.

140
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:27,120
Something else to consider,

141
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,440
if you're trying to gather
a lot of information

142
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:33,570
is whether you should start
with the most difficult,

143
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:37,590
the most confrontational,
the most intrusive question,

144
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:40,830
or whether it's better to
start with an easy question

145
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:44,450
and then ramp up the
sensitivity of your questions.

146
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:46,300
Well, there's some research
that I read on the topic

147
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,910
and by the way, at the
end of this presentation

148
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:51,210
I will share you the article names

149
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:54,180
of various papers and
references that support

150
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,330
some of the ideas that
I'm sharing with you.

151
00:06:56,330 --> 00:07:00,729
But I read the research
that showed that if

152
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:05,580
you truly want to get answers
in a very tough situation

153
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:06,930
you might not be better off

154
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:09,430
asking the most intrusive question first

155
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:14,430
to just shock your other
party into thinking critically

156
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:19,340
about the problem and set the bar high

157
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,340
for the kind of questions
you're gonna be answering.

158
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,039
For example, if you're
trying to understand

159
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,310
the security posture of an organization,

160
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:27,960
a tough intrusive question might be,

161
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,270
what is the biggest concern you have

162
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:34,560
about the existing compromise
in your environment?

163
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,890
I don't know, something like that.

164
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:38,300
Something that really
worries the other party.

165
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,420
Such an intrusive question
might be difficult to hear

166
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:43,300
in the beginning, but it'll
allow you to set the bar

167
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,290
and frame the rest of your conversations,

168
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:47,620
so that the subsequent
questions are easier

169
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:51,330
and that way the person
might end up opening up more.

170
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:53,950
However, the same researchers
found out that if that's how

171
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:56,560
you choose to begin asking your questions,

172
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,540
then it will be a very
difficult conversation

173
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:01,360
that perhaps will not
contribute towards building

174
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,390
a strong lasting relationship
with the other party.

175
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:06,130
And if you're planning to work together,

176
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:07,930
this is a colleague with
whom you're gonna be spending

177
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:10,440
at least a few years
in the same workplace,

178
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:14,180
then it is actually more
effective in the longer term

179
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:18,370
to ease into the conversation,
start with light questions

180
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:22,390
and then gradually
escalate their sensitivity.

181
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:27,390
So as I just shared with you,
the key to asking questions

182
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:33,650
is hearing the answer and
informing your followup questions

183
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:37,039
based on how the person talked
about the subject matter

184
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:41,689
and how they answered,
what terms they used

185
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:43,240
in response to your question.

186
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,680
Now, another reason why
this is so important

187
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,910
is because the other
party is paying attention

188
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:50,709
whether you are paying attention.

189
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:52,850
And if all of your
questions are disjointed,

190
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:55,240
if you've prepared your
questions in advance,

191
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,770
and if you just ask them one at a time

192
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:01,810
without demonstrating that
you really are listening

193
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:03,810
then the other party will realize

194
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:06,500
that you may be are
not all that interested

195
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,220
in what they're trying to say.

196
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:11,180
You might be interested,
but they need to see that.

197
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,599
And the way that they will see that,

198
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,880
the way that you demonstrate
that you're paying attention

199
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,000
to them is by informing
of subsequent questions

200
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,500
about what they've said.

201
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,640
Sometimes researchers
call this being responsive

202
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,939
to that person or to the other situation.

203
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,240
This helps establish rapport.

204
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:31,550
And by asking questions in
formed by previous answers

205
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:33,410
you're showing that
you're more responsive,

206
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:35,650
you're building rapport
with the other party.

207
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:39,530
And frankly, the other party
generally enjoys conversing

208
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:43,533
with you more in these kinds
of responsive interactions.

209
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:47,050
Now let's look at another question

210
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:50,372
and think about what about it
might be counterproductive?

211
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:54,849
The question is, why have you failed

212
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:57,923
to follow server hardening requirements?

213
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:01,930
That's a pretty tough question.

214
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:03,790
It's very confrontational, isn't it?

215
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:06,150
The other person might feel attacked

216
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:08,860
and right away start being defensive.

217
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:11,540
What makes this question
particularly difficult to hear

218
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,939
is the word you, because you're saying

219
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:17,830
what have you done,
why have you done this?

220
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:21,580
The word 'you' amplifies
the perceived attack.

221
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,670
And unless your goal is really
to agitate the other party

222
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:27,433
which probably is unlikely,

223
00:10:27,433 --> 00:10:31,860
you're better off avoiding
attacking other people

224
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,330
with whom you're trying to collaborate.

225
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:36,007
And instead adjust your question

226
00:10:36,007 --> 00:10:41,007
so that it focuses on the
situation and the desired outcome.

227
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:44,623
So how might you reword this
question with this in mind?

228
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:48,740
How about this possibility?

229
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,350
You could say something like this,

230
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,980
the server's configuration does not meet

231
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,930
our security requirements.

232
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:57,410
How might we address the situation now

233
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:59,120
and prevent it in the future?

234
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,653
You see, I'm careful not
to attack the person.

235
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,750
I'm talking about the problem

236
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:08,293
that I have with the current situation.

237
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:11,973
And I'm also explaining
what I want to happen

238
00:11:11,973 --> 00:11:14,099
in response to my question.

239
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:17,740
I'd like to find out how to
address this problem right away

240
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,890
and how to prevent it in the future.

241
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:24,720
So I'm cooling down the
tone of my question here.

242
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,580
And now there are some
situations that are very urgent.

243
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,900
Like if you're in the process of dealing

244
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,319
with an active compromise
on the adversaries spreading

245
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,060
within your organization, you must hurry.

246
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,189
You must act now.

247
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:37,220
You must get others to
realize that this is something

248
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:39,540
that they should be paying
attention to and take seriously.

249
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,150
In that case, the tone of your question

250
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,980
will be urgent and hot.

251
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,790
I would still avoid personal attacks

252
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:48,260
but you might need to ramp
up the tone of your question.

253
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:51,670
But in most cases we're better
off cooling things down,

254
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:54,270
avoiding direct confrontation

255
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,770
and talking about the situation.

256
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:58,449
And very importantly,
what you want to happen

257
00:11:58,450 --> 00:11:59,900
in response to your question.

258
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,850
But these situations where
incident responses involved

259
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:09,560
they often times are the
reason why people are stressed.

260
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,603
And so look at this question.

261
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,160
How would you know whether
this is the right way

262
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,300
to ask the question in a given situation?

263
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:21,109
And my question here is, in
an incident response scenario

264
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:24,533
what do we know so far
about what happened?

265
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:28,839
Earlier in this talk I
suggested that it's nice

266
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,720
if you're not sure about your audience

267
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,393
to begin with an open-ended
question like that.

268
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,250
But there's a problem
with open-ended questions,

269
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:41,930
which is that sometimes the
question is too open-ended

270
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:44,199
and people of whom you're
asking this question

271
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,640
might not know how to answer it.

272
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,600
They might not have the mental framework

273
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,720
because of their experience
or lack of their offer,

274
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,940
for example to provide an adequate answer.

275
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,830
And very importantly, I found that

276
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:00,570
if you pose an open-ended question

277
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:04,070
when the person is stressed
out, when they're very nervous

278
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:07,970
then they just don't know how
to properly respond to it.

279
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:11,970
So what I've learned is that
if the situation is urgent,

280
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:16,000
if there's a lot of stress,
then I want to guide

281
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,822
the other party through
answering my question.

282
00:13:18,822 --> 00:13:21,370
And so I don't ask an open-ended question.

283
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:25,640
In that case, I provide
more specific questions

284
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,360
offering some extra guidance

285
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,270
to the way that I want the
question to be answered.

286
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:30,910
And therefore, I found that

287
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,380
when I'm dealing with
stressful situations,

288
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:36,020
situations where people are
likely to make a mistake

289
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:38,360
because of just the nature of the problem

290
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,490
we're trying to solve here,
I found that it's very

291
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:44,470
useful to organize my
thoughts using a checklist.

292
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:48,940
So I come prepared if I can,
with a set of questions,

293
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,250
I should consider asking.

294
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,120
Now, remember earlier, I said that

295
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,280
you want to make sure
that the other party feels

296
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,930
that you're not just bombarding them

297
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:58,689
with prepared questions
one after the other.

298
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:00,300
They wanna see a theme to your questions,

299
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,530
they wanna see that your questions

300
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:03,480
are informed by their answers.

301
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,790
So I'm not just gonna be
asking these questions

302
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:09,390
one after another, after another blindly.

303
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,598
But I come in with some specific questions

304
00:14:11,598 --> 00:14:15,760
that can guide me in
asking them specifics.

305
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,930
And then depending on the answers

306
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:20,420
I might choose to admit certain
questions or eventually,

307
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,339
if I see that we
established the right report

308
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,680
and the stress has come down

309
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,162
I might resort to asking
open-ended questions.

310
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:31,750
So these are the thoughts
that come to my mind

311
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,890
when I think about questions that I ask

312
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:36,980
in discovery type situations.

313
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:39,070
And what I discussed with you so far

314
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:41,850
is that you need to
understand your audience

315
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:45,770
so that you ask your
questions on their terms.

316
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:48,199
I suggest that one way to
get to know your audience

317
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,410
is to open up with open-ended questions.

318
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:53,530
At the beginning, you
might say something like

319
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:55,390
what do we know about the situation?

320
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:59,640
And by the way, you can also
wrap up your conversation

321
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,870
with an open-ended
question to something like,

322
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:04,690
is there anything I should
have asked that I didn't

323
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:08,740
that can reveal some additional answers?

324
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:11,270
I also highlighted the
need for your questions

325
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:15,340
to be relevant to the situation,
responsive to the person.

326
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:18,240
And also I explained that your questions

327
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,120
should account for the context

328
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,600
within which your person is
answering your questions.

329
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,770
And I suggested that, especially
in stressful situations

330
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:30,730
you should look at checklists
that you prepare in advance

331
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:34,696
to guide your conversation
and to minimize the chances

332
00:15:34,696 --> 00:15:36,910
that open-ended questions

333
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:39,323
might lead to incomplete or wrong answers.

334
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:42,699
Next I wanted to discuss with you

335
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,150
questions in the context of planning.

336
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:47,050
Now, we do a lot of planning.

337
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:49,189
In information security for example,

338
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:51,240
we might be planning a way to address

339
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,490
a risk fixable durability,

340
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:55,440
deal with a policy non-compliance,

341
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,230
prevent some dangerous situation.

342
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:01,820
We might plan, when we look for goals

343
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,450
for our security projects and programs.

344
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:08,520
And another context maybe we're
planning the right features

345
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,550
of a product we're building

346
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:11,939
or an internal tool that we're creating.

347
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,380
So a whole lot of planning takes place

348
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,899
in the world of information security.

349
00:16:16,899 --> 00:16:21,553
Let's talk about questions
that can help you plan.

350
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:27,470
Because a lot of security
activities go beyond yourself,

351
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:30,820
your immediate team, and they account

352
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,903
on the cooperation and input from others.

353
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:40,410
So consider a situation where
you're a security person

354
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:42,469
talking to an application owner

355
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:45,513
and maybe the application
has a security weakness.

356
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:48,530
And maybe you ask this question,

357
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:53,410
when will you design a way to minimize

358
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:55,642
the data exposure of this application?

359
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:59,410
There you're talking to
the application owner.

360
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:02,219
There is some concern over data exposure.

361
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:05,512
When will you design a
way to minimize that risk?

362
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,700
How might you strengthen this question?

363
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,829
What are the weaknesses in this question?

364
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:13,629
Maybe you've picked up already

365
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:15,579
based on something I
shared with you earlier

366
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:17,639
that this question could be perceived

367
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,650
as being confrontational.

368
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:23,810
The other person might feel
like they're being attacked.

369
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:25,473
So that's one aspect of the question

370
00:17:25,473 --> 00:17:27,250
that I would like to correct,

371
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:31,380
but also my concern over this question

372
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:35,090
is that it places the burden
solely on the other person

373
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:37,679
to figure out a way to solve this problem.

374
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,570
And you know what,

375
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:42,530
if it was easy to solve
data exposure risks

376
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:45,350
maybe they would have
been addressed already.

377
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:47,889
So in many cases, as
security professionals,

378
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:49,500
we'll walk into situations

379
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:53,200
and should be willing
to offer some insights.

380
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,010
Now we're gonna be careful to not make

381
00:17:56,010 --> 00:18:00,320
other people's problems
solely our own responsibility.

382
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,610
So I'm not saying you come
into a situation and say,

383
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:04,899
I'll fix everything for you,
I'll tell you what to do.

384
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,860
That's not the right way
to handle it as well.

385
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:10,669
But my point is that we might
need to be more collaborative

386
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:12,550
but not in many cases.

387
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:16,483
So how about this way of
rephrasing this question?

388
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:23,149
What I would say is how
might we design a way

389
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:26,240
to minimize the data
exposure of the application?

390
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:31,240
How might we, that's how
I'm opening this question.

391
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,800
This specific way of starting a question

392
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,970
is sometimes called collaborative framing.

393
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:42,440
It asks the question in a
way that makes it clear that

394
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:46,460
we are both or all of
us in this conversation

395
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,350
gonna think about a problem.

396
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:53,050
And this way of asking a
question is especially useful

397
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:57,419
for coming up with
creative ideas to problems.

398
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:00,110
I read an article by Nelson Norman Group

399
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:02,820
that does a lot of ideation work

400
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:06,320
and they really recommend
this way of asking questions,

401
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,159
'how might we'.

402
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,320
If your goal is to brainstorm

403
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:15,429
and together come up with
potential creative solutions.

404
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:19,380
It really encourages
people to start thinking

405
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,713
in interesting ways.

406
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:23,710
So the reason why this way

407
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:25,140
of asking the question achieves this

408
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:28,100
is because it really
encourages others to chime in.

409
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,379
It says that we are all participating

410
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:33,640
in planning out a
solution to this problem.

411
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,600
And it also says, you're not on your own.

412
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,699
I'm here as well.

413
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,930
We're going to tackle this together.

414
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:42,730
'How might we', this is
collaborative framing.

415
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:46,750
Consider another question that
is trying to plan a solution

416
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,840
to a particular problem.

417
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,673
This question says,

418
00:19:49,673 --> 00:19:54,580
how might we train people to
not click on phishing links?

419
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,100
So the starting point is good, right?

420
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,199
It's that collaborative framing

421
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,580
that is hopefully going to come
up with creative solutions.

422
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:05,750
But a challenge with many
questions that we ask

423
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:10,750
is that we already
presuppose a particular type

424
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:15,920
of a solution by defining
the problem too narrowly.

425
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,139
Look at this question.

426
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,159
What is the underlying issue

427
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,070
that we're trying to solve here?

428
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:25,700
Is it indeed our goal to solve the problem

429
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:28,623
of people not clicking on links?

430
00:20:29,735 --> 00:20:31,060
'Cause people are gonna click.

431
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:33,000
That's just what people do.

432
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,610
Maybe it is more constructive to think

433
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:39,389
about the underlying
issue a bit more broadly.

434
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:41,130
And maybe we can rephrase this question

435
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:42,140
to say something like,

436
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:46,210
how might we mitigate the
risk of phishing attacks?

437
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:49,980
You see now, we broadened the framing

438
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:53,610
of this question, and now we
might come up with solutions

439
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:55,129
that actually might work.

440
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:59,810
And maybe a part of the solution
will be lowering the rate

441
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:02,389
of clicking on suspicious links.

442
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:06,420
But now we can include in
the planning of the solution

443
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:08,400
other type of security measures

444
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,980
be it email filtering or
browser security controls.

445
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:15,600
So sometimes we ask questions too narrowly

446
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,193
and we need to broaden our framework.

447
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:24,010
But sometimes the
framing can be too broad.

448
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:26,020
For example, let's say
you're asking the question,

449
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:28,583
is the security agent
on all the endpoints?

450
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:33,830
This question, 'is it on all end points',

451
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:38,010
maybe it's not specific enough
because if somebody says yes,

452
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:41,730
does that really mean that
your security control,

453
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:43,120
that your security question,

454
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,989
your security concern is addressed?

455
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:47,520
Because it's possible to be
agent softwares installed

456
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,639
but it's not working or maybe it's working

457
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,680
but it's not communicating
with the management server

458
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,490
or maybe it's there, but
it's not properly configured.

459
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:56,890
So sometimes we ask questions too broadly.

460
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:59,870
And when is the right
way to ask a question

461
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:00,870
in a particular matter?

462
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:02,520
Well, you just need to think about this.

463
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,530
You need to look at your question

464
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:06,750
and see how will the
other party perceive it.

465
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,730
Will they answer it very directly

466
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:10,660
and will that truly give you the answer

467
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:13,490
to everything you wanna
know about the situation?

468
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:17,010
Sometimes we need to broaden
the framing of the question,

469
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:19,483
sometimes we need to be more specific.

470
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:24,149
So how are we thinking about questions

471
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:26,680
that can help us with planning?

472
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:31,680
What I suggested with you
is to include language

473
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:34,810
in the beginning of your question that,

474
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:36,639
well, it's an inclusive framing,

475
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,360
is what I suggested to you.

476
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,919
Using the word, 'we'

477
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,370
to share the sense of
ownership over the answer

478
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:46,020
so that the person knows that
you're there to help them

479
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,389
and so that other participants

480
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:49,620
in this situation feel welcomed

481
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,020
to chime in with their answers.

482
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:54,510
'How might we', this way
of asking the question

483
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:56,250
really encourages collaboration

484
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:59,080
to come up with creative solutions.

485
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:02,090
Also, I suggested that you are careful

486
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:06,290
about not having preconceived assumptions

487
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:08,780
hard-coded into the question.

488
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:12,639
Sometimes you need to broaden
the scoping of your question

489
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,750
to make sure that you come
up with meaningful answers

490
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:17,630
and don't solve a problem
that's very narrow

491
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:20,020
that doesn't actually
address the underlying risk.

492
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:22,680
And sometimes I said that
your questions framing

493
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,260
can be a bit too broad and might require

494
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:28,843
some specific sub or
followup questions perhaps.

495
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:32,959
The next set of activities
I wanted to discuss with you

496
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:37,290
involves how you engage with
others by asking questions

497
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:39,659
when you're trying to be persuasive.

498
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:42,860
This for me is perhaps the hardest aspect

499
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:45,719
of working in cyber security.

500
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,340
I need to persuade others to pay attention

501
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,970
to what it is I'm trying to say,

502
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:52,280
to address the risks in a particular way,

503
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:55,450
to follow the recommended course

504
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:57,670
of action that I've put together.

505
00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:00,220
Oftentimes we need to get
buy-in from other stakeholders

506
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:02,260
in the security projects,

507
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:05,340
we need to defend our
security budget requests

508
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:08,169
by persuading the decision makers,

509
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:11,460
we need to persuade perhaps our customers

510
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,840
so they can trust us in
our security program.

511
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,340
And we need to persuade those

512
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:18,110
who ask us for approval to risky actions,

513
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:21,889
that maybe the action is
too risky to be taken.

514
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:23,473
So let's look at some examples.

515
00:24:24,483 --> 00:24:27,050
Consider a situation
where somebody asks you

516
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:29,430
to approve something that you

517
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:33,170
as a security professional
think is just too risky.

518
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:38,170
And your answer is, I cannot
approve this security request.

519
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:45,260
How might the other person see
you and perceive your answer?

520
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:50,060
Well, of course, nobody
likes hearing a rejection.

521
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:52,050
They will not like it when you disagree.

522
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:55,649
And look, sometimes you
have enough political power

523
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:58,440
in the organization to simply say no

524
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,370
and that'll be the end of it.

525
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:01,100
But usually security professionals

526
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,040
don't have that much power.

527
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,750
Instead, we need to persuade
others that our point

528
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:09,890
of view is valid, useful,
and worth agreeing with.

529
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:12,580
So the key here is to
cause the other party

530
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:16,260
to understand our point of view.

531
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:20,100
To be persuasive, try to
see if the other party

532
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,629
can understand your perspective.

533
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:23,580
But it's a very hard
thing to do 'cause how

534
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:28,179
can you force somebody
else to empathize with you?

535
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:29,900
That can be a hard thing to do.

536
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:32,993
If only there was a way to force empathy.

537
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:38,870
And there might be a
way by asking questions

538
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,183
in a particular way.

539
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:47,260
Here in this situation how
might you rephrase the question

540
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:49,370
so that the other person is likely

541
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:52,169
to think about it from your perspective?

542
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:53,800
Well, here's my suggestion.

543
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,560
You might say something like,

544
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:59,490
how can I approve your request
while staying consistent

545
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:02,410
with our approach to risk management?

546
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:04,563
How can I approve your request?

547
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:08,870
Now, the other person, if
they're paying attention,

548
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:10,850
if they're paying any attention
to what you're saying,

549
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:13,780
now they're starting to think about it

550
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,080
from your perspective.

551
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:18,439
You have caused them
to empathize with you.

552
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:22,550
Because now they need to think
like a security professional.

553
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:26,310
How can I approve your request
while staying consistent

554
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:27,950
with our approach to risk management?

555
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:29,430
Notice the word 'our' here

556
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:33,410
also introduces collaborative
framing as well.

557
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:38,410
So if you want to say
no, do so using this way

558
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:44,060
of framing your question,
'cause the other person to think

559
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,750
about the problem from your perspective.

560
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:48,660
And this I learned by
reading a book by Chris Voss

561
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:52,870
who was a former FBI negotiator.

562
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:55,659
And his favorite way of asking questions

563
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:57,560
as a way of saying no is to simply say,

564
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,677
'how am I supposed to do that?'

565
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:01,440
How am I supposed to do?

566
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,200
If somebody asks you to
do something that's risky

567
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,230
and by simply saying, 'how
am I supposed to do that?'

568
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:09,130
Or how can I do this

569
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:11,780
without exposing our
organization to undue risk,

570
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:15,820
that causes the other person
to empathize with you.

571
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:18,720
And of course you need
to include other advice

572
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,780
that I shared with you
and asking your question

573
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:24,300
like collaborative framing, for example.

574
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:29,300
But look, this is perhaps
a more effective way

575
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:32,720
of interacting with others
than simply saying no,

576
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,770
forced empathy.

577
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:36,083
If that's a good thing can help you here.

578
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,110
Let's look at another example.

579
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:40,449
What might be a stronger way

580
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:42,640
to defend your security budget requests?

581
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,870
Let's say your budget request
was not fully approved.

582
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:48,639
You wanted to get some
funding for, I don't know,

583
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:53,000
a penetration test and
that request was rejected.

584
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,223
What might you say?

585
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:59,671
You could say, why was my
request for funding rejected?

586
00:27:59,671 --> 00:28:01,296
'Why?'

587
00:28:01,296 --> 00:28:03,290
That might not always be effective.

588
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:05,260
It turns out just from experience,

589
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:07,212
maybe you'll agree, I don't know.

590
00:28:07,212 --> 00:28:11,190
People get a little bit
defensive when you ask them why,

591
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,700
like you're calling them out

592
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:16,050
and this elevates the tension
in the room sometimes.

593
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:19,023
So I prefer not to start
my questions with why.

594
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:25,470
In this case, to better understand

595
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:27,630
why your funding request was rejected

596
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:31,110
so that presumably you can react to it,

597
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:34,560
maybe ask the other party to reconsider

598
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:37,129
or make sure that the
other party understands

599
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:40,440
the repercussions of the denial.

600
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,490
You could phrase your
question in a way that speaks

601
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:46,270
to a shared objective.

602
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:49,120
Here's how you might rephrase
the previous question.

603
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,000
You might say our need
for the penetration test

604
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,390
was driven directly by our
customers requirements.

605
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:59,290
How will we meet their expectations

606
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:00,822
without the penetration test?

607
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,780
So now I'm causing the other
party to see the situation

608
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:06,970
from my perspective.

609
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:10,840
I'm using inclusive
framing with the word 'we',

610
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:14,190
but I'm also speaking to shared objectives

611
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:16,970
because presumably in a given organization

612
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:20,140
we all want our customers to succeed.

613
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:21,760
We need to support their requests.

614
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,850
So on this bet requests
for penetration test

615
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:25,000
came from your customers,

616
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,530
how will we meet their expectations?

617
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:30,540
Maybe this will start the
conversation for perhaps

618
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,740
including some extra funding,

619
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,590
even though it was initially denied,

620
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:36,149
or maybe this will lead to some other way

621
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:37,850
of addressing the underlying need

622
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:40,250
that you perhaps even haven't thought of.

623
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:42,850
So think about shared objectives,

624
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:45,209
especially when you want to connect

625
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,970
and resonate with colleagues
outside of the security

626
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:52,080
or the IT organization and
speak to shared business needs.

627
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,260
I mean, as security professionals,

628
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:56,190
we like to talk about threats
and vulnerabilities and risks,

629
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:57,130
but that kind of language

630
00:29:57,130 --> 00:30:00,220
doesn't work with other colleagues.

631
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:03,360
Think about shared objectives,
rephrase your questions

632
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,773
to bring those up in your conversations.

633
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,550
Something else I wanted to mention to you.

634
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:11,310
When I'm dealing with a situation

635
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:16,310
where I'm hoping to get
approval for something.

636
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:20,419
And so I might say something like,

637
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:25,230
are you okay with the latest
revision to my security policy?

638
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:26,480
Now here I'm talking about something

639
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,540
that is a little bit subtle.

640
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:29,020
So I'm not sure if you will agree.

641
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:31,790
But what I have learned
books and experience

642
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:35,200
is that people oftentimes
are worried about saying yes.

643
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,280
Saying yes is a commitment.

644
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,270
And sometimes they will say yes

645
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:41,360
just so that you stop bothering them

646
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,622
even though they don't
necessarily mean yes.

647
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:48,129
So sometimes it's easier to get buy-in

648
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:49,980
by rephrasing your question.

649
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:54,130
So that the answer that you want is no.

650
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:55,320
What does that mean?

651
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,020
How might you rephrase this question

652
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:59,580
so that the answer that
I want to hear is a no?

653
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:00,879
How about something like this?

654
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,840
Do you have any concerns
with the security policy

655
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,132
before I finalize it?

656
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:08,420
In this case I hope the
answer will be, Nope,

657
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,860
everything's fine.

658
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:12,830
It's easier for people to say no.

659
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:15,960
So sometimes I rephrase my questions

660
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:20,110
so that for the person to
agree with me they say no.

661
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:23,360
And look, people don't always
agree with me, of course not.

662
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,310
And here I will remind you that

663
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:28,000
even if they do say no
and you were looking yes,

664
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,640
that's not always immediate
rejection that could be seen

665
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,560
as the start of a negotiation
and a conversation

666
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,639
that you'll be having

667
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,960
with all the other ways
of asking questions

668
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,910
to get their buy-in eventually, hopefully.

669
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:43,730
So my takeaways for how to ask questions

670
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:45,000
when you try to persuade

671
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,310
involve phrasing your
questions in a way that causes

672
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:48,889
the other person to think

673
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:50,830
about the situation from your perspective,

674
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:52,949
forcing empathy on them.

675
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:54,820
Bringing in shared objectives,

676
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:57,270
going beyond threats and vulnerabilities

677
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:59,590
to perhaps talk about business goals

678
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:01,730
and thinking about asking your questions

679
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:04,130
so that the answer you seek no.

680
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:06,680
Because maybe it's easier
for somebody to say no.

681
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:10,273
And maybe when they say yes,
they don't truly mean yes.

682
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,340
So the next steps for you,

683
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:15,820
if you like what you have heard so far

684
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:17,879
review these materials again.

685
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,800
And for every type of
activity that we covered,

686
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,399
think about a question
you can ask somebody,

687
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,370
relate it to your projects
at work right now.

688
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:28,000
How can you you ask those questions,

689
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,930
when can you ask them and
how much rephrase them

690
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:33,720
to incorporate the advice
that I shared with you?

691
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,710
That's my challenge to you.

692
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:38,810
Those are the next steps
you might wanna take.

693
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:41,060
