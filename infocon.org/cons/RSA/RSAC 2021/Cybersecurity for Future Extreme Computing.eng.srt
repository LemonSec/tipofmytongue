1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:03,649
- Good afternoon, my name
is Dr. Anne Fitzpatrick

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:05,640
and I'm with the National Security Agency.

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,440
And I'm here to talk to you
for a little bit this afternoon

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:11,860
about Cybersecurity for
Future Extreme Computing.

5
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:14,110
I appreciate your taking
time out of your day

6
00:00:14,976 --> 00:00:18,400
to listen to my presentations
and chat a little bit.

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,180
And I'd like to take
about 40 minutes or so

8
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:24,169
to talk about this subject.

9
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:25,300
This is not going to be,

10
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,920
I'm gonna go to my first slide.

11
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,620
This is not going to be a
really detailed technical talk,

12
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:33,360
but more from big picture
and policy perspective.

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,220
And when I talk about cybersecurity,

14
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:39,360
I'm gonna talk about it on many
levels to some degree today,

15
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,910
a little bit about what I'd
call like traditional hacking

16
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:44,742
and things like this,

17
00:00:44,743 --> 00:00:47,250
but also from a big picture perspective

18
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:51,240
as to what cybersecurity
means in a globalized world

19
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,860
And from high-end computing,

20
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:56,269
I'll get into the definition
of it a little bit,

21
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:59,010
but where we need to be as a nation

22
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:02,629
and where we need to be to
be economically competitive

23
00:01:03,662 --> 00:01:05,370
and going forward in high tech.

24
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:06,223
So it's a big topic.

25
00:01:06,223 --> 00:01:07,803
It's a very broad topic.

26
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:10,149
But what I'd like to start off

27
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:11,630
with the slide you see right now,

28
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:13,720
I have several goals for this presentation

29
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,600
I'd like you to take away from this.

30
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,690
I'm gonna go into some brief
history of high-end computing

31
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:22,730
and I'll talk over my terms of
what this means in a minute,

32
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:25,280
and the current state of
the field, where we're at.

33
00:01:27,249 --> 00:01:31,770
I'm not an HP, High-Performance
Computing, or HPC engineer,

34
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:34,960
scientist, mathematician, or designer.

35
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,110
I'm a tech-savvy social scientist.

36
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,640
And I'll talk to my
background in a minute.

37
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,420
But part of what my job is,

38
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:42,940
and part of what I've done for my career

39
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:45,560
is get people to question
their assumptions about things

40
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,928
and especially when designing
machinery or big computers

41
00:01:49,928 --> 00:01:51,200
or things like this.

42
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,600
And I'm gonna describe what's happening,

43
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,050
what I've seen over working
for 26 years in this field,

44
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:00,580
what I see as some serious paradigm shifts

45
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:04,120
happening underway in
high-performance computing.

46
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:07,060
And we're also in kind
of a Clay Christensen

47
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,103
innovator's dilemma scenario I see,

48
00:02:10,103 --> 00:02:12,280
and why that's seen maybe as a crisis,

49
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,760
but also as an opportunity.

50
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,519
And I'm gonna talk to
that a little later today.

51
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,510
I'd kind of like you to
try to see this with me.

52
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,540
And then I'm gonna talk a little bit about

53
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,560
cybersecurity in a big picture sense

54
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,610
for high-performance computing futures

55
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:26,230
and where we might go from there.

56
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:29,130
So I'm trying to get you to think

57
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:30,820
and get you to question your assumptions

58
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,433
and talk about the impact.

59
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,820
I wanna kick off a long-term discussion

60
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,730
and encourage people to
challenge their assumptions

61
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:39,209
about where we are.

62
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:41,590
And I'll talk to some
of these specific things

63
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,220
a little later on.

64
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,050
And just going with the assumption here

65
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:48,650
that advanced computing, if
you really think about it,

66
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:50,890
in various forms has become

67
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:54,450
kind of an invisible, but
critical technological backbone

68
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,429
for modern society today.

69
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,670
I mean, who could not live

70
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:02,739
without having their
laptop or PC or a phone.

71
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:05,920
Think about it, your car has
something like 50 or plus CPUs.

72
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,512
In fact, there's a chip
shortage going on right now.

73
00:03:08,513 --> 00:03:10,780
I'll speak to that a little later

74
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:13,530
where the auto manufacturers
are slowing production.

75
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,240
It's just, you can't get
away from this today.

76
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,840
It's really hard to.

77
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,280
And then I'll talk a little bit about

78
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,600
what's called the top 500 list,

79
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,840
which is the top 500 ranking
of supercomputers in the world

80
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,960
and how we've come historically,

81
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,800
and what that has been,
how that got developed,

82
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,670
and question whether it matters anymore.

83
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:36,130
And you'll see more later in the talk why.

84
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:37,733
Just a little bit about me,

85
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,470
this is my first time speaking at RSA.

86
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:42,430
I've not normally run
with this crowd before,

87
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,780
'cause I normally run with the
super-computing, or SC group,

88
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,230
which is a big meeting like RSA

89
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:50,709
that meets every November normally,

90
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:52,460
when we weren't having COVID.

91
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:55,780
And a lot of the
high-performance computing

92
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,850
scientific community.

93
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:02,370
a lot of the US National
labs and people from academe

94
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:03,970
and people from some industry.

95
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:06,130
It's not so cybersecurity focused,

96
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:08,440
but I think it's becoming
more so, I've observed,

97
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,540
which is a good thing.

98
00:04:11,554 --> 00:04:13,780
I have a degree in Science
and Technology Studies

99
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,550
from Virginia Tech.

100
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:17,959
What is Science and Technology
Studies you might ask?

101
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,769
I get asked this question a lot.

102
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:22,169
It's known colloquially as STS.

103
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:25,120
It's an interdisciplinary
field that teaches people

104
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,580
both social science and hard science.

105
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:31,990
My PhD professor was a
philosopher of science.

106
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:33,600
There is such a field.

107
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,840
And it's a really cool
set of skills to have

108
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,640
because it leads you to be able

109
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,830
to talk between the
scientists and engineers

110
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:43,979
and the policy makers, such
as like in Washington DC,

111
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,910
and translate the language between them.

112
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,440
I've made kind of a career of that

113
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,893
and it's been a lot of fun.

114
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,022
And again, I'm at the latter
part of my career these days,

115
00:04:53,022 --> 00:04:56,390
but I've spent time working from academe.

116
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:59,830
I was Los Alamos National
Laboratory staff.

117
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:00,890
I have a couple of books

118
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:03,930
and I made my way Washington
DC about 15 years ago

119
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:06,010
and worked at a number
of government agencies,

120
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:08,310
including the Department of Energy,

121
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:10,350
Department of Defense,
Department of Homeland security,

122
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:12,360
and made my way to NSA last year.

123
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,810
And it's been a lot of fun.

124
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:16,090
And so again, because of my background

125
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:19,090
and because of what I've
done, things I research,

126
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:21,099
I tend to think of security

127
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:24,730
in terms of how to protect
the US from cyber enemies

128
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,530
and how to protect our technological

129
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:29,540
and competitive advantages.

130
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:30,490
It's part of my job.

131
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:34,534
So with that we will
move to the next slide,

132
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:37,010
I'll get into some history here.

133
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:40,070
So what is high-performance computing?

134
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:42,120
Let me define these terms,

135
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,140
extreme computing or
high-performance computing,

136
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:48,770
super computing, HPC we call it for short.

137
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:50,640
For our purposes today,

138
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,729
they're all the same thing, essentially.

139
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:55,573
In the business, we
tend to call it all HPC.

140
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:01,049
But extreme, you might surmise
that it's like high-end

141
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:03,110
or computing that is designed

142
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:07,860
to do a very big and
complicated problem set.

143
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,490
And that's right, that's
the right assumption.

144
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:12,920
But I want to talk a
little bit about history.

145
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,320
I always believe that we can
learn lessons from history

146
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,960
and that kind of can see
what's happened in the past

147
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,299
and see what's happening now

148
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,530
and maybe take some lessons from that.

149
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:23,623
So what is HPC?

150
00:06:24,889 --> 00:06:27,450
Probably this crowd
knows, for the most part,

151
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:29,510
but some of you may not.

152
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:33,950
It's a very specific, very
rarefied, kind of high-end

153
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:36,219
part of the information technology field

154
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:40,910
that tends to lend itself to being used

155
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:43,810
for really big science problems,

156
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:48,610
modeling nuclear weapons,
modeling cryptanalysis,

157
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:50,600
things like studying the universe

158
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,880
and the way that the
sun burns, for example,

159
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,760
or people who study black
holes, extreme weather,

160
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,593
things like this.

161
00:06:56,593 --> 00:07:00,920
And it was considered in World
War II to help win the war.

162
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,560
And back in the 1940s, when
World War II commenced,

163
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,150
IBM presented these mechanical tabulators.

164
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:10,669
And they had these things
called punch cards.

165
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,310
And some of you are old
enough to remember these.

166
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:14,350
I used them when I was starting my career.

167
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,980
They're a little card this big

168
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,300
and you would feed them
through the machine

169
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,210
and that's how you would
do your computations.

170
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:21,359
But things have changed drastically.

171
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,440
But there would be these
rooms full of these devices

172
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,090
and rooms full of mostly women,

173
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:28,619
so-called hand computers.

174
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,531
It was a device that looked
like a big typewriter.

175
00:07:30,531 --> 00:07:33,900
And they would calculate arms trajectories

176
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,679
through the war and
towards the end of the war.

177
00:07:36,679 --> 00:07:38,289
Say when you fire a weapon,

178
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:41,080
the trajectory had to be very precise.

179
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,370
And they were used to figure out later on

180
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:44,740
the atomic bomb design.

181
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:49,570
And so that latter problem set
is a very hard problem set.

182
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:51,190
And so it drew some of the West's

183
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:55,000
most prominent scientists
to Los Alamos, New Mexico,

184
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,990
where the atomic bomb project
was carried out in secret.

185
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:00,090
And so, many European scientists

186
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:02,650
who were of Jewish extraction

187
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:05,909
had to flee Europe when
Hitler arose in the 1930s.

188
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:08,680
Many came to America,
including Albert Einstein.

189
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:12,050
Among them was also
Hungarian John von Neumann.

190
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:14,263
These were just amazingly
brilliant people.

191
00:08:14,263 --> 00:08:16,580
I was fascinated with them
when I was a graduate student.

192
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,870
And I actually got to meet
some of their colleagues

193
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:22,130
when I worked at Los Alamos
in the early nineties

194
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:23,730
as a student.

195
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:25,720
But John von Neumann is interesting

196
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,110
because he's largely credited

197
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:30,800
with inventing the first
modern electronic computer,

198
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,140
the Electronic Numerical
Integrator And Computer, ENIAC.

199
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,980
It was at the University of Pennsylvania

200
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:37,813
during World War II.

201
00:08:37,813 --> 00:08:40,049
And ENIAC was supposed to be used,

202
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:44,380
and it was used for conventional
armaments trajectories

203
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:46,790
that they would practice
at Aberdeen, Maryland,

204
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:48,670
at the Army Proving Grounds.

205
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,443
And so von Neumann, though,

206
00:08:50,443 --> 00:08:55,110
figured out how to employ
it to do some calculations

207
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,710
for the first atomic bomb.

208
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:58,430
And he, and a lot of his,

209
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:01,609
again, women programmers
figured out how to do this.

210
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:03,510
And they saved a lot of precious time.

211
00:09:05,283 --> 00:09:07,920
And resulted in Fat Man and Little Boy

212
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,880
and the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

213
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,943
They calculated how those things work.

214
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,569
And it really resulted in

215
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:19,400
not having to send the US
Marines to invade Japan in 1945.

216
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,540
And while the ethical matter

217
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:23,390
of the atomic bombing of Japan

218
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:25,360
is beyond the scope of this talk.

219
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,440
World War II, as all the
scientists who I met there told me,

220
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,420
it was a different time

221
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,870
and people felt it was a desperate war.

222
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:36,270
So I'm happy, if anyone wants
to talk about this offline,

223
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:40,140
I did my PhD thesis on the
atomic bomb and computing

224
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,509
about this subject,
and so a long time ago.

225
00:09:42,509 --> 00:09:45,950
But if anyone wants to talk
about it after my presentation

226
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:48,970
or on email or anything,
I'm very happy to do that,

227
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:50,242
but moving on.

228
00:09:50,242 --> 00:09:53,260
Likewise, and pictured up
in the top corner here,

229
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:56,470
the top-left corner.

230
00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:00,500
Again, the British were doing
something similar in the UK.

231
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,050
Alan Turing, who's pictured here

232
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:04,560
played by the actor Benedict Cumberbatch

233
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,510
in "The Imitation Game,"

234
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:10,220
He's working on the
British rough equivalent

235
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:14,258
of the ENIAC here, the
Bombe, that's bomb with an e.

236
00:10:14,258 --> 00:10:16,060
What it did, it allowed the British

237
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,680
to break the German naval codes

238
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,560
and allowed the allies

239
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,766
to get ahead of Germany in World War II.

240
00:10:20,767 --> 00:10:24,240
And so this was very
groundbreaking technology

241
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,073
for that time.

242
00:10:25,073 --> 00:10:27,520
And I wanted to kind of
set the tone for this talk,

243
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:30,700
'cause it'll give us some
perspective of where we've come

244
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:33,583
in the last 70 to 75 years or so.

245
00:10:36,981 --> 00:10:38,640
And the other pictures I have here,

246
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,100
these are other more contemporary things.

247
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,710
There's the stock market.

248
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:47,140
And where are these machines used today?

249
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,430
Definitely for high-speed trading,

250
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:50,599
for weather prediction,

251
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,270
as you can see in the top-right corner

252
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:56,720
on helping us predict the
path of hurricanes and things.

253
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,160
Summit computer, in the middle,

254
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,930
it's at Oak Ridge National
Laboratory down in Tennessee.

255
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:04,300
And why is there a Pringles can on here,

256
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,132
you might ask? (laughs)

257
00:11:05,133 --> 00:11:09,732
So the story behind that is
industry, other industry,

258
00:11:09,732 --> 00:11:13,750
has adopted HPC, oil
and gas, manufacturing.

259
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,930
So Pringles used to be owned

260
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:17,479
by Proctor & Gamble Corporation.

261
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,220
I don't believe they are anymore.

262
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,440
But at the time,

263
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:24,900
P&G had a HPC division.

264
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,550
And they have to

265
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:32,193
package their household
products very fast, right?

266
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,780
Pringles, if you have ever eaten them,

267
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,350
they're shaped kind of like this.

268
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:39,510
They're like a wing or half a wing.

269
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:41,708
And the way they package these things,

270
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:43,650
they're blown into the can

271
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:45,500
very fast and very much precision.

272
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,560
Well to do that at really
high speeds and at volume,

273
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,010
you need computer modeling,

274
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:51,470
super-computer modeling to do that.

275
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:52,303
And that's what they do.

276
00:11:52,303 --> 00:11:53,720
And they would do the same thing with like

277
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,480
spinning the toilet paper
rolls and things like.

278
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,442
So it's gotten adopted by
other things than science.

279
00:12:00,442 --> 00:12:05,442
Not so much the scale that you
would do in the National Labs

280
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:07,660
and weapons modeling,

281
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,270
and Department of Defense
applications and things.

282
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:14,620
People are trying to
adopt these computers more

283
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:17,130
in maybe smaller industries.

284
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:19,010
It's been kind of a challenge.

285
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:20,240
But the final thing

286
00:12:21,656 --> 00:12:23,060
I'd like you to take away from this slide

287
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:27,989
is that HPC is a very
specialized architecture

288
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:31,370
compared to regular IT,
your desktop or your laptop,

289
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:32,203
or something.

290
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:36,750
And it's programming is very specialized

291
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:37,980
and very hard to do.

292
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,640
One spends a lifetime learning to do this.

293
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:44,330
And for many years,
nuclear weapons design,

294
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,870
things like intelligence
cryptography needs

295
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:49,678
drove the US supercomputing industry.

296
00:12:49,678 --> 00:12:51,450
And it helped make the fortunes

297
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:54,610
of companies like IBM
and Cray, it really did.

298
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:57,950
And over time, machines kept increasing

299
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:59,550
in speed and capability.

300
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:02,510
And I'll talk to more detail
in that in a little bit.

301
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:05,319
And the big point is they
were made in America.

302
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,273
The fact is, this is no longer the case.

303
00:13:09,597 --> 00:13:10,850
It's gonna haunt us for the most part.

304
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:12,530
And it's hurting our cybersecurity.

305
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:14,183
This is not the case any more.

306
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,430
The components, everything
is not US-made anymore.

307
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,665
That's something to be concerned about.

308
00:13:20,665 --> 00:13:22,790
We had no foreign competition either,

309
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:25,000
so everything used to
be US Government driven

310
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,560
and that's not true anymore at all.

311
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,569
I'll get into that more later.

312
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:32,860
But again, gradual
adoption by some industry,

313
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:35,270
but not on the scale we'd
probably like to see.

314
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:36,380
We'll talk about that.

315
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:38,060
Let me go on to the next slide.

316
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:41,359
All right, so I think
I also need to set up

317
00:13:42,769 --> 00:13:45,100
a good portion of this talk
that is about cybersecurity,

318
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:48,740
I wanna a little more about what sets HPC,

319
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:49,940
high-performance computing,

320
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,710
apart from other information tech.

321
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:54,160
You might think, "Oh, it's
just a lot of computers

322
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:54,992
wired together."

323
00:13:54,993 --> 00:13:55,943
Not exactly.

324
00:13:57,291 --> 00:14:00,357
HPC usually refers to the practice

325
00:14:00,357 --> 00:14:03,370
of aggregating computer power in a way

326
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:06,013
that delivers much higher
performance than one could get

327
00:14:06,013 --> 00:14:09,030
over your typical desktop or workstation

328
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,630
in order to solve big problems

329
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:13,780
in science, engineering,
sometimes business.

330
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:17,173
It's a rarefied field and
not a common profession.

331
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,939
Ask yourself, when was the last time

332
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:22,380
you asked someone, "What
do you do for a living?"

333
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,571
And they say, "I'm an HPC scientist."

334
00:14:24,571 --> 00:14:26,160
(laughs) Probably once in
your life or something.

335
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,350
It's a small field.

336
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:29,210
It's a small community.

337
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:31,300
Everybody knows one another.

338
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,520
It's just the way it's evolved.

339
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,430
There are various reasons for that.

340
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:37,280
There's no one goes to college

341
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,250
and gets a degree in
high-performance computing.

342
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,120
It's not offered.

343
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,000
You might get a computer science degree

344
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,860
or engineering degree.

345
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:46,650
But then often, what happened to me,

346
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:50,640
I got a fellowship to
Los Alamos Lab in 1993.

347
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:54,770
And I went out there to finish my PhD work

348
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:57,610
and start learning some of this stuff.

349
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:00,330
And often it's something you do,

350
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:02,560
it's almost like you have
to learn as an apprentice

351
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,589
or on the job to do this kind of thing.

352
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:07,750
And so people often spend 20 years

353
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,110
trying to learn to program
these kind of computers.

354
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,513
It's very difficult.

355
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:15,940
You can't compare it to being a developer

356
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,080
or something like this.

357
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,423
You can't go to GitHub and get the code.

358
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:24,910
Stuff is still often programmed
in Fortran, some C++,

359
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:29,150
older languages that not
a lot of younger people

360
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:30,430
are going into today.

361
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:34,370
And I'll talk to that sociology
part of it a little later on

362
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:36,970
and why that is and how
that's changing the field.

363
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:40,130
But these machines are
optimized for high performance.

364
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:41,610
You have to do this,

365
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:44,140
because often the scientific problem sets

366
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:47,400
people are studying in Astrophysics,

367
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,410
you have to include things
like changing times,

368
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:52,520
multiple dimensions,

369
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,810
changing densities that are
happening in your material.

370
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:59,650
And all this eats up memory,
lots and lots of memory.

371
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:00,920
Again, I think I mentioned,

372
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:04,020
if someone is studying the
topic of how the sun burns,

373
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:06,563
and it's really complicated stuff.

374
00:16:09,809 --> 00:16:10,963
And because it's so difficult to do,

375
00:16:10,963 --> 00:16:14,270
it makes this HPC something
of a closed community.

376
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:17,319
And so it's kind of an
exclusive club in some ways.

377
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,550
And so that has affected
the state of the field,

378
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:24,699
and ultimately security and
where we're going forward.

379
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:27,890
I have another slide on that
topic a little later on.

380
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:30,754
One thing HPCs, people often ask

381
00:16:30,754 --> 00:16:34,130
"Well, how is that different
from cloud or data computing?"

382
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:37,780
Well, so HPCs actually need
to sit physically close,

383
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:40,730
kinda like pictured here, to one another

384
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:42,530
to avoid lags in communication

385
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:43,930
the way that the problems are run.

386
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:45,540
And so this is different from cloud

387
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:49,120
where servers can be hundreds of miles

388
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,260
or thousands of miles
apart, it doesn't matter.

389
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:55,439
HPCs often support some
types of exotic hardware.

390
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,780
Yes, they do use
conventional semiconductors

391
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:01,829
produced all over the
world, particularly in Asia.

392
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:05,920
But things like special
interconnect technologies

393
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,040
have been developed for them

394
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,670
that let the machines communicate

395
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:11,099
with one another more easily.

396
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:13,290
It's just the architecture
is kinda specialized.

397
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:17,659
And so software, again Fortran, some C++,

398
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:21,690
there's some stuff done in
Linux and Unix to some degree.

399
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:26,043
And then the other thing
that makes HPC stand apart,

400
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,453
they have extreme energy demands.

401
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:35,900
Our next goal in HPC is to
get to the exascale level.

402
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:39,010
I'll talk to what that
means in a few minutes.

403
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:41,480
The working exascale computer,

404
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,540
they're projecting it's going to require

405
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:47,270
anywhere from 20 to 65
megawatts of power annually.

406
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:49,270
The cost to build is high too.

407
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:51,370
Depending on the size of the machine,

408
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:54,189
they can cost from 20 to 400 million

409
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:55,087
to build one of these things.

410
00:17:55,087 --> 00:17:56,440
And so it's expensive.

411
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,120
And my last bullet here,

412
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,439
I'm not gonna read all the bullets,

413
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,823
that's just not my style.

414
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:06,550
You might think of HPC as a Ferrari

415
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:10,750
and your desktop or laptops as a Toyota.

416
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:13,570
In that the Toyotas were
the utilitarian thing

417
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:14,403
for everyday use,

418
00:18:14,403 --> 00:18:17,790
the HPC is for very specialized
and fast processing.

419
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:20,250
So I've always liked that analogy.

420
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,343
So the next slide, slide five,

421
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:25,440
I wanna talk a little bit about,

422
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,120
again, I'm a social scientist.

423
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,159
And as a social scientist,

424
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,100
I do focus some on people and what they do

425
00:18:33,444 --> 00:18:36,945
and how humanity and technology interacts

426
00:18:36,945 --> 00:18:39,300
and how that affects society.

427
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,110
And I've done this for a long time.

428
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:45,409
And something I've observed
in the last 20 to 25 years

429
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:47,197
in the field of HPC is what I like to call

430
00:18:47,197 --> 00:18:49,522
"The Pursuit of Machoflops."

431
00:18:49,522 --> 00:18:52,340
And this isn't mean to be facetious.

432
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,550
I actually didn't invent this term.

433
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:57,629
It was a term invented
by the vendors, industry.

434
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:59,740
And I don't know what company.

435
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:04,740
But way back 20 to 25 years ago,

436
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:08,550
the vendors would be
selling their machinery

437
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:12,450
to the government and to private buyers.

438
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:14,240
And they would say, "Oh, so and so

439
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,710
just is selling you machoflops.

440
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:19,553
They say they got the
best FLOPS and they don't.

441
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,600
My machine is better than theirs.

442
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,949
Or mine is bigger than theirs."

443
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:26,930
And so what that refers to

444
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:30,100
is the speed that
high-performance computers

445
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:30,933
are measured in.

446
00:19:30,933 --> 00:19:34,080
And so, that's FLoating-point
Operations Per Second,

447
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,919
or FLOPS.

448
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,470
For as long as I can remember,

449
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:40,010
this is how high-end computers,

450
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:41,280
their speed is measured.

451
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:46,280
And so back in the day
of the earliest HPC,

452
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,060
the ENIAC that I mentioned,

453
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,700
it was John von Neumann's baby,

454
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,000
ran at something like 500 FLOPS.

455
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,020
Well we've come a really
long way since then.

456
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:59,300
And the world's fastest
machine today, it's in Japan.

457
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:02,129
It's the Japanese Fugaku Supercomputer

458
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:03,330
is currently number one.

459
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:05,990
It's at 442 teraflops.

460
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:07,300
I have a little chart over here

461
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:11,350
that kinda talks to how
the speeds are measured in.

462
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:13,939
Right now we're in the teraflop range

463
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,550
and we're getting up
to the petaflop range.

464
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:19,103
And so the next goal is exaflops.

465
00:20:20,256 --> 00:20:23,140
And from what I hear from my colleagues

466
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:27,446
who expect to get there in
another year, maybe two years,

467
00:20:27,446 --> 00:20:31,280
whether it's practical or
usable we'll wait to see.

468
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,200
But that's how we measure it.

469
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,130
But what this is based on,

470
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:37,670
I got a logo up in the
top-right corner here

471
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,860
is the Top500 list.

472
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:43,080
This is the kind of standard, if you will,

473
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:48,080
for how we rank the world's
fastest supercomputers.

474
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:51,649
And it was started by a
gentleman named Jack Dongarra

475
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:53,960
and his colleagues about 25 years ago.

476
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,700
And Jack, he's a colleague of mine,

477
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,010
he's a great guy.

478
00:20:57,010 --> 00:21:01,070
And they needed a way to
standardize and compare

479
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:03,443
how these machines perform.

480
00:21:05,048 --> 00:21:07,168
And what that is, is the Top500 list,

481
00:21:07,168 --> 00:21:09,040
they will go around,

482
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,500
and anyone can participate,
it's not mandatory,

483
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,430
it's voluntary.

484
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:14,710
And the owner of whatever computer

485
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:18,190
can say "Come and take a
measurement of my machine."

486
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:19,090
And they'll come out

487
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:22,320
and they'll run a standard
set of linear equations

488
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,153
on that computer.

489
00:21:23,153 --> 00:21:24,400
And it will take the measurement

490
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,940
of how it performs on the same set.

491
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:29,200
And it's always the same set
of problems so it's equal.

492
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,537
And they will go around
and measure these things.

493
00:21:31,537 --> 00:21:34,130
And so it's become basically an industry.

494
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:36,400
And it's presented every
year at Supercomputing

495
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,233
and then again

496
00:21:37,233 --> 00:21:39,060
at the International
Supercomputing Conference

497
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,710
in Germany in June.

498
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:43,503
So the list gets updated twice a year.

499
00:21:45,303 --> 00:21:49,110
So the thing about this Top500 list,

500
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:50,179
it's a good measure.

501
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:52,730
And it's really the only thing out there.

502
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:54,940
There are some alternatives to it,

503
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:59,890
the Green500, which measures
supercomputers eco imprint,

504
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:00,723
I guess you could say

505
00:22:00,723 --> 00:22:03,840
or how much energy it
takes, which is important,

506
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,250
because these things use a lot of energy.

507
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:09,582
But my point on this
whole machoflops thing,

508
00:22:09,582 --> 00:22:11,850
and this is the subject
of a book I published

509
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:13,423
and I'll show it here,

510
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:17,312
in an edited collection
called "Feedback Loops."

511
00:22:17,312 --> 00:22:19,199
Andrew Garnar and Ashley
Shew were the editors of it.

512
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,280
I can show you like that.

513
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,740
And I've got it up on the screen anyway.

514
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:27,530
But I published a chapter
last fall in this book

515
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:30,080
that talks about "The
Pursuit of Machoflops:

516
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,199
the Rise and Fall of
High-Performance Computing."

517
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,620
And we're kind of in a downward trend

518
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,850
in high-performance computing now.

519
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:39,669
Because I believe, and a lot
of people in the field believe,

520
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:44,670
there's been too much emphasis
among the HPC community

521
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:48,976
on just really getting to
number one on this list.

522
00:22:48,976 --> 00:22:50,620
It's a cool thing, right,

523
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,209
it's something to brag about.

524
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:53,043
It's important.

525
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:57,034
Many nations feel like this is

526
00:22:57,034 --> 00:23:00,759
their sort of, what do you call it?

527
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:05,070
A national moment, a
point of national pride.

528
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:07,429
I think is what I'm trying to say.

529
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:09,730
The more machines or the most you have

530
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:10,760
at the top of the list

531
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,820
was really a great place
to be for nerdy people

532
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:17,169
who like to work on this kind
of thing, including myself.

533
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:19,780
But I feel, and having
a lot of discussions

534
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,500
with folks I've worked
with over the years,

535
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,080
there's just a little too much
emphasis on being number one

536
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:24,913
on this machine,

537
00:23:24,913 --> 00:23:29,630
because you can run the Top500,

538
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:31,283
the LINPACK benchmark it's called,

539
00:23:31,283 --> 00:23:33,449
this is the linear equations set,

540
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:35,350
and get a really great rating.

541
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:39,830
But then when you put a real
world problem on your computer,

542
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:43,082
like a nuclear weapons design
or something like this,

543
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,510
it slows way down.

544
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:48,560
And so it's not really designed,

545
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,899
the Top500 list doesn't really show,

546
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,340
I think in all fairness,

547
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:55,870
accurately how good your machine is doing.

548
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:59,270
And so it's not perfect.

549
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:02,090
It's gonna need to evolve and it is.

550
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:06,510
But it's an indicator
also of global changes,

551
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:07,910
and one is the rise of China,

552
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:10,680
which is something that
I'm concerned about

553
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:13,900
in that China as a country,

554
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:14,733
you may not know this,

555
00:24:14,733 --> 00:24:18,980
before the year 2000, had no
machines on this Top500 list.

556
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:22,050
Today they have something like 214,

557
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:23,399
last time I looked.

558
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,260
And I'll get back to this a little later

559
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,920
about the changing state of globalization.

560
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,780
And these are cybersecurity issues

561
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:33,160
and so these are national security issues,

562
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,450
economic security.

563
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:37,700
And so keep that in mind as we go through.

564
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:41,460
And finally, there's been
little substantive innovation

565
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,730
in high-performance computing architecture

566
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:44,870
in the last 25 years.

567
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:48,070
Somewhat in interconnects
and a few things,

568
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:51,810
but what happens is that as
we've been going forward,

569
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:53,649
the hardware advances a little bit,

570
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:56,090
but the software hasn't always
advanced as much with it

571
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:57,433
which you need equally.

572
00:24:59,377 --> 00:25:01,570
The result is that HPC as we know it

573
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:03,409
is something on the decline.

574
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:06,391
I'll talk more about
this a little bit too.

575
00:25:06,391 --> 00:25:07,224
And what does it mean

576
00:25:07,224 --> 00:25:10,919
if you have the world's fastest
computer on the Top500 list

577
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:14,237
or biggest computer and you
can't do that much with it

578
00:25:14,237 --> 00:25:15,970
in the real world problems?

579
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:18,080
So keep that in mind as we go forward.

580
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,090
And this is something
that needs to resolve.

581
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:24,330
And I think will get
resolved as we go forward.

582
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:25,409
So the state of HPC,

583
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:27,820
I'm gonna bring us up
to the present today.

584
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:30,590
And as I mentioned earlier,

585
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:34,310
HPC is a rarefied but so important field.

586
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:37,970
And little innovation
in the last 25 years.

587
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:39,610
Moore's Law is coming to an end.

588
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:40,990
Some of you probably know this,

589
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:43,640
but Moore's Law was
named after Gordon Moore,

590
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:46,450
who's one of the founders
of Intel Corporation.

591
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:48,570
And it's not a law in the legal sense

592
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:50,460
but an observation he made

593
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,960
that the number of transistors

594
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:55,270
in a dense integrated circuit
doubles about every two years.

595
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:58,120
And that's happened pretty steadily

596
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,489
through our recent history.

597
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:02,890
But that's starting to
break down at this point.

598
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:07,890
And so when you can't put any
more transistors on a chip,

599
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:09,380
you just have problems.

600
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:12,153
And then Dennard scaling
has already ended.

601
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:17,499
It's a similar thing to Moore's
Law where he talks about,

602
00:26:17,499 --> 00:26:19,710
Robert Dennard was a tech giant.

603
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:22,280
And he and his colleagues
observed that transistors

604
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:25,100
as they reduce in size, their
power density stays constant,

605
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,600
but that's not happening anymore

606
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,500
So when you get things so small,

607
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,740
there's leakage and all
these strange things happen

608
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,583
and it causes the chip to heat up,

609
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:38,430
thermal runaway and
increase in energy costs,

610
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:41,080
and can be failure in the machine,

611
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,149
which can be a cybersecurity issue

612
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:46,210
if that machine is not operating properly.

613
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:48,670
So other thing that's happened,

614
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:51,320
and nobody really foresaw
this I don't think,

615
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,000
is that in the last few decades

616
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,010
you have the rise of Big Tech,

617
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:58,410
and that's private
industry, not government.

618
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:02,290
It's what the stock market
likes call FAANG companies,

619
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:07,129
that's what, Facebook, Alphabet,
Apple, Netflix, and Google,

620
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:07,963
I believe.

621
00:27:07,963 --> 00:27:09,909
And it's really caught
up and surpassed HPC

622
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:13,130
as the driver of economic things.

623
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:17,090
And there's just a lot
of change has happened.

624
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:18,260
And it happened so fast.

625
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:21,240
We don't have time to really
sit back and reflect on it.

626
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,270
And whatever your political views,

627
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:25,680
this is not a political talk,

628
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:30,680
but Twitter silenced President
Trump after the election.

629
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:34,420
It wasn't the government did that.

630
00:27:35,449 --> 00:27:38,430
And the power they have
is quite astonishing

631
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:40,660
if you sit back and think about it.

632
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,030
What I want to add too,

633
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:46,290
going back to I showed a copy
of "The Innovator's Dilemma,"

634
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:48,850
Clay Christensen's book from about,

635
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:49,959
it's probably 20 years old now,

636
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,360
but it's still really great.

637
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:53,530
When Clay Christensen

638
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:55,562
was looking at Silicon Valley companies,

639
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,250
he coined the notion of what
he called Customer Capitalism

640
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:02,480
as driving tech innovation today.

641
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,060
And companies are driven now
to delight their customers.

642
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:09,760
They have to have the greatest
and latest cool thing.

643
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,550
And people want the new PS5.

644
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:16,149
I recently read on Reddit
that there are some groups

645
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:18,817
that are devoted to driving around

646
00:28:18,817 --> 00:28:21,700
and posting where you
can find a PlayStation 5,

647
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,050
because you can't find them right now,

648
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:24,080
there's a chip shortage,

649
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,780
which I'll get to in a little bit.

650
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:28,300
And people, they don't
care how the device works,

651
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:31,560
but you gotta have your latest iPhone.

652
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:34,120
I can't unlock my house

653
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,530
without these things practically today

654
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:37,530
or people start their car with them.

655
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:40,703
And it's just become so expected,

656
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,149
but they don't care how it works.

657
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:49,150
And so that has really
driven innovation in IT.

658
00:28:49,497 --> 00:28:54,250
And it hasn't been HPC and
the government anymore,

659
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:55,120
that's changed.

660
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:59,070
And so all these factors I've covered here

661
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,362
in the last few slides,

662
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:03,480
plus that cybersecurity in a sense

663
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:08,480
has not really been a high
priority of HPC designers.

664
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:11,408
They didn't have to be in many ways.

665
00:29:11,408 --> 00:29:13,358
And I'll get to that in the next slide.

666
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,633
But I think that's changing.

667
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:18,153
Let me go to the next slide.

668
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,800
So cybersecurity and HPC,

669
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:27,460
there's some, we'll say,
unique challenges in that.

670
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,840
And I'm not saying that HPC is going away,

671
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:34,413
it's just evolving today and
I'll talk more later on that.

672
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,243
Here I mean, in this context,

673
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:43,400
cybersecurity in terms of reliability.

674
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,920
I've mentioned that there are
exascale computing projects

675
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:49,720
well underway down at
Oak Ridge National Lab

676
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,270
and I believe there are others.

677
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:54,290
If you have something,

678
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:59,290
say you have a time-sensitive,
say medical modeling problem

679
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:03,730
where people's lives are at stake,

680
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:07,350
HPC has been supporting
the COVID modeling effort,

681
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:10,939
for example, in a big
way which has been good.

682
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:12,550
But if you have something,
say for example,

683
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:14,000
that people's lives are at stake

684
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,220
and your reliability decreases.

685
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:19,980
That cam be a cybersecurity
problem if the machine fails.

686
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:24,980
And so generally, as you scale
up on these kind of machines,

687
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,580
the reliability decreases

688
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:29,790
for some of the reasons we talked about.

689
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:32,795
And then you have these
extreme power requirements

690
00:30:32,795 --> 00:30:37,160
and leakage from your
semiconductors and things

691
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,380
and do you solve that?

692
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:41,330
People are still trying
to figure that out.

693
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:45,342
And there's just a lot of
different forces at work in this,

694
00:30:46,517 --> 00:30:49,083
that are all technical,
and social, and political.

695
00:30:50,036 --> 00:30:51,830
HPC is a community, again,

696
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:52,663
being a social scientist

697
00:30:52,663 --> 00:30:56,100
I tend to look at people and
culture more than others.

698
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,699
And I've noticed, again

699
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:01,973
studying this for 26 or so years now,

700
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:05,740
there's a sort of what I
call cultural exceptionalism

701
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:08,640
in some of the HPC
community is still present.

702
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:12,310
And so it has to do with
the exclusive culture

703
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:14,095
that we talked about in HPC.

704
00:31:14,095 --> 00:31:15,050
And it's so rarefied

705
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:17,040
and not a lot of people
do this for a living

706
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,649
and they tend to
congregate in remote places

707
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:23,713
like the National Labs and
in scientific institutions.

708
00:31:25,403 --> 00:31:26,236
And I've seen

709
00:31:26,236 --> 00:31:29,290
that certain government
HPC communities bristle

710
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:33,440
when they ask Hewlett-Packard, HP, or IBM

711
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,960
to build a certain item for them

712
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,020
and IBM and HP just won't do it.

713
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:40,800
And they don't understand why.

714
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,080
And I think they don't understand

715
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,330
that they're no longer the driver of this.

716
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:47,310
HP, IBM, others, Intel,

717
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:49,500
they can't make as much
money from the government

718
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,090
as they can from the private sector

719
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:53,179
as we talked about a
little on the last slide.

720
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:55,293
And it's also, it's hard.

721
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,449
People are people and it's
harder for anyone to let go

722
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:02,050
of something you've spent
your life building, right?

723
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,990
If you're interested in this,

724
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:08,853
I think one of the best books
on people who design tech,

725
00:32:10,402 --> 00:32:11,360
the book's from 1981,

726
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,129
is Tracy Kidder's "Soul
of the New Machine."

727
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:18,510
I teach this in my History of
Computing and Software course

728
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:19,350
at Virginia Tech,

729
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:22,600
which I do every once in
a while as an adjunct.

730
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,730
It's a great read.

731
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:24,990
It's a timeless book.

732
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:26,420
It's about Data General,

733
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,450
those of you who are old enough

734
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:29,994
to remember that company (laughs)

735
00:32:29,994 --> 00:32:32,399
that went out of business at some point.

736
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,610
But it talks a lot about the people

737
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:38,189
and heroes in it and antiheroes,
and it's a great read.

738
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:39,490
And I can understand,

739
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:40,940
people don't like change.

740
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:43,410
That's we're all guilty of that.

741
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:45,253
But change is inevitable.

742
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,500
It's gonna happen, no matter what.

743
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:51,480
So HPC is definitely in a state of

744
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:56,639
paradigm shift, Thomas
Kuhn paradigm shift,

745
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,667
and what Professor Christensen called

746
00:32:59,667 --> 00:33:02,050
"The Innovators' Dilemma"
and technological change,

747
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:03,592
technological revolution.

748
00:33:04,695 --> 00:33:07,040
And that's again the changing
disciplinary boundaries

749
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:10,600
as the rise of consumer driven
data computing is coming,

750
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,870
and A.I. programming,

751
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:14,379
and things like this Internet of Things.

752
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:17,420
And there's also, I feel
there's always opportunity

753
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:18,970
to be found in this kind of change.

754
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:21,153
So let's go to the next slide.

755
00:33:24,125 --> 00:33:27,180
You can see my topic,
cybersecurity and HPC.

756
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:32,180
I don't know if there's anything
really too unique about it

757
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:37,820
in that HPC has some
built-in physical advantages

758
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:40,740
to securing itself.

759
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:44,010
And so here I'm referring to cybersecurity

760
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:46,570
in terms of what I call
the traditional senses,

761
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:50,072
hacking and people
breaking into it and such.

762
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:53,170
As I said, it's very specific,

763
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:57,590
used for certain sets of problems
that most people don't do.

764
00:33:57,590 --> 00:34:02,129
And by that in itself makes
it a little more secure.

765
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:03,850
It's often very customized,

766
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:05,219
specialized hardware and software

767
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:08,690
that very few people know to design

768
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:10,409
or work that or use it,

769
00:34:10,409 --> 00:34:14,920
which makes it a bit harder to access.

770
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,949
And the components are
physically close together.

771
00:34:16,949 --> 00:34:19,239
The data doesn't have to
travel very far usually

772
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:20,179
as with cloud.

773
00:34:20,179 --> 00:34:23,589
And you have often, in government,

774
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:28,590
HPCs are dependent for say
like defense-related problem

775
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:32,433
such as modeling a aircraft
carrier or something,

776
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,929
these machines are in closed settings

777
00:34:35,929 --> 00:34:37,120
on a military base

778
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,603
or closed behind a fence.

779
00:34:39,603 --> 00:34:42,236
And foreign nationals
don't have access to them.

780
00:34:42,237 --> 00:34:44,900
And so they're secure in that sense.

781
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,730
And again the language too,

782
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:50,830
so many still run programs like Fortran.

783
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:52,270
They're programmed in Fortran.

784
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:55,493
Younger people don't
tend to use those things.

785
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:04,265
It's not necessarily a big problem.

786
00:35:04,265 --> 00:35:06,470
I'm gonna finish up on
my last couple slides,

787
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:09,212
'cause I've only got a
few minutes left here.

788
00:35:09,213 --> 00:35:11,563
Let me go to the next,
I think I have two left.

789
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:19,370
Okay, so I wanna make some
recommendations to finish off.

790
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:21,930
We have to view extreme scale security

791
00:35:23,308 --> 00:35:24,733
at a macro and a micro level.

792
00:35:24,733 --> 00:35:26,603
From a national perspective,

793
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:31,079
we may see that President
Biden back in February

794
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:33,490
put out an executive order
on America's supply chains

795
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:35,129
because there was a chip shortage.

796
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:37,120
And the chip supply chain is global.

797
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,130
That's a little scary.

798
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:41,040
Intel made an announcement
in the wake of that,

799
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,620
they're going to onshore production.

800
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:43,720
That's great.

801
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:47,359
Like it's great for national
security and cybersecurity,

802
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:50,160
reinvigorate the Made in America idea.

803
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:54,120
Intel's supposed to fill
two new semiconductor fabs

804
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,339
in Arizona.

805
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:59,480
And Post Moore's architecture
as we move to ubicomp,

806
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:02,800
that's like taking data
computing over here and HPC

807
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,200
and bringing them together.

808
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,850
It's more affordable to do.

809
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:07,950
It'll present opportunities.

810
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:09,899
And definitely need to focus on things

811
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:14,900
like technical STEM education
at the elementary level.

812
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:19,420
And we need to be thinking big about this.

813
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:22,623
So I've got a couple minutes left here.

814
00:36:23,705 --> 00:36:26,950
We need to design for data,
not processor performance,

815
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:30,821
not machoflops, not beating
everyone on the Top500 list.

816
00:36:30,822 --> 00:36:34,110
And hire more cybersecurity specialists,

817
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:36,010
probably on a per project basis.

818
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:37,350
And I like to say,

819
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:39,000
odds are in another 40 years,

820
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,708
we're not gonna recognize
HPC as we do now.

821
00:36:41,708 --> 00:36:43,030
It's evolved.

822
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:47,240
People tend to accept what
technology is available to them

823
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,073
and they will.

824
00:36:48,073 --> 00:36:50,740
And I think we're gonna see a
lot of very interesting things

825
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:54,839
on the horizon as things
like A.I. computing mature,

826
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,490
which is till not mature.

827
00:36:56,490 --> 00:37:00,259
But we're going to have a secure future

828
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:05,260
and be machines that can
learn and things like this.

829
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:08,343
And my last slide, where to go from here.

830
00:37:09,718 --> 00:37:11,970
We need to include interdisciplinary teams

831
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:13,770
when we do these research and solutions

832
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:15,830
and not just engineers and technologists,

833
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:18,040
like social scientists
and people who understand

834
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:20,410
things like language and culture.

835
00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:22,009
Diversity is a big thing.

836
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:24,406
So we're moving forward,

837
00:37:24,406 --> 00:37:26,009
people from diverse backgrounds

838
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:28,650
have unique insights into things

839
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:30,713
to rethink the HPC workforce.

840
00:37:32,074 --> 00:37:33,760
And to really support STEM education.

841
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,290
This was a big important thing of mine.

842
00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:38,420
So that's what I've got today.

843
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:40,740
I'm here to answer questions

844
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:41,810
when this runs live

845
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:44,160
and I appreciate your
spending a little time with me

846
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,350
this afternoon.

847
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:46,980
And thank you for your attention.

848
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,500
If you want to get in touch with me,

849
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,610
I have an email here you can see.

850
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:52,490
I'm always happy to chat.

851
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:54,189
So thank you for your time today.

852
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:56,140
I've had a good time speaking with you.
