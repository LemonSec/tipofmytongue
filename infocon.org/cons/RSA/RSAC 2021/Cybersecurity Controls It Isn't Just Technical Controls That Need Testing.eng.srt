1
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:03,200
Hi, I'm Glauco Sampaio.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,240
I'm Chief Information,
Security, Fraud Prevention

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,410
and Privacy Officer at Cielo in Brazil.

4
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:12,210
It's a pleasure to be here with all of you

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,690
talking about security, cybersecurity

6
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:16,930
in RSA Conference 2021.

7
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:18,960
I will talk today about test.

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,230
Test is something that we as
cybersecurity professionals

9
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:24,840
do it all the time.

10
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,550
But I want to show something

11
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,030
that I consider really important

12
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:31,580
and can bring good results for us

13
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:33,129
as cybersecurity professionals.

14
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:35,750
Are we secure?

15
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:36,923
That's the question.

16
00:00:37,944 --> 00:00:39,050
We heard this a lot

17
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:40,419
from

18
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:43,440
our boss or from our executives

19
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,269
or even from our team.

20
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:48,610
And it's really hard to ensure this.

21
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:51,370
We cannot ensure that we are secure.

22
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:55,239
But we work hard every day to be better

23
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,690
and to improve the
security of our company.

24
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,940
But how can we guarantee this?

25
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:00,949
What's the methods for?

26
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:03,590
How can we as cybersecurity professionals

27
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:07,860
can ensure and can elevate
the level of the security

28
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,130
in our companies?

29
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:10,493
That's part of our job.

30
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,649
And to do this,

31
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:17,940
we use a bunch a lot of type of tests.

32
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:20,880
We have a different types of this.

33
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,860
We can do tests in application level

34
00:01:25,443 --> 00:01:26,370
as SAST, DAST,

35
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:28,750
IAST, MAST,

36
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,430
static keys, dynamic keys,

37
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:31,900
running through applications,

38
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,110
running manually.

39
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:36,150
We can do tests on the database security

40
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:39,780
using vulnerability scans solutions.

41
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,050
We do manual tests like ethical hacking

42
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:43,259
and pentest to try

43
00:01:45,532 --> 00:01:50,110
to penetrate in a company
to bypass the controls.

44
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,153
We have a big number of this.

45
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:56,270
It's not just this tests
that are in your screens.

46
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:58,160
We have more than this.

47
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,410
But, is this enough?

48
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:01,423
That's the question.

49
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:03,910
All of them they matter.

50
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:04,770
They matter.

51
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:07,039
They must be part of our strategy.

52
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,890
They are good.

53
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,810
They can find the vulnerability,

54
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,520
they can help us to correct what's wrong,

55
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,230
what are not following the policies,

56
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:17,760
the software development policies,

57
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,593
the infrastructure,

58
00:02:18,593 --> 00:02:20,359
the patch management policies.

59
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,330
They find this type of issues

60
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:27,350
and we have to use them
to improve the security.

61
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:29,823
It must be part of our strategy.

62
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:34,360
But the question is this enough?

63
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,950
That's my main question and this something

64
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:42,000
that I'm working hard from the beginning.

65
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,913
And connects the question
that are we secure?

66
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:49,650
I'm not feel comfortable
to answer this question

67
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,310
that we are secure or not

68
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:57,280
because we have different
things to learn all the time.

69
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,560
The scenarios has change.

70
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,620
The environments has change.

71
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:04,090
New technicals and new
tacticals of the attack

72
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:05,890
appears all the time.

73
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:09,209
And the tests that we
are running before this

74
00:03:10,493 --> 00:03:13,660
is not enough to ensure what we are...

75
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:17,770
What we have to ensure.

76
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:18,603
So,

77
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,500
this is the bigger problem.

78
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,640
We have a big number of controls.

79
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,653
If you take a look of our companies.

80
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:31,260
And make a quick map of what we have

81
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:33,063
in place

82
00:03:34,315 --> 00:03:35,240
in the environment.

83
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,560
We can find hundreds of controls

84
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,770
from the most basic like patch management,

85
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:42,210
firewall rules.

86
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:44,100
To the most advanced things like

87
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,320
data loss prevention controls,

88
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,920
web applications, protections,

89
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,410
and

90
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:53,220
all of the controls that
support our policies

91
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:56,883
and support the level of
security of the company.

92
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,290
And we have to.

93
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:01,570
Is part of our job, ensure this

94
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:03,609
that we have a big number of control.

95
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,090
We must have this.

96
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:09,143
But we have to ensure that
this control is working good.

97
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,050
And we saw a big number

98
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:16,579
of securities incidence breach
data leakage all the time.

99
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:18,632
We are seeing the media.

100
00:04:18,632 --> 00:04:21,149
We are seeing this in our own companies.

101
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:24,609
We are working on this all the time.

102
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:25,443
And

103
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:29,560
we have to be mind that

104
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,950
we are in the middle of something,

105
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:35,050
in the middle of the company

106
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,823
to respond on incidents.

107
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,800
And most of the times

108
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,830
when we look at the big incidents,

109
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,979
we saw that basic issues

110
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,213
are finded

111
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,320
on the forensics.

112
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:52,010
We saw that controls that must be in place

113
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:53,340
for a long

114
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,080
is not working anymore.

115
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,073
And they can cause incidents.

116
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:01,539
We also be surprised about audit finds

117
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:04,640
and audit finds not for new things

118
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,842
but for all things.

119
00:05:06,976 --> 00:05:09,330
For issues that we

120
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:10,690
solve it before.

121
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:13,640
We solve these issues
before a long time ago.

122
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:17,419
And the auditor came and
find that the control

123
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,910
is not working as we design.

124
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:21,930
And we received

125
00:05:22,888 --> 00:05:25,270
this recurrence audit find.

126
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,561
And

127
00:05:26,561 --> 00:05:27,861
as cybersecurity executive

128
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:32,293
it's something that makes me
really, really, really sad.

129
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,120
And is it's something
that I talked to my team

130
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,880
that we can and we must avoid

131
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,670
one audit findings

132
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:46,570
that show a problem in
something that we always...

133
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:49,790
We solve before is not good for us

134
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:51,193
as cybersecurity executives.

135
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:53,880
I know

136
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,740
most of the companies

137
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:59,440
have this change management
process to ensure that

138
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,420
every change

139
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:04,832
in the environment are analyzed.

140
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:09,820
And don't cause anything

141
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,240
wrong or can...

142
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,910
Or don't broke anything that was in place.

143
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:16,830
But we cannot

144
00:06:18,704 --> 00:06:19,880
be there all the time.

145
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,070
And we can not guarantee you
when we have a big number

146
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,520
of controls that we are able

147
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:31,109
to guarantee that one
change in the environment

148
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:35,470
are not putting something,
a control, a process

149
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:36,780
or a security

150
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:39,540
technology

151
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,373
outside

152
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,640
the designed process.

153
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,820
One change in the network can cause

154
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:50,140
a security bypass or even

155
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:50,973
a change

156
00:06:51,896 --> 00:06:54,900
in the Windows policy can broke something

157
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:59,130
can change the configuration
of the security issue.

158
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:02,260
So, we cannot trust in

159
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:04,570
full time in the change management.

160
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:08,800
Even if we have security
guys looking at the change.

161
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,260
We cannot guarantee that the guy

162
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,590
who are implementing something

163
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:15,869
are completely

164
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:16,703
focus

165
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:17,536
and

166
00:07:18,488 --> 00:07:20,260
don't do anything wrong

167
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:23,000
and disable or change something

168
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:27,950
that calls a security
flaw on the environment.

169
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,280
They can disable

170
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:31,863
a security control.

171
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,219
So,

172
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,130
what can you do

173
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:38,860
about this?

174
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:42,570
We are not able to see
everything that's working.

175
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:43,403
That's...

176
00:07:43,403 --> 00:07:44,690
Everything that are done

177
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:47,380
in our environment.

178
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,719
But we have to do something.

179
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,920
We have to do

180
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,990
our job and

181
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:54,493
try to find this.

182
00:07:54,493 --> 00:07:55,500
This issues.

183
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,660
We have to run more tests

184
00:07:58,660 --> 00:07:59,584
to find

185
00:07:59,584 --> 00:08:00,890
that

186
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:04,320
if the controls that are
in place at an company

187
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,950
are still there working

188
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,933
as are design.

189
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:10,157
And I will show this five...

190
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:12,010
And I show five examples

191
00:08:13,506 --> 00:08:15,982
of tests to illustrate
what I'm talking about.

192
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:21,402
The first one is focused on
data loss prevention rules.

193
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:26,727
We all know the importance of this.

194
00:08:26,727 --> 00:08:30,493
And we have a bunch of
rules in our DLP solutions.

195
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,010
One for the financial companies

196
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:39,549
are that we cannot allow
credit card information to be

197
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,720
send and received by mail.

198
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:46,570
So we create a rule that not allow this.

199
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:48,290
This email must be blocking

200
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:52,199
when sending internally
or even externally.

201
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,430
And as a process we designed it that

202
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:56,449
if this...

203
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:58,890
If this happened and anyone tries

204
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:02,060
to send a credit card
information through email.

205
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:06,290
A tickets must be opening
in the DLP solution.

206
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:08,240
This email must be blocked

207
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,040
and this tickets must be

208
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,680
treated by an analyst in four hours.

209
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:18,109
And as part of the process the rulebook

210
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:21,890
an email must be send
to notify the superior

211
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:24,160
of the email sender.

212
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:24,992
That's...

213
00:09:24,993 --> 00:09:28,940
It's one example of a process that support

214
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,673
DLP rule.

215
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,140
And what we can do?

216
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,010
We can force this.

217
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:37,040
We can simulate an email.

218
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,120
We can generate a database

219
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,770
of credit card information
and try to send it

220
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:46,689
to a personal email or to
someone in the company.

221
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:50,423
To See if what we
designed is still working.

222
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,350
And

223
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:54,260
with this

224
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,020
test,

225
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,079
what we can get a result.

226
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,400
We can see if the DLP rule

227
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,340
is still matching,

228
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,690
is still blocking the email

229
00:10:07,047 --> 00:10:08,247
as the rule is designed.

230
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:13,430
The ticket is automatically open

231
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:15,703
in the system to be
treated by the analysts.

232
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,339
The analysts is following the rulebook.

233
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,173
They are doing

234
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:25,740
the incident response as
the processes are designed.

235
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,170
And

236
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:29,877
the processes are still
be runned in the SLA

237
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:33,830
in the same...

238
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:36,160
In the four hours that we're designed.

239
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,480
This is one example, we
can test with one email.

240
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,324
We can test if

241
00:10:42,324 --> 00:10:45,300
the whole process are still working

242
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,589
and

243
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:49,603
supporting the cybersecurity control.

244
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,720
Another example is focused

245
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,113
on unauthorized account creation.

246
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:57,490
This happened in every

247
00:10:58,410 --> 00:10:59,242
company.

248
00:10:59,243 --> 00:11:01,410
We know that not just

249
00:11:02,435 --> 00:11:04,640
the cybersecurity and the
guys who are in charge

250
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,300
of the account creation
on Active Directory

251
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,349
has the authorization to do this.

252
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:13,070
And we have to test if
someone are not doing this.

253
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:14,510
So,

254
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:15,569
the rule is,

255
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:18,090
no one outside the IDM solution

256
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:20,200
or the IDM team

257
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,300
are allowed to create users

258
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,050
on the Active Directory.

259
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:27,120
So, if this happened

260
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,370
the whole process

261
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,860
is designed to do.

262
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,310
A ticket, must be opening.

263
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:37,359
This tickets must be
treated in to eight hours.

264
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,570
And we can...

265
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:42,170
We designed it to block the accounts.

266
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:43,762
The new account.

267
00:11:43,763 --> 00:11:48,590
And the creator of this account
must be notified by email

268
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:51,873
that he made something that
is not following the policy.

269
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,083
And, we do this.

270
00:11:56,402 --> 00:11:58,330
We create a credential.

271
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:01,590
We create a user in the Active Directory.

272
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:05,920
Outside using a credential
that is not allowed.

273
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,040
And as results we can see

274
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:10,872
different SIEMs.

275
00:12:13,832 --> 00:12:17,890
We can see if the log is
still going to the SIEM.

276
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:21,040
This is a problem that's
happening all the time.

277
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,390
Someone changed something.

278
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:25,910
And the logs that was
coming through our SIEM

279
00:12:26,825 --> 00:12:27,870
are not coming anymore.

280
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:30,040
So, we have to test this

281
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,400
and this situation can force

282
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:34,672
this scenario.

283
00:12:37,843 --> 00:12:42,198
The alert was generated as we design it.

284
00:12:42,198 --> 00:12:45,843
To check the analyst must
work on their own desires.

285
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:48,654
And this...

286
00:12:48,654 --> 00:12:51,633
The ticket was opened on the system.

287
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,260
It was treated during

288
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,413
the official SLA.

289
00:12:59,116 --> 00:13:01,740
The account created was blocked.

290
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:05,143
We can force this and
test all the scenario.

291
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:10,183
Another one is related
to privilege escalation.

292
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:15,410
We can have a policy that not allow anyone

293
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:18,069
to include the users in the Domain Admins

294
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:22,760
or even group admins or
other administrator groups.

295
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,260
And

296
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,373
if this happening,

297
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:29,430
we have to automatically disable the user

298
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:30,620
and block

299
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:33,593
the guy who made this inclusion.

300
00:13:35,177 --> 00:13:36,730
It's a high risk

301
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,350
credential or high risk group.

302
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:42,130
So, we have to block

303
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:47,087
these movements and block who made this

304
00:13:47,087 --> 00:13:50,353
and create a ticket to
be treated by analysts.

305
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:52,839
We force this.

306
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,110
We go there for credential

307
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:58,590
and put someone in the
Domains Admins group.

308
00:13:58,590 --> 00:13:59,870
And basically,

309
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:00,840
we see

310
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,920
the same result of the test.

311
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,150
We see if the log is
generated by the server

312
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:09,250
and it's going to our SIEM.

313
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:13,030
If the automation is working as designed,

314
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:15,140
blocking the user,

315
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,939
removing the privilege,

316
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:17,773
creating

317
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,995
the tickets to be treated by

318
00:14:21,995 --> 00:14:25,460
the analyst in the same time during...

319
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,003
In the SLA.

320
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:31,260
We can see if the whole behavior of

321
00:14:32,313 --> 00:14:33,620
this process

322
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,220
is it still working as designed?

323
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:37,140
Another one

324
00:14:39,361 --> 00:14:41,840
it's remote access control.

325
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,930
This is

326
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:45,920
focus on

327
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,060
guys who are working on two VPNs.

328
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:50,969
And are...

329
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:54,370
The corporate policies do not allow

330
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:57,420
non-corporate computers to
be connected on the VPN.

331
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,839
So,

332
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,740
if this happened

333
00:15:00,848 --> 00:15:03,290
what we design it to do.

334
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:07,060
We design a process to
automatically block the user.

335
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,869
Block the IP address

336
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:10,130
that they are connecting

337
00:15:11,524 --> 00:15:12,890
through a non-corporate user.

338
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:13,750
If the connection

339
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:18,623
was for real user and have success.

340
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:22,080
They have the user name and password.

341
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,700
We blocked the user too

342
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,370
and we create a ticket

343
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:26,630
to be treated by the analyst.

344
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:27,610
So,

345
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:28,443
again,

346
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,590
we see if the log is still generating,

347
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:35,290
it's still going to the SIEM.

348
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:37,660
The automation is still working.

349
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:40,170
Is still working as

350
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:41,283
we design it.

351
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:45,870
The behavior of the
process is still working

352
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:48,502
as

353
00:15:48,503 --> 00:15:49,336
we have

354
00:15:50,924 --> 00:15:51,973
to be in the company.

355
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,502
Another example is focused
on endpoint security.

356
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:00,670
No one can disable or even try

357
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:02,870
to disable the security solutions

358
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,950
that run in all the endpoints.

359
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:09,010
The anti-viral the DOP agents or

360
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,800
the EGR.

361
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,500
Or another one that you have

362
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,290
in the endpoint.

363
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:15,959
So if this happening...

364
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,010
If this happens

365
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,520
what the SOAR must do.

366
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:23,189
The SOAR quarantine the computer
because something's wrong.

367
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:27,390
Or the user are doing
something that is not allowed.

368
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,490
Or the computer has...

369
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:30,700
Can be compromised or so.

370
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,520
We have to quarantine

371
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,560
this computer

372
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,983
and open a ticket to be
treated by an analyst.

373
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:39,910
And with this test we see the same...

374
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:41,100
Almost the same

375
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,400
results.

376
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,050
We see if the logs generated,

377
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:46,520
it's going to SIEM.

378
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,207
The rules working as we design.

379
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:50,680
The automations that are quarantine

380
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,512
make the...

381
00:16:51,513 --> 00:16:53,310
Put the computer on quarantine.

382
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:54,560
The analyst is running

383
00:16:56,156 --> 00:16:58,010
the playbook in the SLA.

384
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:00,470
Basically, we saw we are testing

385
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:03,530
if the control is running

386
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:06,193
from the beginning to the end.

387
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:11,379
It's a type of test that is designed

388
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,170
to test the whole process

389
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:14,003
not just

390
00:17:15,711 --> 00:17:16,544
the control.

391
00:17:16,544 --> 00:17:18,232
We test all team.

392
00:17:18,232 --> 00:17:19,817
We test the security.

393
00:17:19,817 --> 00:17:22,609
If our analyst it's running the playbook,

394
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:23,443
it's doing

395
00:17:24,369 --> 00:17:26,219
what he must be done

396
00:17:28,457 --> 00:17:29,863
in an incident like this.

397
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,080
It's just five examples.

398
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,780
And I'm sure

399
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:39,480
that we are looking at our companies now.

400
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,662
And we are seeing

401
00:17:41,662 --> 00:17:44,990
a bunch of other controls

402
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:46,500
that can be simply

403
00:17:50,043 --> 00:17:52,419
tested using this methodology.

404
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,270
This approach

405
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,080
Is nothing new.

406
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,810
Is nothing so different.

407
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:01,193
But it's a different approach.

408
00:18:03,195 --> 00:18:04,028
We don't have

409
00:18:06,053 --> 00:18:08,370
this approach in mind all the time.

410
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:11,439
And we have the of consequences that.

411
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,203
We suffer incidence.

412
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,410
We receive audit finds

413
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:17,840
for something that is...

414
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:23,780
For something that was
in place for a long.

415
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:24,613
So,

416
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:28,527
we all know that is important.

417
00:18:28,527 --> 00:18:30,480
And we have hundreds of centers

418
00:18:31,437 --> 00:18:32,649
to test this.

419
00:18:32,649 --> 00:18:34,283
And

420
00:18:34,284 --> 00:18:35,117
we can do

421
00:18:37,286 --> 00:18:39,640
a big list in five minutes,

422
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,560
if I take a sit with our team.

423
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,840
And

424
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:43,673
propose them

425
00:18:45,343 --> 00:18:47,080
to use this approach.

426
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,793
And I sure that we will have good results.

427
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,220
And

428
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,410
to help you

429
00:18:54,851 --> 00:18:55,860
in this journey.

430
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:56,693
I will

431
00:18:58,210 --> 00:18:59,043
show to you

432
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,673
five steps

433
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:06,440
to be in place in the next two weeks

434
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,740
to start this process.

435
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,570
We must try this in our companies.

436
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:11,653
In the first week,

437
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:16,400
we can focus on map the controls.

438
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,540
I know that after these examples,

439
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:23,850
you have a big list in your mind.

440
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:26,580
But you must focus on controls

441
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:29,082
that is related to the Crown Jewels.

442
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,530
It's something that no...

443
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:38,710
Most of the companies have in mind

444
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:41,600
and must address the...

445
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,699
This approach.

446
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:46,940
Because as I told you before
we have hundreds of controls.

447
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,470
And we cannot...

448
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:51,570
We are not able to test all
of them on the first time.

449
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:56,129
So, we have to focus on the
most critical security controls.

450
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:59,260
And the most critical are
related to the Crown Jewels.

451
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,790
But you also have in mind that

452
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:02,870
it's a test.

453
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,409
we are testing an approach.

454
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:05,243
So,

455
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:09,110
don't put efforts on

456
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:11,810
big scenarios

457
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:15,419
or even in controls that are
really really hard to test.

458
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:17,150
Focus on the Crown Jewels

459
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:19,180
and something that is quite easy

460
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:21,390
to run the tests.

461
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:22,223
After

462
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,790
get the maturity of this process.

463
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,370
You can run tests

464
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:29,459
on high level of security controls.

465
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:32,450
But you can start with the smallest one.

466
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:33,930
Talk to your Red Team.

467
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:38,010
Your Red Team has a really
good view of your environment

468
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:39,210
and

469
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:40,110
knowledge

470
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:43,969
to help you finding these controls.

471
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:46,260
And find where you can approach

472
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:49,840
when you can use this
approach and run the tests.

473
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,480
Use the previous audit finds.

474
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,380
We have

475
00:20:54,488 --> 00:20:56,510
the audit reports there

476
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:57,500
and we can

477
00:20:58,977 --> 00:21:00,350
use these reports

478
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:03,379
to find security controls

479
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,213
that

480
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:10,699
are placed around the Crown Jewels

481
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,620
or in the past.

482
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:15,139
And we can use the reports to

483
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:18,783
bring this knowledge and
help us to create this list.

484
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,630
And I'm telling about thinking

485
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:25,160
this model at the beginning.

486
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:29,410
Don't try to use a big
number of security controls.

487
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:31,990
Or even try to test

488
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:35,633
hard and difficult scenarios.

489
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:38,139
Start small.

490
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,640
That's it.

491
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,850
On the second week, you can choose three

492
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:44,310
or five of these scenarios

493
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:45,820
and

494
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:48,040
use them to start

495
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:48,960
define.

496
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,603
We have to Map.

497
00:21:51,699 --> 00:21:52,532
If we don't have

498
00:21:53,647 --> 00:21:55,800
from the implementation of the control.

499
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,169
We have to map what we expect

500
00:21:59,864 --> 00:22:04,450
to be the full process that
are around this scenario.

501
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:06,930
As I told you before on the examples,

502
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:09,210
we have to test a process.

503
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:12,400
So, the control must be...

504
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,690
Must do this.

505
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:15,550
The analyst must do this.

506
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:17,230
That's the

507
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:18,900
expected response.

508
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,830
So we have to map this
because it's important

509
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,419
to follow all this scenario

510
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:28,700
and see if the response

511
00:22:29,668 --> 00:22:30,820
are correct

512
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,943
from the beginning to the end.

513
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,840
Create the use test case

514
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,090
sit it for team,

515
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:40,649
use the Red Team expertise to show them

516
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:41,610
what you are...

517
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,840
What you want to do

518
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,010
and

519
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:47,472
use them to create the tests.

520
00:22:47,472 --> 00:22:48,847
They know how to test.

521
00:22:48,847 --> 00:22:50,940
They know how to bypass

522
00:22:52,744 --> 00:22:53,577
the controls.

523
00:22:53,577 --> 00:22:56,910
So, use your team to create the tests.

524
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:57,960
And run.

525
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,130
Run the tests

526
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:02,563
Run the test and wait for the results.

527
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:06,200
If everything work

528
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,450
as designed,

529
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:08,760
congratulation.

530
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:12,270
You can be a happy security professional

531
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:14,629
and go home.

532
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:15,463
If not,

533
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:19,980
you must understand what's happening

534
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:22,150
and address the corrections.

535
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,680
Understanding the scenario.

536
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,760
You can see where the problems are

537
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,879
and address the corrections.

538
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,340
You can find

539
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,173
with

540
00:23:32,116 --> 00:23:33,680
the guys who was in charge of

541
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,570
the process what's happening

542
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:38,980
and apply the corrections.

543
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:42,840
Help the team to solve the issue.

544
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,810
And

545
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:46,450
after the corrections

546
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:48,930
are applied on the environment,

547
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:51,990
run the test again and wait.

548
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:54,963
Wait, into the results.

549
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:59,120
If something wrong again

550
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,260
and it's can happening,

551
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:03,750
the process can fail in another parts.

552
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:04,583
In

553
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:07,139
another guy from the team,

554
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:07,973
you can

555
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,673
test the analyst, the different analysts.

556
00:24:12,881 --> 00:24:14,356
Or you can have succeeded,

557
00:24:14,356 --> 00:24:15,939
and the process are

558
00:24:16,911 --> 00:24:20,840
runned from the beginning
to the end of success.

559
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:25,457
After that you must share the results.

560
00:24:25,457 --> 00:24:28,019
Socializing the results.

561
00:24:28,019 --> 00:24:30,370
Socialize with the team.

562
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:31,226
The technical team.

563
00:24:31,227 --> 00:24:32,160
You must

564
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,110
take the guys was in charge of the process

565
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:36,943
and show them.

566
00:24:36,943 --> 00:24:38,520
Show them the methodology.

567
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,030
Show what you are...

568
00:24:41,581 --> 00:24:42,840
what do you want to do.

569
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,100
What the result that you are expecting.

570
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:48,540
Show to your team because
most of these tests

571
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:51,629
are putting fingers to the security guard.

572
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:52,463
So,

573
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:54,570
do this.

574
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:56,540
Share the results of them

575
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:59,080
just after that show the results

576
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,320
to the management and to the stakeholders.

577
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:05,240
This is important at all the tests

578
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:08,650
but you must show this
before to the technical team.

579
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:09,543
Otherwise,

580
00:25:11,333 --> 00:25:14,963
we will have a big number
of enemies in the company.

581
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:20,530
Establish a formal process of tests.

582
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:21,363
After that.

583
00:25:21,363 --> 00:25:22,196
After show

584
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,250
to your stakeholder

585
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:27,110
to your boss or

586
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:29,320
to the other stakeholders.

587
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:32,340
You must propose a formal process to them.

588
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,480
I'm sure that no one

589
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:39,140
in the company will see the results

590
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:41,993
and will not support your initiative.

591
00:25:44,672 --> 00:25:47,130
We are creating something that
brings value to the company.

592
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:49,050
And the executives understand this.

593
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:49,883
So,

594
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:54,330
propose a formal process test to this.

595
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:58,129
Define a routine to run this tests.

596
00:25:58,130 --> 00:25:59,840
Try to automate this.

597
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,780
Even if you...

598
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:04,900
We use scripts for this.

599
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,560
We don't have a big solution

600
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:09,179
for SOAR solution for automation.

601
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:11,890
We can use the scripts

602
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:12,723
to this.

603
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:16,149
And you must define a list.

604
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:17,310
A big list.

605
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:20,030
You try with five or three scenarios

606
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:22,510
but I'm sure that we have a big list

607
00:26:23,895 --> 00:26:24,860
of controls to test.

608
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:29,219
So, define a prioritization lists

609
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,480
of the security controls.

610
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,230
We are not be able to run

611
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:36,480
this test for the whole bunch

612
00:26:37,508 --> 00:26:38,600
of controls that we have

613
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,020
on the environment at the same time.

614
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:41,853
So,

615
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,889
define a prioritization list

616
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:47,540
and focus on the most critical control.

617
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,899
And create a routine

618
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,570
for all the new security controls

619
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:54,580
implemented on your environment.

620
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,500
Generates

621
00:26:56,956 --> 00:27:00,800
a testbook to be part of this process.

622
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:04,710
You can use the new implementations

623
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:08,360
to create new tests scenarios

624
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,193
and

625
00:27:09,193 --> 00:27:12,143
put it in your formal process.

626
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:16,270
I talk a little bit about automation.

627
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:17,300
It's quite important.

628
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:21,260
But you can start without
them, without automation.

629
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:23,260
And today we have solutions for that.

630
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:26,240
We have the the Breach & Attack Simulation

631
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,490
that can help us

632
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:28,860
but they don't solve the problem.

633
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,740
Because most of the this solutions

634
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:33,260
are focused on technical tests.

635
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,629
You can implement a little bit

636
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:36,920
of

637
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,220
process testing to this

638
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:41,230
but they are not completed.

639
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:43,000
They can help you

640
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,580
to get

641
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:48,000
a larger scale on the controls.

642
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,180
But they don't solve the problems.

643
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:53,670
As the (murmurs) RPA solutions.

644
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:57,200
You can use RPA solutions to

645
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,430
run the tests for you.

646
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:00,380
And if you...

647
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:03,900
And you are able to run
a big number of tests,

648
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:07,230
a large number of tests
on the same period,

649
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:08,720
on the

650
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,230
same time using RPA solutions.

651
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:12,380
Is important.

652
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:13,600
But as I told you before

653
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,370
it's not a mandatory issue.

654
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:17,810
You can start

655
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:19,250
doing this

656
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:20,093
manually.

657
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:24,590
I know companies who start this

658
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:25,423
with just

659
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:27,770
a few hours

660
00:28:28,996 --> 00:28:32,290
of finales of the security analysts

661
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:34,743
and get really good results of this.

662
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:38,550
And

663
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,540
to the end I want to share

664
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:43,690
what I learned in my practical experience.

665
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:45,840
I'm working in security for a long.

666
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,720
For more than 20 years.

667
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,830
And I'm working with this model

668
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:52,340
for almost 10 years

669
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,820
from now.

670
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,075
And

671
00:28:55,075 --> 00:28:58,890
I implemented in three
different companies.

672
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:00,130
And I will share...

673
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:01,750
I can share with you

674
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,660
a little bit of my experience.

675
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:08,170
What's the challenge
and what's the benefits

676
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:10,073
of this approach.

677
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:12,970
The main challenge

678
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:15,160
for everything that we made

679
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:18,393
in cybersecurity are resource.

680
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,080
We don't have resource.

681
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:21,990
We don't have analysts.

682
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:24,040
We don't have cybersecurity professionals

683
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:28,420
in our teams do enough.

684
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:30,300
They are all full of jobs.

685
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,850
They are

686
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:33,342
running tests.

687
00:29:33,343 --> 00:29:34,540
They are running

688
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,020
the operation.

689
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,270
But we have to find.

690
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:39,940
We can find

691
00:29:43,721 --> 00:29:47,070
a little part of the
time of these analysts

692
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:49,701
to implement this.

693
00:29:49,701 --> 00:29:52,810
With specifically the
team and get half an hour

694
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:54,820
of each analyst.

695
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:55,980
I'm sure that

696
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:59,879
they are able to run these tests.

697
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,220
They are able to design

698
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,343
the test scenarios.

699
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:08,220
They can dedicate half an hour,

700
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:10,483
one hour to start the process.

701
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:13,770
For sure in the future

702
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:17,053
with this running a big number of tests.

703
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:20,240
We will have need

704
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:23,503
dedicated team to this.

705
00:30:24,524 --> 00:30:29,050
But in the beginning
we can use our own team

706
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:30,673
to start this process.

707
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:34,189
Don't create enemies...

708
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:35,480
More enemies because

709
00:30:36,717 --> 00:30:37,550
we love

710
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:40,553
to create enemies inside the companies.

711
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:44,360
Be careful when presenting,

712
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,389
when showing the results

713
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:47,660
to

714
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:49,970
the technical team, to your team

715
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:51,860
because as I told you before,

716
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:56,803
we are testing the cybersecurity
team during this process.

717
00:30:56,803 --> 00:30:58,432
Testing the technical team,

718
00:30:58,432 --> 00:31:00,150
testing the IT team.

719
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:01,080
So,

720
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:01,913
be careful

721
00:31:01,913 --> 00:31:03,610
when presenting this

722
00:31:05,974 --> 00:31:08,040
to the guy was in charge of the process.

723
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:08,873
No one's like

724
00:31:08,873 --> 00:31:10,060
to

725
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,440
receive a critical...

726
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:18,530
An issue on what he's doing all the time.

727
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:19,870
Be careful with this.

728
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:22,409
Try a partnership approach.

729
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:23,530
Show them the results.

730
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:27,270
Show that you are doing
this to avoid issues.

731
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:29,180
Avoid audit finds

732
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:31,570
that's really worse than

733
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,582
if it was presented by you.

734
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:39,610
And don't start with
a big number of tests.

735
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:42,260
Focused on the most critical control

736
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:46,669
the controls that are not so hard to test.

737
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:48,620
And don't try to

738
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:52,870
do a hundred of different
tests on the first time.

739
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:54,110
Start small.

740
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:56,310
Start with five, with 10

741
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:59,860
and growing this number during the time.

742
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:01,330
Start to...

743
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:02,510
Start small,

744
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:05,840
and put one scenario,

745
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,673
two scenario,

746
00:32:06,673 --> 00:32:09,070
three, four, five every month.

747
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:10,600
Every period.

748
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,909
You can create

749
00:32:12,844 --> 00:32:13,677
this routine

750
00:32:13,677 --> 00:32:14,510
and grow the number

751
00:32:15,385 --> 00:32:18,730
of scenarios without
starting with the big one.

752
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:21,690
If you start with a big number,

753
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:25,040
you're will not able to finish the tests

754
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:28,290
and you cannot create the
routine to run this test.

755
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:30,990
Because this must be a routine.

756
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:34,640
You must run the tests all the time,

757
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,760
every month, every week

758
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,310
because the problem

759
00:32:41,881 --> 00:32:44,890
can appear now or can appear like a month

760
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:45,723
or

761
00:32:45,723 --> 00:32:48,590
an year after the implementation.

762
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:51,562
That's the importance of
run the test periodically.

763
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:55,493
And talking about the benefits.

764
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,560
What can we generate for the company

765
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,620
this...

766
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:02,350
With this process?

767
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:05,360
We can reduce the uncertainty about

768
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,429
this cybersecurity controls

769
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:08,770
as the first question

770
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:11,300
that I show are secure.

771
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,879
With this I can guarantee that we are...

772
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,620
We reduced the uncertainty

773
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,523
of this answer.

774
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:23,020
We are not being 100% secure.

775
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:25,350
But as a new type of test

776
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:30,220
we are bringing more
security to the company.

777
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:33,930
We will reduce the audit
finds over existing controls

778
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:36,150
that as I told you before is something

779
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:40,640
not so good for us as
cybersecurity professional...

780
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,473
Professionals.

781
00:33:41,473 --> 00:33:43,950
And as cybersecurity executives

782
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:44,783
receive

783
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,053
audit finds

784
00:33:48,053 --> 00:33:51,750
is in control is not so good.

785
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:54,533
And you mitigate the risk of incidents.

786
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,930
We implement a bunch of controls

787
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:00,700
and we have to guarantee

788
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:04,140
that it's good, that
these controls are there

789
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,490
to solve the...

790
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:06,980
To mitigate the risks.

791
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:09,600
And if this we can mitigate

792
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:14,759
the risk of incidents on our environments.

793
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,387
And as cybersecurity professionals

794
00:34:17,387 --> 00:34:19,110
and cybersecurity executives

795
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:21,239
we can try to sleep

796
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:23,439
a little bit better

797
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,570
than easily or the previous night.

798
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:29,210
Every time that we test a scenario

799
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:30,630
that we test

800
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:32,389
a control.

801
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:37,009
And we see that this
control is still working as

802
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:38,070
designed.

803
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:41,623
We can try to sleep a little bit better.

804
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,739
So,

805
00:34:44,739 --> 00:34:46,270
I hope that everyone

806
00:34:47,594 --> 00:34:50,520
are good with this new approach.

807
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,690
Is not creates before

808
00:34:53,655 --> 00:34:56,020
for the other type of tests.

809
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,070
As I told you before

810
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:58,210
we have to run

811
00:34:59,642 --> 00:35:01,250
this test too.

812
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:04,660
But this approach are
continuous control approach

813
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:06,149
for

814
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:07,770
the cybersecurity controls.

815
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:09,470
Is something that I really believe

816
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,460
that's bring values to the company

817
00:35:14,015 --> 00:35:16,123
as far as cyber professionals.

818
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:17,813
Thank you.
