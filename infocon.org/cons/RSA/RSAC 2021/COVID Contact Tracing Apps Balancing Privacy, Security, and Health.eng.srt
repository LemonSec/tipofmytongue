1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:05,130
- Hello, and welcome to
COVID Contract Tracing Apps,

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:08,440
balancing privacy, security, and health.

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:12,940
My name is Sheila Sokolowski
and I am a partner and chair

4
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:17,250
of the Health and Biotech
privacy group at Henze Law.

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,940
And I'm joined today by
Dr. Gabriela Zanfir-Fortuna

6
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:24,113
and I let Gabriela introduce herself.

7
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:26,310
- Thank you very much, Sheila.

8
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:27,640
Hello everyone.

9
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,730
I am senior counsel for Global Privacy

10
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:32,479
at the Future of Privacy Forum

11
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,809
which is a theme time
based in Washington, DC.

12
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:37,340
And as Sheila was saying,

13
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:39,910
we are happy to host this session today

14
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:44,050
to discuss about COVID
contact tracing apps.

15
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:48,309
We have prepared a very crowded agenda

16
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:51,090
but I hope it will be interesting for you.

17
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,680
First, we will look at the case

18
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,950
for digital contact tracing for COVID-19.

19
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:59,890
We will then talk about
some of the key ethical

20
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:02,870
and legal considerations
to take into account

21
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:06,500
if you want to deploy
or to use such an app.

22
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,950
We'll look at some of
the most common technical

23
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:14,570
and design features that
we have seen out there.

24
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:18,699
And then also the adoption rates

25
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,533
of this apps around the world.

26
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:24,180
We're working with the data
we have, as you will see

27
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,260
there's not a lot of
data about that just yet.

28
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:30,690
We will afterwards look
at the effectiveness.

29
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:33,020
In one particular case,

30
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:36,229
we will look particularly in Switzerland

31
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:41,230
and how the COVID app was
adopted and how effective it was.

32
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,900
And at the very end, we
will make some points

33
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,880
about how you can apply some
of the things you've learned

34
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,592
in the session, in your
day-to-day activity.

35
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,983
I'll pass over to Sheila now.

36
00:01:53,983 --> 00:01:55,300
Sheila.

37
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,133
- Thank you.

38
00:01:56,133 --> 00:01:59,679
So a little to start with, we
wanted to talk a little bit

39
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,680
about what contract tracing
is and how it's played out

40
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:11,100
in previous instances
in the US in particular

41
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:15,450
and then a little bit about why it came

42
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:18,489
to the fore as we are all
confronting the outbreak

43
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:21,130
of COVID-19 here in the US.

44
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:23,600
So contract tracing is simply a process

45
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,380
by which individuals who've
may have come into contact

46
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:29,200
with an infected person are identified

47
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:33,950
so that they can either
potentially isolate themselves

48
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:38,950
to not pass on further infection
or to receive treatment

49
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,150
or to understand what other
contacts they may have had.

50
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:46,834
It's a way to understand the control

51
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:48,760
or so the spread of disease

52
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,290
and also in some instances,

53
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:53,023
a way to control the disease.

54
00:02:55,213 --> 00:02:58,070
It started out as a manual process

55
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:00,459
and it's been around in the US

56
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:05,460
as a method of infectious
disease control since the 1920s.

57
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,090
It was primarily in its most

58
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:10,690
that contemporary
instance used to response

59
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,870
to syphilis outbreaks and other outbreaks

60
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:16,680
of sexually transmitted infections.

61
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,820
And so privacy and confidentiality

62
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,420
given the sensitive
nature of those instances

63
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:27,440
was always very much a part of what

64
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:31,690
the rollout of the contact tracing

65
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:34,450
and incorporated into
the contract tracing.

66
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:37,589
And certainly because
it was also widely used

67
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:42,590
in the US during the
HIV and AIDS outbreak,

68
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:48,000
the issues of privacy were
particularly important there both

69
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,490
because AIDS and HIV was being transmitted

70
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:55,760
within homosexual communities

71
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,049
and those communities...

72
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:57,950
I'm sorry.

73
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:00,947
And homosexuality at
that time was outlawed

74
00:04:00,947 --> 00:04:03,020
in several States.

75
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:07,580
And also it was transmitted
through intravenous duck juice.

76
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,160
Much of which was illegal.

77
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:14,970
And so you didn't want
an unintended consequence

78
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:17,860
of the contract tracing to be

79
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:22,010
that someone would be
discriminated against

80
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:25,853
or potentially criminally prosecuted.

81
00:04:27,494 --> 00:04:31,850
So that's why confidentiality is key

82
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:34,600
and privacy are key when you roll out

83
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,740
these kinds of programs.

84
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:41,610
So with COVID-19 we have
a particular challenge

85
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:47,200
for doing contact tracing.

86
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:52,919
Because it was very often transmitted

87
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,003
before people had any symptoms.

88
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:59,940
At the time there were no
proven effective treatments

89
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,500
for it and it became the case

90
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:06,330
that very large outbreaks
could occur very quickly.

91
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:11,330
And so contract tracing
through the use of digital apps

92
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,710
which is what we are
talking about here today

93
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:19,780
became an important tool, if you will,

94
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:22,859
in the toolbox that we were going to use

95
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:26,320
to get control of the COVID-19 pandemic.

96
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,173
So one of the questions we look at,

97
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,270
when we're rolling out
contract contact tracing

98
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:40,020
was the question of, is
it going to be effective?

99
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,609
Why would we do these things

100
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:44,940
if the return on investment,

101
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,550
to use a business term is not there?

102
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:51,780
Especially when, as you'll
see there are ethical

103
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:54,359
and legal considerations
that need to be considered

104
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,273
and you want to make sure
that whatever you're doing

105
00:05:58,273 --> 00:06:03,273
that may potentially impinge
on some ethical concerns

106
00:06:07,514 --> 00:06:09,469
or have to be structured in a way

107
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:11,603
that they can happen legally,

108
00:06:13,031 --> 00:06:16,270
is it worth the effort
that we're putting forth?

109
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:20,680
And so initially the numbers were that

110
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:25,170
you would have to have 60 to 75% uptake

111
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:29,970
in the the contract tracing
apps, the digital ones,

112
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:34,410
the digital contact tracing
apps in order to have an impact.

113
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:38,600
And as the pandemic progressed,

114
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,313
we learned that actually we
don't need quite those numbers.

115
00:06:43,193 --> 00:06:47,099
The Google Oxford study
said that small levels

116
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,317
when combined with other measures,

117
00:06:49,317 --> 00:06:52,830
such as social distancing
and rapid testing

118
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:57,260
and treatment could actually have a impact

119
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:00,280
on the number of deaths and infections.

120
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,799
And certainly when we were talking

121
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,040
about the vast numbers of people

122
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:07,208
who have succumbed to COVID-19,

123
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:12,360
if these numbers did make it appear

124
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,320
that they would be worthwhile.

125
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,610
And then a similar study from
University College London

126
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:20,910
also found that these
types of digital tools

127
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:23,985
from contact tracing apps were effective

128
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:26,460
when they were complimenting
other measures.

129
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,960
So no one at any point thought

130
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,479
that contact tracing was the solution.

131
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:36,330
It was just really meant
to be part of the solution.

132
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:41,330
So what are the ethical
considerations that I mentioned?

133
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:46,650
So one is that this has to have
an impact on public health.

134
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,890
We need to be able to demonstrate

135
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:55,090
through scientific studies,
such as the Oxford Google Study

136
00:07:55,090 --> 00:08:00,090
and the UCL study that
these contact tracing apps

137
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:04,730
are having the right sort of
impact and having an impact.

138
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:07,950
And you want to, as part of that,

139
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:10,130
makes sure that they are integrated

140
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:12,860
with the public health services,

141
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:17,250
with the testing services and
with manual contact tracing

142
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,333
at some point.

143
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,810
You wanna look at are there less invasive

144
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:24,793
or risky alternatives?

145
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:30,770
In terms of the risk here
was the privacy risk, right.

146
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:33,853
Is that are we willing to make sacrifices

147
00:08:33,854 --> 00:08:37,220
potentially on privacy or not?

148
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:40,530
And what can we do to, as you'll see,

149
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:45,500
when Gabriela talks a little
bit about the different types

150
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,621
of digital contact tracing apps,

151
00:08:47,621 --> 00:08:49,860
there are trade-offs that allow you

152
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:53,960
to use less invasive alternatives.

153
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:57,300
And then the adoption rate question.

154
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,569
The studies pointed out that
you needed potentially...

155
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:04,690
Early studies pointed out 60 to 75%.

156
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:06,960
So when you look at a number like that

157
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,400
do you want to make it a mandatory system?

158
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,020
But then later the numbers
came back and said,

159
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,170
Oh, it really doesn't,

160
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:15,729
additional studies came out and said,

161
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:18,470
it didn't need to be quite
that high to have an impact.

162
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:22,290
So does that favor a
more voluntary system?

163
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:25,390
Is there a reason to
potentially use incentives

164
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:31,270
to have the adoption rate
be sufficiently high?

165
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:34,199
And then the question
is when we're talking

166
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:37,689
about digital contract tracing apps

167
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:42,600
and the disparities that not
everyone has a smartphone,

168
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,440
so what do we do about that?

169
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,910
And do we look at things like,

170
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:52,370
devising a digital technology,

171
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:54,850
that's a contact tracing
apps that are very low cost,

172
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:57,410
as opposed to needing
something that you could

173
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:00,933
have to download to a
relative expensive phone.

174
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:04,569
Do you look at questions of, okay,

175
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,560
well, this mandates that in some instances

176
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,617
we'll still have to do
manual contact tracing

177
00:10:08,617 --> 00:10:11,193
'cause people won't have these resources.

178
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:16,463
And then the questions around
discrimination and stigma,

179
00:10:19,758 --> 00:10:23,870
whether the app or the
digital contact tracing,

180
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:26,313
making it such that it doesn't create

181
00:10:26,313 --> 00:10:30,370
unintended consequences that force people

182
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:31,940
to be discriminated against,

183
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:36,120
or potentially not in the
case of COVID-19 necessarily,

184
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,330
but as I mentioned with
respect to AIDS and HIV,

185
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:43,470
potential criminal contact consequences.

186
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:47,637
And lastly, the questions
around transparency.

187
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:52,020
Do folks understand
what these apps are for

188
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,733
and how the data's being used?

189
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:58,350
Do our data minimization principles adhere

190
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:01,720
to such that the app is only collecting

191
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,990
or the digital contact tracing device

192
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:06,850
is only collecting
information necessary to make

193
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:11,280
the contact tracing occur,

194
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:14,400
or are there other pieces of
information being collected

195
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,650
for other ulterior purposes such as,

196
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:21,040
that's often referred to
as surveillance creeps?

197
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,949
So these are the kinds
of ethical considerations

198
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:26,450
before we even get to the legal ones

199
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:29,200
that needed to be considered

200
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:34,200
as these digital contact tracing apps

201
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:37,973
are put into the environment.

202
00:11:39,384 --> 00:11:40,640
- Yeah. Thank you, Sheila.

203
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,770
And that's such an important
framing that you did there

204
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:47,560
with the ethical
considerations and sort of

205
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:51,270
the big questions that
scientists were thinking about.

206
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:53,500
And policymakers were thinking about

207
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:57,577
when deciding to on one
hand, build this app

208
00:11:57,577 --> 00:11:59,420
and on another hand,

209
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:02,372
deploy them and decide
on whether to use them.

210
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:08,230
Besides the ethical
consideration as you said,

211
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:12,290
there are already some legal obligations

212
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:13,870
and legal considerations

213
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:18,380
that the deployment of such apps entailed.

214
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:23,380
So when you look at a global pandemic,

215
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,440
we kind of need to take into
account a global framework

216
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,690
and look at global
frameworks when deploying

217
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,250
a technical solution
that is supposed to work

218
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,470
in more than just one jurisdiction.

219
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:40,450
And even eventually to
work across jurisdictions

220
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:41,903
and be interoperable.

221
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:45,099
Outside of the United States,

222
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:49,810
the legal framework on
data protection and privacy

223
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:55,920
is already kind of settled.

224
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,010
Particularly when we're looking to Europe

225
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:00,800
and when we're looking to
the legal systems out there

226
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,819
that were inspired by
the European approach,

227
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:08,050
which is best encompassed

228
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:11,140
in the general data protection
regulation in the GDPR.

229
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,020
And some of these legal considerations

230
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:15,680
that people have been looking at

231
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,599
when deploying or building
conduct tracing apps

232
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,600
had to do with building within
the app, privacy concerns,

233
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,969
privacy safeguards, data
protection safeguards

234
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:32,540
and applying what the GDPR
calls data protection by design

235
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,223
and by default.

236
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,210
Other obligations that are
very important to keep in mind

237
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:44,210
when we are looking at this
apps are data minimization.

238
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:47,660
You already mentioned this notion before,

239
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:52,420
and it refers to the principle
that only the data necessary

240
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:54,339
to achieve a particular purpose

241
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:57,063
should be collected and
used, should be processed.

242
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:03,160
Other considerations have to
do with purpose limitation.

243
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:06,689
And this means that once
we collect and use data

244
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:10,280
for a particular purpose, in
this case, contact tracing

245
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:13,949
it shouldn't be used for other purposes.

246
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:18,620
Users, consumers, persons
have certain expectations

247
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:21,680
that once they give access to their data

248
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,882
it will be used for what they
thought it will be used for.

249
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:28,880
There are considerations that have to do

250
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,560
with retention limitations.

251
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,876
So for example, only retaining data

252
00:14:33,876 --> 00:14:36,750
as long as it's necessary
to achieve the purpose

253
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:40,750
in this case to achieve conduct tracing.

254
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:44,630
And I would say these are just
some of the core principles

255
00:14:46,686 --> 00:14:50,040
of the GDPR that we need
to take into account

256
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,360
when looking at contact tracing apps.

257
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,220
I will not go through the
entire list of obligations

258
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,610
but I would say this are

259
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:01,990
really, really relevant and important.

260
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:06,780
Also, another point to
make is that right now

261
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:11,110
around the world, we have
more than, I would say 100

262
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:16,110
but there I think more
than 120, 130 right now

263
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:21,930
comprehensive data
protection and privacy laws

264
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:25,500
that are built on kind
of the same principles

265
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,930
of fair information practice principles,

266
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:32,930
like the ones that I discussed just now.

267
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,950
So when we looked at the US,

268
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:40,243
the situation is indeed different.

269
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,020
- Indeed it is.

270
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:45,170
Thank you, Gabriela.

271
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:50,170
So the US does not have a
comprehensive privacy law

272
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:51,642
like the European Union.

273
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,490
We have what is typically
referred to as a patchwork

274
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:57,870
of data privacy and security laws.

275
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:03,010
Reflecting both different state laws

276
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:04,360
that have been put into place

277
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,680
to protect data privacy and security,

278
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,250
primarily around data breach.

279
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:12,030
But also we now see States like California

280
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:16,290
and now Virginia adopting more
comprehensive privacy laws.

281
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:18,829
And the other piece of the patchwork

282
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:20,700
to make it even more interesting in the US

283
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:24,250
is that we have industry or sector laws.

284
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:27,940
So you have financial privacy
and health data privacy.

285
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:32,940
So it really isn't a complicated
morass to weight through

286
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,450
when you're dealing with
these issues in the US.

287
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:39,820
But trying to work our way through it

288
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:49,640
in the context of the
digital contact tracing apps.

289
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,560
While we do have HIPAA that protects

290
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,839
a lot of healthcare information,

291
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:59,840
unless the contract tasting
apps are being conducted

292
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:04,319
or feeding data to covered entities,

293
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:08,879
which in the US is healthcare providers

294
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,700
most significantly in health
plans, also significantly,

295
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:17,010
then the data would not
be covered by HIPAA.

296
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:20,160
So then you look to what
do different State laws say

297
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,940
like CCPA and now the new Virginia law,

298
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,349
we would have to look at those

299
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:29,310
because you're collecting
essentially personal information

300
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:32,470
and information that
identifies individuals.

301
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:35,340
And then other little twist on this

302
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:38,790
is that some States
like Illinois and Texas

303
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:42,850
have biometric privacy laws
requiring a notice and consent

304
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:44,560
when collecting different information.

305
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,220
So how do you weave all of that

306
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:50,940
into these digital contract tracing apps

307
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:54,240
is going to be a challenge for folks

308
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,550
depending on how the apps are designed

309
00:17:56,550 --> 00:18:01,379
and who's running the apps or devices

310
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,680
and who's getting the information

311
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,550
that comes from the devices.

312
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:09,000
The other thing you need to
think about too in the workplace

313
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,530
is labor employment rights.

314
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:17,530
If you're asking your employees
to download a particular app

315
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:22,919
and use that when they're in the workplace

316
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,950
there may be issues of wage and hour laws,

317
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:28,660
there may be union contracts
that need to be looked at

318
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:31,510
or union collective bargaining agreements

319
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:34,730
that would address how these things

320
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:38,040
can be deployed in a workplace situation.

321
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:41,258
And then you need to
think about the fact that

322
00:18:41,258 --> 00:18:45,550
if these are apps downloaded
to individual's phones

323
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:48,060
and they don't leave their phones at work,

324
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,899
they take them with them
when they leave the workplace

325
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:55,900
how do you manage limiting the
collection of the information

326
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:57,790
to just the workplace setting

327
00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:02,750
because you wouldn't as
an employer have the right

328
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:05,890
to collect information
from outside the workplace

329
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:10,020
beyond just anything that would qualify

330
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,960
as a fitness for duty exam.

331
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:16,960
And so how do you limit that
navigate, that particular

332
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:21,070
or thread, it's almost like
threading a needle a little bit.

333
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:23,913
And lastly, there are
anti-discrimination laws.

334
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:30,409
With COVID we had initially,

335
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:35,210
there were different cohorts
of people that were identified

336
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:38,260
as higher risk for getting COVID.

337
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:43,260
And so there might be a
tendency like with the vaccines

338
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:47,430
to only wanna require it
for the higher risk folks,

339
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:51,747
but that runs into some
discrimination law issues,

340
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:57,790
because some of the,
shall we say, the cohorts

341
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:04,510
such as over age 65 align with
certain protected classes.

342
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:06,860
So that's another consideration

343
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:10,610
in terms of the
implementation of a deploying,

344
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:13,679
once you've identified a device or an app

345
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,343
or whatever it is you're
going to use digitally,

346
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:21,180
this implementation piece
cannot be overlooked either.

347
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,540
- Thank you Sheila for that.

348
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:25,280
We are now looking at
some of the technical

349
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:30,280
and design features that
the apps are relying on.

350
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:36,424
One of this technologies
that is helping the apps

351
00:20:36,424 --> 00:20:41,424
in being effective, hopefully
effective, is location data.

352
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:48,320
This entails that the
movements of the phones

353
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:52,250
are being tracked for instance using GPS

354
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:55,910
or triangulation from nearby cell towers.

355
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:59,070
And then looking for other
phones that have spent time

356
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:00,810
in the same location.

357
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:04,110
The problem with this
approach is that location data

358
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:06,500
tends to be really sensitive.

359
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:11,500
It may tell about the owner of the phone

360
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,960
specific whereabouts.

361
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:17,870
It may lead to discovering
sensitive information

362
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:22,679
about the person, for
example, religious affiliation

363
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,130
or other health issues.

364
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:27,780
So location data is
generally being considered

365
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:31,190
a very sensitive data.

366
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:34,370
Another technology
being used is Bluetooth.

367
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:37,500
The contact tracing
apps based on Bluetooth

368
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:41,490
involve proximity tracking,

369
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:45,010
which means that phones
swept encrypted tokens

370
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:49,090
with any other nearby
phones over their Bluetooth.

371
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:52,980
It is easier to anonymize information.

372
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:57,490
And generally the Bluetooth
based app are considered better

373
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:59,590
for privacy than location tracking

374
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:02,629
because they only record the fact

375
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:06,143
that two phones were in proximity.

376
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:10,850
What has been very helpful
with the deployment

377
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:13,139
of contact tracing apps,

378
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:16,490
Google and Apple developed a joint API

379
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:21,310
which actually allowed
iOS and Android phones

380
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:24,610
to communicate with each
other over Bluetooth.

381
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:28,516
And this now is being used,
this API is being used

382
00:22:28,517 --> 00:22:33,517
by a majority of the
national contact tracing apps

383
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:36,453
in Europe for example.

384
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:41,840
There is another very similar protocol

385
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,480
which I would say in terms of chronology

386
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,410
was actually first
developed, the DP-3T protocol

387
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:51,410
which was developed by
researchers in Switzerland

388
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:56,410
and other European countries
that focused indeed

389
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,219
on Bluetooth technology

390
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:02,260
and privacy preserving proximity tracing.

391
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:07,260
Now, all of this technologies
are being considered

392
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:13,139
when choosing how to build

393
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:16,100
and then deploy a contact tracing app.

394
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:19,419
Some of the other features,
technical features

395
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,090
that are relevant in this debate

396
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,480
have to do with data storage

397
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,220
which can be centralized or decentralized.

398
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:32,220
For example, a central public
authority of federal level.

399
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:35,130
Let's say public
authority could centralize

400
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:40,130
all of the interactions and
all of the positive results.

401
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:47,080
Or the other option is having
a lot of the data processing

402
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:52,080
and data hosting being on the device.

403
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,270
We also have different
types of participation.

404
00:23:57,270 --> 00:24:01,800
We have seen mandatory use
of contact tracing apps

405
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,430
particularly in some Asian countries

406
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:06,520
but also voluntary participation.

407
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:09,670
And this is the case with
all of the European countries

408
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:13,640
and with those apps that
we have seen in the US.

409
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:16,393
There is also the issue
of government access.

410
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:20,690
Some of these national contact racing apps

411
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:24,200
have allowed government to access the data

412
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,100
for other purposes than
contracting tracing.

413
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:31,219
And one example in that
case would be Singapore,

414
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,560
which was not known a time

415
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,899
when people started using contact tracing.

416
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:40,457
There are other features
that we can discuss too

417
00:24:40,458 --> 00:24:44,260
such aggregated and anonymized data

418
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:46,750
using only aggregated and anonymized data

419
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:51,822
and similar features like that.

420
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:56,670
One important thing to keep in mind here

421
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:58,240
is that purpose limitation,

422
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,610
I was mentioning at the
beginning when we were talking

423
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:05,189
about some of the legal implications

424
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:09,180
and why in some cases it would make sense

425
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:14,180
for the government to not have
access to any of this data.

426
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:19,870
I just wanted to show a
bit of various solutions

427
00:25:21,888 --> 00:25:25,793
that European countries
chose to implement.

428
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:30,040
We see here that only France and Hungary

429
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:35,040
chose a centralized storage
and decentralized type of app,

430
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:40,150
even though most of the
European countries right now

431
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:42,730
are using the Bluetooth based technology

432
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:44,810
for their contact tracing apps.

433
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:46,909
I think it's also interesting to see

434
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:48,820
that there are some European countries

435
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:52,639
that do not plan to use any
of the contact tracing apps

436
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,513
like Bulgaria, Romania, and Sweden.

437
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:58,020
- Thank you, Gabrielle.

438
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:01,580
So shifting gears from the technology

439
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:04,939
to the question of the adoption rates

440
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,820
that we're experiencing with some

441
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:10,790
of the contact tasting app
technology that was rolled out.

442
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:15,500
This is a study from July of 2020.

443
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:19,090
And show that none of these countries,

444
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:20,870
these are the highest adoption rates.

445
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:25,870
None of these countries got
anywhere near the 60 to 75%

446
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:28,542
that was initially talked about.

447
00:26:28,542 --> 00:26:33,220
The best here we have
is Australia with 21.6%.

448
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:38,220
And here in the US, this
is from November of 2020,

449
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:44,990
you have just way of
comparison to Ireland,

450
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:48,725
which got up to 34% by that point.

451
00:26:48,725 --> 00:26:51,169
Oh, I'm sorry, this is late October.

452
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:52,930
With the exception of Nevada.

453
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:54,860
But none of the States,

454
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:59,179
Virginia, just being the highest at 10.6%.

455
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:02,690
And so the question becomes
why roll out of the apps

456
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:05,933
was left to the individual
States in the US.

457
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:10,719
Some of those States lacked
the right kind of expertise

458
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,810
to develop the apps from the technology

459
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:16,770
that was made available to them.

460
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:21,513
And there were fears
about personal privacy,

461
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,673
not surprisingly.

462
00:27:27,153 --> 00:27:30,620
There was a general
concern about big tech.

463
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:35,030
And so in general, that spilled over into

464
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:39,940
some of these COVID-19 contact
tracing apps so much so

465
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:44,090
that in South Carolina
lawmakers actually banned

466
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:46,862
the use of the Google and Apple API.

467
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:52,990
- To quickly go on the only use case study

468
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:56,082
we have seen on the
effectiveness of this apps,

469
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:59,710
let's focus on the Swiss case.

470
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:01,780
As I was saying, the
researchers in Switzerland

471
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,629
were some of the first
ones, if not the first ones

472
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:07,210
that actually came up with a protocol,

473
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:10,420
an open source protocol for privacy

474
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:11,960
preserving contact tracing.

475
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:16,740
And Switzerland was the first
country to be very serious

476
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:19,430
about deploying such an app.

477
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:22,060
We have seen a study that shows

478
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:25,690
that from may 25 to
September 10 of last year,

479
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:28,250
the SwissCovid app has been downloaded

480
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:31,350
by 2.36 million people.

481
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:33,889
And the number of active apps per day

482
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:37,080
has been estimated at 1.6 million.

483
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,550
The number of active users corresponds

484
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:43,657
to 18.9% of the Swiss population,

485
00:28:43,657 --> 00:28:48,490
which is about 8.6 million people.

486
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:51,640
During the study period,
the authorities reported

487
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:55,070
more than 12,000 confirmed COVID cases.

488
00:28:55,070 --> 00:29:00,070
So during those months that we mentioned.

489
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:05,490
Then the authorities
issued 2,447 COVID codes

490
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:07,679
that could be used in the app,

491
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:12,680
which were about 19.6%
of the confirmed cases.

492
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:16,830
This is also because this
number actually correlates

493
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:19,939
with the number of the percentage

494
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:23,273
of the entire population
that is using the app.

495
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:29,370
And then 1,645 of this COVID codes

496
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,593
were entered into the app by the users.

497
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:40,480
This means about 13.2% of confirmed cases.

498
00:29:40,936 --> 00:29:45,379
Users actually have to
enter this codes themselves

499
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:50,380
in the app in order for them
to be effective and to work.

500
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:55,340
During that time out of the 12,000 people

501
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:58,112
that were confirmed with COVID,

502
00:29:58,113 --> 00:30:03,113
7,800 entered the reasons...

503
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:09,167
7,800 of those that tested and disclosed

504
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:15,077
the reasons for testing,
reported the SwissCovid app

505
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,760
as the reason for their tests.

506
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,850
So if they wouldn't
have received this alert

507
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:27,283
they wouldn't have went to take a test.

508
00:30:28,331 --> 00:30:32,959
41 people of this 7,800
were found to be positive.

509
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:37,950
You might think this
is a very small number

510
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:42,467
but researchers considered
that this is a proof of concept

511
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:46,893
that contact tracing apps work.

512
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:51,610
Some of the conclusions from this use case

513
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:54,830
show that voluntary
digital contact tracing

514
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:56,889
can show similar effectiveness

515
00:30:56,890 --> 00:31:01,280
at identifying effective
partners of index cases.

516
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:04,899
So those original cases
that tested positive.

517
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,670
Just as classic contact tracing,

518
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:12,180
but the index case and
the exposed contacts

519
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:15,620
have to use the app in
order for it to work.

520
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:17,840
The effectiveness of
digital contact tracing

521
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,620
crucially depends on a strong embedding

522
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:22,639
into an efficient testing

523
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,780
and contact tracing
infrastructure on the ground.

524
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:29,300
If you don't test after
you receive your alert

525
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:33,100
then all of this is useless, right?

526
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:36,120
Some of the improvement
areas that researchers found

527
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:40,310
have to do with the
increase of the procedure

528
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:42,810
and in determining the risk.

529
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:45,149
So then determining exactly

530
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:47,970
which of the contacts should be notified.

531
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:51,167
And then also they
discovered during this study

532
00:31:51,167 --> 00:31:55,419
that there was a certain
delay in communicating

533
00:31:55,420 --> 00:32:00,420
to users the results of positive cases.

534
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:05,620
So they are looking to
somehow reduce this delay

535
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:09,553
in communicating to others.

536
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:13,663
Some of the lessons learned
in terms of effectiveness.

537
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:17,710
We have seen a study about this.

538
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:20,330
It's very important to integrate the use

539
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:24,520
of any contact tracing app
with the local health policy.

540
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:28,450
Pay lot of attention to what
the local health authorities

541
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:32,303
are implementing as their policy.

542
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:37,410
Researchers have found
that a high user uptake

543
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:42,889
and adherence means that
contact tracing apps

544
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:46,720
can reduce transmission
at low levels of uptake

545
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,540
including for those without smartphones.

546
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:52,639
However, large numbers of users increase

547
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,280
the effectiveness of this app.

548
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:59,280
So a high user uptake is recommended.

549
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:04,580
One other lessons they
highlighted is that the quarantine

550
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:09,580
of infectious people should
be as accurate as possible.

551
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:15,030
So the public health
policy should be again,

552
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:18,689
taken into account in
terms of recommending

553
00:33:18,689 --> 00:33:23,689
what conduct should quarantine
under what conditions.

554
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:27,180
Rapid notification is
absolutely essential.

555
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:30,800
The time between the onset
of symptoms in an index case

556
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:34,020
and the quarantine of
their contacts is of,

557
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:37,840
again, key importance in
COVID-19 contact tracing.

558
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:41,810
And then the ability to evaluate
effectiveness transparently

559
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:43,770
is also very important.

560
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:47,500
As we were researching for the session,

561
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,880
we have found very, very little data

562
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:53,020
to support the effectiveness
of contact tracing

563
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:57,460
as well as the actual
uptake on the ground.

564
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,830
- Thank you, Gabriela.

565
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:01,810
So before we conclude today,

566
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:06,810
I want to share with you just
some guidance from the CDC

567
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:09,060
and put into a little bit of context

568
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:13,170
in how digital contract tracing can assist

569
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:17,969
with a potential investigation.

570
00:34:17,969 --> 00:34:22,969
So COVID-19 is a nationally
notifiable infectious disease

571
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:27,120
meaning that it's required to by US law

572
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:33,800
to report the disease cases
to public health authorities.

573
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:37,389
When cases are reported
the health department

574
00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:39,770
can begin an investigation

575
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:42,009
and may or may not begin an investigation

576
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:44,050
depending on the circumstances,

577
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:46,520
but it can impact the workplace

578
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:50,770
when the employer is asked to assist

579
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:55,770
with identifying workplace
contacts or contacts rather.

580
00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:00,300
And so as part of that CDC
has issued some guidance

581
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,530
for non-healthcare employers.

582
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:04,563
I've put the link here in the slide.

583
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:10,640
But one of the things that
CDC has advised is that

584
00:35:11,529 --> 00:35:15,170
if there's an outbreak
that impacts a workplace

585
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:17,800
or they begin an investigation
in the workplace,

586
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:22,800
because of notification

587
00:35:22,825 --> 00:35:27,270
of someone coming down with the disease

588
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:30,780
or any reportable
disease, not just COVID-19

589
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,920
that they will request workplace

590
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:37,110
and schedule information
in order to trace contacts.

591
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:39,370
And I'm putting here their shorthand,

592
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:43,247
which is they want to know
who was within six feet

593
00:35:43,247 --> 00:35:47,730
for at least 15 minutes in the 48 hours

594
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:52,070
before the person was
diagnosed with COVID.

595
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:54,640
And they will ask for that information

596
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,490
and you want to be careful

597
00:35:55,490 --> 00:35:58,399
not to give them confidential
personnel records.

598
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,380
So one of the ways that these

599
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:04,730
digital contact tracing technologies

600
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:06,370
can be helpful in the workplace

601
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:09,839
is for answering that particular question.

602
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:12,970
In the workplace we've found

603
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:16,629
that they can actually
address many concerns

604
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:19,400
about further transmission

605
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:22,670
but they are really only
part of a necessary response.

606
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:26,840
There are still other
measures such as rapid testing

607
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:30,017
and social distancing
that can be effective

608
00:36:30,017 --> 00:36:31,810
in the workplace.

609
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:33,590
- Then it's also very important to take

610
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:35,680
into account efficient testing

611
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:39,183
as one of the key factors
for effectiveness,

612
00:36:39,183 --> 00:36:43,840
accurate quarantine, who
you will ask to quarantine

613
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:47,180
once contacts are being identified,

614
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:51,319
rapid notification of
the persons of interest

615
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:54,180
and the persons that have
been identified as contacts

616
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:57,149
and contact tracing
infrastructure on the ground,

617
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:58,810
all of these are essential

618
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:02,549
for the effectiveness of
the apps as we have seen.

619
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:05,820
And then don't forget that
in order to increase trust

620
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:10,550
and in order to increase
uptake of contact tracing app

621
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:13,030
privacy concerns must be addressed.

622
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:15,810
And they can be addressed
by opting for an app

623
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:18,350
that collects the minimum necessary data,

624
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:20,830
that limits access to the data processes

625
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:24,123
and that includes a short
data retention period.

626
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:28,913
Thank you very much all for
joining our session today.
