1
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:03,679
- Hi, I'm David.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:06,580
I'm a Privacy Program Manager by day

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:11,173
and a graduate student at UC
Berkeley by later in the day.

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,493
- Thanks David. Hi, I'm Stewart.

5
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:21,490
If you were at RSA last year,
you probably remember me.

6
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:27,673
I was that one guy wearing an N95 mask,

7
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,120
in a sea of unmasked faces.

8
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:39,063
Tens of thousands of
naked mask-less faces.

9
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:44,809
There were dudes walking
by with Fado keys pierced

10
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:47,990
into various body parts and yet everyone

11
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:50,873
was still staring at me.

12
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,130
No, I didn't have access to secret data

13
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:59,510
about COVID reaching
California, rather I knew

14
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:02,140
there was an absence of data.

15
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:05,230
I was worried about making
optimistic assumptions

16
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:07,390
in the absence of data.

17
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:11,530
And this talk is about the
assumptions we're making

18
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:14,763
about password managers
in the absence of data.

19
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:17,870
And I'd like to start
the talk with Bill Gates

20
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:21,877
who by the way, was
warning us all to prepare

21
00:01:21,877 --> 00:01:25,143
for pandemics back in 2015.

22
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:30,310
But those predictions
about passwords weren't

23
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:35,310
as cautious or prophetic,
especially those he made here

24
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:40,053
at RSA specifically 17 years ago.

25
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:46,000
He said we'd use passwords less and less.

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,950
Back then Microsoft spoke
of eradicating passwords

27
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,320
as if they could make passwords go the way

28
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,610
of diseases like Smallpox.

29
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:59,393
Fortunately, not everyone
shared their optimism.

30
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:03,180
A separate camp had been
betting that passwords

31
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,430
weren't going away.

32
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:09,160
Passwords were multiplying, spreading.

33
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,910
To manage this problem people

34
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:14,880
would need help remembering passwords.

35
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:18,060
People would need help
creating good passwords.

36
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,800
We would need to adapt
to a world with passwords

37
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,353
instead of dreaming of
a world without them.

38
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,760
And when Bill Gates gave that
speech at RSA in 2004, many of

39
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:36,020
the members of this password
management camp already

40
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,603
had a head start.

41
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:42,520
Like Bruce Schneier who
introduced Password Safe

42
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,903
the first password manager in 1997.

43
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:49,890
And Apple which released Keychain

44
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:54,602
in 1999, based on technology
from earlier in the decade.

45
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:59,183
Then commercial products
arrived like RoboForm,

46
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:04,540
and a few years before Bill
Gates gave that speech Microsoft

47
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:07,239
even added a built in password manager

48
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,780
to their Internet Explorer browser though,

49
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:13,023
they would do much to improve it after.

50
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:17,720
Firefox had a built-in
password manager as well.

51
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:21,300
And even third party KeyPass
was on the scene before

52
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,933
that 2004 speech.

53
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:28,369
So, plan B for survival
in a world where passwords

54
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:32,420
are endemic was well
underway when Bill predicted

55
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,972
the decline of passwords 17 years ago.

56
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:40,790
And within Microsoft at
roughly the same time Florencio

57
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:44,840
and Hurley from Microsoft
Research started preparing a study

58
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:49,380
of millions of real-world
users and their passwords.

59
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:52,403
They completed their research in 2006.

60
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:57,850
They found that users had
a lot of passwords to enter

61
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:59,690
and keep track of.

62
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:04,570
They found that users compensated
by re-using passwords.

63
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:07,780
They found that many users
employed weak passwords

64
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,243
even for banking sites.

65
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:14,850
In short, they helped us
understand the consequences

66
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:18,050
if we continued to fail
in eradicating passwords

67
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,160
and didn't learn to manage them.

68
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,240
Still the rest of Microsoft

69
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,040
was focused on eradicating passwords

70
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:29,359
and brought their master plan to fruition

71
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,783
with Windows CardSpace also in 2006.

72
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,080
They replaced passwords with these cards

73
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,500
that we now all use.

74
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,150
Well, not really.

75
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:44,520
Fortunately, the password
management camp kept busy as well.

76
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,750
Starting with 1Password
followed by LastPass

77
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:53,990
and Keeper and Dashlane, a
large herd of products thrived

78
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:59,690
in an ecosystem rich with
an abundance of passwords

79
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:00,603
to feed upon.

80
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,290
Eradicating passwords proved harder,

81
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:07,660
than some had initially thought.

82
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:12,660
But Microsoft declared victory
on passwords in 2015 during

83
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,159
a global Ad campaign.

84
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,380
They announced that
passwords had been eradicated

85
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:24,380
from Windows 10, though
users still needed a PIN

86
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:28,920
an acronym for Personal
Information Number, P-I-N

87
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:32,540
which might make you think
of something like this.

88
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:37,520
But Microsoft defined number
to include uppercase letters,

89
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,520
and lowercase letters, as
well as special characters.

90
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,010
They didn't let the fact that

91
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:48,760
these numbers looked suspiciously
like passwords keep them

92
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:52,030
from declaring victory
in their war on passwords

93
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:55,592
at least for some definition of victory.

94
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:01,840
Meanwhile the abundance
of passwords continued

95
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,380
to feed a growing population
of password managers

96
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,103
now, including Bitwarden.

97
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:13,020
And now in 2021, these companies
that make password managers

98
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:17,270
are collectively worth
billions of dollars.

99
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:20,909
And for good reason, 17 years after

100
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:23,870
the war on passwords began, most of us,

101
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:28,163
have more passwords to
remember than we did in 2004.

102
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,469
And so, I suspect many of you
who would have recommended

103
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:38,470
the use of password managers
back in 2004, now would.

104
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:43,159
I believe many if not most of us would.

105
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,970
But should we? really ?

106
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:49,200
with the data we have
are we completely sure

107
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,539
the benefits outweigh the risks?

108
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:54,180
Because there are risks.

109
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:58,250
We are asking users to put
all of their credentials

110
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,720
in one place.

111
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:04,720
And as we saw last year at
RSA, even the best products

112
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,099
can give a false sense of security such as

113
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:11,890
by showing passwords is locked
when they're still in memory.

114
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:15,340
Though I should mention that
the team behind that talk

115
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:18,200
at last year's RSA wanted us to know,

116
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,423
that they still believe password
managers are a good thing.

117
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:27,039
One benefit of password managers is that

118
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,163
they can potentially reduce
the risk of phishing.

119
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,610
If you rely on your password manager

120
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:36,180
to enter random passwords for you,

121
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:40,290
and so you don't even know
the password for a website

122
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:41,900
you will need to look up the password

123
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:45,190
in your password manager, when
your password manager fails

124
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:48,730
to fill it in for you as would happen

125
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:50,840
if you went to a phishing site.

126
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,669
And the fact that the
password manager fails

127
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:55,890
to fill in your password and that you need

128
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:59,120
to manually look it up
is a pretty big clue

129
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,293
you're being phished.

130
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:04,120
Companies that make third
party password managers

131
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,950
have also been publishing
Security White Papers.

132
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,930
Like this one from 1Password.

133
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:12,203
So that we can better understand
the risks of using them.

134
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:15,100
And these companies

135
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,500
are promising more and
more security benefits

136
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,390
and features in their products.

137
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:22,409
Almost all of these
products have added features

138
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:26,070
that help users replace old weak passwords

139
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:30,599
and re-used passwords and
replace even passwords discovered

140
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,603
to be compromised during breaches.

141
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,750
And these features are valuable,

142
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,620
if people are actually using them.

143
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,570
But in recommending password managers

144
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:42,690
for these security benefits

145
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:46,140
we are making some pretty big assumptions.

146
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:49,670
We're assuming that users will
use a strong master password

147
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:53,439
to protect the password stored
by their password manager.

148
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,960
We're assuming that users

149
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:59,070
will let password managers
create strong passwords for them.

150
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:01,690
That they won't just choose weak passwords

151
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:03,970
and employ their password
managers just to take

152
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:06,373
those passwords so that
they don't have to.

153
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:11,829
We're assuming that users will
invest the time to replace

154
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:15,480
their weak, re-used and
compromised passwords.

155
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,530
Even if it will take a
lot of time to go through

156
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:21,742
the many accounts they
have built up over decades.

157
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:29,150
There is some prior work
examining these assumptions

158
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:33,060
Joseph Bonneau, and I
examined whether users

159
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:38,060
can remember strong random
passwords, which would be what

160
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:40,653
you'd want them to use
for a password manager.

161
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:44,630
The good news is, almost anyone can learn

162
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:47,270
a 56-bit random password.

163
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,810
The bad news is,

164
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:51,130
that this memorization process required

165
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:55,410
20 to 30 training sessions
spaced at least 30 minutes apart

166
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:57,360
to ensure that participants

167
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,790
could reliably recall these passwords.

168
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:04,000
More bad news, users forget passwords

169
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,103
if they don't use them regularly.

170
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,470
Regarding whether users let

171
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:12,640
their password managers
generate passwords for them,

172
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,819
for new and existing accounts,

173
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:18,700
we have only small qualitative
studies such as one

174
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,538
by Pearman et al.

175
00:10:20,538 --> 00:10:24,050
There're participants who use
third party password managers

176
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:24,979
were more likely

177
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:28,250
to let their password managers
choose random passwords

178
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,250
for them when compared to users

179
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,323
of browser-based password managers.

180
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:38,670
So, prior work does hint at
answers to these questions

181
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:43,410
but as the guy who was wearing
a mask at last year's RSA

182
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:46,469
I'm particularly cautious
about making assumptions

183
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,630
when there's no data available

184
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:52,100
or when there very little data available.

185
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:56,400
So, I encouraged my students
to go get that data.

186
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:00,300
And now I'll hand the
presentation back to David,

187
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,742
who will tell you about how they did that.

188
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,290
- Thank you, Stuart.

189
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:09,849
We started this research
as a course project

190
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:13,323
for the Usable Privacy and
Security course at Berkeley.

191
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:17,760
Stuart teaches this course
along with Christian Bravo-Lilo,

192
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,623
who also joined the
project after the term.

193
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:26,343
The other two students are,
Christian Hercules and Jacky Ho.

194
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,680
This project was funded by

195
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,193
the Center for Long-Term Cybersecurity.

196
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:40,310
As Stuart said we were examining
the assumptions that we

197
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:43,739
as security professionals
make when encouraging people

198
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,283
to adopt password managers.

199
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:49,763
So we built our study around
these same three hypotheses.

200
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:54,729
We recruited participants
by displaying this offer via

201
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:56,163
a platform called Prolific.

202
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,550
People joined Prolific to get paid

203
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,650
to participate in research.

204
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:04,939
And researchers like us use Prolific,

205
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,943
to find and pay participants.

206
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,340
We started with a short
study, open to everyone.

207
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:15,130
To find people who use password managers,

208
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:20,130
we paid 20 cents for three
short multiple choice questions

209
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:22,650
that took about a minute
to complete in total.

210
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:29,123
And we paid that 20 cents
to 2,491 participants

211
00:12:31,173 --> 00:12:32,663
who entered our survey.

212
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:37,070
Since the goal of the
survey was to find people

213
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:39,060
who use password managers,

214
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,709
that would be our first question.

215
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:47,260
Now, many people have saved
passwords into their browsers

216
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:50,170
without realizing that when they do this

217
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:52,823
they are in fact using a password manager.

218
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:56,920
So, before asking participants if they use

219
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,240
the password manager,
we needed to explain,

220
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,370
that they might have been
using a password manager

221
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:03,570
without even knowing it.

222
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:09,900
Since some people use more
than one password manager

223
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,760
we asked them to focus on
the primary password manager

224
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,160
for their personal accounts.

225
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,530
About two thirds of
participants use some form

226
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:23,203
of a password manager.

227
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,350
By far the most

228
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:29,550
were using Chrome's
built-in password manager.

229
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:32,089
We had seen this in our
classroom project dataset

230
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:35,550
and we knew if we paid everyone who used

231
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:39,109
the Chrome password manager to
participate in the full study

232
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,770
we wouldn't have any money
left to get much data

233
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:43,420
from the other password managers.

234
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:48,730
So, we only invited one
out of 15 respondents

235
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:52,250
who used Chrome's password
manager to be part

236
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,350
of our extended study.

237
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:58,600
Of the third password managers,

238
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,440
the most common was LastPass.

239
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,703
So, we'd break out data
from it separately as well.

240
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:11,770
In the extended study, we
asked the participants for data

241
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:13,689
from their password managers dashboard

242
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,910
and participants couldn't
provide this data

243
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:20,492
if their password manager
didn't have a dashboard.

244
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:25,570
So, we wouldn't be able to
include these participants

245
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:26,803
in the extended study.

246
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,420
The most numerous of these were users

247
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:34,069
of BitWarden's free
edition, which turned out

248
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:36,433
to be nine out of 10 BitWarden users.

249
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:39,653
Their dashboard is a premium feature.

250
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:45,730
We also included those password managers

251
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:48,410
that didn't provide
information on both weak

252
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:50,480
and re-used passwords,

253
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,573
which includes Apple's KeyChain.

254
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:58,420
After filtering out 14
out of 15 Chrome users

255
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:01,140
and the password managers
that didn't provide

256
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:05,033
the data we needed, 376
participants remained.

257
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:11,830
To ensure participants had
enough time to get to know

258
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:13,365
their password manager, we asked

259
00:15:13,365 --> 00:15:16,300
how long had they been using it.

260
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:19,490
We only invited participants
to the extended study

261
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:21,330
if they had used their password manager

262
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:23,333
for at least two months.

263
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:29,979
And that reduced our number
of prospective participants

264
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:32,613
for the extended study, to 324.

265
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:37,450
Now, if you recall, we had promised

266
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:41,140
to only ask three questions in one minute.

267
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:44,173
That's three, 20 second questions.

268
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:48,622
We only had 20 seconds
and one question left.

269
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:53,320
And 20 seconds is not enough
to explain what they needed

270
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:56,460
to know to make an informed
decision to participate

271
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,423
in the full study.

272
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:03,760
So, we asked their
permission to tell about

273
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,913
the extended study.

274
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:09,700
The extended study paid
$5 and we'd pay them

275
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:13,550
an additional 25 cents, even
if they didn't wanna complete

276
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:14,652
the extended study.

277
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,110
And they still had to do,

278
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:20,700
all they had to do was read about it.

279
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:23,433
And almost everyone thought
that was a pretty good deal.

280
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:29,700
320 of 324, stuck with us to
learn about the extended study.

281
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:34,940
To participate in the extended study,

282
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:37,113
they needed to be on a desktop computer.

283
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:41,420
And they needed to be able
to use their password manager

284
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:44,002
through its desktop app or web interface.

285
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,000
We required that because
we wanted participants

286
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,820
to take a screenshot of their
dashboards, to upload it

287
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:55,243
and mobile apps forbid screenshots.

288
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:01,610
Since they needed to consent
to send the screenshots,

289
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:03,572
we needed to show them,

290
00:17:03,572 --> 00:17:05,983
what their products dashboard looked like.

291
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,530
A majority of users

292
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:11,680
of the third party password
managers dropped out,

293
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,323
for many different reasons.

294
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,520
Roughly a quarter of
participants in each group

295
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,913
were uncomfortable
uploading that screenshot.

296
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:25,483
That left us with 116 participants.

297
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,640
We validated each submitted entry,

298
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,143
comparing the reported
data with their screenshot,

299
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:36,860
we removed seven participants
who uploaded images

300
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:39,790
that made us suspect it was
not a genuine screenshot

301
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:40,743
of their dashboard.

302
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:44,423
And that left us with 109 participants.

303
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,100
Though, we were moved

304
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,770
from our analysis nine more participants

305
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,620
who completed the final study...

306
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:56,490
These are participants who had fewer

307
00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:00,233
than five saved passwords
in their password manager.

308
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:06,379
Now, to our questions about
the assumptions that we make

309
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,080
in recommending password managers.

310
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:13,790
The first, that users will
choose strong master password

311
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:16,143
to protect all of their other passwords.

312
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:21,113
So we asked them how they had
created their master password.

313
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:27,514
A few users of third-party
password managers used

314
00:18:27,515 --> 00:18:29,993
a randomly generated master password.

315
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:34,480
Though nobody using Chrome's
password manager had

316
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:39,373
and a sliver using approach,
we hadn't categorized.

317
00:18:41,362 --> 00:18:45,610
Most people use a password,
they generated mentally,

318
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:48,602
but the final category
really surprised us.

319
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,990
Many confessed that even
their master password,

320
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:57,023
was a re-used password.

321
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,920
We also asked participants
how they backed up

322
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,093
their master password.

323
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:08,193
Everyone seems to do something different.

324
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:13,543
And features like trusted
friends aren't heavily utilized.

325
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,623
Okay, so enough about master passwords.

326
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:23,080
Our next question was,

327
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,129
are users letting their password managers

328
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:27,243
choose strong passwords for them?

329
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:32,950
Or are they just using, password
managers to save keystrokes

330
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:35,580
while they stick with
passwords, they also manage

331
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,463
in their minds.

332
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:42,730
So we asked when you are
creating an account on a website

333
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:46,363
or change your password, which
are you more likely to do?

334
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:51,181
Let's start with LastPass.

335
00:19:51,181 --> 00:19:55,200
And the other third party
password managers, only about half

336
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,500
of the users rely on these products,

337
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,163
to generate a password for them.

338
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,930
Over a third of their
users keep using passwords

339
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:04,930
they have memorized.

340
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,840
Now you might think Chrome is doing

341
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,209
a terrible job in comparison.

342
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:14,660
79% of Chrome users,

343
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:17,593
aren't letting Chrome create
random passwords for them.

344
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:24,530
But remember, these are
people who didn't do

345
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:26,910
the work to find a
third-party password manager

346
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:28,793
or pay for one.

347
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,770
Many don't even know they're using one.

348
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:37,163
And Chrome hadn't had
this feature that long.

349
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:41,963
Many other browsers don't even offer it.

350
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:47,402
And the percent only
tells part of the story.

351
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:53,640
The total number of users
protected, is the number

352
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:58,110
who opt for random passwords
times the number using

353
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:59,413
the password manager.

354
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:05,679
Which means three times as many people

355
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:09,220
have started using random
passwords in their browsers

356
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:12,203
as compared to the next
most popular product.

357
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,630
And since some of our participants

358
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:19,870
may not have carefully read
that when they save a password

359
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:24,090
in Chrome they are actually
using a password manager.

360
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:25,923
So, we may be under counting.

361
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,430
So, if you happen to work for a company

362
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:34,780
that produces a popular web
browser and can increase

363
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:38,240
this number you could
have an incredible impact

364
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,653
on user security.

365
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,890
Now, to our final question.

366
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:47,930
Users may have accumulated accounts

367
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:50,400
with passwords over decades.

368
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,093
Would they do what it takes to
also protect those accounts?

369
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:59,123
Will they get rid of their old,
weak and re-used passwords?

370
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:04,659
This is the question that
inspired us to ask users

371
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:07,023
to upload images of their screenshots.

372
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:12,760
We asked them to provide the
numbers that we were collecting

373
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,440
from those screenshots, but the upload

374
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,913
was the most important.

375
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:20,199
Without it, we wouldn't be,

376
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,140
we wouldn't know if
participants read a number

377
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:26,310
from the wrong field
or if they mistyped it

378
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,180
or if they made a number up,
because taking a screenshot

379
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,253
was too difficult.

380
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:36,430
Or because they didn't
actually use the product

381
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:39,963
but wanted to make the
$5 in our full study.

382
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:44,939
So we provided a detailed instructions

383
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,443
on how to take a screenshot.

384
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:51,870
And we provided product
specific instructions

385
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,370
on how to do that.

386
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:57,408
Instructions to tell them,
how to find the dashboard

387
00:22:57,408 --> 00:23:00,090
with the data that we
needed in the product

388
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:01,139
that they were using.

389
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:05,780
Complete with illustrations
of what they capture

390
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,572
and how to upload it.

391
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:13,350
And as mentioned earlier, we did ask them

392
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:18,350
to enter it themselves, value by value.

393
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:24,230
Just to see how reliably they can do that

394
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:26,743
which could be handy to
know for future studies.

395
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:31,470
And so we'll start our analysis

396
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:34,220
with the number of participants,
who didn't have any weak

397
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,453
or re-used passwords.

398
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:39,060
I'm not hiding the number for Chrome.

399
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:43,010
It's just that everybody
had at least one weak

400
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:44,203
or re-used password.

401
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,899
That's not surprising.

402
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:51,159
Most of us use sites
that require passwords

403
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,203
for no good reason.

404
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:57,360
If a password is not
protecting anything of value

405
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,372
then why replace it?

406
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:05,340
So, we asked participants
or any of these passwords

407
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,423
that you have, should they be replaced?

408
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,003
And some people said, no.

409
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:16,899
Now, some of those participants said

410
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:21,290
their weak or re-use
passwords weren't worth fixing

411
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:23,223
and I guess that makes sense.

412
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:28,910
But the rest said that some or
all of those passwords needed

413
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:30,330
to be replaced.

414
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:33,220
Somewhere between two
thirds to three quarters

415
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:36,170
of all the users had
weak or re-use passwords

416
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:37,433
that should be replaced.

417
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:43,233
And various reasons why
they hadn't done so.

418
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:48,143
They had known it was too much work.

419
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:52,480
Maybe they hadn't gotten around to it yet

420
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:56,910
or maybe they were worried
something could go wrong

421
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:58,610
if they had replaced the password.

422
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,399
We did the same for passwords

423
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,133
that their password managers
knew were compromised.

424
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:10,250
And we expected these green
bars, which show people

425
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:13,483
with no compromised
passwords to be much bigger.

426
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:18,750
Alas, lots of people had
passwords known to be compromised

427
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:21,673
in breaches but still did not fix them.

428
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:28,360
Again, we asked participants
if they cared about

429
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,060
the accounts with these passwords.

430
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,889
And some participants only
had compromised passwords

431
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:36,990
they didn't feel it needed to be replaced.

432
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:41,890
But many participants had passwords

433
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:44,083
they knew they should replace.

434
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:49,330
We asked participants
if they'd be encouraged

435
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:52,050
to replace their weak
and re-used passwords.

436
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,863
Many said, they never had been.

437
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,142
The same is true for
compromised passwords.

438
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:03,980
In fact, roughly half of the
participants didn't know about

439
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:06,560
the dashboard in their password manager,

440
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,253
before coming across our study.

441
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:14,360
We asked many of those who
hadn't known about the dashboard

442
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,709
whether they'll expect
to use it in the future.

443
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:22,370
There weren't that many
of these participants.

444
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:25,622
So, I'll use the raw numbers
instead of percentages.

445
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:32,410
In all groups, a majority said
they either would definitely,

446
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:37,323
or probably use it again and
most said, at least maybe.

447
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:43,570
I should caution that this
is a self-reported data

448
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:45,290
in a study where participants knew

449
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:46,863
we were studying dashboards.

450
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:52,150
Participants might have said
they would use them again

451
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:53,920
because that's what they...

452
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,770
that's what they had thought
we had hoped they would say.

453
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:01,570
To know whether they actually
would use the dashboard

454
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:04,639
and improve their password manager habits,

455
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,790
we would need to perform
a follow-up study.

456
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:10,203
So, in summary.

457
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,920
We should not assume

458
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:16,223
that people would choose
strong master passwords.

459
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:20,919
Even though doing so is essential

460
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,600
to protect all other passwords stored

461
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:28,600
by their password manager,
we should not assume

462
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:31,760
that people should start
using password managers

463
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,590
will trust the password manager

464
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:35,703
to create strong passwords for them.

465
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:43,820
Or that people will replace
their weak or re-used passwords

466
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,483
even when reminded about them.

467
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:52,480
Or even people will replace
their breach password

468
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,920
which their password manager
is known to be compromised

469
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,970
when alerted to them.

470
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:02,290
In short, there's lots to be done

471
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:07,253
and it's work that
desperately needs doing.

472
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:15,300
Thanks for coming all
this way to see our talk.
