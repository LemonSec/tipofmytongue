1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:02,300
- Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:05,119
Thank you for joining
us for this discussion.

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,910
I'm Catherine Lotrionte.

4
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:09,310
I currently am serving
as a Senior Researcher

5
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:10,950
at Georgetown University

6
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:14,729
and a non-resident
senior associate at CSIS.

7
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:17,240
I have the pleasure today
of serving as the moderator

8
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,580
for this panel discussion titled,

9
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:24,250
The Cyberspace Solarium Commission,
what is left to be done.

10
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:27,920
The Cyberspace Solarium
Commission was established in 2019

11
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,260
in the National Defense Authorization Act.

12
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:33,090
Its mandate was to develop a consensus

13
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:36,070
on a strategic approach to
defending the United States

14
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:38,510
in cyberspace against cyber attacks

15
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:40,930
of significant consequences.

16
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:44,330
The co-chairs of the commission
was Senator Angus King

17
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:46,320
and representative Mike Gallagher,

18
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,180
along with eight commissioners,

19
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,130
including Frank Cilluffo,

20
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:53,130
who is here joining us today on the panel.

21
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:55,470
The commission presented its final report

22
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:58,910
to the public on March 11, 2020.

23
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:02,069
The report had over 80 recommendations

24
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,220
tied to its proposed strategy
of layered cyber deterrence.

25
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:10,480
25 of those recommendations
have been codified into law.

26
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,780
The National Defense
Authorization Act of 2021,

27
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:16,690
we authorized the commission to collect

28
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:19,179
and assess feedback on the analysis

29
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:22,670
and recommendations contained
within its final report.

30
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:27,670
Also to review the the
implementation of its recommendations

31
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:29,759
and complete some of the activities

32
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,330
originally set forth for the commission.

33
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:35,830
Since then there've been
a number of white papers

34
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:37,700
that have been released by the commission

35
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,890
on topics such as ICT supply chain,

36
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:42,790
the Federal Cyber Workforce,

37
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:45,540
and the cybersecurity
lessons from the pandemic,

38
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,860
which also included additional
new recommendations.

39
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:51,500
I would like to briefly
introduce our panelists

40
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,770
in the owner that they will speak today,

41
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:56,470
providing us with their
unique perspectives

42
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:58,150
on the commission's work.

43
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:02,150
All three of these panelists
are truly cyber veterans

44
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:04,660
and have extensive government experience

45
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,350
and diverse perspectives,

46
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:09,993
which should provide plenty
of food for thought today.

47
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:14,350
First, as I mentioned, Frank
Cilluffo was joining us.

48
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:16,470
He was one of the commissioners

49
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,720
of the Cyberspace Solarium Commission.

50
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,730
He also is the Director
of Auburn University's

51
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:23,410
McCray Institute for Cyber

52
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:25,263
and Critical Infrastructure Security.

53
00:02:26,558 --> 00:02:29,260
He he previously served
as the special assistant

54
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:32,440
to president George W.
Bush for Homeland security

55
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:36,340
immediately following the
911 attacks against the US.

56
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:39,160
Next, we'll hear from Paul Rosenzweig.

57
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,540
Paul also has had extensive experience

58
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:42,840
in the federal government,

59
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,490
including formally serving
as deputy assistant secretary

60
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:49,550
for policy at the Department
of Homeland security.

61
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:53,110
Paul currently is a
senior fellow at R Street.

62
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:56,430
Last, but certainly not
least is Tom Corcoran.

63
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:59,450
Tom is one of those
cyber guys that was cool

64
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:01,750
before the cybers were cool.

65
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,410
He formally served as a staffer

66
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,890
on the house and Senate
intelligence committees

67
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:08,809
and he worked for the
Department of Defense.

68
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:11,760
Currently, Tom is the
head of cybersecurity

69
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,720
at Farmers Insurance.

70
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,640
Frank, if I would ask you

71
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,750
to please kick off the conversations,

72
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,680
maybe framing the work
of the commission for us,

73
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:25,050
talking a little bit about
the detailed recommendations,

74
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:27,840
and then possibly giving us some insight

75
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,730
into the legislation.

76
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:31,769
I'd like to return to you Frank,

77
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:34,370
once Paul and Tom have spoken,

78
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:37,650
so maybe we can get some
of your personal opinions,

79
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:39,290
views, likes or dislikes,

80
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:41,340
if you can share them with us

81
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,633
about some of the recommendations

82
00:03:42,633 --> 00:03:44,130
in the work of the commission.

83
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,590
So Frank over to you

84
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:48,950
and thank you all three
of you for joining us.

85
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:50,780
- Awesome, well, thank you, Catherine.

86
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,700
Real privilege and pleasure

87
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,799
as always to be on a panel with you

88
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,560
and two good friends, Paul and Tom.

89
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,510
So this should be a lots of fun.

90
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:04,560
Lemme start with sort of
stepping back a little bit.

91
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,870
As you mentioned that very aptly 25,

92
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:09,910
it's actually 27 provisions

93
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:13,890
of our initial recommendations
were codified into law.

94
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:17,760
So pretty significant
impact first go around,

95
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:21,630
but we're by no means running
a victory lap at this point.

96
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,190
I mean, first and foremost,

97
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:25,480
we need to make sure that
some of those recommendations

98
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,450
are being acted upon
and the intent behind.

99
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:29,760
Some of those recommendations

100
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,990
are moving in the right direction.

101
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:33,520
And secondly, we need to make sure

102
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,760
that the resources are backing up

103
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,940
some of those recommendations.

104
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,760
The old adage policy with
that resources is rhetoric.

105
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,593
We need to make sure

106
00:04:41,593 --> 00:04:43,720
that we're funding some
of these initiatives

107
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,980
as well as hopefully pointing
us in the right direction

108
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,240
from a policy perspective.

109
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,470
So that's our first order of business.

110
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:57,360
Subsequently we have about
30 primary recommendations

111
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,070
we're advancing this fiscal year.

112
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,960
And because we came out

113
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,940
of the National Defense Authorization Act,

114
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:06,700
that was obviously the
primary vehicle we looked at

115
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,050
to last year.

116
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:10,550
This year we obviously recognize

117
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:13,250
that cyber goes far
beyond national security.

118
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,290
So we need to make sure

119
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:17,700
that there are other
congressional vehicles committees

120
00:05:18,688 --> 00:05:21,370
and other approaches
to be able to implement

121
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:25,410
some of our recommendations
and provisions.

122
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:27,570
I thought I'd just touch on a couple

123
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:29,863
that I think are most important.

124
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:33,460
You'll see a lot of emphasis this year

125
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:36,239
on translating the nouns into the verbs

126
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,070
in terms of public-private partnerships.

127
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:41,150
We've all been around this
discussion for decades.

128
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:42,479
I think we've all written books,

129
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:46,340
reports, papers testified
on this particular issue,

130
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,739
but what we wanna be able to do

131
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,960
is translate some of
those nouns into verbs

132
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:54,960
to really have practical,
pragmatic and operational impact.

133
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:57,830
So one of the first
recommendations we're looking at

134
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:01,560
is establishing a Joint
Collaborative Environment.

135
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,130
We're calling it JCE for short.

136
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,620
This is to actually
bring the private sector,

137
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,880
not as a secondary afterthought,

138
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,200
but actually have a seat at the table

139
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,650
in terms of implementing
some of our operations

140
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:16,520
and implementing some of
our cyber defense measures

141
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,890
much more on that, happy to touch on that,

142
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:21,640
during Q&A as well.

143
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,570
We're also looking to designate

144
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:26,360
what we're calling systemically
critical infrastructure

145
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,700
of for acronym CP, but
the acronym is what it is.

146
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:33,860
The idea is to make sure that
our genuine lifeline sectors,

147
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:37,320
not all critical infrastructures
are equally critical.

148
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,630
US government, DHS in particular,

149
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:42,650
good work has designated
17 sectors to be critical,

150
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:45,190
but some from a white blind perspective,

151
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:47,100
or even more critical than others.

152
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,740
And as such some,

153
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:52,110
we need to establish
both burdens and benefits

154
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:54,150
to some of those that are going to have

155
00:06:55,113 --> 00:06:58,780
a more significant
public-private partnership

156
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:01,599
to be able to focus our efforts on.

157
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,300
And we all know what those
lifeline sectors are,

158
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,610
but I'm happy to jump into
that in greater detail later.

159
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:10,040
But third, and I'm happy to say that

160
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:13,890
when we asked for a
cyber state of distress,

161
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:16,630
which was really looking at
a whole new set of issues

162
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:19,610
around continuity of the economy.

163
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:22,440
So the old coupe and Kog
programs of government,

164
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,590
we thought we needed to bring into

165
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:27,030
a private sector domain as well.

166
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:31,919
And in that we are calling
for a cyber response fund.

167
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,160
So think of natural disasters,

168
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,350
think about the need to be able to have

169
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:42,350
to backstop our state local
tribal and territorial partners,

170
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:43,700
in a cyber bank.

171
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:46,340
So a significant incident, the privates,

172
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:50,150
I mean, the state and local
clearly do not have the same,

173
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:53,030
wherewithal and resources that
the federal government does,

174
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:56,539
I'm happy to touch on that
in greater depth as well.

175
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,000
Another big recommendation

176
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,583
is standing up the Cyber Diplomacy Act.

177
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,980
This was a bit of a legislation

178
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:06,950
that Congressman McCaul
and Congressman Landry VIN

179
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:10,800
and others were supporting
on the house right now.

180
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,080
And that's to elevate
state department's role

181
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,580
to an ambassador role

182
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:18,550
and to a bureau role to better fit into

183
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:22,310
the broader inter-agency
sets of issues around cyber.

184
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:24,890
This is not about seeding
our national interests,

185
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:26,400
it's actually about empowering it.

186
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,859
So we can work with our allies

187
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:31,170
to be able to better push back on Huawei

188
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:36,020
or ZTE or Kaspersky and I can
go on and on on that as well.

189
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,429
And I'll just leave really quickly

190
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:40,819
three more just cause
they're important to me.

191
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,793
One is a data breach notification law.

192
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,100
We need to make sure

193
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,670
that we have the reporting
structures in place

194
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,689
in terms of a breach.

195
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:52,380
This has been around for decades,

196
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:55,560
but I think there's finally
awareness that we need

197
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,219
to be able to move forward on law there.

198
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:02,000
And then, two more are around supply chain

199
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,630
just because it's an area
I've spent a lot of time on,

200
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:08,390
and I chaired an effort for
DHS on economic security

201
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:10,420
that also zeroed in on
some of these issues.

202
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:11,252
So we're calling

203
00:09:11,253 --> 00:09:14,240
for a National Supply
Chain Intelligence Center.

204
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,220
And again, this is not just the feds.

205
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,810
This is actually integrating
with the private sector,

206
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,239
know yourself, know your enemy,

207
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,430
and we don't have visibility
across our supply chain

208
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,030
as we'd like right now.

209
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,640
And finally, we're also calling

210
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,439
for a National Security
Investment Corporation.

211
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,760
So there are a lot of loopholes

212
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:37,760
in terms of early stage
funding and the like where

213
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:40,500
issues of concern from foreign investment

214
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,800
need to be addressed.

215
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,490
So I've never had an unspoken thought.

216
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:44,530
I went on way too long,

217
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:46,860
but I could go on for so much longer,

218
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,880
but I'll stop there, Catherine, thank you.

219
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,810
- Oh, that's great.

220
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:50,910
Thank you, Frank.

221
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:54,990
Paul onto you, what are your
favorite recommendations

222
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:58,890
or least favorite and what
do you predict in this space?

223
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:03,890
- I think that it's
imperative at this point

224
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:07,410
to be a little more,

225
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:08,800
it'd be narrowly focused

226
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,032
on what's really important going forward.

227
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,380
The NDAA is a great vehicle,

228
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:17,439
but most of the remaining recommendations

229
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,440
unfortunately fall more
or less outside of it.

230
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:24,040
And depending upon how the
senate parliamentarian, you know,

231
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,469
feels that morning after breakfast,

232
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:30,271
you may or may not be able
to get some things in there.

233
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:33,040
So for my money,

234
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,480
we're gonna have to pick and choose

235
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,193
a few of the really important ones.

236
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,890
I won't repeat or second any of the ones

237
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:44,210
that Frank said simply
because he's covered them all,

238
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:46,230
rather for the next couple of minutes

239
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:48,120
I wanna talk about one
that he didn't mention

240
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,470
that is to my mind essential,

241
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:55,790
and that I hope will be a
singular focus with Congress.

242
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:59,043
The creation of a Bureau
of Cyber Statistics,

243
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,200
where the commission has recommended,

244
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,130
it be in the department of commerce.

245
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:08,800
I'm pretty much agnostic as to the where,

246
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,810
I'm pretty much agnostic
as to the structure,

247
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:15,729
whether it's a singular agency
or it has a three heads,

248
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:18,570
how it's funded, all those
things can be answered,

249
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:20,640
but they're less important, I think,

250
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,223
than the idea of actually
sitting down and doing it.

251
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:27,610
To my mind, our biggest problem

252
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:31,790
in cybersecurity right now is that,

253
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:33,829
to put it in my elevator speech voice,

254
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:36,950
cybersecurity is an art, not a science.

255
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:40,150
And that's because we can
tell you qualitatively

256
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,079
what we think works.

257
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,440
We can talk about, you know,

258
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,940
it's better to have passwords than not,

259
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,720
and two factor authentication

260
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,320
or multi-factor authentication is good,

261
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,640
but we can't tell you how good.

262
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:53,860
And if I gave you 5
million dollars and said,

263
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:57,080
spend this on improving the
security of an enterprise,

264
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:00,820
of the average system
couldn't actually put numbers

265
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,940
to a proposal to decide
whether or not to do

266
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:10,199
threat hunting or a better
training of employees.

267
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,975
We probably think better
training of employees would work,

268
00:12:13,975 --> 00:12:16,320
but we can't numerous size that in ways

269
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,580
that are really effective.

270
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:21,380
To my mind that needs to change.

271
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:25,710
If we're going to actually
have a significant effort

272
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:30,290
to systematize America's
approach to cyber security.

273
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:32,717
And the Bureau of Cyber Statistics

274
00:12:32,717 --> 00:12:37,717
is likely to be a venue for
creating those types of metrics,

275
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,280
first agreement on what
the metrics might be

276
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,130
or how to develop them,

277
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:46,939
and then about how to implement them.

278
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,920
From my perspective,

279
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:53,089
metrics would be useful at at
least three different levels.

280
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:55,920
One of them is the one that
Frank has already mentioned,

281
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,979
which is simply incident,
response and counting.

282
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:03,570
It boggles my mind that 15 years

283
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:07,500
into this cybersecurity crisis,

284
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,160
pretty much since 2005, 2006,

285
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,579
we still don't have an operating picture

286
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:19,580
of how frequently and what
sorts of breaches occur

287
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:20,653
in the United States.

288
00:13:20,653 --> 00:13:23,700
We're doing better than
we did 15 years ago,

289
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,460
but without a comprehensive
breach notification law,

290
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,280
we simply will never get a sense

291
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,280
of what's actually
happening on the ground.

292
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33,089
And that makes it impossible
to do trend analysis

293
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:35,463
or gap analysis with any efficacy.

294
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:39,800
But even that is doing better now

295
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,392
than my kind of other two ideas,

296
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:45,217
that I believe will be, you know,

297
00:13:45,217 --> 00:13:47,699
the commission has put on the plate

298
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,550
for the Bureau of Cyber Statistics.

299
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:53,400
One is what I would call,

300
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,290
network cyber hygiene metrics.

301
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:58,360
That is large scale metrics

302
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:01,710
about what's happening at
the top level, the network,

303
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:04,360
how frequently we see bad traffic,

304
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,650
where it's sourcing from,

305
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:11,650
what sorts of techniques, you know, TTPs,

306
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:14,513
the bad guys are using at a bulk level.

307
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:20,090
It was a surprise to us, a
strategic surprise to us,

308
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:22,620
the transition to ransomware

309
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:25,580
and the bad guys panoply
of activities, you know,

310
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,900
in the last five years.

311
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,360
But that would have been no surprise

312
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:32,220
have we been paying better
attention to the signals,

313
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,180
the antecedent signals for that before,

314
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:37,040
and we simply had no way of measuring it.

315
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,339
And then the third bucket that I wanna,

316
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:41,417
I would love to see

317
00:14:41,417 --> 00:14:43,780
are Bureau of Cyber Statistics work on,

318
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:47,990
is kind of the tweener
stuff, enterprise metrics.

319
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:52,090
How do we measure the security
of a particular enterprise?

320
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:55,520
And that's going to be
critical in the end.

321
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,210
If we're ever going to get to a place

322
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:00,240
where we can actually differentiate

323
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,530
and say that company A is doing
a better job than company B.

324
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:08,473
And that ought to be reflected
in pricing, insurance,

325
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:11,140
you know, security efforts,

326
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,680
the assistance they get from government,

327
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,849
all sorts of things with flow from that.

328
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:19,430
And right now that's a
blank space, pretty much,

329
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:21,589
certainly in the public domain.

330
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:24,780
There are some products out
there that are proprietary,

331
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,510
but they're not transparent.

332
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:29,300
And the ultimate goal here for me

333
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,790
is to have metrics that are transparent,

334
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:36,110
are countable, auditiable, affective,

335
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:39,620
generally agreed upon,
widely used and scalable.

336
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:42,140
And we're nowhere near that right now.

337
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:47,040
And for me, the single most significant

338
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,550
on addressed commission recommendation

339
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:53,000
is the creation of a
Bureau of Cyber Statistics,

340
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,480
which would be the first step on the road

341
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,000
to what I consider to be the holy grail,

342
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,180
which is getting to a point

343
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:05,497
where cyber security
is like bridge safety.

344
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:09,550
You can put a number on it,

345
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:12,319
or at least a range of
numbers that is better than,

346
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,320
yeah, it's better than it used to be.

347
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,820
I could talk about many
other recommendations,

348
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:20,100
but like Frank, I've probably
gone on far too long,

349
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:24,170
and so I will recede and talk
to some of the others later,

350
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:26,170
but I'll turn it over to you and to Tom.

351
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:28,680
- Paul thanks, thank you very much.

352
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,160
And we will return to some of these.

353
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:34,069
So Tom let's hear from you.

354
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:34,910
From your perspective,

355
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:38,010
you've had experience
on the hill in the past,

356
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:41,560
but you've also seen things
from the executive branch.

357
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,729
Of the recommendation,

358
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:46,490
do you have one that for
you as most important

359
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:48,630
or top of your mind,

360
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:50,810
most effective in solving
some of the problems?

361
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:52,150
What are you thinking?

362
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,060
- Yeah, thanks, Catherine.

363
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:53,892
I would say that actually

364
00:16:53,893 --> 00:16:56,710
the two that struck me most network

365
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:59,240
are probably most colored by
my private sector experience,

366
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,550
and they were both,

367
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:02,530
you sort of alluded to
you by Paul and Frank,

368
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:04,310
but I'd go a little deeper on them.

369
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,230
The first is that, you know,

370
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:08,762
that National Data Protection
and Data Protection Law,

371
00:17:08,762 --> 00:17:10,139
that the report calls for.

372
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:13,900
And well, I would say
data breach is important,

373
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:17,730
you know, for all the reasons
that Frank and Paul suggested.

374
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:19,150
I would also add to it that,

375
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:22,670
companies that operate
nationally in the US,

376
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:23,810
every time they have an issue,

377
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:25,339
they have to do a 50 state analysis

378
00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:26,609
of what's required of them.

379
00:17:26,609 --> 00:17:28,959
And so, sitting in national standard

380
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,380
would certainly make things a lot easier

381
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,120
for American companies,

382
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,610
and especially for companies
don't have the resources

383
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:36,320
to have a big regulatory
team to figure that out,

384
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,520
would make their lives a lot easier.

385
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,129
And also it's a fairness issue,

386
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:40,530
that why do, you know,

387
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:42,850
citizens of state A get
very little protection

388
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:43,939
and visibility into what happens,

389
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:46,000
whereas, you know, state B,

390
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,340
they get incredibly risky details

391
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,370
and maybe even like a
private right of actions

392
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:51,330
to deal with an issue of negligence

393
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:53,250
that impacts their privacy.

394
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,850
And so I think spreading that

395
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:59,730
equally across all the US I
think would be a good idea.

396
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:03,000
Also I think maybe setting some
standards while we're at it,

397
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,300
for all companies should
meet, you know, a minimum bar.

398
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,470
As an insurance company,

399
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:09,850
the company I worked for is subject,

400
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:11,620
and we were licensed in
the state of New York.

401
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,456
So we're subject to

402
00:18:13,457 --> 00:18:16,647
the New York Department of
Financial Services Regulation.

403
00:18:16,647 --> 00:18:18,649
And it's a fantastic regulation indeed.

404
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:21,050
It was a great conversation

405
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:22,350
between the state of New York

406
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:24,600
and all the companies
will be impacted by it.

407
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,590
The first year after wasn't great,

408
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:29,199
but after a lot of conversations,

409
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,900
we got to something that's
not only, very, you know,

410
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,680
so straightforward to comply with.

411
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,850
It's also, you know, actually a standard

412
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,360
that any company should reasonably meet.

413
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,429
And why should only, you know,

414
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:42,560
insurance companies and banks

415
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,460
be subject to that kind of regulation.

416
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:47,650
I think most, most
companies should be subject

417
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:48,920
to that kind of regulation

418
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,670
if they're handling customer data,

419
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:53,520
they provide a service
that people are paying for.

420
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,510
Anyway, so I think obviously

421
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:56,090
that's going to be a really tough trick

422
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:57,100
for Congress to pull off,

423
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,439
and I think it's something
they should get done.

424
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,420
I also am a big fan of the
joint collaborative environment,

425
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:04,880
that's called for in the report.

426
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,270
I would probably though,

427
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,250
although it talks about private,

428
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:10,290
public partnerships in there,

429
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:12,930
I would probably set the fulcrum

430
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:14,810
closer to the private
sector side of the balance

431
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:16,510
in terms of what needs to be done.

432
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,620
The private sector has most
of the tools and needs.

433
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:23,260
It just doesn't always
have the right information.

434
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:26,690
And I would say that the average company

435
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:29,090
doesn't have the resources
to dive into the details

436
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:32,129
of a cyber threat and tune
their tools to meet the threat.

437
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:34,380
They're relying on what I
would call a black box service

438
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:37,430
from a big enterprise provider like Cisco

439
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:40,380
or Palo Alto to deal with that.

440
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:43,160
And so I would like to see
the government providing

441
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,310
more real-time threat
intelligence to those companies.

442
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:47,710
They could automatically
feed it into their tools.

443
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:49,070
Now, maybe not in real
time, but, you know,

444
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:51,710
in a matter of nanoseconds,
they could get that protection.

445
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:53,410
We already have a good
running start on that

446
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:56,570
with an institution called
the Cyber Threat Alliance.

447
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,030
It's as a private sector organization

448
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,420
where a bunch of companies
have gotten together

449
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:03,840
and cyber providers have gotten
together and decided that

450
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,689
the actual threat
information is a commodity

451
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:08,180
and they're not going to sell
their products this time.

452
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,130
Differentiations this time

453
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:10,610
is the way they provide that service,

454
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:12,120
how fast they act on it,

455
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,120
how well they integrate with other tools

456
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,949
that should be the competition space,

457
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:17,210
not the threatened tokens itself.

458
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:19,540
And so right now it's
mostly just information

459
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:21,820
being shared between those
big sort of, you know,

460
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,929
high-end cyber threat providers.

461
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:26,246
But I would love to see
information from DHS

462
00:20:26,246 --> 00:20:28,700
and NSA being washed through that

463
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:32,310
and being provided so that,
you know, down on the streets,

464
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:33,560
you know, with farmers intelligence,

465
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,500
I don't need to know where
the information came from.

466
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,010
I just need to know that, you know,

467
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:39,470
my Palo Alto provider believes that

468
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:41,650
it's good information that
blocks that threat as a result.

469
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:43,360
And I don't care where it came from,

470
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,080
one of their competitors or came from NSA

471
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,409
or from one of NSA's
sort of European allies,

472
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:51,300
as long as I get the information fast

473
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:54,020
and I don't even really need
to know why they blocked it.

474
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,940
Just that, hey, this is
a threat, we blocked it,

475
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,400
have a nice day.

476
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:02,400
- Tom, if I can pick up on
that very recommendation

477
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:05,200
from the commission
returned to Frank with it,

478
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,440
but also hear from both of you on this.

479
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,970
And Paul, I don't think you brought it up,

480
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:13,730
but I'd love to kind
of put you on the spot

481
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:14,680
to have you think about it.

482
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:18,030
And that's the Joint
Collaborative Environment

483
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:18,889
that you've talked about,

484
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:22,410
because as many people, most recently,

485
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:24,520
probably one of the things
that's been on everyone's mind,

486
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,340
of course, is the SolarWinds incident.

487
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:32,340
And there's been discussion
around that incident

488
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:35,850
and some proposals by the former,

489
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:37,280
NSA's former general counsel,

490
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,490
one of them and others,

491
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:40,640
but the creation of a new center.

492
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,380
Tom, you mentioned, you'd like to lean

493
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:44,740
more on the government
in that environment,

494
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:48,110
providing information
to the private sector.

495
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:51,189
You know, from what I've read
in open sources on SolarWinds,

496
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:53,680
it was the private sector
that had the information,

497
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,350
came to the government and notified them.

498
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:58,580
So if we could talk a little bit about,

499
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,610
maybe Frank, tell us a little bit

500
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:04,800
how of the commission
viewed this environment,

501
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,149
how it would have been different

502
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:07,913
than anything we'd done before?

503
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:10,650
That environment might
turn out to be something

504
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:13,940
than different than what the
commission envisioned, maybe.

505
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:16,140
But then the big question to all of you,

506
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:20,264
if that was in place before SolarWinds,

507
00:22:20,264 --> 00:22:22,449
would things have been different, right?

508
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:25,160
Would we have had a different outcome

509
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,580
months earlier potentially,

510
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,149
on just that most recent,

511
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:31,763
one of the most recent,
you know, incidents?

512
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:35,480
- Catherine, so I'll just jump in quickly.

513
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,440
I mean, my thinking is very consistent

514
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,660
with where Paul and Tom were

515
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:43,400
in terms of the JCE,

516
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,330
the Joint Collaborative Cyber Environment.

517
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:48,560
And at the end of the day,

518
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:51,280
we're talking about the
same question we've had

519
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,540
and that's tasking collection priorities.

520
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,480
So at the end of the day,

521
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:59,080
this would allow as long as their burdens,

522
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,300
as well as benefits

523
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:04,500
to companies that could
actually absorb information.

524
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,880
Again, you can scrub it
of sources and methods

525
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,713
to Tom's point.

526
00:23:07,713 --> 00:23:09,790
You don't need to know precisely who,

527
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:10,980
what, where, when, how,

528
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:13,030
but you need to know that
this is actually important.

529
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:15,230
This is something we need to be moving on.

530
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:17,690
And that is the thinking

531
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:21,790
behind the JCE sets of
recommendations going forward,

532
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:24,240
is where there would actually be

533
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,820
a cloud enabled environment
that would be the pooling

534
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,840
of different resources and information.

535
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:34,840
So all things said and
done, easier said than done.

536
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,020
I mean, the reality is,

537
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:40,260
is there all sorts of authorities

538
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:42,900
and there's a reason we
haven't answered this question

539
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,470
for quite some time, it's not easy.

540
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:46,820
You also need to make sure

541
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:50,830
that we take the privacy
considerations very seriously

542
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:53,129
and there are a whole host of issues

543
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:54,890
that need to be tackled.

544
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:59,640
That said, we can't continue
to punt on second down.

545
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,490
I can understand punting on fourth down

546
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:02,900
when it's fourth and 10,

547
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:06,120
but we've been punting this
ball for way too long right now.

548
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,473
And if you ask me,

549
00:24:08,937 --> 00:24:11,820
that's what I meant by translating
the nouns into the verbs.

550
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:13,800
I think we've admired the problem,

551
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:17,090
we've diagnosed what needs to be done.

552
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:19,530
Once we start getting
into this solution set,

553
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:20,800
it's going to be a little clumsy.

554
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,300
It's probably going to change,

555
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:27,100
but that's where the action
will actually be to have,

556
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:30,209
I think, significant impact and outcomes.

557
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:34,713
So I think we're speaking on
the same sheet of music there.

558
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:37,710
And I'll stop on that,

559
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:41,880
but I have a bunch of other
items that if there's time,

560
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,713
I'd be happy to bring up,

561
00:24:42,713 --> 00:24:43,840
but that's a great point.

562
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,203
- Yeah, Frank, we definitely
wanna come back to you.

563
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:49,133
Lemme bug you Paul for a second.

564
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:53,500
Speaking on that, the Joint
Collaborative Environment,

565
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:56,060
what sorts of potentially new authorities

566
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,480
might we have to envision?

567
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:01,140
If we want this to come
to fruition and work?

568
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:02,970
- Well, I mean, I think
that's a great question,

569
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:07,970
and honestly, though I am encouraged

570
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:10,640
by the inclusion of the JCE

571
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,480
in the commission's recommendations,

572
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,270
I think that the way we're structured now,

573
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:19,690
it's almost impossible to implement it.

574
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:23,670
And it's going to take a
really significant rethinking

575
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:26,860
of how we share information.

576
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:31,060
There's a reason why
all of our prior efforts

577
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:34,659
at threat and vulnerability
information sharing

578
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:37,540
have failed or have been
less than fully successful

579
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:38,572
in this environment.

580
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:42,300
And it's simply because, or not simply,

581
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:47,300
but it is clearly because
we have a necessity

582
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:53,100
for rapid, agile
distribution of information

583
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,610
that is fundamentally inconsistent

584
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:58,949
with the structure of our
governance systems, right?

585
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:00,670
I mean, the commission rightly

586
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:03,750
call for an information
sharing environment

587
00:26:04,625 --> 00:26:06,513
that has speed and agility.

588
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,129
I mean, that's a drag.

589
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:12,330
Those are two words that will never,

590
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:16,090
never be said about any federal agency

591
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:17,709
or any governmental agency.

592
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:20,980
And I don't mean that in a mean way.

593
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,330
Maybe a little bit in a mean way,

594
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:24,649
but I don't really mean it in a mean way.

595
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:26,830
I mean, it as a statement of reality,

596
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:29,740
that our hierarchical system of governance

597
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:33,810
in the federal system
and in the states systems

598
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:38,810
is built around limitations
on speed and ability,

599
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:42,913
as a proxy for
accountability and oversight.

600
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:48,780
And to date that has hamstrung our ability

601
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:54,360
to move information quickly
to the private sector.

602
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,929
The centralizing instincts
that come from, you know,

603
00:26:57,930 --> 00:26:59,320
the commission suggested

604
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:04,280
that perhaps the JCE will be
CYSA or somewhere like that.

605
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:08,389
That's going to necessarily mean

606
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:11,810
that there'll be all sorts
of structures and authorities

607
00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:13,240
that come with CYSA,

608
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,800
that will slow things down.

609
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,183
From my perspective,

610
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,570
when you asked what
authorities do we need?

611
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:24,669
I would say that the right
way to do a JCE of this sort,

612
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:28,310
would be to completely construct
a purpose-built entity,

613
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:30,803
not subservient to any other institution,

614
00:27:31,835 --> 00:27:34,410
in which the government
is a seat at the table

615
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:38,500
that is no different in
terms of authority to add,

616
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,980
subtract, multiply, or
divide information from it.

617
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:43,600
Then from the private
sector that had a separate,

618
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,860
small, nimble kind of Silicon valley,

619
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,530
agile developments type,

620
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:51,129
executive secretary for the creation

621
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:53,670
of new and different ways
of information sharing,

622
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:57,330
test them out, they fail,
move on, try another one.

623
00:27:57,330 --> 00:27:59,780
That's the type of structured environment

624
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,790
that we are capable of creating,

625
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:05,120
that the Global Cyber
Alliance is sort of creating,

626
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,530
but even there it's a
structured environment,

627
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:10,960
because of the large size
of the institutions involved

628
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,693
that would really be effective.

629
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:18,483
I honestly don't think we have
the political will for that,

630
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:24,990
but if we did, it could
really be effective,

631
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:26,893
it could be a real time game changer.

632
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:32,120
And so I love the commission

633
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,320
and I am certainly with Frank here,

634
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,419
I don't want to say anything
bad about the commission,

635
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:40,410
but this is one where the
instinct to do something

636
00:28:41,912 --> 00:28:46,773
is going to run a hard up into
the reality of no, we can't

637
00:28:46,773 --> 00:28:50,159
in the judiciary committee

638
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,890
of the house of representatives
or the Senate, you know,

639
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:53,890
something like that.

640
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:57,980
- So we have two that seem
a little more optimistic.

641
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:00,180
One less optimistic.

642
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,520
Tom, I don't know if you want to,

643
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,790
before we maybe pick up
on another recommendation,

644
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:06,740
Tom, did you want to add anything else?

645
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,937
Cause you raised the
collaborative environment

646
00:29:08,937 --> 00:29:12,870
is something that you
thought would be helpful.

647
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:15,762
- No, I don't reject Paul's
idea of that, you know,

648
00:29:15,762 --> 00:29:17,480
a government startup to do this,

649
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:20,570
but I think there's already
some great tools in the toolbox.

650
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:22,770
I think CYSA already has
a fantastic relationship

651
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:23,603
with the private sector

652
00:29:23,603 --> 00:29:25,600
and is already providing a lot of value.

653
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,120
The problem is that often
comes in the form of an email,

654
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,250
a lot of technical data

655
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:32,740
that either companies can
consume quickly or at all.

656
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:34,690
And I'd like to see it, you know,

657
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,060
maybe it's a little bit
of authority for them

658
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:38,530
to build a pipe between
them and say, for example,

659
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:41,124
the cyber threat Alliance
and agreed on data standard

660
00:29:41,124 --> 00:29:44,120
and agree on some way to
launch the data once it gets,

661
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,290
because the cyber threat
Alliance is already, you know,

662
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:49,720
99% private sector permission
being shared between

663
00:29:50,843 --> 00:29:52,800
the operation cyber threat providers.

664
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,933
And so if you add another 5% of, you know,

665
00:29:54,933 --> 00:29:56,800
sort of high fidelity,

666
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,490
threat information that in
the data standard they consume

667
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:02,380
and push out to their tools,
to all their customers.

668
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,960
I think we can probably
get there pretty quick

669
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,510
without a whole lot of legislation.

670
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:08,810
Maybe you've used a little
bit of executive action.

671
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:11,230
- And Paul (indistinct) alliances,

672
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:13,990
the global cyber alliance
and the cyber local alliance,

673
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:16,380
both great institutions, but it's a...

674
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:20,390
- And I'm going to throw one
more institution in there,

675
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:23,570
because there's also the
analysis of resilience center

676
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:26,899
for systemic risk, which used
to be the financial services,

677
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:31,350
the FSR now includes the biggest companies

678
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:32,290
and the biggest sectors.

679
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:35,003
Here's the reality from my perspective.

680
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:38,570
I'm not speaking on behalf
as a commissioner right now,

681
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:42,610
but information sharing and
intelligence programs work

682
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:44,610
if there's giving and taking.

683
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:46,990
In other words, if you're
only in receive mode

684
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:50,050
and you're not providing,
that's doomed for failure.

685
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:53,570
The biggest impediment
in my eyes is trust.

686
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:58,050
It takes years to build
and nanoseconds to lose.

687
00:30:58,050 --> 00:31:01,970
So I think the way that I am proposing,

688
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:03,790
and again, I'm not speaking
on behalf of the commission,

689
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:06,889
here is to sort of take that arc mindset

690
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:08,953
to the JC environment
where you have companies

691
00:31:08,953 --> 00:31:11,260
that could actually absorb the information

692
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:12,300
and know what to do with it.

693
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:15,500
And oh, by the way, they have
very important information

694
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:17,790
to provide as well

695
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:20,760
and I'm glad you both brought
up the cyber threat Alliance.

696
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:24,200
I think that's a great model
that ought to be part of it,

697
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,560
but I just needed to
throw the arc in there,

698
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:30,840
because not everyone could
absorb some of the capacity

699
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,850
and the wherewithal that
could be brought to bear.

700
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:35,800
Quite honestly, it's more of
a burden than it is a benefit.

701
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:40,190
- So let me go back to you, Frank.

702
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:43,500
If you had your wishes,

703
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:46,440
is there anything that
didn't get picked up

704
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:49,380
by the commission and the follow on work

705
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:50,890
that you think is still missing?

706
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:54,250
That, you know, maybe at the time

707
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:56,700
there was a lack of a
consensus on the commission

708
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,630
or it just wasn't top of mind

709
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:02,350
or because of more recent
issues like SolarWinds,

710
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:04,379
you have thought a little more about it?

711
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:07,383
And that can be for Paul and Tom as well.

712
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:09,940
Of all the recommendations,

713
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:12,180
is there still something that

714
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,730
maybe we haven't thought about?

715
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,570
- Well, firstly, I'm clearly biased

716
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:18,820
in terms of what's missing.

717
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:22,330
So I'm probably not the
best person to ask on that,

718
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:24,879
but one thing that gets lost,

719
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,560
I think in a lot of our
discussion about the commission

720
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,850
is the strategy itself.

721
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:32,050
I mean, at the end of the day,

722
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:35,399
we need to make sure that
all the various instruments

723
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,220
to state craft can be brought to bear.

724
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:38,640
And quite honestly,

725
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,450
there are a lot of people
who poopoo cyber deterrence.

726
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:43,900
I think that we're talking
about their straw mat.

727
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,160
At the end of the day,
you don't deter cyber,

728
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,340
you deter actors from engaging in cyber.

729
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:51,649
So I think getting to the point

730
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:54,760
where we can impose costs and
consequences and bad behavior,

731
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,220
we can work with our allies

732
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:58,780
and we can actually lean a little forward.

733
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:00,610
We're never gonna simply firewall our way

734
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:01,443
out of the problem.

735
00:33:01,443 --> 00:33:03,660
So at the end of the day,
there's a governance issue.

736
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:06,070
I think the standup of the
national cyber director

737
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:06,903
will help with that.

738
00:33:06,903 --> 00:33:09,520
And I couldn't think
of a better individual

739
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,270
than Chris Inglis,

740
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:12,960
will hopefully be confirmed quickly

741
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,080
by the senate to act on that.

742
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:19,360
One thing which didn't get
a whole lot of attention

743
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:23,360
that I think is also equally
important, is victims.

744
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,949
So we're calling for

745
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:28,750
National Cyber Crime Victim
Assistance and Recovery Center,

746
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:30,450
I mean, at the end of the day,

747
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:32,580
I spend my time thinking about advanced,

748
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,760
persistent threats, Russia, China,

749
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,980
but most of the incidents
people are dealing with

750
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:39,470
are going to be (indistinct)
where incidents at the state,

751
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:41,700
local tribal and territorial level.

752
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:44,550
So we need to have
recourse and opportunities

753
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:46,659
and tools that can be
brought to the victims,

754
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:50,100
that are getting fleeced day in, day out,

755
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,389
especially the elderly

756
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:53,930
and those that are not technically savy.

757
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:56,060
So I think that's a big area.

758
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:59,290
And then just because I'm
under law enforcement,

759
00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:03,113
we ask for doubling the cyber liaison,

760
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,470
the ALATs and the FBI,

761
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:08,659
we need more than they're
worth their weight in gold,

762
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:12,290
because at the end of the day
if you look at SolarWinds,

763
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:14,330
US servers were exploited here.

764
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:19,290
So if you reverse engineer and
do an autopsy on these cases,

765
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:21,130
we have real hard questions.

766
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:23,290
We have the country needs
to come to grips with

767
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:24,550
if we start talking about

768
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:28,163
what could truly stop a
SolarWinds going forward.

769
00:34:29,262 --> 00:34:30,969
- And that's great, your last point,

770
00:34:30,969 --> 00:34:33,620
actually we could spend
a whole day talking

771
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:35,080
and dissecting the SolarWinds,

772
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:38,159
but that should be for another
panel or another whole day,

773
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,509
but Paul and Tom as we're reaching close,

774
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:43,340
we have a few minutes left,

775
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,909
just or actually a second left.

776
00:34:44,909 --> 00:34:46,632
Last words, last comments.

777
00:34:47,746 --> 00:34:49,719
- Yeah, I would say that
the report does a good job

778
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:50,929
talking about bringing together

779
00:34:50,929 --> 00:34:53,919
all the sort of elements
of national power.

780
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,440
And as I was reading it,

781
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,300
I was thinking that I'd like to see

782
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,900
almost the level of effort

783
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,530
that we bought the counter-terrorism

784
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:02,480
to tackling the ransomware threat,

785
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,440
you know, these folks hided
in dark corners of the world,

786
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,820
outside of the reach of law enforcement,

787
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:10,290
and it's like to see that same
intelligence, special forces,

788
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:12,430
maybe even covert actions about the bear

789
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:13,350
to root these folks out,

790
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:14,880
because the level of damage

791
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,643
they bring to our economy
is tremendous, you know,

792
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:20,620
we could potentially face from terrorism.

793
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:21,609
I think it's worth

794
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:24,380
dealing with that same
level of seriousness.

795
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:26,540
- Paul final words, thoughts.

796
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:28,920
- Oh, I think the
commissioner did a great job.

797
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,170
There was very little that
it didn't leave on the table.

798
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:33,790
I would say the only area

799
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:36,230
that I would like to see
the commission move into

800
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:37,900
or another commission move into,

801
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:42,670
is the related cybersecurity
adjacent question

802
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:47,670
of social disinformation and
the perniciousness of that.

803
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:52,560
It isn't strictly speaking
a cybersecurity problem.

804
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,650
And therefore, strictly speaking,

805
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:56,850
probably not appropriate
for the commission

806
00:35:56,850 --> 00:35:59,870
to have looked at or for
this panel to discuss.

807
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:01,799
But they are near adjacent,

808
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:06,580
especially given the
possibilities of obfuscation

809
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:10,700
and anonymity and malicious
conduct within that space,

810
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:14,140
that are directly related
to cybersecurity issues.

811
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:16,299
And so there is enough of a cognate.

812
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:20,440
So maybe the next NDAA
we'll charge the commission

813
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,320
with going off in that direction.

814
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,340
- Yeah. Well said.

815
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:25,100
Certainly something that's important

816
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:28,700
and is related to cyber as
well as other areas, Paul.

817
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,089
Well, thank you all three of you.

818
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:32,390
Thank you so much for joining the panel

819
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:34,109
and for your thoughtful discussion.

820
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:36,670
I'm sure we're gonna get a
lot of interesting questions.

821
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:38,960
Hopefully we'll all have
time to respond to them.

822
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,940
So great to see you again all of you.

823
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:45,580
And stay safe and stay well.

824
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:47,308
- Thanks Catherine.
- Thank you.

825
00:36:47,309 --> 00:36:49,600
- Next (indistinct) Francisco.
- Thank you Catherine

826
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,720
- That's right, take care.
