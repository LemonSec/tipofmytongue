1
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,310
- Hey everybody.

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:08,070
I'm Alyssa Miller, a hacker,
a security researcher,

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:09,880
cybersecurity professional.

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:12,440
I'm the Business
Information Security Officer

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,690
for S&P Global Ratings.

6
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:17,220
And it is absolutely my
pleasure to be here with you

7
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,240
at RSA today, we're talking about talent

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,759
and workforce management in
the cybersecurity industry

9
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,640
and those things that we need to do

10
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,690
from an industry perspective in order

11
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:33,880
to make our workforce more sustainable

12
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:37,720
Over the course of the pandemic,

13
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,960
if you live in the UK
or you paid attention

14
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,960
to some of the headlines
that came out of that area,

15
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:48,160
you know what the British Government went

16
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,639
through this program,

17
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:54,310
they called a rethink, retool, reboot.

18
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:56,320
And I was kinda broken
hardy when I saw this

19
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,760
because the whole idea of this was

20
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,040
they were encouraging
people who are working

21
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:05,610
in one industry to pursue
a career in cybersecurity.

22
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:08,227
And they had different examples,
but it was one example,

23
00:01:08,227 --> 00:01:10,820
that is the reason why
it kinda bothered me

24
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,410
was they brought up a barista

25
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:16,160
and they said that this
barista, Justin, you know,

26
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,640
his next job could be in cybersecurity,

27
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,520
he just didn't know it yet.

28
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,747
And they did others with
ballerinas and some other things.

29
00:01:23,748 --> 00:01:25,390
And these did not go over well,

30
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:27,970
which is part of why
it concerns me because

31
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:31,100
I have been talking for the
last year using this idea

32
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:35,580
of a barista and how a barista
can make that transition

33
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:40,160
from their role making
coffee into cyber security.

34
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:43,039
So I wanna reset on this
metaphor a little bit

35
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,600
and I wanna share with you a story.

36
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,119
So, I was working in a consultancy

37
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,520
and I was trying to hire
cyber security professionals.

38
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,890
And one of the resumes
that came across my desk,

39
00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:00,700
was for this person who
had worked as a barista

40
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,370
but never worked in a technical field.

41
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:06,400
And it was one when, when it came to me,

42
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,960
the HR person said right away like,

43
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,070
I realized this is
probably not one you want.

44
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:12,790
And I said, well, wait,
let me take a look.

45
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:16,160
And so I read through
it and you know what?

46
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,640
What if I told you that as I considered

47
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,619
the skills that a barista has,

48
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,390
I could see the way that those skills

49
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,702
would translate to a cybersecurity career.

50
00:02:28,103 --> 00:02:29,960
What if I told you I hired that person?

51
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,760
And they were an amazing
security consultant.

52
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,070
Sure, they needed some technical knowledge

53
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:37,560
but I could see they had
the technical aptitude.

54
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,703
Would you believe me if I told you that?

55
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:41,740
Well, as you might've noticed

56
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:44,270
from the title of this session,

57
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,900
that's exactly where we're going.

58
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:50,900
How can we leverage the idea
of a barista in a coffee shop

59
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:55,930
or other non-traditional roles
that people may come from,

60
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,230
when they join cybersecurity?

61
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:01,000
I'm willing to bet that most of you,

62
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,810
maybe at least half have some
pretty interesting stories

63
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,610
about how you got into cybersecurity
that have nothing to do

64
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:11,223
with technology whatsoever.

65
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,270
I'm the co-host of a podcast
called "The Uncommon Journey".

66
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:18,510
And you know what, that's what
we focus on with every guest,

67
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:20,799
we bring in guests who have
all sorts of unique stories

68
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,550
because we wanna highlight
all the unique stories

69
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:27,803
of how people ended up in
this particular industry.

70
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:31,280
So we're gonna use this barista metaphor,

71
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,910
we're gonna keep coming back to Justin.

72
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,640
And we're gonna talk about,

73
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,489
how skills that Justin might
have, from being a barista,

74
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:41,300
would make him a great
fit and cyber security.

75
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,430
Just wait, you're gonna see.

76
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:46,260
Now, let's talk about the other headlines,

77
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,790
the headlines that are all over the news

78
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,340
when you look at cybersecurity,

79
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:52,820
you've seen these right?

80
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:56,283
Four million unfilled
jobs at the end of 2019,

81
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:01,250
cybersecurity suffers
from this talent shortage,

82
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:05,840
Oh, the great cyber security
talent shortage continues,

83
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,320
all of these alarmist
headlines talking about how

84
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,269
we just don't have enough
people in cybersecurity.

85
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:13,930
We don't have enough people
to hire for all the jobs

86
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:14,763
we have.

87
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,480
You've heard things like
talent gap, skills shortage,

88
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:23,043
all of these different terms
to describe the story that,

89
00:04:23,043 --> 00:04:26,403
there's no enough people
to fill all these jobs.

90
00:04:27,977 --> 00:04:29,556
What I'm gonna tell you that,

91
00:04:29,557 --> 00:04:32,193
the problem might be just
a little bit different,

92
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,640
we don't have a talent shortage,

93
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,663
we have a talent gap.

94
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,500
We in cybersecurity do a terrible job,

95
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:46,240
of maintaining a workforce
that is sustainable

96
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,773
and manageable and can
take us into the future.

97
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,250
It's not because of a lack of interest.

98
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,083
Think about it.

99
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:56,330
How many of those aspiring professionals,

100
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:59,320
people who wanna get
a job in cybersecurity

101
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,563
do you hear from on a daily basis?

102
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:04,440
But they can't find jobs.

103
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,253
We have 4 million open jobs,

104
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:10,553
countless people looking for
jobs that can't find them.

105
00:05:11,387 --> 00:05:14,053
It doesn't sound to me
like a talent shortage.

106
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:18,853
That sounds to me like
we're doing something wrong.

107
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,453
So last year I dove in,

108
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,570
I had been hearing these stories,
these different narratives

109
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:30,480
about this talent shortage
and just, you know, how

110
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,623
nobody could find the talent
they needed for these roles.

111
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,820
And I was hearing those other stories

112
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,490
from the aspiring security professionals,

113
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:41,390
people coming out of college,

114
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:44,560
who couldn't find jobs last year, at RSA

115
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,210
I went to a dinner that was hosted

116
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:50,739
for a number of cybersecurity graduates.

117
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:53,630
And they expressed to me the
trouble they were having,

118
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,803
finding jobs in cybersecurity.

119
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,913
So I started to do research,

120
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:02,860
I surveyed thousands

121
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:07,860
of aspiring and experienced
cybersecurity professionals.

122
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:11,520
I interviewed hundreds of recruiters

123
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,313
and hiring managers to find
out what they were seeing.

124
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:20,160
I even did research
into online job postings

125
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:22,469
to understand what was going on there.

126
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:25,030
And I'm gonna share all
of this research with you

127
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:29,239
because what I found supports
that same conclusion that,

128
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:33,320
it's not really a problem
of having enough talent,

129
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,650
it's how we search for that talent

130
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:39,510
and how we go about
maintaining this workforce.

131
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:42,719
That is really what's causing
our troubles when it comes

132
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,743
to hiring for cybersecurity jobs.

133
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,340
Now there's a lot of stories to tell

134
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:52,460
and I would love to share
with you the countless

135
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,330
reams of data that I've got

136
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,680
but we're gonna highlight
a few things here

137
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,260
and we're gonna work from that.

138
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:00,400
And I'm gonna share with you some tactics

139
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,929
that your organizations
can employ tomorrow

140
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:07,373
in order to start making strides
in improving this situation

141
00:07:07,373 --> 00:07:10,173
and building a more
sustainable workforce model.

142
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:16,060
So, one of the first questions I asked,

143
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,130
I'm gonna be honest, when
I started this research

144
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:22,490
I too thought maybe it was
a matter of the job seekers

145
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:24,180
that were doing it wrong.

146
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:27,532
I thought they, if I could
just look into this information

147
00:07:27,532 --> 00:07:30,000
I could figure out what it
is that they're doing wrong

148
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,473
and I could give them tools to correct.

149
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,850
Now the reality is I
did find some strategies

150
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:36,683
that I've shared

151
00:07:36,683 --> 00:07:39,700
in other sessions with
aspiring professionals

152
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:43,473
on how they can be better adept
at finding that first job.

153
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:48,860
But the reality is, there
are issues in our industry

154
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:51,150
in how we handle this.

155
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:52,780
So, because I was focused on job seekers,

156
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:57,200
well, first things I did was
I asked those job seekers,

157
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,663
what their job search was like.

158
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:05,409
I asked them, how long have
you been looking for a job?

159
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:09,170
Let's just understand how
long do these people sit

160
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:11,710
and look for jobs when

161
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:15,450
they already have maybe
graduated high school,

162
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:16,560
graduated college,

163
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,823
they've got degrees, some
of them have certifications.

164
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:22,420
Let's look at these
aspiring professionals.

165
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,290
How long does it take?

166
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:27,403
And by the way, this data set
comes from all over the world.

167
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,190
I had people in many different countries,

168
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,969
it was very dispersed.

169
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,940
Some of them, as I said,
had college degrees,

170
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:34,990
some high school diploma,

171
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:38,330
some had cyber security certifications.

172
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:40,900
We're gonna talk more about
that in a few minutes,

173
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,712
but what you can see here,

174
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:47,040
is that in an industry that
has 4 million open jobs

175
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,390
these aspiring professionals,

176
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:51,242
who've gone to school
in some cases for this,

177
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:55,660
will spend three months or
longer looking for a job.

178
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,403
Look at that, way more than half,

179
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,720
more than a quarter of them
takes seven months or longer.

180
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,330
And you know what I said, that, you know,

181
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:05,540
some have degrees, some don't,

182
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:09,839
there is no correlation between
degrees and other things,

183
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,463
and how long these jobs searches took.

184
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,600
I even asked them, you
know, do you have a mentor?

185
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,280
Do you have degrees?

186
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,500
What did you do prior?

187
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,243
There was no correlation.

188
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,531
What I saw was this, these times

189
00:09:23,531 --> 00:09:27,239
these jobs search lengths
were evenly distributed

190
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,333
across all those other demographics.

191
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:34,080
So that's concerning, but,
you might look at this

192
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,060
and you say, well, all right, Alyssa

193
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,849
these are people who've never
worked in the industry before,

194
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:40,790
I mean it's hard to find
some entry level jobs

195
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:41,622
and that's fair.

196
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:45,680
But I didn't just ask the,
the aspiring professionals

197
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,449
how long it took them to find a job,

198
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:50,150
I asked the experienced professionals

199
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:53,160
how long did it take them to
find a job, and you know what?

200
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,923
It didn't change a whole lot.

201
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:59,153
Now you do see one thing that changed,

202
00:09:59,153 --> 00:10:03,230
is okay 46% of them do find a
job in less than two months.

203
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:04,180
That's good.

204
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:06,959
Okay, little less than half

205
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:11,960
but that means the other
more than half, almost 54%.

206
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:13,780
It takes them three months or longer.

207
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:18,242
What's more concerning is that 23%,

208
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:22,710
very close to a quarter
of them who will search

209
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:25,530
for seven months or longer
to find their next job.

210
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:28,540
So these are people with
demonstrated experience

211
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:31,433
in cybersecurity, who
also can't find jobs.

212
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,500
So suddenly this narrative,

213
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,210
about there not being enough talent,

214
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:40,570
this narrative about
well they're entry level,

215
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:44,200
so of course, it's hard to
find, that starts to fall apart

216
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,800
because we see the problem
as much bigger than that.

217
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:50,970
And this is where things
really started to unravel.

218
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:52,260
And I started to,

219
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:55,030
really dig in and try to figure out, okay,

220
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:57,209
there's more to this
story than meets the eye.

221
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:58,280
I need to find more.

222
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,233
So what up, I asked other
questions on the survey.

223
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:05,410
This one was really
particularly interesting,

224
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:06,860
because this comes up a lot,

225
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:09,550
if you follow me on Twitter, by the way,

226
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:12,579
you'll see me tweeting
this stuff all the time.

227
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:15,773
The idea of bad job descriptions.

228
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,270
When I asked,

229
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:21,660
both aspiring and experienced
cybersecurity professionals

230
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:25,500
what the biggest challenge
was that they ran into,

231
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,030
you can see overwhelmingly,

232
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,850
they said it was bad job descriptions.

233
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:33,100
More so than salary, more so
than company culture, more so

234
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:36,420
than finding the right level
of role or finding remote work

235
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,810
simply what the job
description stand in the way.

236
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:43,430
So again, this is an indication

237
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:46,810
that we as hiring organizations
and hiring managers

238
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:50,239
and recruiters are not
doing this the right way.

239
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,040
That there's something wrong

240
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,219
in how we are searching for talent.

241
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:57,420
If we can't find these
individuals who wants so

242
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:00,680
desperately to be a part of our industry

243
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,923
or who are already here and
just wanna find a new gig.

244
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:09,240
So these are some very telling tales,

245
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,960
and I started to dig in more.

246
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:14,763
I really wanted to start to
develop some ideas of what it is

247
00:12:14,763 --> 00:12:16,433
that we're doing wrong.

248
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,180
So I told you, I investigated hundreds

249
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,943
of job descriptions online.

250
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:28,093
I talked to hiring managers
and recruiters, as well.

251
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,283
And what I found,

252
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:35,770
was that our job description suck

253
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:41,273
and our hiring expectations
are completely out of whack.

254
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:46,570
They make it impossible for us to maintain

255
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:50,930
a sustainable workforce, and
that's what we need to fix.

256
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:54,390
So let's talk about what
we can do as cybersecurity

257
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:56,939
professionals in this
industry to make this better.

258
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,100
Let's start with job descriptions.

259
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,400
Let's talk about these for a minute.

260
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,540
Let me share a few examples with you.

261
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:04,680
So let's start with this job description

262
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:08,823
for a cyber security intern or
Information Security Intern.

263
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,560
As an intern,

264
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,540
think about your definition of an intern.

265
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:17,069
It's usually someone coming out of school

266
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,810
or someone may be still in school,

267
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:20,540
who's gonna work for a reduced rate,

268
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,860
they're gonna come in and kinda learn

269
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:24,250
some of the skills of the trade.

270
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:27,820
They do, maybe some lower level
tasks for your organization

271
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:30,780
things that you otherwise
wouldn't be able to get to.

272
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,680
Right, that's what we do with interns?

273
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:38,940
But look at this job
description, for an intern,

274
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:43,940
a bachelor's degree, a
CISSPA, CISA, CISM or CEH.

275
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:47,810
So we want them to have such too

276
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:49,310
before they get an internship.

277
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:52,130
And that's, what's pretty funny,

278
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:53,990
a memo seven years working

279
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:57,263
in Information Technology
Security, excuse me, what?

280
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:03,023
Seven years of experience
insecurity for an intern!

281
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:06,483
I don't know about you

282
00:14:06,483 --> 00:14:08,760
but when I hire somebody with
seven years of experience

283
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,860
they're probably going into a senior role.

284
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:14,163
So this is problematic.

285
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:18,252
So the only one I found,
check this one out.

286
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:23,203
This one goes on for an
Information Security Architect,

287
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:25,382
for three pages,

288
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:29,790
we're gonna just this intricate detail

289
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:31,910
of all the responsibilities

290
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,910
for an Information Security Architect.

291
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,250
Now understand,

292
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,050
an architect is a very senior role,

293
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:40,103
we expect them to have a wide
breadth of skills, no doubt.

294
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,949
But look at the laundry list here,

295
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,640
look at the list of requirements,

296
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:48,100
all these various technologies and things

297
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:51,060
that this organization who I have,

298
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:54,313
for their right have obfuscated here.

299
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:58,160
Just look at what they're asking for,

300
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,610
what magical unicorn out there
is gonna fit a job like this?

301
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:03,970
There just isn't one.

302
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:08,910
This isn't realistic, but
this is what job descriptions

303
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,089
in cybersecurity look like.

304
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:14,470
Now, you, I can hear you
thinking at home at your desk,

305
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:16,230
and you're like, well, Alyssa,

306
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:18,260
I mean these are a couple examples

307
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,920
and I know you tweet some more.

308
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,880
No, the fact of the matter is,

309
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:26,870
this is the predominant
pattern that we see.

310
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:30,910
The majority of cybersecurity
job descriptions have issues,

311
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,242
just like these.

312
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:36,710
You see them asking for
CISSP from, you know,

313
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:39,060
for entry-level roles,
while you have to have,

314
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:41,423
five years of experience to get us CISSP.

315
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:47,290
We see them, some of the
worst ones I've seen,

316
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:49,520
where they ask for, you know,

317
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:52,140
10 years of Kubernetes experience.

318
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:54,770
Anybody know how long
Kubernetes has been around?

319
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:55,843
Not 10 years.

320
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:59,430
So things like this that are
just absolutely impossible,

321
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:00,262
and what does it do?

322
00:16:00,263 --> 00:16:03,910
It turns away those job applicants,

323
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:07,780
who might be a perfect fit
for what you actually need,

324
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:10,230
if you could just write
a decent job description.

325
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:16,620
So I've mentioned a couple
of times now, certifications.

326
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:20,410
Let's talk about what I
found when I started looking

327
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:25,410
at job descriptions in
relation to certifications.

328
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:29,230
How many of you list an
industry certification

329
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,463
when you post a job?

330
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:36,540
Well, the fact of the matter
is I know for it's most of you

331
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,203
and that's not necessarily a bad thing,

332
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,980
but it really depends
on what certifications

333
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,120
you're looking for,

334
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,150
and what your expectations
are, and whether or not

335
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:53,329
you're providing other ways
to fill that requirement.

336
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:55,660
Or is that the only one?

337
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,829
So in looking at job descriptions,

338
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:02,550
what I found first and
foremost was that 71%

339
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:06,050
of entry level jobs

340
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:10,319
Was the CISSP as a requirement.

341
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,139
In most cases, they specifically
said the reason I take them

342
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,200
as entry level, if they
didn't specifically

343
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,210
call it out themselves,
was that they were asking

344
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:19,069
for less than three years of experience.

345
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:20,579
Well, that right there
is pretty problematic

346
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:24,169
when you're asking for a
five-year certification,

347
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:25,780
that doesn't work.

348
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:29,300
91%, now this is really interesting.

349
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:33,706
91% of job descriptions list
of requirement for a degree

350
00:17:33,707 --> 00:17:35,823
and a CISSP or an equivalent,

351
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:39,883
interesting.

352
00:17:42,595 --> 00:17:44,596
What about all those people
who don't have degrees?

353
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:46,161
We hear from them all the time,

354
00:17:46,161 --> 00:17:49,513
I have many colleagues in
this industry who never

355
00:17:49,513 --> 00:17:53,299
graduated college and do a terrific job.

356
00:17:53,299 --> 00:17:56,142
They're amazingly skilled and talented.

357
00:17:56,142 --> 00:17:58,280
What are those people who don't have a CS

358
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:02,090
or a computers, a cybersecurity degree?

359
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:03,780
They didn't go for engineering,

360
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:06,230
they went for communications
or other things,

361
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:07,430
don't they have skills to bear?

362
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:10,200
But we say that we want
a degree in cybersecurity

363
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,163
or in computer science or a related field.

364
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,990
That's kind of problematic too, isn't it?

365
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:23,419
So thinking about the CISSP and
the way it comes up so often

366
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:25,810
and I don't mean to pick
on ISC squared, right?

367
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:28,193
I like the CISSP don't get me wrong.

368
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:33,170
It's how hiring managers and
hiring organizations treat it,

369
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:34,730
that becomes problematic.

370
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:35,563
Here's the story,

371
00:18:35,563 --> 00:18:38,450
so you see 91% of job descriptions, right?

372
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:41,853
So CISSP record 71% of entry
level say they want it.

373
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:47,730
Well, ISC squared tells
us as of October of 2020,

374
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:51,860
there are 2.8 million
cybersecurity professionals

375
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:52,933
in the world.

376
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:54,980
Okay, so those are actively

377
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,470
working cybersecurity professionals.

378
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:58,470
This is from their 2020 workforce study.

379
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,793
But as of that same time, October 2020,

380
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,990
only 142,000

381
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:10,860
of those professionals
have a CISSP certification.

382
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:15,649
That's about 5%, do
the math, 71% versus 5%

383
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:19,863
91% versus 5% something doesn't work here.

384
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:23,400
Certifications are not the answer.

385
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,203
And in fact, when I look at
the information from my survey,

386
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:33,470
only 49% thinking back to these degrees,

387
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:36,083
holds an IT or a
cybersecurity related degree.

388
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:40,483
So I've got 91% of my job
description say, you must have,

389
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:44,440
but only 49% of the
people coming in actually

390
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:48,123
have a degree that is
in one of those fields.

391
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:52,730
So I think you're starting
to see the problems here,

392
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:55,160
you're starting to see what it is,

393
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:58,666
that is causing this
disconnect, this talent gap.

394
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:01,550
It's not a shortage, it's the gap.

395
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:04,639
Because we just can't bridge a connection

396
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,192
between our hiring and those professionals

397
00:20:08,192 --> 00:20:11,340
and talented individuals
that are out there just

398
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,533
waiting to be a part of our organizations.

399
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,960
So the whole point of this is,

400
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,823
this isn't a sustainable model.

401
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:25,270
We need to look at how do
we make it sustainable.

402
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:26,840
Because we're doing this to ourselves,

403
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,580
if we can't find
cybersecurity professionals,

404
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:30,293
it's all self-inflicted wounds.

405
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,409
So how do we get better at this?

406
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:33,626
How do we highly progress?

407
00:20:33,626 --> 00:20:35,423
How do we make sure,

408
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:39,800
that we're able to adjust?

409
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:43,610
Not only are our job descriptions
in our hiring practices

410
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:46,469
but literally our
expectations and how we handle

411
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:49,373
our employees to make a
more sustainable model.

412
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,520
Here's where the problems begin,

413
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,760
when we look at the core issue,

414
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:02,340
when we build job descriptions,
when we build a job role

415
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,780
and we're gonna, we're
gonna talk about everything

416
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,290
that's involved in that job.

417
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:11,290
We are so hyper focused on all
the various technology tools

418
00:21:11,808 --> 00:21:15,723
and techniques that these people
must come in the door with.

419
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:20,510
And we think that's how we
measure a successful candidate.

420
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:27,030
Now, wait a minute,
I've heard some of you,

421
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:29,623
I've heard you say it,
and I've said it myself.

422
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,370
Why could teach anybody the skills?

423
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:36,250
I want them to have something else, right?

424
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,280
And we'll talk about what
some of those things are,

425
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:41,050
that what people say they want.

426
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:41,883
So if that's the case,

427
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:44,040
why are we so hyper-focused
on technologies?

428
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,710
Why do we expect people to come in

429
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:47,330
and be able to immediately sit down

430
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:50,960
and expertly configure
our Sims or our wafts

431
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,170
or our cloud security
environments, our CASB Solutions.

432
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:57,203
Why do we think that that's
what we need to hire?

433
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,580
I'll tell you why.

434
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,330
And it came from those
interviews that I did

435
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:02,580
with hiring managers.

436
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,023
For some reason,

437
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:08,910
we have this prevalent
belief in cybersecurity

438
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,320
that we're gonna be perfect.

439
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:16,560
And that the only way to achieve
perfection in our security,

440
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,679
is to bring in people who've
already worked in the industry

441
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:23,620
and already know things and
have them fill our roles.

442
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:24,800
That's what we do.

443
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,770
We do it over and over again.

444
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:27,210
The job descriptions prove it.

445
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:29,625
Hiring managers attitudes, prove it over

446
00:22:29,625 --> 00:22:34,003
and over and over again,
but that's not realistic.

447
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:39,570
The fact of the matter
is looking at candidates,

448
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:42,252
based on what technological
skills they have,

449
00:22:42,252 --> 00:22:44,860
what they've worked with in the past,

450
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:48,280
which tools they've used, which, you know,

451
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,322
Olsen challenges they've done.

452
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:55,459
This is great information, but it is not.

453
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:58,300
What is the primary
measure of whether or not

454
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,700
they're gonna be successful?

455
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,103
Think about it.

456
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,773
What other industry do we do this in?

457
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:11,153
What other industry out
there on this planet,

458
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:13,810
do we sit there and say the only people

459
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:17,179
we're gonna hire, are people
who already have the job skills

460
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:19,563
necessary to sit down
and do the job tomorrow?

461
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:23,709
Where do we do it?

462
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:27,910
Doctors, you know, people are
responsible for human lives.

463
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:29,863
We don't do it there, do we?

464
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:35,320
No, they have a very structured
progression of, on the job

465
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,770
learning through residencies

466
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:41,200
and all the things that
they do, think about that.

467
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,653
Doctors, learn on the job,

468
00:23:44,508 --> 00:23:46,813
but we can't do it with a
cybersecurity professionals.

469
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:53,790
What about skilled trades,
plumbers, electricians,

470
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,170
what do they do?

471
00:23:57,170 --> 00:24:00,450
They just show up and they've
got a master certificate

472
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:02,810
and they can go work anywhere they want?

473
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:07,330
No, they go through apprenticeships,

474
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:09,460
they learn on the job, and by the way,

475
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,050
when they're learning on the job,

476
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:13,923
they get paid to learn on the job.

477
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:19,990
We don't tell plumbers and
electricians and doctors,

478
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:22,250
oh go learn on your own,
go figure it all out,

479
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:25,023
and then come to us with that information.

480
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,879
We don't tell them that,

481
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,830
we give them a very structured career path

482
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:31,689
that they need to follow,

483
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:33,640
but we don't do that in cyber security.

484
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:38,303
We need to move out of this approach,

485
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:41,379
as hiring organizations we need to start

486
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,540
investing in our people again.

487
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:46,110
I know this is a wildly unpopular idea,

488
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:49,500
the thought of spending money
to train our individuals,

489
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,040
because we're also worried.

490
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,980
And I think of the
cartoon I've seen on this

491
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,340
and you probably have too,

492
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,432
well what happens if we train them,

493
00:24:55,432 --> 00:24:57,540
and then they go in and get
another job somewhere else?

494
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:59,870
Because we know
cybersecurity is a hot field.

495
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:03,189
So I don't, I don't wanna pay
for them to go get an OCP.

496
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:06,550
I don't wanna pay for them
to go to this vendor trainee.

497
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:08,370
So I'll split the cost with 'em

498
00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:11,760
or I'll reimburse them after
they successfully pass it,

499
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,840
and they've worked here
for six months afterwards.

500
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:17,120
We do all these crazy things,
we probably use restrictions

501
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,840
because we don't wanna
invest in our people.

502
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,919
We don't wanna bring in people

503
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,940
who we have to invest in from the start.

504
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:24,544
We think we're just
gonna keep hiring people

505
00:25:24,544 --> 00:25:26,410
who already have all the skills.

506
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:29,410
It doesn't work that way,
that's not sustainable.

507
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:32,800
For obvious reasons, if every
organization in the world

508
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,553
only hired people with experience,

509
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,550
what would we do?

510
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:40,710
Suddenly, we wouldn't have
people with experience anymore

511
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:42,670
'cause they had all retired
and we'd have nothing.

512
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:44,360
That's a pretty obvious issue.

513
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,969
And it's something that
we need to correct,

514
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:47,453
but it's not the only issue.

515
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:50,150
Here's another one that
you're probably gonna

516
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:51,990
moan and groan when I say it,

517
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:56,520
the idea of diversity,
and I told you before,

518
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:59,700
that a candidate success isn't based

519
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:04,100
on their technology
skills alone, and in fact,

520
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,850
I would tell you it's not
even the primary contributor.

521
00:26:09,471 --> 00:26:11,040
If you think about it,

522
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,820
whether it's an individual
or at the industry level,

523
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:15,523
think about it at a macro level,

524
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,821
how do we be successful inside?

525
00:26:17,821 --> 00:26:20,879
How are we successful in cybersecurity?

526
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:25,870
It's our problem solving
skills that make us successful

527
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:27,989
in cyber security is it not?

528
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:31,363
That's what we do every day,
we're here to solve problems.

529
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:35,340
Maybe we go looking for some of them,

530
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:36,562
and then we solve them.

531
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,180
How do we find those problems?

532
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,070
How do we solve them?

533
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:41,730
How do we get better at problem solving?

534
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:43,780
The key is diversity.

535
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:46,620
Now I'm gonna give you
some real talk here.

536
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:47,979
There's some dog whistles out there,

537
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,310
when I start talking
diversity, people say,

538
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:51,409
oh yeah, well, I hire
for diversity of thought.

539
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:52,580
And that's a way of saying,

540
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:54,850
I don't wanna look at
demographics of people,

541
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:57,080
I just I'm gonna hire and,

542
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:00,570
or you hear the other one is
I want the best candidate.

543
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:03,550
Well, what is your definition
of the best candidate?

544
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:07,110
Does the diversity of their
background play into that?

545
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:10,370
Because it should, consider this example,

546
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:14,724
what happens if you hire
say 20 white male engineers

547
00:27:14,724 --> 00:27:17,560
and another 10 white female engineers

548
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:22,243
and you're gonna build
new scanners for the TSA?

549
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:24,253
What happens?

550
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,640
Well, if you know the story,

551
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,150
it should sound familiar
because it did happen.

552
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:30,960
We ended up with a bunch of scanners,

553
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,930
that were unfairly indicating
issues with women of color

554
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:37,763
because of their hairstyles.

555
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,670
Why didn't that get identified?

556
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:43,893
Because the people working
on it, weren't diverse.

557
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,750
You didn't have black
women there who would have

558
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:49,160
said right away, hey, you know what?

559
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:52,090
This is something that we
deal with in other spaces,

560
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:53,756
that might be a problem here too.

561
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,260
So when you say diversity of thought,

562
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:59,450
diversity of thought comes
from diversity of backgrounds,

563
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:00,720
experiences and other things.

564
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,280
And that diversity comes from

565
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,903
their demographics as
much as anything else.

566
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:09,378
So the reality is no,
I'm not saying go out

567
00:28:09,378 --> 00:28:13,300
and say this job is only
open for one particular race

568
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,770
or whatever demographic you wanna choose.

569
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:17,129
That's not what I'm telling you.

570
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:19,160
What I am telling you is understanding

571
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,450
and being deliberate about
hiring for diversity,

572
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:23,540
needs to be a part of
your success criteria

573
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:24,373
for that candidate.

574
00:28:24,373 --> 00:28:26,450
If you're gonna say, I'm
gonna hire the best candidate

575
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:28,330
or you're hiring for diversity of thought

576
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:31,283
you need to recognize that
diversity is a part of that.

577
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:35,760
And you have to challenge your own biases.

578
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,290
You have to challenge
your organization's biases

579
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:40,090
looking for people who
came up in the ranks

580
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:42,110
just the same way you did.

581
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:44,560
You're not getting diversity
of thought that way.

582
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:50,070
And then, let's talk about this idea

583
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:52,740
of core transferable skills.

584
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:53,950
And we're gonna bring Justin

585
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:56,600
and some other examples back in here now.

586
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,610
When I talk about core
transferable skills,

587
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:04,610
I am talking about those skills
that transcend any industry.

588
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,310
Things that would apply,

589
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:09,200
no matter if you were
working in hospitality,

590
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,960
in cybersecurity or in the arts,

591
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,373
what are those skills?

592
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:19,050
They're core transferable skills.

593
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:22,773
Now don't make the mistake
of talking about soft skills,

594
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,970
this idea of soft skills,
first of all, I hate the term

595
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:29,770
in the first place, because
it's used more as a pejorative

596
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:32,400
and it implies that they're soft,

597
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:36,040
so they're not really
the rugged foundation

598
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,610
on which we wanna build
things, and that's not true,

599
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:42,260
core transferable skills
are the best indicator

600
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:45,313
of how someone's gonna be
successful on a particular role.

601
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:47,500
So what do I mean

602
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:50,160
when I talk about core
transferable skills?

603
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,170
I'm talking about those skillsets,

604
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:54,150
that somebody learns in one job,

605
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:57,300
as I said before, and it
transcends any industry.

606
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:01,223
So while I might describe
that job in a certain way,

607
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:04,170
based on that industry,

608
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:08,030
if I bring that back and
identify what's at the core

609
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:10,129
of those skills that I
was using in that job,

610
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:13,060
now, I find what's
transferable to other roles.

611
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:15,223
So let's talk about a couple of examples.

612
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:18,430
We're not talking soft skills.

613
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,090
So let's talk about retail employee,

614
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:22,300
and why do I tell you
about retail employee?

615
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,770
Because I also hired somebody
directly out of retail,

616
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:27,120
who had no experience in cybersecurity

617
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,260
and has also been a wildly successful

618
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:31,800
cyber security consultant ever since.

619
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,562
Why did I hire this person?

620
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:36,993
Well, their resume told me two things.

621
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:42,780
One, they had customer service skills,

622
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:45,120
and I'm sorry to all my colleagues

623
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,610
out there in cyber
security, but we lack that,

624
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:51,330
that empathy, that ability
to understand the people

625
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:53,419
we're talking to and communicate with them

626
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:55,020
in a way that's meaningful to them,

627
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:58,050
so they'll understand and be
motivated to wanna help us.

628
00:30:58,050 --> 00:31:00,909
We don't do a good job of
that in cyber security.

629
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:04,793
This is an ongoing struggle
that we need to get better at.

630
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:08,649
And so when I saw customer service,

631
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:10,180
dealing with customers day in and day out

632
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:12,710
and having to learn that that
was pretty attractive to me.

633
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:14,500
The other thing that
he listed on his resume

634
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:17,280
and it was really impressive
to me, was that he talked

635
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:21,149
about his ability to problem
solve when he was faced

636
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:23,220
with issues that affected the delivery

637
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:25,400
of their products and services.

638
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,410
Specifically, he
highlighted an example where

639
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:32,600
he found a problem in
their inventory system

640
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,933
that was affecting their
returns processing.

641
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:37,940
Now think about this for a minute.

642
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:40,943
So let's dial this back to
core transferable skills again,

643
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:46,660
that ability to be able to
see the interrelationships

644
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:50,970
between two disparate systems
that seemingly aren't related

645
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:54,240
in any way, to see how
the impact each other

646
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,290
and to be able to problem solve for that.

647
00:31:57,180 --> 00:32:00,560
Isn't that exactly what we
wanna see in cybersecurity?

648
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,602
That's a core transferable skill.

649
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,220
That's what we need to be looking for.

650
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:07,500
That's what tells us if our candidates

651
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,200
are gonna be successful.

652
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,660
So now let's go back to our barista,

653
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,820
let's talk about Justin for a minute.

654
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:15,500
What skills does Justin have as a barista

655
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,730
that would make him a great
cybersecurity candidate?

656
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:23,053
I'm gonna tell you right
now, a barista like Justin,

657
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,620
given that they have all
their technical aptitude

658
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:27,592
and desire.

659
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:31,409
They're great as a SOC analyst,

660
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:33,640
they have core transferable
skills that fit right

661
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,650
into a SOC analyst role.

662
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:36,483
What are they?

663
00:32:36,483 --> 00:32:38,760
Think about what they do every day,

664
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:43,350
a barista processes, multiple
inputs from disparate sources.

665
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:46,689
They then have to translate
those inputs into tasks

666
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:48,180
that then they're going to prioritize

667
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:50,530
and organize to make sure
that they can execute them

668
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:53,060
in the most efficient manner possible.

669
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:55,870
And then they have to focus
on efficiently delivering

670
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:57,803
that product to the customer.

671
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,460
All the while they also have to plan

672
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:06,540
and execute maintenance activities.

673
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:09,220
So think about this from the
SOC perspective, isn't that

674
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:12,030
exactly what you want a SOC
analyst to be able to do?

675
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:14,399
To be able to process
those multiple inputs,

676
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,840
use a method to prioritize
and execute them and do them

677
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,580
in the most efficient way possible

678
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:23,220
and delivering to the
customer with quality

679
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:25,810
and still also being able
to plan regular maintenance

680
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:26,810
and other things.

681
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:30,283
That's exactly what we want in
cyber security professionals.

682
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,850
Those are core transferable skills

683
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:34,399
that we need to be focused on.

684
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,003
Not have they worked 10 years with Splunk.

685
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:43,180
So, how do we improve this?

686
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:45,180
Let's go back to our job descriptions

687
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:47,260
and our attitudes to our hiring.

688
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:49,000
We need to be more precise

689
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,323
in how we build our job descriptions.

690
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:55,000
This is how we eliminate bias,

691
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,900
this is how we make them more
open to our professionals.

692
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:02,030
We need to be precise,
and when I say precise,

693
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:04,060
one of the things we
need to understand is,

694
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:07,730
how do we address the
skills, the experience

695
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:10,139
and the knowledge we want
them to come in with?

696
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:13,053
Each of those words has
a very different meaning.

697
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:16,179
And so when we write them
in a job description,

698
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:18,929
we need to be sure that we're
asking for the right one.

699
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:22,600
So we're not talking about
knowledge I'm talking about,

700
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,810
I just simply have knowledge of it.

701
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:25,040
I've read about it.

702
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:25,873
I've studied it.

703
00:34:25,873 --> 00:34:27,230
Maybe I've gone to conference talks

704
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:29,370
or I've researched it myself.

705
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:30,859
That's knowledge.

706
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:33,429
So you might have some things
in your list of preferences,

707
00:34:33,429 --> 00:34:35,029
that, hey, you know what?

708
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:38,573
We want you to have knowledge
in this particular thing.

709
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:42,100
Now, if you say, I want
you to have knowledge

710
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:44,893
in Splunk because you use Splunk.

711
00:34:45,864 --> 00:34:46,899
And I feel like I'm picking on them.

712
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:47,733
I'm really not.

713
00:34:47,733 --> 00:34:48,860
Please don't take it that way.

714
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:51,230
I could just be just as easily talking

715
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:53,179
about Security Audience or anyone else.

716
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:58,800
Is that really what I want them to have?

717
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,020
Maybe it is, maybe it isn't

718
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:03,150
but is that going to be effective

719
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:08,150
or do I want them to have
knowledge of maybe SIM strategies

720
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:14,029
thread Intel, thread hunting, maybe that's

721
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:15,770
the core of what I actually
need them to understand.

722
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:17,130
I can teach them the technology,

723
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:19,280
send them to training for the technology,

724
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,360
but maybe that's where I need it.

725
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,153
Now, when I say skills,
I'm talking about taking

726
00:35:23,153 --> 00:35:25,750
that knowledge and putting
it into action right?

727
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:27,500
Skills are those things where they have

728
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,450
some demonstrated way

729
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:31,283
of

730
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:33,860
applying what they know

731
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:35,963
and using it in a real world environment.

732
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:39,879
And then finally experience,
for experience is obvious,

733
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,260
that's when we all talk about it,

734
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:42,560
hey I've worked on the job

735
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,453
and I've done this somewhere before.

736
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:47,350
So we need to be precise about these,

737
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:49,453
when we write these in job descriptions.

738
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:53,380
But let's talk about those
hiring attitudes now, too.

739
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:56,270
Now I asked the hiring
managers for what they

740
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:59,310
would tell aspiring
cybersecurity professionals

741
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:01,590
trying to get into the industry

742
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:03,400
and the word that came
up more often than not,

743
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,200
and I hear it every day
and it drives me insane,

744
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,439
Is people saying, have passion,
have passion, have passion,

745
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,140
have passion, have passion
all this stuff about passion,

746
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:12,330
be passionate, make sure
you're passionate about it

747
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:13,830
and have an aptitude for it.

748
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:17,299
Genuine passion for the field
trump's dry experience really?

749
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,133
Does it?

750
00:36:18,133 --> 00:36:19,600
Look at your job descriptions?

751
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:23,910
How do you demonstrate
passion when you're passing

752
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:26,390
in a resume and it's going into an ATS,

753
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:29,080
automatic applicant tracking system

754
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:33,279
an applicant tracking system,
can't measure passion,

755
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,033
get this stuff out of your head.

756
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,399
If you wanna see them demonstrate passion,

757
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,353
tell them in your job description how,

758
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:43,330
is there a place where
they can submit to you,

759
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:45,130
videos that they've created,

760
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:47,110
tutorials that they've generated,

761
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:50,420
all their online content,
that they've authored,

762
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:52,990
things that would demonstrate
their mastery of the topic,

763
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:54,939
even though they don't have experience.

764
00:36:56,350 --> 00:36:59,480
This involves getting
outside of just the ATS,

765
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:02,580
and the problem is that
ATS is the limiting factor

766
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:04,560
on too many of our job searches.

767
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,950
I told you about what happened
with that barista resume

768
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:10,160
I got it scored very low on ATS,

769
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,399
I only, I'm not even sure why
the HR person handed it to me

770
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,083
because they were so convinced
I wasn't going to want it,

771
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:20,333
but I'm so glad they did because
I hired an amazing person.

772
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:23,350
And that's what we need to do.

773
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:25,620
We need to invite more that's
what we've gotta get out

774
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:28,880
of this mode of all the
applicant tracking system

775
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,260
being the gate, because it breaks things.

776
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:37,260
How do we encourage applicants
to demonstrate passion?

777
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,560
How can we think about hiring differently?

778
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,163
This is where we need to go.

779
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:48,220
So, to wrap things up, how
do we bridge this divide

780
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:54,290
this talent gap from a hiring
organization perspective

781
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:55,520
the owners is on us,

782
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,833
we gotta do better, we've gotta do more.

783
00:37:58,730 --> 00:38:00,760
First of all, we need to realign our goals

784
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,530
for on-the-job training.

785
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,230
We have to understand
that learning and training

786
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:08,010
on the job is to, what's
gonna make people successful.

787
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:09,560
We need to challenge our biases

788
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:14,180
in deliberately seek out
diversity in our candidate pool.

789
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:17,730
We need to focus on core
transferable skills,

790
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:18,830
those are so crucial

791
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:21,819
in measuring the success of any candidate.

792
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:24,400
And finally, we need to be precise

793
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,450
in how we word our requirements

794
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:29,460
and our preferences
and our qualifications.

795
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:32,070
And then we need to invite our candidates

796
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:35,020
to be able to share those
non-traditional ways

797
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:37,243
that they can demonstrate their expertise.

798
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:40,710
So thank you so much,

799
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:43,420
I really appreciate you
all being a part of this,

800
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:47,350
coming and attending RSA today
and being here for this talk.

801
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:49,900
I hope that you can take to
heart many of the lessons

802
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,660
that I learnt through this research

803
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:54,500
and work with me and the
rest of our colleagues

804
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:58,120
to truly see that hidden link that exists

805
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,680
between a great cup of coffee

806
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:03,680
and a great cybersecurity professional.

807
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,903
Thank you so much.
