1
00:00:01,113 --> 00:00:03,590
- Thank you all for coming
to our session today,

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:06,330
we're honored to be
here speaking with you.

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,590
I'm Lisa LeVasseur, the executive director

4
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:10,960
and founder of the Me2BA Alliance.

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,620
And with me today is Cam Geer,

6
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:14,850
who has really been a foundational member

7
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:17,590
of our organization since its inception.

8
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:20,563
And he is currently serving
on our board of directors.

9
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,770
We're gonna be talking today,

10
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:25,290
about measuring the ethical
behavior of technology

11
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:29,333
and sharing with all of you,
our experience of doing this.

12
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:34,050
And we're gonna go through
these five sections,

13
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:37,059
first of all, who are we
and what are we doing?

14
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:38,850
And then we wanna spend some time

15
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:40,853
explaining our ethical foundation.

16
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,660
It's core to everything that we do.

17
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:47,110
Third, we're gonna talk
about our actual process

18
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:49,750
for measuring technology behavior.

19
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,530
And then we're gonna
share the key learnings

20
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:54,310
that we've derived through the process.

21
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:56,610
And finally, we're gonna be leaving you

22
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:58,080
with a lot of recommendations

23
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,923
around how you can build
respectful, ethical technology.

24
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:06,793
So with that, Cam is
gonna take it from here.

25
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:10,289
- Thanks, Lisa, it's great to be here

26
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:12,690
at the RSA conference today,

27
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:15,330
and I'd love to tell
you a little bit about,

28
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:18,090
who the Me2BA Alliance is.

29
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:19,180
As the name implies.

30
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,310
It's an organization
about the relationship

31
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:24,222
between Me-s and B-s, or as we say,

32
00:01:24,222 --> 00:01:26,449
people and the businesses

33
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:29,407
that produce technology
that we use every day.

34
00:01:31,472 --> 00:01:36,280
Me2BA is a new kind of standards
development organization

35
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,790
bringing together everyday
people with industry

36
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:42,973
to create the standard
for respectful technology.

37
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,660
We're different because our standard

38
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:50,588
has to be objective and measurable.

39
00:01:50,588 --> 00:01:52,750
It's not traditional bits and bytes,

40
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,550
and protocol development.

41
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:58,289
It's creating a way to measure
the behavior of technology,

42
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:01,600
not looking so much at
how the company behaves,

43
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,890
or how the technology is developed,

44
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:07,763
but how the tech actually
treats the people that use it.

45
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,570
And also we use respectful and ethical,

46
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:14,130
interchangeably throughout
this presentation.

47
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:16,760
And we look at our ethical foundation,

48
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,083
you'll understand why.

49
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:25,470
We're like independent crash
testing for automobiles,

50
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,700
but for connected technology.

51
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,619
We're evaluating connected
tech for potential risks

52
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,853
and harms to people.

53
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:40,870
Our central ethos is that respectful tech,

54
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,280
is better for Me-s, and B-s.

55
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:46,460
Research has typically
centered around more corporate

56
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:48,390
or organizational behavior

57
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:52,279
but there is a growing research
to support the hypothesis

58
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,480
that respectful technology,

59
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,950
or an ethical behavior of technology,

60
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:58,993
is likewise better for business.

61
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,739
For instance, in this
2019 research from Cisco,

62
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:09,040
illustrates the value
of a privacy investment.

63
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,900
Additional research is needed
to prove the hypothesis

64
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,830
that respectful technology
is better for business.

65
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:18,020
And we expect to see more of that

66
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:20,073
and drive much of that research.

67
00:03:23,809 --> 00:03:26,660
(clears throat)

68
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:30,320
So shifting gears, I'm gonna
share about how we arrived

69
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,923
at an ethical foundation
to ground our work.

70
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:39,120
There is no universal ethic,
but we needed a foundation.

71
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,220
And so we looked at and a number of things

72
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:46,430
including the United Nations
Declaration of Human Rights,

73
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:50,230
the US Constitution,
Moral Foundations Theory,

74
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:54,390
even the World Economic Forum
Sustainable Development Goals

75
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:56,920
kept coming back to social norms

76
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,042
in the physical world as guidance.

77
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:02,920
Ultimately, we landed
on the characteristics

78
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,732
of healthy human
interpersonal relationships.

79
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,000
Because technology is
becoming more personalized,

80
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,080
and our relationship with
technology is becoming more

81
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,963
like interpersonal relationships.

82
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,959
The relationship framing
is really critical

83
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,190
especially when you consider
how many relationships we have

84
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:25,743
with connected technology.

85
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,270
As you know, in your
own business experience

86
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:33,280
the number of these
relationships is even higher.

87
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,640
A research from last pass
in 2017 showed an average

88
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:41,550
of nearly 200 online
accounts for businessperson.

89
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:43,143
And this was all before COVID,

90
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:47,480
where suddenly we become
reliant on services

91
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,703
that allow us to work and learn from home.

92
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:58,240
So, considering how we
think about relationships,

93
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,450
technology should treat
us like a good friend,

94
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:03,553
or at least a polite stranger.

95
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,973
In short technology should be respectful.

96
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,500
So what we did was look at the attributes

97
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,920
of healthy human
relationships from psychology.

98
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,700
And we synthesize the
list of those attributes

99
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:26,700
into this list which we call
our Me2B rules of engagement.

100
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:29,230
Specifically, we crafted these to apply

101
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:34,010
to products and services,
worried about privacy and data.

102
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:36,490
As you can see, we don't
use those words here

103
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:39,070
and we feel the focus is too narrow.

104
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:42,673
Instead we focus on respect
and respectful behavior.

105
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:48,080
So now I'll turn it over to Lisa

106
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,063
who will share how to
measure technology behavior.

107
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
- Thanks Cam, so how do we go
from these broad principles,

108
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,763
to actual measurement?

109
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:01,359
That's the challenge.

110
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,440
And when we began our work
at the beginning of 2019,

111
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,090
we envisioned a kind of serial process

112
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:10,469
somewhat serial process,
starting with creating a framing

113
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:14,130
and vocabulary drafting a specification,

114
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:17,670
validating the specification
with everyday people,

115
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:18,550
and then finally

116
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:21,030
applying the specification
through measurement.

117
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:23,510
It all seemed very clean and tidy

118
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:26,909
but the reality has
been a little different.

119
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:28,420
In practice what we've done,

120
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:32,910
is we created the Me2B
relationship framework

121
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:34,650
and then we drafted this back.

122
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:37,320
In fact, we drafted the
spec a couple of times,

123
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,830
we ran several courses of validation

124
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,433
through ethnographic research,

125
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:47,500
and then we refine this back
and then we started measurement

126
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:50,750
and then we found out our
language wasn't precise enough,

127
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,330
and then we had to update the spec

128
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:54,450
from that and redefine the spec.

129
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:58,830
So it's been a little
bit of a a more iterative

130
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:01,539
and frenetic process, frankly.

131
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,810
And so what I wanna do is
go through each of these

132
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:05,050
in a little bit more detail

133
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:09,670
and explain a little bit
what goes on in here.

134
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:13,690
So this is initial step of
framing of a vocabulary.

135
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:16,420
We really didn't have
the language to precisely

136
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:19,750
describe the norms and
behaviors in the digital world,

137
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,210
and this was a real problem for us.

138
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:24,409
We had to come up with
language to articulate

139
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,660
with nuance and specificity.

140
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:29,220
So we created a framework

141
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,890
and it's really oriented
around this Me2B relationship

142
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:34,590
in particular that
digital Me2B relationship

143
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:36,919
which I'd like to share with you today.

144
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:41,920
So Me2B relationship seems
like a pretty intuitive thing,

145
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,870
but it's actually quite
layered and nuanced.

146
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:49,870
And so this is Alice and she
has just unboxed her iPhone.

147
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:52,360
And so the first thing that happens

148
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,660
and we've all experienced this,

149
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:56,770
is that she is confronted
with an agreement,

150
00:07:56,770 --> 00:08:00,549
a legal agreement, terms
of service or terms of use.

151
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:02,990
And we call this a Me2B legal relationship

152
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:06,600
with Apple, the
manufacturer, in this case.

153
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:10,870
She continues to use the phone
and she develops over time,

154
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:13,330
what we call a Me2P, me to product,

155
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:16,599
experiential relationship
with the phone itself.

156
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:20,880
And this, she has a
disposition and an attitude,

157
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,440
you know, love or hate.

158
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,020
This is really a two way dialogue.

159
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:30,849
It's like eight interpersonal
relationship with this device.

160
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:34,220
At the same time, there are
a number of what we call,

161
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,870
Me2B hidden affiliates that are integrated

162
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:38,960
into the phone and possibly,

163
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:42,053
into integrated at the
backend, the back office.

164
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,790
These are third party integrations
and software suppliers.

165
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:48,620
Alice doesn't know she has
a relationship with them

166
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:49,453
but she does.

167
00:08:49,453 --> 00:08:52,030
And we'll explore that a little bit more.

168
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,589
So this is all pretty straightforward,

169
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:56,040
it's not too confusing,
but it doesn't stop here.

170
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:58,680
Alice continues to use the phone,

171
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,109
she goes to the app store and
downloads the Chrome browser.

172
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:03,690
And of course the first
thing that happens,

173
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:07,390
is she has to set up a Me2B
legal relationship with Google.

174
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:09,600
And then she starts to
use the Chrome browser.

175
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,330
And she develops a Me2P,

176
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:14,780
me to product experiential relationship.

177
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:17,990
This two way dialogue
with the Chrome browser.

178
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,000
Note what happens to the phone.

179
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,100
It becomes what we call a Me2T,

180
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:25,030
or me to technology enabler relationship.

181
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:27,699
She knows she's using it
but this Me2P relationship,

182
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:32,690
is always the most the
relationship that's most

183
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:34,630
in front of her at the time.

184
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:37,563
It is the most foremost
in her consciousness.

185
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:41,010
And then similarly, there are a number

186
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:42,830
of B2B hidden affiliates here,

187
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:45,040
and I like to call this
sort of the growing

188
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,750
hidden party guests.

189
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:52,680
And so now it's whatever
is in the Chrome browser

190
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,410
but also whatever is in the native device.

191
00:09:55,410 --> 00:10:00,410
So it's a cumulative stack
of hidden party guests.

192
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,010
So it's getting a little more complicated.

193
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:05,450
Well, suppose she goes
to the Instagram website

194
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:08,060
and wants to create an Instagram account.

195
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:08,969
First thing she'll do,

196
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:12,220
of course is create the legal
relationship with Facebook,

197
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,520
and then she starts to have

198
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,023
a Me2P relationship with Instagram.

199
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:21,520
And again, our hidden party
guests, the list grows.

200
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,340
And so suddenly this isn't
a single relationship

201
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:29,200
but a vast network of known
and unknown relationships

202
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,830
that are all happening simultaneously.

203
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,250
So when we think about the scope

204
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,230
of what the Me2B Alliance is doing

205
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:37,360
when it's measuring behavior,

206
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,980
we're mostly looking at
what's happening visibly

207
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:43,320
in the Me2P and Me2T relationships

208
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,473
as well as invisibly in
the B2B hidden affiliates.

209
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:53,000
Another key foundational
piece of framing for us,

210
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
is looking at the Me2B and
Me2P relationships over time.

211
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,610
So once again, we turn
to human psychology,

212
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:06,500
and this is a human relationship
model from psychology

213
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,157
that just shows the arc of a relationship,

214
00:11:08,157 --> 00:11:10,700
and this is pretty
intuitive for most of us.

215
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,060
This is idealized.

216
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:16,109
No relationship is ever
this clean typically

217
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:18,460
but this is a good framing for us

218
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,830
to kind of get more specific

219
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:24,470
about what happens in our
digital Me2B relationships.

220
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:27,040
So here, we're gonna focus on those,

221
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,894
and I wanna just point
out one fundamental aspect

222
00:11:29,894 --> 00:11:31,960
of this diagram.

223
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:35,160
You'll see that there are
two main areas in the slide,

224
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,120
a dark gray and a light gray.

225
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,390
The dark gray is what we call anonymous.

226
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:42,020
We believe people have
a reasonable expectation

227
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:45,100
of anonymity until a point in time,

228
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,463
where they say otherwise,

229
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,709
this is of course not actually true today

230
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,090
in digital Me2B relationships,

231
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:56,090
but this is what we are
aspiring to achieve, frankly,

232
00:11:58,696 --> 00:11:59,946
and in the digital world.

233
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:05,590
So and this is really
drawing from the social norm,

234
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:07,850
of like when we go into a store,

235
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:11,360
we have a reasonable
expectation of general anonymity

236
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,710
and we believe that should be preserved

237
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:15,170
in the digital world.

238
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:18,689
And in fact, you know,
browsers are called browsers

239
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:21,480
and they should be supporting, you know

240
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,313
the norm of window shopping and anonymity.

241
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,430
So a key term that we've developed here

242
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:31,489
to define what happens over time

243
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:34,750
in this digital world and these
digital Me2B relationships

244
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,970
is a Me2B commitment.

245
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:38,960
And we have several of
these Me2B commitments

246
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,720
that happen over the arc of
this overall relationship.

247
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,000
The first commitment that we might see

248
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,260
on a website for example,
is the accept cookies.

249
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:52,439
And that's the first decision
we're confronted with.

250
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,693
Soon after we might get a
request for a sharing location,

251
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:59,260
we might perform a one-off transaction.

252
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:01,450
We might grow to like the service.

253
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:02,640
I mean, you might wanna sign up

254
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,460
for promotional communications.

255
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:07,450
We might wanna sign up
for a loyalty program.

256
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:11,520
And the pinnacle for us is this
what we call Me2B marriage,

257
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,130
where we sign up for an account,

258
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:16,170
we ask to be remembered, recognized

259
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,189
and personally responded to.

260
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:20,640
We believe that is something that grows

261
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,210
this is also the pinnacle of trust, right?

262
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:24,600
I don't wanna get married

263
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:29,600
until I am feeling very
trusting of the service

264
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,493
that I'm using.

265
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:34,930
We might also, at some
point end the marriage,

266
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:36,640
and delete the account or ask

267
00:13:38,447 --> 00:13:40,097
that our relationship be severed.

268
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:43,240
And each one of these commitments,

269
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:48,240
kind of has a behavioral
economics calculus to it.

270
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,480
Like we decide whether
or not the, the deal,

271
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:56,320
the Quid Pro Quo is
appropriate and whether or not,

272
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,220
we wanna actually pursue that commitment

273
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,963
for every single one of these.

274
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:06,380
And that all seems pretty intuitive.

275
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:11,340
I think we can all kind of
relate to these commitments,

276
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:13,260
but it's actually much
more complicated to that.

277
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:16,210
Remember those hidden party
guests that we talked about?

278
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:19,880
Well, the reality is that
instead of having this nice sort

279
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:23,260
of vertical time slice of when
I am remembered, recognized,

280
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:26,380
and responded to it's
really not like that.

281
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:30,390
There is this Parallel
Dataverse where sort of,

282
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:33,400
as soon as I open a
website or open an app,

283
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,270
there is remembering recognition,

284
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:37,160
and identification happening.

285
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,360
And this is often called to
the data layer in the browser

286
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,350
called the data layer
and the browser world.

287
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:46,550
And this is really all
those third party affiliates

288
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:49,579
kind of talking back and forth, right?

289
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:52,420
Talking gossiping really about the Me

290
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:55,022
and sharing information,
sort of willy-nilly.

291
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:58,990
The important thing is that our testing

292
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:03,130
covers both of these realities,
both the experienced view

293
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:05,720
of going through the
commitments, the visible view

294
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:09,260
with the first party, as well
as the hidden affiliates,

295
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,500
the third parties

296
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:14,740
that are these sort of
surveilled relationships.

297
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:18,623
They're not really what we
would call a Me2B relationship.

298
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:21,220
So let's look at the next box.

299
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,600
Here are our specification activities.

300
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,150
So we started this work it's happening

301
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:28,970
in a certification working
group in our organization.

302
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:32,020
And we invite we're open to any member,

303
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,939
can join those
certification working group.

304
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:36,370
We've been working on this since 2019

305
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:40,603
and we are just now preparing
our 1.O spec for ballot.

306
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:44,280
A couple of notes on the spec.

307
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:47,459
It is an MVP version of the spec,

308
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:51,880
it is not comprehensive of
all of the possible harms

309
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:55,300
or all of the parse
possible rules of engagement

310
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,083
that Cam shared with you earlier.

311
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:01,290
There is another document
that we've produced

312
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:03,339
and this is available online right now.

313
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,590
It's a digital harms dictionary,

314
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:08,060
and we're gonna be
converting that into a Wiki,

315
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:10,089
but it's, we're trying to collect

316
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:12,443
all of the various types of digital harms

317
00:16:12,443 --> 00:16:14,920
that a person might be exposed to.

318
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,219
And at some point we envisioned

319
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:21,060
that our respectful text specification

320
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,280
will address all of those digital harms.

321
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,329
And that's when we'll
know our work is done

322
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:28,000
that will take a very long time.

323
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,440
But that is what I mean when I say that,

324
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,380
it currently does not address

325
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,200
all of the potential digital harms,

326
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,393
but we hope that someday it will.

327
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:42,473
Moving into the validate and listen stage.

328
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:45,610
We've conducted several ethnographic

329
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:48,900
and qualitative research
projects to better understand

330
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:51,693
what people most want and need to know.

331
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,680
We learned from our earliest research

332
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,780
that there were two key concerns.

333
00:16:56,780 --> 00:17:00,810
Oops, sorry folks, there
were two key concerns.

334
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:04,010
The first key concern
relates to whether or not

335
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:05,510
they were getting a fair deal.

336
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:10,220
And in particular, what
is the cost of free.

337
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:13,619
People in our research expressed
some general uneasiness

338
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:15,599
and a great deal of resignation

339
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,869
that they basically had to just take

340
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:20,209
what was offered to them.

341
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:21,619
They didn't really have any volition.

342
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:24,219
They didn't have any agency
or choice in the matter.

343
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:27,310
They did have a sense that the supplier

344
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:29,940
and consumer line was muddy, and was hazy,

345
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,490
and that they were
somehow involved in supply

346
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:36,280
where, you know unusually
in the digital world

347
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:40,040
but they didn't really have
an ability to assess the deal.

348
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:44,550
So we learned that providing
some kind of assurance

349
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:48,050
around the fairness of the
deal was important to people.

350
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:51,050
The second thing we learned
is people are keenly aware

351
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:54,960
and concerned about security
lapses, credentials, breaches

352
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,963
and identity theft, in particular.

353
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:02,929
When we later tested some
of these assurance marks,

354
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:05,480
these little icons that
you see on the slide here,

355
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:08,210
we actually had one of the
participants laugh out loud

356
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:11,163
when we shared the
security assurance mark,

357
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:15,409
and they explained that,
well that's just impossible,

358
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:16,760
and he wasn't wrong, right?

359
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:21,760
I mean, it is kind of
impossible to assure security.

360
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,680
And our certification really does,

361
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,380
a kind of light touch on security.

362
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,910
We're not going deep into security.

363
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:30,740
There's plenty of security
standards and specs out there.

364
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:35,740
And we're just confirming
that they're being adhered to,

365
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,092
at a sort of high level.

366
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:41,760
We added these two other
categories here agency and control.

367
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,970
It was clear that people felt
like that was science fiction

368
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:47,650
due to that resignation of
just, this is what we get

369
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,470
even though it felt that way,

370
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:53,080
we knew that it was gonna
become important to people,

371
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,159
and it is an important part of our testing

372
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:58,023
and our respectful text back.

373
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,390
We also added in private, by default.

374
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:04,290
We really wanted to surface this

375
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:06,480
what we call respectful defaults

376
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,970
and making sure that the
product out of the gate

377
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:13,670
you don't have to basically
go tinker with settings,

378
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:15,540
in order to have a private experience.

379
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:18,570
Again, drawing from norms
in the physical world.

380
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:22,673
We have kind of private by
default is our social norm.

381
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:28,980
So finally moving into
the measuring state.

382
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:31,120
We've been doing what we
call early certification

383
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:35,530
testing of websites and mobile
apps for the past year or so.

384
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:39,010
And this is really
validating the specification

385
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:43,970
and also hearing from vendors
and makers of technology

386
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:47,670
what resonates and what doesn't
in our certifications back.

387
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:50,500
Our scoring goes from
minus three to plus one.

388
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,820
Again, if you think that like
we're automobile crash testing

389
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,879
we're really more interested in the nuance

390
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,400
of the potential risks and harms.

391
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,830
So that scale goes from
minus one being somewhat

392
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:04,010
disrespectful or potentially risky

393
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:07,290
to minus three where there
is a rather large potential

394
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:08,700
for harm or risk.

395
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,040
Zero is a great score for us.

396
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:14,790
No harm detected, that's
terrific, that's awesome.

397
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:16,240
Plus one is even better.

398
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,270
It means that the vendor
is taking some extra care

399
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:23,050
doing something outside of
their norms to take extra care

400
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:25,393
of the end user of the technology.

401
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,870
So what have we learned
throughout all of this process?

402
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:34,350
Well, first of all, a big thing is,

403
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:36,610
if you can't name it,
you can't measure it.

404
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,360
And we, again, we didn't
have the language.

405
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:41,679
We really had to get the clarity
of those Me2B commitments

406
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,790
to be able to say and to measure and test,

407
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:49,170
each one of those commitments
against our criteria.

408
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:52,060
Acute alternate name for this is,

409
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:55,010
what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas.

410
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:57,143
And that's certainly the case.

411
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:03,000
Also, this is kind of almost
a rhetorical observation

412
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,590
but translating principles
into measurable criteria,

413
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:06,810
is really hard.

414
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:07,643
It's really hard.

415
00:21:07,643 --> 00:21:09,910
We knew it was hard going
in, it was even harder.

416
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:13,450
It continues to be challenging as we go.

417
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:17,767
And this continues to be a place

418
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,673
where we have to work extra hard.

419
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,880
Another key learning is that
virtually all technology has,

420
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,770
all digital technology has
potential risks and harms

421
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:31,300
to the end user.

422
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,250
That's what we're finding.

423
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,790
Now, where it is in the spectrum,

424
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:37,363
minus three to minus one

425
00:21:37,363 --> 00:21:40,173
that's where the nuance is important.

426
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,980
Another key observation here is that,

427
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:46,000
that parallel data verse
that I shared with you,

428
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,533
is much more harmful to
me than the visible world.

429
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:52,650
Many of those risks are
actually kind of endemic

430
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:56,050
from the platform
infrastructures themselves.

431
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:59,870
So one interesting point is what happens,

432
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:01,820
when we remove the third party cookies,

433
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:05,189
which as we I think we all
know here is well underway.

434
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:08,380
And one of the concerns we have is,

435
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:11,270
will this dynamic of
removing third-party cookies

436
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:15,590
actually kind of expedite
the process of forcing people

437
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:19,290
into a Me2B marriage
and essentially forcing

438
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:22,510
more identification and more credentials,

439
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:25,250
and thereby also increasing risk, right?

440
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:29,730
You know, kind of building
that population of credentials

441
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:32,950
that you're having to
keep track of as a vendor.

442
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:34,170
I don't know if this will happen,

443
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:38,930
but there's some indication
that there will be a movement

444
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:43,000
to gather more first party data,

445
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,103
I'm seeing a lot of
marketing buzz about that.

446
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:53,980
So finally, the passing
score threshold is hard.

447
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:57,870
We don't have a clear
indication of what that is.

448
00:22:57,870 --> 00:23:01,449
It's somewhere between probably
minus one and minus two.

449
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:04,320
And it's likely to be contextual,

450
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,800
depending on the industry vertical.

451
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,120
So this is gonna take us some time,

452
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,979
and a great deal of testing

453
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:14,530
across a number of products
in order to figure out

454
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:17,920
where is the certification
passing threshold.

455
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,980
This will be coming probably
throughout, you know

456
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:23,590
this year into next year,
well into next year,

457
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:27,713
before we have clarity on where
that passing threshold is.

458
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:35,073
So what can you do today, to
build respectful technology?

459
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,750
Well, first of all you
can treat the people

460
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,830
who use your technology
whether they're everyday Me-s,

461
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:44,320
or they're business people, or whomever,

462
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,740
treat them with respect.

463
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:48,170
Build respect in from the start.

464
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:50,980
It's very hard to retrofit in.

465
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,780
It's something you need
to do out of the gate.

466
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:56,833
It needs to be a primary
design focus for you.

467
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:00,133
Make your products private by default.

468
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:05,260
Don't abuse, don't don't,
don't abuse, your end users.

469
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:07,460
Make it private by default.

470
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:08,890
Check your entitlement.

471
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:13,590
There is, I would say,
across the world, right?

472
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:17,379
And in the it's an industry
norm, a global industry norm

473
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:21,490
that data is there ripe for the picking,

474
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:22,803
ripe for the taking,

475
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:26,540
why do we have that sense of entitlement?

476
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:28,600
Just because it's there doesn't mean

477
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,763
that we ought to take it.

478
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:35,090
We need to be mindful about this.

479
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:37,173
Similarly with identity,

480
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:41,810
forcing people into
identity relationships,

481
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:42,960
you know, that Me2B marriage

482
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:47,710
that we talk about, that's
a sort of hallowed space.

483
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:49,900
Like that's a real relationship,

484
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:52,720
that you should treat that
really with a lot of respect,

485
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,420
and a lot of integrity.

486
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:59,420
And, you know, don't force
people into identification

487
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:02,023
until it's meaningful.

488
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:07,253
And if you can only do one
thing on this list so far,

489
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:11,550
make it private by
default, do that at least,

490
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:13,773
to treat people with respect.

491
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:18,060
Also for each of the Me2B
commitments in your service,

492
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:22,200
make it easy for people
to sign up and unenroll.

493
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,220
Make it peep easy for people to understand

494
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,590
what they're giving,

495
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:27,659
and what they're getting
for that commitment.

496
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,230
What's the Quid Pro Quo,

497
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:31,330
for that commitment, should be obvious.

498
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:35,320
And it should be proportional
only ask for what you need.

499
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,470
If I'm signing up for a loyalty program,

500
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:40,850
you don't need to know my
gender and my birth date.

501
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:45,072
You really only need to
know how to contact me.

502
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,690
Don't take without asking this
kinda goes without saying,

503
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:51,160
but it doesn't, unfortunately

504
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,430
because it's a norm.

505
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:53,610
Don't take without asking,

506
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:55,320
we don't do it in the physical world.

507
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,620
We ought not be doing
it in the digital world.

508
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:02,350
Also make it easy for people
to understand what you've done

509
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:05,629
with any information that
they've shared with you

510
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:07,580
make it easy for them to get a history.

511
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:13,000
And by the way, if you
do all of this stuff,

512
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,010
you probably won't have
to worry too terribly

513
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:17,550
much about being compliant
with whatever regulation

514
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:20,280
comes down the pike in
the US this, you know

515
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,060
you can sleep pretty easy,

516
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:24,500
knowing that you're
treating people respectfully

517
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,860
and you're likely to comply
with with the vast majority

518
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,872
of any regulation coming out.

519
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,530
Now, it's interesting to note,

520
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:35,889
as I put together this presentation,

521
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:38,020
that there's some similarities
between the challenges

522
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:40,940
of measuring the ethical
behavior technology

523
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:44,050
and assessing the security of technology.

524
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:48,040
So in his turning award speech in 1983

525
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,956
Ken Thompson says this,

526
00:26:49,957 --> 00:26:52,500
"the moral is obvious you can't trust code

527
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,330
that you did not totally create yourself."

528
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:58,379
Well, you all, as security
professionals live

529
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:00,450
and breathe this, you know this.

530
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:04,840
So it turns out do we as
measures of ethical behavior

531
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,570
of technology in particular,

532
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:10,800
it's the challenge of the
increasing complexity of software,

533
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,889
and the ability to assess that software,

534
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:14,830
whether it's for security threats

535
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:16,763
or for respectful behavior.

536
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:22,610
I like to call this ever
increasing complexity problem,

537
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:25,479
the knowability of software problem.

538
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,560
And I, my hypothesis is that,

539
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:31,110
we may be post peak software knowability.

540
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:34,453
We may no longer be able to
know as a single individual.

541
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:38,812
And, Certainly we've
seen this in our testing,

542
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:43,129
where disrespectful behavior
and the technology, isn't a,

543
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:46,680
it's not a product of deliberate
intentions at all in fact,

544
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:49,390
but rather of not knowing the behavior

545
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:53,033
of some of the third-party
integration that you've got.

546
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:56,070
It's hard and it's getting harder,

547
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:59,770
but we have some
recommendations about this.

548
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:03,350
So forgive the grammar on this,
but this is a nod of course

549
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:06,100
to the move fast and break things mantra.

550
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:08,439
We suggest that it's time to move slowly

551
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,310
and deeply know things.

552
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:13,649
You need to know in particular
all of the information

553
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:17,080
that you get observed, derive,
otherwise get, and you know

554
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:20,870
calculate that originates
from people or their behavior.

555
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:24,370
You need to know it, you need
to question do we need it.

556
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:25,592
Do we truly need it?

557
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,130
Similarly you need to know

558
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:31,200
what all your third
party services and APIs,

559
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,990
and anything that's integrated

560
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:35,400
into your website, mobile apps.

561
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:39,020
You need to know what are they
doing with the information?

562
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,060
How are they treating it?

563
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:41,610
How are they treating

564
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:43,913
are they being respectful to the end user?

565
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,760
And it's early days for privacy labels

566
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,190
like Apple's privacy label

567
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:51,670
on their mobile apps in their app store.

568
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:53,710
You're gonna have to know these things.

569
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:55,330
And you're probably gonna have to put them

570
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:58,053
in the privacy label, in the future.

571
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:02,419
So sooner or later is coming.

572
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:05,240
Similarly, our supplier
management practices

573
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,080
need to be we updated.

574
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:10,090
We need to include clear
information use scopes

575
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:14,560
and restrictions into
our supplier agreements.

576
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,409
Additionally, we need to have very clear,

577
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:19,690
permission management obligations
right in our supplier,

578
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:21,823
our service level agreements themselves.

579
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:29,090
In GDPR as a data controller,
we are all obligated

580
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:31,600
to have permission management flowing

581
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:36,480
through all of our data
processors or co-data controllers.

582
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,010
We're already obligated,

583
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:40,240
but the practices and the norms,

584
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,960
on the supply side management,
they're not quite there.

585
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,090
We have to get a lot more detail.

586
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:47,040
We have to more deeply know this stuff.

587
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:52,490
So hopefully that's a little
helpful guidance for you.

588
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:54,310
I'd like to thank you
all for your time today.

589
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:57,690
I hope that this has been
illuminating and valuable for you.

590
00:29:57,690 --> 00:29:59,440
And if you'd like to either get involved

591
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,690
in creating the respectful tech standard,

592
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:05,330
or if you'd like to
have us perform an audit

593
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:07,189
for respectfulness and your technology,

594
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:09,220
please feel free to contact us,

595
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,640
and thank you very much.
