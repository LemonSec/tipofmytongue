1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:02,650
- My name is Steve Winterfeld,

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:04,257
I'm the Advisory CISO at Akamai.

3
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:08,830
And today, I wanted to take some time

4
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:12,160
and just share some of my experience

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,830
talking about some of the things
I see going on in industry

6
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,537
and across our customer bases,

7
00:00:19,537 --> 00:00:23,070
and really, it's around you
know how to protect the edge.

8
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,340
Traditionally, when I
was building a program,

9
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:28,290
and as we're gonna to talk
about today is building programs

10
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:30,590
is I used to think about, you know,

11
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:35,590
the edge facing out my
network, and then the endpoint.

12
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,373
And today's you know, multi
infrastructure options,

13
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:42,570
that's actually becoming dated.

14
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:45,720
I have some customers that
everything is almost on the edge.

15
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:50,269
And so I wanna talk through
how to secure that edge.

16
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:52,660
I love this quote by
Michael Jordan, you know,

17
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:57,660
first of all, it is
absolutely a team sport,

18
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,699
everything we do in infosec.

19
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:03,090
Second of all, you know, we
used to think about going out

20
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:05,610
and getting the best
athlete, the best product,

21
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,960
for each individual capability.

22
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,509
And now I've got some customers

23
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:12,920
I've talked to an insurance
company the other day was 63,

24
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,860
talked to major Bank of
England they had 500,

25
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:17,870
which just blows my mind.

26
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:18,840
And so it's about, you know,

27
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,370
getting rid of some of that
complexity, and moving forward.

28
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:24,238
So let's jump in.

29
00:01:24,238 --> 00:01:27,620
I wanna start talking about, you know,

30
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:32,620
the concept of really a
strategy versus a framework.

31
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:35,660
And I think they are different.

32
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:36,759
Some people will say, you know,

33
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,330
the framework is my strategy,
and I'll push back on that.

34
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:42,594
So let's say, you know, you go out there

35
00:01:42,594 --> 00:01:44,210
and now you're in banking now

36
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:46,550
resiliency is becoming something

37
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:48,170
the federal auditors looking at.

38
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:51,593
So let's say I wanted to
have a resiliency strategy.

39
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:54,980
Why, you know, that
that can mean, you know,

40
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:58,120
a simple definition of
ensuring my customers

41
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:02,590
have access to their wealth
in a contested environment.

42
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:03,750
And what are the resources?

43
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,880
I could, you know, move to a CDM.

44
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,210
So they had, you know, good capacity,

45
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:12,160
I could move to something
that prevented a threat

46
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,079
like denial of service.

47
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,330
I could move to, you know,
a cloud infrastructure

48
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:20,260
that could scale and give me more capacity

49
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:23,257
by building more servers, you know.

50
00:02:23,257 --> 00:02:25,910
So I think, as we think
through that though,

51
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:28,760
then the framework has
to come with something

52
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,959
that's a little bit different,

53
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,920
and that's more around,
you know, NIST 800-160

54
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,980
talks about resiliency,

55
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:39,980
or ISO 22301 talks about
business continuity,

56
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:45,690
and resiliency and security
or components within that.

57
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:46,850
So I think those are the frameworks.

58
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:51,560
And I think those are tools
we use to get to the strategy.

59
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,540
And in fact, one of the things
I'll talk about today is

60
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:57,690
we're gonna recommend an analyst strategy.

61
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:00,920
And I would be careful, analyst framework,

62
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,929
I would be careful calling it a strategy

63
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:05,950
because then you can be
held to by an auditor

64
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:08,519
to doing everything within that framework.

65
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,760
If you call it an analytical
tool, which is appropriate,

66
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,640
since it's from an
analytical organization,

67
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,279
then you can just implement
things that are in accordance

68
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,273
with your strategy.

69
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:21,580
And so you know, let's look
at some other frameworks

70
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:22,413
real quick here.

71
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:24,850
We've got a number of them.

72
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:28,184
The first is, you know,
government base NIST.

73
00:03:28,184 --> 00:03:32,560
The one second the bottom,
mitre is semi government,

74
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,320
it's government sponsored.

75
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,299
I'm a huge advocate of the mitre framework

76
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,200
is a way to measure the
maturity of your SOC.

77
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,732
We've got some over here to the right

78
00:03:42,733 --> 00:03:44,457
HITRUST similar to PCIs

79
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:47,660
and external paid for auditing capability,

80
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:51,063
COBIT is an audit capability
framework you can use.

81
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,610
So there are a number of these,

82
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:56,780
we're gonna to focus today on
a two (indistinct) edge based.

83
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,233
Forrester, Zero Trust Edge,

84
00:03:59,688 --> 00:04:03,066
SASE, the Secure Access Service Edge.

85
00:04:03,067 --> 00:04:07,560
And that actually came out
in 2019, in a paper called

86
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,770
the Future Network
Security is in the Cloud.

87
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:12,390
And if you wanna access that paper,

88
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:16,469
you can get it on Akamai
or a number of other sites.

89
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:18,627
And of course, with Zero Trust Edge

90
00:04:18,627 --> 00:04:21,132
has a great blog that anybody can get to

91
00:04:21,132 --> 00:04:24,180
that kind of outlines
their thought process.

92
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,400
But these are a couple
tools I wanna focus on it.

93
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,640
And we're really focused
on the Gartners today.

94
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,260
I think it's gaining a lot of (indistinct)

95
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:36,670
similar to Forrester's
Zero Trust 10 years ago,

96
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:38,590
we're still talking about that,

97
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:41,359
because it's something the
industry was already doing.

98
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,080
And I think the SASE framework

99
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,080
is just hitting us at a
time where it makes sense,

100
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,000
'cause we're already
moving in that direction.

101
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,436
And then the last one on here

102
00:04:50,436 --> 00:04:53,909
is something a little
bit outside security,

103
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:57,500
but I think with insecurity
should look at those, you know,

104
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,100
what is the cost of doing business?

105
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,820
What are some of these
other other frameworks

106
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,750
we should be paying attention to?

107
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,470
So as we work across the
stakeholders and partners,

108
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:07,363
we're talking in the same language.

109
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,513
So let's talk about the SASE framework.

110
00:05:12,715 --> 00:05:14,150
And I love the saying that,

111
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:16,950
name SASE all day as much as you will.

112
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:20,680
And so, you know, it
is about the benefits.

113
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:24,380
And so the first thing we
wanna do is reduce complexity,

114
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:27,450
while actually gaining
more situational awareness

115
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:29,870
by being on one platform,

116
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:32,700
you're getting that integration up front.

117
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,490
Simple vendor management equation.

118
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:37,700
You know, if I think about one customer

119
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,740
managing 500 vendors,

120
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:43,142
they're spending a lot of their
time in vendor management.

121
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:45,020
And so if I can cut that number in half,

122
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,620
regardless of it is.

123
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,200
And if I'm a small company
with two employees,

124
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,740
and 15 vendors is a lot of vendors.

125
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,810
And so if I can cut that down,

126
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:57,054
it just makes life easier for everybody.

127
00:05:57,054 --> 00:05:59,750
You know, staffing.

128
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,895
I can't keep increasing my staff

129
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:04,140
and finding the skills quite honestly

130
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:06,669
is making it hard in the first place.

131
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:10,020
And so I wanna look at
something that, you know,

132
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,280
instead of having four security tools

133
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,369
with one engineer managing four

134
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:17,480
and barely being able to keep
them patched and optimized,

135
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,984
now I have one engineer
managing one platform,

136
00:06:20,984 --> 00:06:23,930
able to do a much better job.

137
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:26,030
So I think there's some benefits there.

138
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:27,929
And then finally, you know,

139
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:32,063
reducing latency and
improving enforcement,

140
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:36,830
by collaborating with the network side.

141
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,109
And we're gonna take a look at that here.

142
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:44,110
So we have is, we have the
ability for the framework

143
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:49,550
to include both the network
side and the security side.

144
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:51,450
And so we're looking at,
I'll give you an example

145
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:55,000
from my past, it's one
of my favorite stories is

146
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,460
(indistinct) done,

147
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,239
I had my program in place.

148
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,156
And then I found out
some of the applications

149
00:07:04,156 --> 00:07:07,633
I'm protecting, were being
moved to public cloud.

150
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:11,040
And so now I'm scrambling to say,

151
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,920
how do I get the controls
into this particular cloud?

152
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,590
How do I make sure that

153
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:18,510
I'm able to meet my audit requirements,

154
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:23,510
you know, it just sent me into
a scramble to protect those.

155
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:27,630
Because we weren't really
tightly integrated with IT.

156
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:30,730
We've all had this experience
of being pulled in too late.

157
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:33,810
But this is an effort to
kind of get in front of that.

158
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:36,870
And so as you look to the
left hand of the screen,

159
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:39,570
you have all those network capabilities,

160
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:44,070
Software-Defined WAN and
Content Delivery Network.

161
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:47,698
On the other side, you have all
those security capabilities,

162
00:07:47,698 --> 00:07:51,219
you know, Cloud Security
Brokers, Secure Web Gateways,

163
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:56,203
Zero Trust Network Access,
web and application firewalls,

164
00:07:56,203 --> 00:07:58,969
you know, cloud based firewalls,

165
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:01,500
secure DNS, remote browser isolation.

166
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,200
If you look at the broader list,

167
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,010
there's probably between

168
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:08,330
10 and 15 capabilities listed there,

169
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:10,210
that you should think about integrating

170
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:13,359
all both sides of this into one platform

171
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,803
to get that complete integration.

172
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:19,239
So now, let's take a step back.

173
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,130
And you know, we said okay,
we've got a framework,

174
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:24,920
it talks about the edge,
how do we define that edge?

175
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:28,630
How are we gonna come to
consensus on what that looks like?

176
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:30,570
And so what I wanna look at here

177
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:33,962
is just the ability for
us to say, you know,

178
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,630
you can have the edge and
still be in the data center.

179
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:40,970
There are some infrastructure,
some industries,

180
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:44,253
that just makes sense to
stay in the data center.

181
00:08:45,383 --> 00:08:47,940
There are others that
are gonna go into Cloud,

182
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,440
they may go into multi cloud,

183
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,580
they may go into private cloud, a mix.

184
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:55,010
And so you know, what does that look like?

185
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:56,160
And there are others that are moving

186
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,449
straight out to the edge.

187
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:00,928
You know, you've heard
the term edge compute.

188
00:09:00,928 --> 00:09:02,730
If you're thinking about, you know,

189
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:05,450
even if we go back to
cloud, you have you know,

190
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:08,580
infrastructure as a cloud,
you have data storage,

191
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:12,800
you have functions, or
running code snippets,

192
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,579
what we call serverless.

193
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:17,100
Some of the serverless are
going straight to the edge,

194
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,090
and they're doing more
and more distributed.

195
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:25,090
And so as you think of
these different concepts,

196
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:28,110
you have to say, what
does edge mean to us?

197
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,960
Am I gonna, you know, protect the edge,

198
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,530
protect the network, protect the endpoint?

199
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,089
How am I gonna protect the edge?

200
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:35,990
What does that consist of?

201
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:37,590
And so as you get your arms around that,

202
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:40,530
I think that really helps
you then, be able to say,

203
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:43,100
what are the requirements to secure it?

204
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,823
What is the strategy I'm
gonna go about to do that?

205
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,880
And so next, let's kind of say

206
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,827
what are some of those architectures
that might be involved.

207
00:09:52,827 --> 00:09:57,827
And so the first architecture
is kind of a content delivery.

208
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:01,890
Now that was one of those more
than (indistinct) concepts.

209
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:05,040
And so if you're building into
this, what are the threats?

210
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,520
How do we deal with that?

211
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,650
And how do we build towards this?

212
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:13,120
And so if you have a lot
of web facing capabilities,

213
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,480
be the APIs or web pages,

214
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,220
this may be a good concept to think about.

215
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:20,273
Now, again, it's not gonna the
only thing you think about,

216
00:10:20,273 --> 00:10:22,350
there's just one architecture.

217
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:24,490
But as you talk to the networking side,

218
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,230
this will be part of it, you know,

219
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:30,110
are they gonna use something
like content delivery?

220
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:33,100
Are you really worried about
denial of service attacks?

221
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,650
You know, again, going back to the example

222
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:37,010
of wealth management,

223
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:39,900
people need help access
to their bank account.

224
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,329
And so are you gonna focus on, you know,

225
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:45,240
availability being extremely high?

226
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,710
And so are you gonna do some
kind of scrubbing center

227
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:51,230
or something to mitigate DDoS?

228
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:53,330
'Cause that's a high threat.

229
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:56,040
And then, you know, ultimately DNS,

230
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,599
so people can find things,
where people can find you,

231
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,040
how are you gonna protect that?

232
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,380
How are you gonna optimize that?

233
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:07,380
So these are some samples of
things for us to think about,

234
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:11,790
as we say, you know,
we've defined the edge,

235
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,949
now we need to talk about
the different architectures

236
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:17,880
involved in the edge and others, you know,

237
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,800
going back to Software Defined WAN,

238
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,160
there are other opportunities
to have a discussion here.

239
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,530
But this is just a sample
of the kind of things

240
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:27,579
we should think about.

241
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,370
As we think about those, you know,

242
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:32,181
it's always good to crosswalk
those to the threats

243
00:11:32,181 --> 00:11:33,850
we're most worried about.

244
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:37,000
And so, you know, first of
all what are you protecting,

245
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,800
kind of mapping to the
architecture before (indistinct).

246
00:11:40,931 --> 00:11:44,320
And then, you know,
what is the requirement,

247
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,502
you know, as a performance
as a just access?

248
00:11:47,502 --> 00:11:48,939
You know, what are we concerned about?

249
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:51,580
Or where are we willing to take risk?

250
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:55,680
And then, you know, which
infrastructure should we use?

251
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,089
So, as it everything,

252
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:59,500
I think this is an excellent opportunity

253
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,610
to make sure your red teams involved,

254
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:04,530
or your penetration test
team or your SOC team.

255
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:07,350
Whoever's in charge of
bringing that threat

256
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:08,490
to the conversation

257
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:10,810
to make sure you're building
something that is secure

258
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:13,479
and meeting the needs up front.

259
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,800
And so, you know, the next
thing we wanna talk about

260
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,150
is kind of these different models,

261
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:20,640
as we tie back to the
(indistinct) architecture

262
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,750
and all that is,

263
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,920
we now need to go look at
what our business model is.

264
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,319
'Cause ultimately, you know,

265
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,280
when I talk about the security strategy,

266
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,360
the security strategy should be a subset

267
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,120
of the business strategy,

268
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,620
the security architecture
should be a subset

269
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:39,280
of the business model
we're gonna be using.

270
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,319
And so you know,

271
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,880
different industries are
doing this differently,

272
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,189
we're coming out,

273
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:46,690
some will continue to
lean into remote work,

274
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:48,890
but even remote work is different.

275
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:50,520
I mean, we're back to the challenge

276
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,319
of somebody being in a hotel,

277
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,980
or a coffee shop, or an airport.

278
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:58,090
And as that starts to
happen more and more,

279
00:12:58,090 --> 00:12:59,900
I think the traditional challenges

280
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,490
of people (indistinct) will expand,

281
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,610
'cause now you're on more and
more potentially untrusted

282
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:07,930
or compromised networks.

283
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:10,020
And so as we're looking
forward to this, you know,

284
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:13,210
are we gonna go to what I call more of a

285
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:16,060
location agnostic architecture,

286
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:18,670
are we gonna stick with our heavy branch?

287
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:20,000
You know, you get the main office,

288
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,960
and then you got bank branches,

289
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:27,010
or you know, you've got you
know, these sub components

290
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:28,900
that are physical places,

291
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:32,134
that you're mirroring your infrastructure.

292
00:13:32,134 --> 00:13:34,680
Are we gonna stay in this more, you know,

293
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:38,449
distributed remote workers
and have each worker,

294
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:42,860
or each city, you know,
somehow be a thinner branch

295
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:45,450
and smaller requirements,

296
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,590
'cause we're not protecting quite as much

297
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:50,150
depending on how we have them coming in.

298
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:51,829
And then finally, you know,

299
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:55,350
we've got something that
is leaning away from this

300
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:58,040
more in the cloud architecture.

301
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,719
And so you see different
security components

302
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,480
based on managing risk and
your business processes.

303
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,450
And so you know, if you have
somebody that is simply doing

304
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:12,330
administrative work, they may
need fewer security tools,

305
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:13,970
than somebody that's working, you know,

306
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:15,780
a developer on your crown jewel

307
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:18,154
with all your intellectual property.

308
00:14:18,154 --> 00:14:21,090
Some of this will be
very compliance based.

309
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:23,220
It may be regionally compliance based,

310
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:26,050
it may be compliance from
industry or privacy here,

311
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:27,670
all sorts of things.

312
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:30,849
So part of this goes back to you know,

313
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:34,060
how are we matching up
to the business model.

314
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,979
And it's something we need
to start leaning into is

315
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:39,920
one of those internet of
things we're trying to protect,

316
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,752
where are they coming up?

317
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,319
Just the other day, I took my car in

318
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,640
and they were like, have
you been here before?

319
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,430
Yes, they connected to the car,

320
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:52,530
pulled up everything from diagnostic,

321
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:56,329
my name, all my information,
never even asked me who I was,

322
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:59,060
but just focused on interacting with me

323
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:01,890
through the data they pulled off the car.

324
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:05,670
And that data included any
alerts that I wasn't aware of

325
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:08,630
that they may wanna have to
have called me before later.

326
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:10,020
And so you know,

327
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:14,010
what of my information is
on that little pad there,

328
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:15,853
the tablet they're using.

329
00:15:15,853 --> 00:15:17,829
Is my credit card information is there

330
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:20,970
in my personal life information on there.

331
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:23,000
You know, protecting the customer

332
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,630
is certainly tied to a device

333
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:27,780
that may not have gone
through the security review.

334
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,839
So what are those internet of things

335
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,040
that we have to protect.

336
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:35,550
And so just something to think through

337
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:38,469
as we continue to do this crosswalk.

338
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:41,023
So now I wanna jump into a group of slides

339
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,470
that are really going to be text heavy.

340
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:46,580
The temptation is to read
through all the slides,

341
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,440
ignore me while I'm talking.

342
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,920
But I wanna say that, you know,

343
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,790
I built these and I built this whole thing

344
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:54,577
for you to be able to
go back and look later

345
00:15:54,577 --> 00:15:58,610
to use as a tool, scribe this information,

346
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:03,610
and then build a program
or use it to take a review

347
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,890
of where your program is today.

348
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:08,600
And so there's a lot of text
here that you can go back,

349
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,310
pull up the slides,

350
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:12,140
and then scribe this
information and use it.

351
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,740
So we'll dive straight into here

352
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:17,867
to the first one (indistinct) backups.

353
00:16:17,867 --> 00:16:20,839
If you look (indistinct)
you know, analyst paper

354
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:24,380
and another number of factors
as much longer than this,

355
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,600
I wanted to talk to the ones

356
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,160
that I think are the most critical.

357
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,161
And obviously, the holy
grail of security is,

358
00:16:31,162 --> 00:16:35,350
you know, finding that
situational awareness,

359
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:37,846
knowing what's happened real time.

360
00:16:37,846 --> 00:16:41,283
The minimize the dwell time of
any threats on your network.

361
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,360
And so what we have here is, you know,

362
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,620
how does this tie into
the rest of your system?

363
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:52,150
Is this, you know, a way
for you to get visualization

364
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:54,283
and situational awareness rapidly,

365
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,593
defense in depth obviously,
you know, classic.

366
00:16:59,843 --> 00:17:03,469
I wanna jump into two
of these upfront though,

367
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:06,793
and that is really
resiliency and segmentation.

368
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:11,450
So everything we've been
talking about is consolidation,

369
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:13,839
and getting rid of complexity.

370
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,135
And here I'm talking about two concepts

371
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:20,280
that let's say, let's
make things more expensive

372
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:24,430
by having multiple capabilities,
some kind of a resiliency,

373
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:29,430
and let's do segmentation and
to make things more complex.

374
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,770
And so these are kind of,

375
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:35,610
I call them the yin and
the yang here to explore,

376
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:36,990
how are we gonna do this.

377
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:40,140
You know, redundancy and resiliency

378
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,030
are two different things.

379
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:43,340
So it doesn't mean you have
to have two of something,

380
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:45,560
it doesn't mean you have to double down,

381
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,190
it means it has to be able to again,

382
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:50,150
work in a contested environment.

383
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:52,340
You have to have
components of your network

384
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:54,590
and security capabilities

385
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:56,970
that are gonna respond real time,

386
00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:01,470
ideally in an automated safe
way to ensure that access,

387
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:04,653
or productivity, or whatever
your business model is.

388
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,940
And so just need to
think about that upfront.

389
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:13,000
So you don't take away

390
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,740
some of what we're
trying to build towards.

391
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,063
And then segmentation.

392
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:20,243
You know, the classic
is VPN speed, you know,

393
00:18:21,402 --> 00:18:25,997
segmenting VPN is great
'cause you reduce your risk.

394
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,430
You know, we talked about upfront

395
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:31,700
that your trust network access,

396
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,970
typically, there are two ways to approach

397
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:38,190
that micro segmentation
or network layer access,

398
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:41,173
you know, going straight
into the application,

399
00:18:41,173 --> 00:18:44,030
benefits to both of those.

400
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:46,370
But as you talk through
this, having done this,

401
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:48,810
you know, when you have
an auditor come in,

402
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:50,600
and you say, well, I have that segmented,

403
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,679
and then they want
evidence of segmentation,

404
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,550
and then somebody does segmentation wrong

405
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:57,879
and you have data spillage.

406
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:01,620
And can so, worth considering
how to minimize this,

407
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:04,239
how to take things out
of scope where you can,

408
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,190
as a technique to minimize
what you have to segment,

409
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:09,430
and just think through

410
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:12,523
how to not lose some of
the benefits you gained.

411
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:17,233
And then the last one, I'll
emphasize on this is staffing.

412
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,930
I like to work with a vendor

413
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:24,330
that can give me (indistinct)
expertise on demand,

414
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:27,669
or maybe help me search for a project

415
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:31,240
that I need extra help with,
and then they can fade off

416
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,690
after I've accomplished that goal.

417
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:36,580
So, you know, when you
think you're staffing both,

418
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,580
how are you gonna minimize your staffing

419
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:39,840
and as you work with vendors,

420
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,560
how are you gonna be able to

421
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,903
leverage on demand staffing.

422
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:47,040
Next, I wanna give you
a kind of a checklist

423
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,960
of what I think are some of
the critical capabilities.

424
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,570
Up front, we just had a talked about

425
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:53,932
what the corporation needs to do

426
00:19:53,932 --> 00:19:57,710
(indistinct) from the vendor,

427
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,810
and then a couple at the
end talking about you know,

428
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:04,260
the future and other
considerations to have.

429
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:07,180
So upfront, you know,
what are my requirements?

430
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,550
What's my edge look like,

431
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:10,120
we talked about that.

432
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,080
Then here in the middle, it is, you know,

433
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,293
what are the services do they offer,

434
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,454
you know, geographically?

435
00:20:17,454 --> 00:20:20,360
And this is a huge component for me.

436
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,793
What are the compliance requirements?

437
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:27,590
I just need to understand, you know,

438
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:29,459
if you're in the United
States for privacy,

439
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,140
it's different by state,

440
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:35,620
if you're International,
it's different by country.

441
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:38,570
You've got somewhere
they're talking about,

442
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,350
you know, where data can reside,

443
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:42,800
inside or outside the country.

444
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,210
You have different definition of

445
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:47,050
what is included in privacy.

446
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:50,659
You know, and so, as you
work through all this,

447
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:54,410
you want a vendor that
is going to pay attention

448
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:57,670
to that for you, or you're
gonna take care of that.

449
00:20:57,670 --> 00:21:00,050
And this is an example
of where we talked about

450
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,659
it being a team sport.

451
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:04,900
You may need to pull in
the privacy or the legal

452
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:08,200
and get those reviews on a
one of those requirements

453
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,883
actually look like.

454
00:21:09,883 --> 00:21:12,500
You know, how mature are they?

455
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,620
How are they gonna be around?

456
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,229
Do they deliver on the roadmap?

457
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:18,530
Is this a company I'm gonna
be wanting to work with

458
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:19,507
long term?

459
00:21:19,507 --> 00:21:22,123
You know, the smaller companies,

460
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,350
are they gonna be bought
by another company

461
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,540
and then they fade out?

462
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:30,139
And there's just so many
things to think about here

463
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:31,840
in the big picture.

464
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,459
And then as we look forward, you know,

465
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,070
what are the emerging threats

466
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:37,379
that aren't in the SASE framework?

467
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:42,090
An example I'll use is kind
of that JavaScript threat.

468
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:44,750
You know, we have a lot
of JavaScript on the edge,

469
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:47,720
the SASE framework as it comes to you

470
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,300
doesn't really talk about protecting that.

471
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:53,540
And with major current threat
out there, another concept.

472
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,440
So one of those emerging threats,

473
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,500
how do I add that in, again,
pulling in your threat team

474
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,500
to try to talk through that?

475
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,750
And then ultimately, it
comes down to efficiencies.

476
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,830
You know, what is the cost,

477
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:08,862
and what is a benefit
to my risk portfolio?

478
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,960
And so then the next capability,

479
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,160
I think is for me really important,

480
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:17,363
which is you know, I always think of,

481
00:22:17,363 --> 00:22:20,673
as it is and to be, when
I'm building up a program.

482
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:24,720
And so we need to take
(indistinct), as is look,

483
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,330
you know, and say, what
is our current risk radar?

484
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:32,010
What are our audit findings?

485
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:34,100
What do we need to fix?

486
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:38,998
And by moving to this new
architecture to this new paradigm

487
00:22:38,999 --> 00:22:42,410
what can I fix that I already know,

488
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:44,780
are challenges that I have?

489
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,850
And then where are we going?

490
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:47,949
Where's the business going?

491
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:49,260
Where is IT going?

492
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:51,293
What are our transformation goals?

493
00:22:52,528 --> 00:22:54,290
A classic one would be, you know,

494
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:56,030
we're trying to be cloud first,

495
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:59,820
or we want to go from web page

496
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,740
to application base,

497
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:03,979
you know, and move more
into the mobile app market.

498
00:23:03,979 --> 00:23:07,150
You know, where are things going?

499
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:09,453
Where is our cyber strategy headed?

500
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:13,219
And so as we think through
you know, this program,

501
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:15,830
we wanna understand all of those things.

502
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:18,919
'Cause it's easy to build
security not tied to the business,

503
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:23,570
it is vital that we go back to understand,

504
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:26,960
are we building out for the
business model we're headed to?

505
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,040
And then ultimately,

506
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:31,629
you got to look at your
technical depth, you know.

507
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:34,790
I've done that where I bought a capability

508
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:36,790
that solved one narrow problem,

509
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:41,430
I'm using 10% of the capability
of whatever I purchased,

510
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:44,673
you know, and I never
optimize it to use 90%.

511
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:47,800
And if I had use 90%

512
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,510
of three of the capabilities
that I did that with,

513
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:51,600
are there redundancies,

514
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,510
or I could get rid of
with other capabilities?

515
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:56,977
And so you know, really think you know,

516
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:59,370
and the worst thing you
could do is have a capability

517
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:02,400
wasn't up to date that would
have prevented a breach.

518
00:24:02,401 --> 00:24:04,518
'Cause now in the class action lawsuit,

519
00:24:04,518 --> 00:24:07,990
your due diligence isn't there.

520
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:09,740
And so these are just kind of concepts

521
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:12,210
that I think are
important to think through

522
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:14,490
and make sure that, you know,

523
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:17,890
our current risk, our technical
debt, and our strategy,

524
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:20,070
are all tied together,

525
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:22,320
so that the program we built

526
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,899
is ultimately gonna move us forward.

527
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:29,410
And so, you know, the next
thing I wanna cover is

528
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:32,210
really just kind of how
you're gonna do this.

529
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:34,710
How you're gonna accomplish this?

530
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:38,520
You know, we talked about all
those network capabilities

531
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,281
on the one side,

532
00:24:40,281 --> 00:24:44,079
we talked about all the securities
tools on the other side,

533
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:45,710
it's not like you don't have any of those,

534
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:48,480
it's not like you're not doing anything.

535
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,120
And so, to move into this,

536
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,620
you're not gonna walk
away from that investment.

537
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,679
And so you're not gonna do this in a year.

538
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,330
And even if you're moving into new like

539
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:59,300
let's say you're gonna move into cloud,

540
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,850
and you wanna do this,

541
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:03,379
you know perhaps you could do it then.

542
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,550
But even then,

543
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:07,680
you're not gonna find one
vendor that does all of this.

544
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:11,058
And so you're gonna have to
say what's most important?

545
00:25:11,058 --> 00:25:12,629
What do I wanna start with?

546
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:14,880
Maybe I start with a vendor
that has some of these

547
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,280
and is gonna move into
future capabilities.

548
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:21,010
But ultimately, you need to
pick a priority to do this.

549
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:23,180
And so without knowing what your you know,

550
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,920
your gaps and your challenges are,

551
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,430
or your business model
is, generally speaking,

552
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:29,580
this is kind of where you wanna start.

553
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,610
So the first thing would obviously be

554
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:35,122
you kind of wanna start
with this Zero Trust Model.

555
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,710
And you wanna go in
here and you wanna say,

556
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:41,060
okay, access is number one.

557
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:44,429
And so how are you gonna provision access

558
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:45,750
in a way that, you know,

559
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:49,070
if you're moving to location agnostic,

560
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:50,649
how are you gonna do it,

561
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:53,160
if people moving back into the office,

562
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,810
and they're still gonna
have more flexibility,

563
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:58,470
how are you gonna do that to
give them that flexibility

564
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:00,420
to be out of the office when they want?

565
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:05,520
But really, I think so many
of the compromises we've seen

566
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,720
are from, you know,
compromised credentials,

567
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:13,720
or people, you know, getting
in through some identity path.

568
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:17,020
And so, number one, Zero Trust.

569
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:20,533
Whatever model you're
going to, most important.

570
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:23,410
And the next thing I would
think through is, you know,

571
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:24,870
protecting that infrastructure.

572
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:28,449
Last year, we saw a huge
spike in both the volume

573
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:31,380
and complexity of DDoS attacks,

574
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:34,800
as well, as you know, attacks
against infrastructure,

575
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,820
extortion DDoS campaign,

576
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:39,610
one of the largest we've
had in the last five years.

577
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:43,780
So how are you gonna stop
that denial of service attacks

578
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:46,973
against your infrastructure,
or against your DNS?

579
00:26:48,222 --> 00:26:50,440
And then this also, you know,

580
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,130
talking about your infrastructure DNS

581
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:54,950
is where you go back and tie
in with your network folks?

582
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:56,010
How are you gonna optimize?

583
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:57,670
How are you gonna have a joyful experience

584
00:26:57,670 --> 00:27:00,393
for your customers and
your employees on this?

585
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:05,117
Next talk about CASB, you know.

586
00:27:05,117 --> 00:27:07,070
And this depends on how much

587
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:09,373
you're using that would require, you know,

588
00:27:09,373 --> 00:27:11,560
a SaaS, CASB solution.

589
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:15,510
If you're not heavily into this,
this would be deprioritize.

590
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:16,863
If this is where everything is,

591
00:27:16,863 --> 00:27:20,000
then this might move
up higher on the list.

592
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,310
Secure Web Gateway

593
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:25,300
just becoming more and
more and more important.

594
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:29,680
And this is, you know, preventing
those phishing attacks,

595
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:34,560
interrupting certain types
of ransomware attacks,

596
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:37,070
just so many areas

597
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:41,320
because of how your
employees are interacting.

598
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:46,320
And then firewall and web
application, or API protection.

599
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:47,680
And this is on the bottom of the list,

600
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,720
'cause you probably have this.

601
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,520
If you didn't have this,
it'll be number one.

602
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,750
And so over time, some of these you know,

603
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:58,250
we're just going to
replace it with an actual,

604
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:01,820
the natural contract expires.

605
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:04,580
Others we may, you
know, have a new concept

606
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:09,580
that we wanna move into just
things to think through.

607
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,500
But I would really take a look

608
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:15,692
at your overall prioritization
as you go through this.

609
00:28:15,692 --> 00:28:20,060
And again, I'm talking
about the security side,

610
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:23,760
you absolutely need to tie
back to the network team

611
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,580
and get their buy-in,

612
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:30,580
so that we can build together
and prioritize together.

613
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:37,379
So finally, I wanna spend
some time talking about

614
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:40,310
how to kind of tie all this together.

615
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:43,490
And so you need to sync with IT team,

616
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:44,990
if I haven't said that before.

617
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:49,890
you wanna figure out what the
mandated requirements are,

618
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:51,830
what models you wanna go through,

619
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:55,877
I've given you, you know, a
couple analyst frameworks,

620
00:28:55,877 --> 00:28:57,850
SASE tends the way it's written

621
00:28:57,850 --> 00:29:00,669
to be a little bit more
focused on protecting

622
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:03,250
the company and your employees.

623
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:05,900
But you can absolutely
expand those requirements

624
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:09,750
to protect your customers,
the web application firewall,

625
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,830
DDoS, a lot of the things you need to do

626
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:13,169
that are already in there.

627
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:15,470
You just need to expand the
scope and the requirements

628
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:17,499
to do that a little bit better.

629
00:29:17,499 --> 00:29:21,570
You know, tie in those
key stakeholders the risk,

630
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:23,320
you know, is the board gonna be involved

631
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,550
depending on how important this is.

632
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:27,300
Get those stakeholders buy-in,

633
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,280
understand what their requirements are,

634
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,562
privacy, legal, fraud,

635
00:29:32,468 --> 00:29:34,263
all those different stakeholders.

636
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:38,167
Look at your (indistinct) you know,

637
00:29:38,167 --> 00:29:40,659
what do you wanna get out of this

638
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:42,560
and what do you wanna solve with this?

639
00:29:45,722 --> 00:29:46,600
Get that all done.

640
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:50,100
You may wanna do an external
assessment of your plan,

641
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:52,860
or afterwards, ideally both.

642
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:55,652
And publish this, go out
and make this happen.

643
00:29:56,750 --> 00:30:01,610
And so with that, I wanna
thank you guys for being here,

644
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:03,389
give me some of your times.

645
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:06,403
Please continue your questions in chat.

646
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:09,600
I'll continue to answer those.

647
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,050
Reach out to me on LinkedIn
just say hey, you know,

648
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:15,580
I saw you on RSA talk
wanted to ask a question.

649
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,848
If you have something
you want in the future,

650
00:30:17,848 --> 00:30:20,220

651
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,630
But again, thanks for
giving me some of your time.

652
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:26,150
Thanks for sharing this journey with me,

653
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:29,310
and look forward to
meeting you in the future.
