1
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:05,160
- Hello there, I'm Vic Baines.

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,530
- And I'm Rik Ferguson.

3
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:08,930
And together, we're going to introduce you

4
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:11,020
to a different way of thinking

5
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:14,209
about futures and about threat prediction.

6
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:16,587
Talking about, "Project 2030:

7
00:00:16,587 --> 00:00:19,577
"Scenarios for the Future of Cybercrime."

8
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,959
So first, just a little bit about

9
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,290
what it is actually that
we're talking about.

10
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:28,119
What is, "Project 2030 Scenarios

11
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,170
for the Future of Cybercrime"?

12
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:31,660
Well, it's a white paper.

13
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:34,450
It's actually a white paper
that we are publishing today.

14
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:35,610
So, it'll be available

15
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:39,300
for you to download and
peruse at your leisure.

16
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,390
We aim to give individuals, enterprises,

17
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:45,880
and even nations, a reasoned
and rational indication

18
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,310
of a possible future.

19
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:50,990
Which should enable them
to devise a more nuanced,

20
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:53,510
long-term strategic direction.

21
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:56,390
The scenarios that we have
created are wide ranging,

22
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,310
and extremely diverse, so much so in fact

23
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:01,290
that we couldn't reasonably expect

24
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:04,420
to have set all of the predictions,

25
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:07,180
in one single real world nation.

26
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:08,730
So instead, what we've done,

27
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:11,300
is set them in the fictional nation state

28
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,250
of New San Joban.

29
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,910
What that does, is it gives us the scope,

30
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:19,200
to bring all our possible
futures together in one place.

31
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,760
The fictional New San Joban,

32
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,870
has many parallels in the real world,

33
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:26,840
for example, the digitally engaged

34
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,750
and very open Estonia,

35
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:31,050
who has been advocating digital identities

36
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:35,652
and e-residency and other
innovations since about 2014.

37
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:40,160
Also think of the highly
privacy minded legislation

38
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,880
of the European Union like GDPR,

39
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,179
and maybe the recent focus on let's say,

40
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,920
homegrown telecommunications
infrastructure projects

41
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,390
that we see in the US and
some others to name but a few.

42
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:56,450
So there are many parallels
for New San Joban in reality

43
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:00,120
but what we are describing
in the white paper,

44
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:04,230
is a future that while it is
plausible or even probable,

45
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:05,700
in many parts of the world,

46
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,930
it's not necessarily inevitable

47
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:10,373
or even possible in all of them.

48
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:14,000
- We should probably also
tell you a little bit

49
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,260
about the prehistory of "Project 2030".

50
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,940
The project has its origins

51
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,870
in an earlier scenario exercise,

52
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:27,870
that I led at Europol's
European Cybercrime Center, EC3.

53
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,400
Now, as the name suggests, "Project 2020"

54
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:36,220
set out to anticipate the
future of cybercrime, in 2020.

55
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:40,130
And we published a white paper in 2013,

56
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:43,530
in which we described how
technological developments,

57
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:47,400
could plausibly be incorporated
into people's lives,

58
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,547
into businesses, and to governments.

59
00:02:49,547 --> 00:02:52,960
And the possible threats
arising from those,

60
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,610
and the implications for
cybersecurity stakeholders

61
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:57,663
around the world.

62
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:02,930
So as soon as we arrived
at 2020 in real life,

63
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:05,150
Rik and the team at Trend Micro,

64
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:08,090
asked me to review how we did.

65
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:10,430
Although scenarios are not the same

66
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:12,950
as linear threat predictions,

67
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:15,859
in hindsight, the future
we described turned out

68
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:18,290
to be really quite accurate.

69
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:20,390
And in fact, the overwhelming majority

70
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:22,149
of the threats we envisaged,

71
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:26,600
were present in some
form at least by 2020.

72
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:31,600
You can read our full review
report, at 2020.trendmicro.com.

73
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,100
But in short, the results suggest that,

74
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:41,040
it is possible, to anticipate
the evolution of cybercrime

75
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,929
by mapping what we already
know about criminals

76
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:45,980
and other hostile actors,

77
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:50,100
against plausible developments
in emerging technologies.

78
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,290
And this means,

79
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:53,799
that as much as we would all agree,

80
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,940
that the future is indeed uncertain,

81
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:00,520
uncertainty is no longer a good reason,

82
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:04,563
for failing to prepare
for future cyber threats.

83
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:11,370
Now, projecting into the future
requires a starting point.

84
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:14,000
And following the same
methodology that we used,

85
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,540
for the earlier "Project 2020",

86
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,721
we conducted a baseline assessment

87
00:04:18,721 --> 00:04:21,690
of current cyber threats and enablers

88
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:26,690
and other key features of
the cybersecurity ecosystem.

89
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,610
I reviewed quite a lot
of analysis actually,

90
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:32,590
published by international organizations

91
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:35,580
like my old agency Europol,

92
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,400
Interpol and the United Nations.

93
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,729
And you'll be unsurprised to hear,

94
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:45,430
that in 2020, COVID related
cyber threats loomed quite large

95
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,860
in their assessments.

96
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,320
In addition to the more usual concerns

97
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,969
of state sponsored activities, APT,

98
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:56,623
financially motivated cyber
crime and other threats.

99
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,870
- I focused on baseline in the community,

100
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,110
that I am more familiar with,

101
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:04,840
which is the cybersecurity industry.

102
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,349
I am sure that many of
you are already painfully,

103
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,860
in some cases familiar with the annual,

104
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,580
cybersecurity predictions published

105
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:15,032
by many of the vendors in this space,

106
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,609
varying degrees of
relevance or helpfulness.

107
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:22,530
I think we all realize that
while some of them are doubtless

108
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,363
that stay,

109
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,040
guided, by the marketing

110
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,660
and the product roadmap
of the vendor in question,

111
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:31,940
they are also hopefully very often,

112
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:34,373
informed by a great depth of threat data,

113
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:38,210
industry expertise and research expertise,

114
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:41,049
in cyber criminal underground activity.

115
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:44,500
So, I attempted to sort out
this wheat from the chaff

116
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,710
when I was synthesizing

117
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:49,719
all of the 12 month horizon predictions,

118
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,370
for 2021, that had already been published

119
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:54,250
in December of last year

120
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,850
which is when we wrote these
sections of the report.

121
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:01,130
Because what I wanted to do,
was to come up with an idea

122
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:04,943
of where the weight of
industry agreement lay.

123
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:07,990
Obviously,

124
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:11,480
as with the research that
Vic previously mentioned,

125
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,810
a lot of this has, the 12
month horizon predictions,

126
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:18,070
has focused on the importance
of the rapid changes

127
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:21,343
to working practices, engendered
by the global pandemic.

128
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:26,969
The working from home, the
pushing of services into cloud

129
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,520
or rapid adoption expansion
of cloud technologies,

130
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,460
but also the mainstreaming
of emerging technologies

131
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,130
and the acceleration of effort,

132
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:36,719
and in some cases, cooperation,

133
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,380
between, organized criminal

134
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:42,053
and nation state cyber operations.

135
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,930
- So, once we established our baseline,

136
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:49,800
next we had to identify key
technological developments

137
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:54,480
and drivers of change towards
that timeline of 2030.

138
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,160
And we conducted
extensive horizon scanning

139
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:01,160
of hundreds of items of open source media,

140
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:05,890
academic research papers,
and technology patents.

141
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:08,469
So, working to that 2030 timeline,

142
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:11,220
we set ourselves the task of determining

143
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:15,010
whether each of these
technologies would be mainstream,

144
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:17,913
or still emerging in 2030.

145
00:07:19,185 --> 00:07:21,140
The COVID pandemic of course also,

146
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:24,810
put pay to running
in-person, expert workshops,

147
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:26,550
as we had for the previous projects.

148
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,640
So we had to test these timelines,

149
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,080
through an invite only survey,

150
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,580
of over 100 practitioners.

151
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:38,580
Most of whom work in
security or privacy fields.

152
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:42,330
Mapping these technological
developments in a single world,

153
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:46,349
allowed us to identify
linkages and interdependencies.

154
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:48,560
Also, barriers to adoption

155
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,590
and possible points of acceleration.

156
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:54,570
So essentially, it's a creative process,

157
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:58,680
but it's grounded in a
scientific methodology.

158
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,740
And already at this
stage, several key drivers

159
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:05,180
and impacts of technological
change became evident.

160
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,820
Including, greater automation,

161
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:12,120
expanded application of
Machine Learning and AI.

162
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,750
Data, as a supply chain component.

163
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:19,100
Cyber-physical convergence in humans,

164
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:23,030
as well as businesses and
critical infrastructure.

165
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:26,030
Advances in Neuro-Linguistic Programming,

166
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:28,700
and Generative Adversarial Networks

167
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,349
for synthetic humans.

168
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:34,940
Immersive environments enabled by AR, VR,

169
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:37,270
and similar technologies.

170
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:41,850
Additive manufacturing, in the
form of 3D and 4D printing,

171
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:42,683
and of course,

172
00:08:42,683 --> 00:08:46,050
proliferation of the
massive internet of things,

173
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:47,599
boosted by 5,

174
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,943
and 6G.

175
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:51,310
So,

176
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:54,040
how exactly, does that play out,

177
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:58,510
for the individual, in our vision of 2030?

178
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:03,060
Well, our individual, is
a woman called Risila.

179
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,550
Who lives with her kids,

180
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:08,359
in the fictional city
state of New San Joban.

181
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,460
And these are just a few of the features,

182
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:13,670
that you can see, of
her scenario narrative

183
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:16,473
which you can read in
full, in the white paper.

184
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,920
Risila works from home, and she plays now,

185
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:25,660
in the center of the city, in
what used to be office space.

186
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:29,219
Wearable technology
identifies her nutritional

187
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,880
and medical needs.

188
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,090
And this is aggregated
with other data sets held

189
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:38,293
by her healthcare fitness
and retail providers.

190
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,740
Those technologies have alerts,

191
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:45,340
that prompt investigations,
drug administration,

192
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:48,360
but also, measures aimed
at behavioral change,

193
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,810
such as making fatty foods

194
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:55,619
or alcohol invisible in
her online grocery store.

195
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,180
Additive manufacturing
is present in the home,

196
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:01,349
in the form of 3D printed food.

197
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:05,410
Immersive technology, is
used at work, at home,

198
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:07,000
and in school.

199
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,090
And even more so,

200
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:12,390
than in 2020, instant access
to the world's knowledge,

201
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:16,400
means that children no longer
need to learn anything.

202
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,620
Education is now focused on processing,

203
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,810
rather than acquiring knowledge.

204
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:26,270
Neural implants first used
for medical applications,

205
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:30,329
now progressed to recreational usage.

206
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,360
And digital selves that outlive

207
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,420
the death of the physical person,

208
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,540
have become more prevalent.

209
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:39,910
In the scenarios we've
called these infini-mes.

210
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:42,069
And while the first
generation of these beings,

211
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:45,730
tended to repeat a restricted
set of interactions

212
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:48,030
based on data that they had been fed

213
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:50,520
in the physical humans lifetime,

214
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:54,600
the latest versions in 2020, 2030

215
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,100
are self-learning.

216
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,380
And they're able to engage

217
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:00,870
in new experiences
based on physical humans

218
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:04,580
in their closest peer and interest groups.

219
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:08,710
So, increasingly, these
digital humans also have agency

220
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:12,830
particularly as the physical
and digital worlds combine.

221
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:17,720
They can engage in inappropriate
and even criminal behavior

222
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,150
and grieving relatives
are seeking legal remedies

223
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:23,959
to prevent loved ones being switched off,

224
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,717
or to ensure that they are.

225
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:30,620
- I'm already imagining
the security nightmare

226
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,557
of not only having to secure
your organization against

227
00:11:32,557 --> 00:11:34,490
all of the people that
currently work for you,

228
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:36,200
but in the possible future

229
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,010
of having to secure it
against all of the people

230
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:39,337
who have ever worked for you,

231
00:11:39,337 --> 00:11:42,090
and perhaps all of the
people who have ever lived.

232
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:45,960
So, really, it represents
like an exponential growth

233
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,933
of the challenge.

234
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:51,300
When it comes to enterprises,
we focused in this white paper

235
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,640
on a manufacturer,

236
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,010
and that's who Risila works for.

237
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:57,400
She works for a company called COLO,

238
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,030
Consolidated Rubber and Logistics.

239
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:01,640
They are a heavy manufacturer
with a 200 year heritage.

240
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:05,880
So, think something like
Michelin, for example.

241
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,290
Retooling their production lines

242
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:09,270
during the great pandemic of 2020,

243
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,670
brought the organization firmly

244
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,370
into the healthcare supply chain,

245
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:14,890
and their work on self-healing polymers,

246
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:16,980
sees them operating environments ranging

247
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,290
from the bottom of the ocean,

248
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:20,130
with telecoms cabling,

249
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:23,480
to the edges of the atmosphere
in satellite communications.

250
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,180
As such, they fall into
a recently enlarged,

251
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:28,810
and actually ever evolving classification

252
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,819
of critical national infrastructure

253
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:33,263
as a key supply chain manufacturer.

254
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:36,130
So, in addition to that,

255
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,780
monitoring of both this
supply chain, and also,

256
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:42,439
in-house enterprise operational
technology environments,

257
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,200
is now entirely digital,

258
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,720
and it's enabled through
largely private 5G networks.

259
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,403
Where, real time,

260
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:53,920
asset condition, maintenance
and hazard monitoring,

261
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,660
and associated operational intelligence,

262
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,589
is constantly delivered in real time

263
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:00,810
to digital twin infrastructure.

264
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:03,489
This means that production
could be streamlined,

265
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:05,280
and made more efficient.

266
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:08,400
And it also means that accurate
preventative maintenance

267
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:10,703
is enabled,

268
00:13:10,703 --> 00:13:12,829
and applied,

269
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:15,580
to preempt disasters or problems

270
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:18,770
that may happen in the workplace.

271
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:22,170
But it also means that it hugely
expands the attack surface.

272
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:25,599
In addition to the exposure
of tens of thousands

273
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,580
or hundreds of thousands

274
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:31,270
of connected devices,
sensors, services, actuators,

275
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:33,470
from a vulnerability perspective,

276
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:35,623
COLO also have to manage the,

277
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:40,260
also have to manage the
dynamic authentication,

278
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,840
and secure provisioning,

279
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,790
of machine to machine and
industrial internet of things,

280
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:48,650
and massive IOT devices in
highly sensitive environments

281
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:51,943
where no direct human
interaction is actually possible.

282
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:55,960
The 4D printing, that
Vic mentioned previously,

283
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:59,670
means that COLO now designs
and produces various products,

284
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:03,829
from heart stents or arterial stents,

285
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:05,350
for use inside the human body,

286
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:08,730
to flat packed items
for near space transit.

287
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:13,480
And 4D printing means that
these items are programmed

288
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,530
to change form or shape or function,

289
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:20,699
depending on external stimuli such as GPS.

290
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,060
So what this has done is
it's led to the merging

291
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:25,699
of traditional Dev Ops processes,

292
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,340
with the more industrial
and physical processes

293
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:30,070
involved in manufacture.

294
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:32,890
COLO calls this hybrid converter process,

295
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:35,133
Des Ops, Design Ops or Make Ops.

296
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,950
From a threat perspective,

297
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:40,330
of course intellectual property theft

298
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:43,810
remains a traditional concern
for manufacturers in 2030,

299
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:45,260
that hasn't gone away.

300
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,990
But as well as there's thriving market

301
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:49,300
for stolen intellectual property,

302
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,589
the possibilities of competitive sabotage,

303
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:54,850
by less scrupulous competitors
or even nation states,

304
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:57,080
means that data manipulation attacks

305
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,420
have become a rapidly growing issue.

306
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:02,270
With so much of the design
process now automated,

307
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:05,420
poisoning of data lakes
or of algorithms directly,

308
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:08,819
leads at best, to sub optimal functioning,

309
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,283
and at worst, to real physical harm.

310
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:17,140
- Now, if we're thinking
about this world of 2030

311
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,630
from the perspective of the States,

312
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:21,160
you can perhaps already guess,

313
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,150
at some of the preoccupations
of the government

314
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:29,150
of New San Joban or NSJ, as
Rik and I have come to call it.

315
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,560
NSJ is characterized as very much

316
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,760
at the forefront of tech
developments and adoption.

317
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,410
And given citizens apparent willingness

318
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:42,280
to aggregate data from different sources

319
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,150
to benefit their healths and wellbeing,

320
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:48,860
governments all over the
world in 2030 are continuing

321
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:53,860
to grapple with popular concerns
over surveillance, privacy,

322
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:58,010
and the notion of a
single digital identity

323
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:00,400
for government services.

324
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,220
In the government scenario narrative,

325
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:06,260
we highlight a positive
example of big data analysis

326
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:10,550
incentivizing good behavior
in a smart city context

327
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:14,130
but also, the potential
for unfair treatments

328
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:16,750
as a result of cross profiling.

329
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:21,750
And in this smartest of cities,
bans on single use plastics,

330
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:25,850
and fossil fuels, drive
integrated energy to energy,

331
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:29,343
and very innovative transport solutions.

332
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:34,140
NSJ is also, an entirely cashless society

333
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,560
with a national digital currency

334
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,770
that doesn't offer anonymity crucially.

335
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:44,220
And we trace the impacts of
that on criminal markets.

336
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:48,150
Now, the preoccupation with
infrastructure supply chains,

337
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:52,370
and techno nationalism, that
we've already seen in 2020,

338
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:55,610
that plays out differently
in different countries,

339
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:57,610
in the world of 2030.

340
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:59,670
With some countries able to benefit

341
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:03,069
from homegrown 5 and 6G components,

342
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:05,510
but others restricted to suppliers

343
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:09,740
from so-called approved countries.

344
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:10,599
Meanwhile,

345
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:13,699
measures aimed at curbing
foreign influence operations

346
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:17,010
by detecting faked or altered video,

347
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:19,800
are at odds with the public's acceptance

348
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,490
of AI generated contents,

349
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:25,530
and synthetic influences.

350
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:29,500
Influence operations are now
fully fledged conversations

351
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:33,320
which are all the more persuasive
in immersive environments,

352
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,879
in which data appears
before one's very eyes,

353
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,703
rather than on a screen at arms length.

354
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,500
As regards, international relations,

355
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:47,580
multilateral agreements against
the criminal misuse of IT,

356
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,939
do solve some problems,

357
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,910
but not others.

358
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:55,430
And in our 2030, the appropriate controls

359
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:58,130
for fully autonomous weapons systems,

360
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:01,900
are still being debated
and that creates a number

361
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:06,220
of loopholes in practical
terms in operations.

362
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:10,000
Finally, some of the biggest
uncertainties for the state,

363
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,990
concern data storage and processing power.

364
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:15,750
So we include as emerging, the practice

365
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:18,530
of data storage in DNA.

366
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:21,399
And while we deliberately
leave a question mark hanging

367
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:25,030
over the precise dates
of quantum decryption,

368
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:27,680
we highlight some of
the key considerations

369
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,383
for governments as that event nears.

370
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:35,500
- So, that's a brief look
at some of the things

371
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,940
we outline in the scenarios,

372
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,650
the three scenarios in the document.

373
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:42,820
But of course, one of the
major points of this exercise,

374
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,310
is to try and anticipate,

375
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:46,440
the criminal activities and opportunities

376
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,220
that arise out of this kind of society.

377
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:51,030
They fall into,

378
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:54,220
some very familiar general categories,

379
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:58,070
the kinds of criminal activities
that we have envisaged.

380
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:01,169
They revolve around unauthorized
access or intrusion,

381
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:04,940
unlawful interception of
communications or data transfer,

382
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:08,740
unauthorized exposure of
data, manipulation of data,

383
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,220
as I mentioned previously,

384
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,330
denial of service, we'll continue to see

385
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:14,240
and disruptive activity.

386
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,930
Misuse of processing power,
something we already see

387
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,370
in the cloud,

388
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:22,810
in 2020,

389
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:24,250
extortion of course,

390
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,520
that's never gonna go away.

391
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,040
And the growth in influence operations

392
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,943
that Vic was just talking about.

393
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,010
As is the case now,

394
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:34,030
a single cyber threat business model

395
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:36,399
may engage in a number
of these activities,

396
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,370
in sequence or even simultaneously

397
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:39,800
just as ransomware today,

398
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,483
using a double extortion,

399
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:45,240
tactic needs unauthorized access to data

400
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,130
and denial of service as leverage,

401
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:50,710
and also, secondary leverage,
in the form of the threat

402
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:52,330
to publish stolen data.

403
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:55,040
So, we will see that kind
of trend continue absolutely

404
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,149
through 2030.

405
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:56,983
Operating in

406
00:19:58,543 --> 00:20:01,332
multiple different threat scenarios.

407
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,330
One of the big differences
over the next decade

408
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:06,240
is that it promises to be one in which

409
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,950
repetitive operations
are much more automated

410
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:09,830
more than ever before,

411
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:12,350
and Machine Learning
advances to the extent

412
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:15,389
that all organizations,
in all sectors of society,

413
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:18,600
will make use of artificially
intelligent tools.

414
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,453
And this inevitably will
include threat actors.

415
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:24,580
In particular, I think
it's reasonable to assume

416
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:27,169
that highly automated reconnaissance,

417
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:29,450
target selection, penetration testing,

418
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:33,450
and delivery of pre-packaged
victims if you like,

419
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:37,330
to cybercriminals, will
absolutely be the norm,

420
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:39,600
and that they will seek to
maximize the effectiveness

421
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,750
and efficiency of their efforts

422
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:44,040
by using tools that are capable
of unsupervised learning.

423
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:48,050
So, really, a strong march
in the criminal adoption,

424
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:50,023
and innovation around Machine Learning.

425
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:54,490
AI powered attacks will
also inevitably be supported

426
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:57,580
by more advanced obfuscation techniques.

427
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:59,649
Also perhaps boosted by AI.

428
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:02,490
Self-learning fast flux tools
for evading data capture,

429
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:05,650
and attribution are actually
the logical evolution

430
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:07,743
of existing anonymizing services.

431
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,010
But as in the current debate

432
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:12,340
around AI powered cyber defense,

433
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:15,280
hands off cybercrime,
AI pallet cybercrime,

434
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,379
is likely to provide
unintended opportunities

435
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,990
for its disruption,

436
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:22,670
if its operations are
not entirely understood

437
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:25,093
by the people who are using those tools.

438
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,480
As Vic mentioned, in a world
where information is delivered

439
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,640
into citizens' immediate line of sight,

440
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,370
through heads up displays, or AR,

441
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:36,399
then data manipulation can be harnessed

442
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,366
for influence operations
and disinformation purposes,

443
00:21:40,366 --> 00:21:44,343
a huge evolution over what
we have seen in recent years.

444
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,610
Subsequent iterations of what we've called

445
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:51,120
algorithmic optimization, superseding SEO,

446
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,879
whether they're benevolent or malicious,

447
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,040
may have greater power
to alter belief systems.

448
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,020
And social engineering as a threat factor,

449
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,100
may likewise be harder to resist

450
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,939
in environments where the
immediacy of the experience,

451
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:05,050
will prompt quicker reactions,

452
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:07,040
and a reduction in critical distance

453
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,040
from the thing that you're experiencing.

454
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,340
In a truly massive internet
of things environment,

455
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:16,010
successful cyber attacks will
also result in disruption,

456
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:18,810
not only to manufacturing and logistics,

457
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:23,350
but also to transportation,
healthcare, education, retail

458
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:26,330
and the home environment, and many others.

459
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:29,260
In the context of the
additive manufacturing,

460
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:31,360
specifically 4D printing,

461
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,379
that we were speaking about,

462
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:34,500
disruption or denial of service to sensors

463
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:37,640
could result in products
not changing shape

464
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,493
or changing state as intended.

465
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:43,190
The 2030 envisaged in this
scenario narratives is one

466
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:46,160
in which, edge processing and analytics,

467
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:49,940
empower things to be self
rooting, and self altering.

468
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,610
In this future,

469
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:53,939
also one of increased self-learning

470
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,960
and autonomy for algorithms,

471
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,120
our current appreciation
of insider threats

472
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,419
may also need to evolve.

473
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,870
Currently understood to
refer to a human's risk

474
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:04,169
to an organization,

475
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:06,120
the insider threat of 2030,

476
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:09,033
could just as easily be
an object or an algorithm.

477
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,280
- In the white paper,

478
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,930
we have a dedicated section

479
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:18,930
about what this means for
cyber security stakeholders.

480
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,510
And in the first instance, of course,

481
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:22,420
that means that there will be changes

482
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:24,653
to the business of cybersecurity.

483
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:29,100
In a future of AI, cyber attack, defense

484
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,830
and incident response,

485
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:35,830
the role of humans will evolve
and it will have to evolve.

486
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:38,820
So, security professionals
will most likely focus on

487
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:42,560
strategy and policy setting,
performance, monitoring,

488
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:45,149
and explaining actions taken,

489
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:48,030
by automated, actors.

490
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:51,950
As one survey participant
who responded to us, remarks,

491
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:56,950
within five years, SOC analysts
will be data scientists.

492
00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:00,560
We envisage that it's
also a future of security

493
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:03,350
and identity on the edge.

494
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:05,899
Because a future of billions
of objects connected

495
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:09,830
to 5 and 6G, that massive
internet of things,

496
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:11,889
that Rik mentioned just now,

497
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:14,180
edge processing, edge analytics,

498
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:16,800
truly distributed cloud computing,

499
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,750
everything as a service,

500
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:23,360
demands an end to cybersecurity's
historical preoccupation

501
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:28,360
with perimeters and with
network-based protections.

502
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:30,370
The world in our scenario narratives

503
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:34,100
also contains greater
integration of digital identities

504
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,980
across devices and services.

505
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:41,710
Synthetic identities that do
not map to offline humans,

506
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:45,380
or to devices, and even more opportunities

507
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:47,800
for humans to alter their identities

508
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,693
according to the situation.

509
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:52,120
It's a future also,

510
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:55,689
in which we have embodied cyber security.

511
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:56,970
What do we mean by that?

512
00:24:56,970 --> 00:25:00,700
Well, the potential psychological
and emotional impacts

513
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,780
of threats and cyber enabled violence,

514
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:06,670
delivered via immersive technology,

515
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:09,710
may result in the information
security workforce

516
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:10,840
of tomorrow,

517
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,409
working more closely,

518
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:16,120
with mental health specialists,
on emergency response.

519
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:19,439
And similarly, information
security professionals

520
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,080
will be required to
investigate physical injuries,

521
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:26,879
and deaths involving
connected healthcare devices.

522
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,960
As another of our survey
participants put it,

523
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:34,423
cyber attacks will be about
losing humans not data.

524
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,950
At the same time, already in 2020,

525
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:42,580
we're seeing indications
that everything is cyber now.

526
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:45,510
Against the backdrop of
growing techno nationalism

527
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:48,140
and flexing of digital sovereignty,

528
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,940
information security professionals

529
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:52,660
can expect even closer scrutiny,

530
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:55,490
of their procurement
choices in the future.

531
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:57,770
And if we stay on the same trajectory,

532
00:25:57,770 --> 00:26:01,360
the trends of a techno nationalism
and digital sovereignty,

533
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,979
will pose challenges
to truly open markets,

534
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,690
and will remove forever,

535
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:09,793
the prospects of a truly global internet.

536
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,950
The scenarios also highlight the risk

537
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:16,360
of even greater technological disparity.

538
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,469
It's unrealistic in the extreme,

539
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:22,070
to assume that the advances
described in the narratives,

540
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:24,060
will be available to the same degree,

541
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,040
in all parts of the world.

542
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:29,240
Taking quantum computing
is just one example.

543
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,430
The world's largest technology companies

544
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:34,070
and the best resourced
research institutes,

545
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:36,010
are the pioneers in this space.

546
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:40,090
And are preparing to lease
quantum processing as a service.

547
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:43,310
So the balance of quantum
power will therefore be held

548
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:47,330
in a comparatively small number
of geographical locations,

549
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:49,580
where the potential trickle down,

550
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:51,379
to those who can afford it.

551
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:54,070
Raising the possibility
of even greater disparity

552
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:57,919
between the tech haves
and the tech have nots.

553
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,900
And such disparity would also manifest,

554
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:05,680
in an exacerbation of those
cyber security capacity gaps

555
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:08,133
that we already see in 2020.

556
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:12,280
Now, in recent years,
high profile data breaches

557
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,610
and privacy scandals,

558
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:16,510
have demonstrated the
global public's moral

559
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:19,610
and ethical expectations of tech.

560
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:21,449
And there's no reason to expect,

561
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:24,540
that the world's population
will be desensitized

562
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:27,520
to these issues in the coming decade.

563
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,070
On the contrary,

564
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:31,379
it's plausible that even greater emphasis

565
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:33,350
will be placed on technology,

566
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:37,679
including, that used by
information security professionals,

567
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,923
doing the right thing.

568
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,550
When it comes to minding
the regulatory gap,

569
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:48,149
the scenario narratives describe
the possibilities and risks

570
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:51,270
of a truly AI enabled life,

571
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:53,100
which will be more intrusive

572
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,469
by virtue of the sheer frequency,

573
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:57,840
and extent of its data gathering.

574
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,350
And this prompts the question,

575
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:02,459
of whether existing data
protection regimes will be fit

576
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,210
for this kind of future,

577
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:07,070
or whether additional
legislation will be required

578
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:11,060
to protect citizens from
ubiquitous surveillance.

579
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:13,820
The majority of our
survey participants agreed

580
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,030
with the statement,

581
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:19,190
that by 2030, countries
will launch cyber attacks

582
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:21,120
on each other by mistake,

583
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,310
and with no human intervention.

584
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:26,250
So that's something else
to be thinking about

585
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:28,163
and keeping us awake at nights.

586
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:30,740
And finally,

587
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:31,780
in 2020,

588
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:35,730
the accepted notions of
truth, trust and authenticity,

589
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:37,710
are already under threat.

590
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:41,910
The world of 2030, depicted
in our scenario narratives,

591
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:45,460
highlights the need to
introduce new measures,

592
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:49,170
to assist citizens in
distinguishing fact from fiction,

593
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:51,280
and honesty, from dishonesty.

594
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:55,240
So in short, scams will
be more compelling.

595
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:58,780
And it may be necessary to
make unprecedented efforts,

596
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:01,670
to improve citizens' critical thinking,

597
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:05,880
or at least to encourage
a post trust appreciation

598
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,460
of the truth.

599
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:10,260
Equally, technical authenticity tools,

600
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:12,883
could well become more important.

601
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,970
- So, what does that mean for you?

602
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:21,920
I know that it's a full on RSA tradition,

603
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,490
a requirement,

604
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:24,860
to have a,

605
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:26,070
what does this mean to you slide

606
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:26,990
at the end of the presentation.

607
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:29,050
So you can guess that we're
already very close to the end

608
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:30,000
because here it is.

609
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:35,770
The major point behind
this exercise, was to,

610
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:37,889
prepare and release a white paper,

611
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:39,170
a research document,

612
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:41,400
that would enable its audience,

613
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,950
that's you hopefully,

614
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:47,640
to elevate your planning horizons
beyond the next 12 months

615
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,920
or maybe beyond the
next two to three years,

616
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:54,430
to lift yourself out of a
constant firefighting mode

617
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:57,780
which unfortunately
seems to be the lot of,

618
00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:00,600
certainly cybersecurity
practitioners at the coalface,

619
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,310
and also of many CSOs that I speak to.

620
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:04,860
It seems to be a constant firefight,

621
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,669
particularly right now,

622
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:08,570
as behavioral patterns have changed,

623
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:09,500
as we've seen,

624
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:13,180
a move away from data center
centric usage patterns

625
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:15,740
to cloud usage patterns that I mentioned

626
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:18,630
had been accelerated by
this global pandemic,

627
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:20,810
and what the workplace has been changing.

628
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:25,169
We've been bringing work
devices into home networks,

629
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:26,640
like the one I'm sitting in right now

630
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,630
while I'm talking to you,

631
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:29,270
and finding new ways to do business,

632
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:31,030
new ways to communicate.

633
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:34,570
And so that it means
that security response is

634
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:36,120
in this constant firefighting mode.

635
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:39,909
What we want to help you achieve
through this white paper,

636
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:41,470
is to,

637
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:43,440
maybe put a framework

638
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,440
around the coming next
10 years of technology.

639
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:49,270
Obviously we don't intend to
be able to predict everything,

640
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:51,600
but certainly the white
paper is extensive,

641
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,060
and we hope that it offers you,

642
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:55,270
at least a framework that you can begin

643
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:58,129
to hang a longterm plan on of,

644
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:00,260
which technology areas are worthy

645
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,920
of more strategic investment,

646
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,680
which require further planning,

647
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,200
and maybe even areas where you
don't need to focus as much

648
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,850
that you perhaps thought you did.

649
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:12,290
So, the report is there
for you to read through,

650
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:15,270
to digest, to extrapolate
from, to work out,

651
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:18,270
which is going to affect
you in your industry,

652
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:20,200
and your customer base.

653
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,580
We would encourage you also,
to join the conversation

654
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:25,000
with the hashtag Project 2030.

655
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:30,000
There's plenty more coming
this year from Project 2030.

656
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:35,070
And we hope to engage all of
you, in a community discussion,

657
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:36,506
of the points raised in the document,

658
00:31:36,507 --> 00:31:37,790
and of course, many points

659
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:39,810
that we probably never even considered,

660
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:42,010
that you bring valid and valuable input

661
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:43,610
from your own industries.

662
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:46,870
So, follow the hashtag, take
part, join the conversation,

663
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:49,469
and look out for much more content coming,

664
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:52,063
that we will share with
you in the coming months.

665
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,080
I wanna thank you all,

666
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,530
on behalf of myself and Vic,

667
00:31:57,530 --> 00:32:00,129
for joining us in this presentation.

668
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:01,870
I'm only sad that we
couldn't do it in person,

669
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:04,399
but I'm sure we all feel
the same way about that.

670
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,270
I hope that we've been
able to hit your questions

671
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:09,290
as we've been going through the chat.

672
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:11,240
If any further questions do come up,

673
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,870
that maybe you didn't wanna ask in public,

674
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:15,469
or they occur to you after the event,

675
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:18,240
you can reach out to either
Vic or myself or both of us

676
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,133
on Twitter.

677
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:23,860
She is CyberBaines, and I am Rik_Ferguson,

678
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:24,990
or grab us on LinkedIn,

679
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:27,690
or whatever your social
network of choice may be.

680
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:30,870
And we are here to have
a conversation with you

681
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:34,320
and to learn from you as we
hope that you can learn from us.

682
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,080
And again, thank you very much

683
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,830
for joining our presentation today.
