1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,889
- Empty airports, closed borders.

2
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:06,920
Zero traffic jams locked up Schools,

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:10,580
exhausted healthcare
workers, remote everything.

4
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:13,720
Working, shopping, and conferences.

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,100
The COVID-19 pandemic showed us

6
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,340
that some truths are truly universal.

7
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:21,220
But while there was so
much, that was similar

8
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:22,970
about the human experience.

9
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:24,830
Where you found yourself living in Austria

10
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:29,110
had a massive impact on how
you tackle the pandemic.

11
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:32,000
Allie and I are here
today because we believe

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,800
that our geographic nuances,
need to be considered.

13
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,050
So that we can better prepare ourselves

14
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:41,620
for a future that is completely disrupted.

15
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:44,643
And so we can be more
resilient to future crisis.

16
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:48,060
- Hi everyone.

17
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:50,300
It's a pleasure to be here with you today.

18
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,620
My name is Allie Mellen.

19
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:55,260
I'm an analyst on the security
and risk team at Forrester.

20
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:58,269
I cover security operations,
which includes the people

21
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:00,723
processes and technology in the SOCK.

22
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,580
- And hi everyone, I'm Kerissa Varma.

23
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:07,010
I'm the group chief
information security officer

24
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:09,450
at one of the largest African insurers.

25
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:10,283
We have a footprint

26
00:01:10,283 --> 00:01:13,430
across 13 African countries
and a small footprint in China.

27
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:15,280
And I'm so excited to be here

28
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,130
because I think the context
of Africa is going to help all

29
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:20,179
of you sitting out there listening to us.

30
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,520
So this is a picture of kya sands

31
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,830
and they often to say that a
picture says a thousand words.

32
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:31,763
It's really true about this picture.

33
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:35,790
kya sands is an informal
settlement in the country.

34
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:37,943
I call home South Africa.

35
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,400
And, on this picture
you can see on the left

36
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,300
houses with manicured gardens,

37
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:49,530
swimming pools and lush green vegetation.

38
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:53,030
On the right, what you see
is informal settlements.

39
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:56,470
They 10 houses closely put together

40
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:58,483
with very limited infrastructure.

41
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:02,500
How people on the left and
the right of this picture

42
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:07,290
experienced the crisis in
2020 is completely different.

43
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:09,880
The people on the left had mobile connect,

44
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:13,799
had fiber connectivity to
their homes, which means

45
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,090
that they were able to
work remotely a lot easier.

46
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:20,020
The people on the right had
sketchy mobile connectivity

47
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,740
at best which means
just doing their day job

48
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:25,570
from their homes when people
started working remotely

49
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:27,840
was extremely difficult.

50
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,250
The people on the left could quarantine

51
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:34,223
in a room when they were
unwell, keeping the family safe.

52
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:38,580
The people on the nights
had one multi-purpose room

53
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,900
with numerous people using it

54
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:44,883
and quarantining to save
the family was impossible.

55
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:50,750
The children on the left
was able to equip themselves

56
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,780
to school remotely.

57
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:57,413
They were, to able to still
have an education last year.

58
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,420
The people on the right,
their children were forced

59
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:04,593
to forego school for a
large period of time.

60
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:08,399
If you consider the differences

61
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,010
between one streat in one country

62
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:15,120
in this enormous world that we live in,

63
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,040
the differences in human experience

64
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,563
are absolutely phenomenal.

65
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:22,859
If we had to extrapolate
this across the globe

66
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,450
we can understand that how, even

67
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:28,730
though we all experienced
the same pandemic last year

68
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:32,023
the experience for each of
us was completely different.

69
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:34,810
Allie, and I believe

70
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:38,630
that understanding this
differences will make us stronger

71
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:41,500
to future challenges,
that may be unexpected

72
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,850
in our geographies, but so critical

73
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:46,662
for us to understand
now, before they happen.

74
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,620
- When I first met Kerissa
and I had a chance to speak

75
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,590
with her about her work as a CSO.

76
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,420
It helped me come to terms

77
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:00,000
with the massive disparity
in resources between IT

78
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,020
and security in a place where
I live like the United States,

79
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:05,740
and a place where she
lives like South Africa.

80
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:08,930
One thing that United
us though, was this now

81
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:12,700
over a year long pandemic
that continues to isolate us

82
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,540
and cause people around the world pain

83
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,670
and in some cases, sadness.

84
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:19,730
Yet we experienced it
very, very differently.

85
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:22,680
And it can be really
challenging to understand just

86
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,310
how differently we experienced it.

87
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:27,180
That's why Kerissa and I came together

88
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,000
for this presentation to show
each other and all of you

89
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,700
how our experience is deferred

90
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:36,250
as we navigated enterprise
security in a global pandemic.

91
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:40,340
So bear with us as we take
you back through some memories

92
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:43,282
from the past year, hopefully
it'll be a little cathartic.

93
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:47,940
- And I think before we
delve into the differences

94
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:51,190
and similarities of how
we manage this crisis

95
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,770
many of you may not be exposed to Africa.

96
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:56,130
So this video shows you a little taste

97
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,790
of Africa and the potential

98
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:00,880
and the opportunity on
the African continent.

99
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,546
(upbeat music)

100
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,169
- So that video is an awesome primer

101
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:39,390
for what we're gonna talk about today.

102
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:41,130
We're gonna start off with the first phase

103
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:43,900
of the pandemic, the investigation phase.

104
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,130
Before jumping into the acceleration

105
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:49,040
when things started to really
get a lot more intense.

106
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,430
Then we're gonna jump
into what is hopefully

107
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,280
a continued deceleration

108
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,869
before digging into what
lessons is on resilience.

109
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:59,460
We can take away from this experience.

110
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,739
What's most important to note here,

111
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:04,560
is that regardless of your
resources or your team

112
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,160
you don't get to decide when
you have to be resilient.

113
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,963
You just have to go ahead and
have the courage to do it.

114
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:15,900
So before we dive in

115
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,479
I wanna level set on some background.

116
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,160
These charts are meant to
show how prepared different

117
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,260
countries were leading up to the pandemic.

118
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:28,380
On the left, you can see that
two factors are at play here.

119
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:31,830
The robustness of the
digital platforms they use

120
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:32,849
and the resilience

121
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:36,010
of the internet infrastructure
to traffic surges.

122
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:38,070
Places like South Africa are high

123
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:40,530
on the resilience of
internet infrastructure.

124
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:44,349
But dramatically low on
robustness of digital platforms.

125
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:45,540
Surprisingly countries

126
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:48,370
like Sweden have robust digital platforms

127
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:50,270
but struggle from a low resilience

128
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:53,570
of internet infrastructure
to traffic searches.

129
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:57,469
The U.S., UK, Singapore
and Germany in contrast

130
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:01,730
are high on both scales,
which is to be expected.

131
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:04,090
Importantly, there's a third dimension.

132
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:05,979
That's not really mentioned here

133
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:09,300
which is all the physical
aspects of working remotely

134
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,830
like having access to
clean water, having access

135
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:15,823
to wifi laptops and other
resource requirements.

136
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,200
- That's so true, Allie.

137
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,690
And the slide on, the graph on the right

138
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:26,520
talks about the ability
to actually tend to work.

139
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,810
And if you look at the Subsaharan Africa

140
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:31,040
and just compare that to living in Europe

141
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,669
or living in Subsaharan
Africa, there's a huge impact.

142
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:37,329
It becomes very obvious
that even though once again

143
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:40,250
we all went remote, we all
started working remotely

144
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,200
but effected the way
you lived in the world

145
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,770
was a huge differentiator as
to how you were able to perform

146
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:47,593
in your work and your daily duties.

147
00:08:48,934 --> 00:08:51,839
And, as we can see on the graph

148
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,080
whether you lived in Europe
or you lived in South Africa

149
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,250
it made a very big difference

150
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,800
as to what you were able to do.

151
00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:03,090
- Absolutely, so, let's
take a step back in time.

152
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,040
For those outside of China

153
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:09,810
January, 2020 showed that
COVID was not even really yet

154
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:12,829
a priority taking this
way back to the beginning

155
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:13,663
of the year.

156
00:09:13,663 --> 00:09:17,670
The focus was on Boeing airplanes
and U.S. Iran relations.

157
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:20,959
With COVID really being
just a mysterious outbreak.

158
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:25,270
Only one confirmed case was
in the U.S. by January 21st.

159
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:27,300
We are still going to the office.

160
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,729
Most of us were actually
getting for re getting ready

161
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:32,770
for RSA conference in San Francisco.

162
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:36,010
And while hindsight is 2020,
if you'll pardon the pun.

163
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:38,490
It's worth noting that
business continuity plans

164
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:40,600
and disaster recovery
plans should have been

165
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,300
in place already at this point.

166
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,839
Not to prepare for COVID

167
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,810
but just to really be prepared in general.

168
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:50,359
To give some numbers on this
40% of enterprises surveyed

169
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:54,030
had no business continuity plan
in place before the pandemic

170
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:58,420
and that's across North America,
Europe and Asia Pacific.

171
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:01,010
As early as the end of
January, my colleagues

172
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:03,210
at Forrester were starting calls for work

173
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:04,220
from home planning

174
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,583
and it was really critical
even that early on.

175
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:16,189
Now catapulting us into late February.

176
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:18,350
We're seeing more concerns over COVID

177
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:20,860
in the United States and globally.

178
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:24,140
January 31st marked the WHO listing COVID

179
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:26,790
as a global health emergency.

180
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:30,030
Traveled to and from China had
been dramatically restricted

181
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,600
by the Trump administration.

182
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,890
And in a few short
weeks, travel from Europe

183
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:34,903
would be as well.

184
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:39,140
Some of us like myself,
chose to go to RSA conference

185
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:44,069
in person anyway, and boy, do
I look back on those pictures

186
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:45,323
with total shock.

187
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:50,210
Verizon ACNC and IBM pulled
out of the conference.

188
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:53,410
And that's where we started
to see some organizations

189
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:56,329
in the U.S. building their
business continuity plans

190
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:57,440
or updating them.

191
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,670
It really didn't start to
happen until those restrictions

192
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:03,050
started to prevent executive travel.

193
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:05,420
Once large organizations
were really pulling out

194
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:08,750
of conferences, that's where
organizations started to

195
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,920
find alternate means of communication.

196
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,930
But keep in mind things are
still really early here.

197
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:18,589
And for many there's
little to no expectation

198
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:20,450
that we would really end up

199
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:23,150
in a Countrywide lockdown in weeks.

200
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:25,750
Italy didn't even Institute its first

201
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,480
infamous lockdown until March 9th of 2020,

202
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,983
which was far after RSA
conference ended by comparison.

203
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:38,160
By March, things are
starting to pick up pace.

204
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,896
Israel starts its first set of
social distancing procedures.

205
00:11:40,896 --> 00:11:44,560
And by March 13th COVID is
declared a national emergency

206
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,819
in the U.S.

207
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,830
On the 15th Puerto Rico put forth

208
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:51,510
the stay at home order followed
by California on the 19th.

209
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:54,670
Which was then followed
by a slew of other States.

210
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:57,160
on the 23rd Boris Johnson made a statement

211
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,530
regarding lockdowns in the UK.

212
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:01,900
And this led to really a push

213
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:05,120
for all non-essential workers
to start working from home.

214
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,260
Forcing security teams to take
on a lot of IT related tasks

215
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,590
due to this sudden change.

216
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:12,870
Security teams in places

217
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,890
with a more resilient infrastructure

218
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:17,750
focused on a few key, extremely tactical

219
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,660
things in the moment.

220
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:20,910
They were figuring out who could work

221
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:23,130
from home and who needed
to be in the office.

222
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:25,620
They were balancing who
should have admin privileges

223
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,240
which was a big issue at the time

224
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,570
because you need to get
everyone working remotely

225
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:32,480
but still able to access
the files they need.

226
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,930
We're talking about how to
secure the physical office

227
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:36,380
with limited staff there.

228
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:39,870
And supplying the workforce
with equipment like laptops

229
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:42,630
VPNs and cloud-based collaboration tools.

230
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:44,950
In some cases, this was fairly easy

231
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:48,960
by comparison because we'd
already been working from home.

232
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,840
But in other places, this was not as easy

233
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,093
including some parts
of the U.S. and the UK.

234
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:59,219
It's really a storm of
security teams helping IT

235
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,280
which leaves little time to react

236
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,600
and respond to the threats
that are happening.

237
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,130
But keep in mind, COVID scams are massive.

238
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:11,930
Even this early on from just
January to July of that year

239
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:14,709
over 11 million Sterling pounds was lost

240
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:17,130
due to COVID related scams.

241
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,370
Kerissa, can you dive
into how March looked

242
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:21,233
from a South African point of view?

243
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,290
- Yeah, sure, Allie

244
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:26,110
and the reason I've been quiet
between January and February,

245
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:28,050
is actually between January and February

246
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:30,400
nothing was happening on
the African continent.

247
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,600
We were all standing by
watching the rest of the world

248
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,840
go through this pandemic and hoping

249
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,980
and praying really that it
didn't come to our shores.

250
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:41,610
In fact, for the majority
of March, we even,

251
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:43,840
didn't see a mass cases or dates.

252
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,630
We saw our first case
towards the middle of March.

253
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:50,430
And I really believe that
that period of us watching

254
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:54,449
and experiencing and
learning caused us to get

255
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:57,940
to a lot quicker action in March
when we actually needed to.

256
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,840
Because we had to, we were able to then

257
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,890
base what we did have
some solid experience

258
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:04,960
in Europe and the us to be able to say

259
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,850
these are the strategies that and worked.

260
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:09,000
And these are the
strategies that did work.

261
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:12,660
We, so we looked at the
trajectory of the virus

262
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:17,090
own mutual has a small business in China.

263
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,830
So our teams were actually collaborating

264
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:20,670
with people in China to
say, what did that look

265
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:24,060
like when it first happens and
how should we have responded?

266
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:26,579
And so that knowledge and
context really helped us

267
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:29,670
in March to be able to
springboard in to actions.

268
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:31,863
What was really surprising Allie was that,

269
00:14:33,055 --> 00:14:35,089
in certain African countries

270
00:14:36,235 --> 00:14:38,070
there were multiple crises happening.

271
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:41,610
The entire world was
talking about COVID-19.

272
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:44,620
But if I take some Zimbabwe as an example.

273
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:47,203
In March last year, Zimbabwe is,

274
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,680
was having a massive economic crisis.

275
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,609
They were through hyper inflation.

276
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:56,060
So when the whole world was
talking about, the COVID crisis

277
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:58,810
and yet Zimbabwe are very
worried about COVID as well.

278
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:03,780
There was a 680% annual inflation rate

279
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,453
in March last year in Zimbabwe.

280
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:09,189
That alone while governments
were opening a purse strings

281
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:12,030
and trying to get more
money into the healthcare.

282
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,209
And trying to get more money

283
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:16,340
into systems to support
them during this pandemic.

284
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:19,200
You can imagine what,
just that two dynamics

285
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:24,200
of having a crushing economy
with 680% inflation does

286
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:27,830
to your ability to respond,
but it didn't end there.

287
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:30,110
I mean, Zimbabwe had just come out of

288
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:34,920
a year off massive drought,
2019 was a horrible year

289
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,760
for Zimbabwe, from a water perspective.

290
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,470
And you can imagine
what that dynamic looked

291
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:41,530
like when you're telling people sanitize

292
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:43,680
and wash your hands,
but there is no water.

293
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:48,372
And, rolling power outages, is something

294
00:15:48,372 --> 00:15:51,120
that's quite common across
the African continent.

295
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,070
And we've actually, started
to be, it's become normal.

296
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:57,120
In Zimbabwe, at that point in March

297
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,853
they were having two to three
days without power in homes.

298
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:04,490
And so you can imagine
when you asking hospitals

299
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:05,680
to keep people safe.

300
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,329
You asking people to,
sanitize and wash their hands.

301
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:11,490
And you asking a government
to actually respond

302
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:14,940
to a crisis that needs investment.

303
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,433
Zimbabwe had almost a perfect storm.

304
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:21,500
But if you look at the results
of what happened in Zimbabwe

305
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,210
and actually across the rest
of the African continent

306
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:28,010
the impact of COVID-19
was not as severely felt

307
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:29,930
as it was in Europe, and the U.S.

308
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:31,380
And so you got to kind of ask yourself

309
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:34,280
so with all of this
dynamic happening in Africa

310
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,930
how is it possible that
our death rate is lower?

311
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:38,430
That our infection rate is lower?

312
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:40,040
But our population is higher.

313
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,550
So it really doesn't make much sense.

314
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:43,859
And in thinking about it

315
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:46,390
I think there's two things
that attribute to this.

316
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:48,300
I think the first one is, like I said,

317
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,439
we learned from others.

318
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,710
But we didn't just learn from others.

319
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:51,923
We took action quickly.

320
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:55,360
We were very decisive about lockdown

321
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,285
getting people out off of
communal areas, both Kenya

322
00:16:59,285 --> 00:17:03,110
and South Africa, for example,
went into complete lockdown

323
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:05,119
before the first death in the country.

324
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,760
And, I mean, I'm talking
about closing borders

325
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,180
closing schools, everyone in their homes

326
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:14,609
other than going out
for medical care or food

327
00:17:14,609 --> 00:17:16,439
you were not allowed to leave your home.

328
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:19,050
So we took that drastic action upfront

329
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:23,290
to be able to respond, very
quickly and very decisively.

330
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:24,123
And I think it was based

331
00:17:24,123 --> 00:17:26,069
on learnings from elsewhere in the world,

332
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:27,980
but also based on the
policy that we had said,

333
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,040
where we were gonna be,
we were gonna put life

334
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,110
in front of everything else.

335
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:34,750
And I think the second thing that

336
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:37,520
that was really, a blessing to us

337
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,504
I guess in disguise was the fact that,

338
00:17:40,504 --> 00:17:45,504
our population had had two to three months

339
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,723
of priming of media, of how bad COVID was.

340
00:17:51,116 --> 00:17:53,067
We had seen what was happening in Italy.

341
00:17:53,067 --> 00:17:55,984
We had seen what was happening in the U.S.

342
00:17:55,984 --> 00:17:59,460
and we we'd heard the doctors say.

343
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:04,460
they can't cope and understanding
our own healthcare systems

344
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:07,490
and the fragility of our
own healthcare systems

345
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:10,030
and realizing that countries
that have better infrastructure

346
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:12,590
than us we're fearing so badly.

347
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:15,129
We knew that if this
pandemic took hold in Africa

348
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:18,470
it would be very difficult,
to get rid of it.

349
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:20,120
And all through the year, last year

350
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,879
there were all these news
articles that said like Africa's

351
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,730
such a mystery.

352
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:24,563
Why is it?

353
00:18:24,563 --> 00:18:26,840
Cause, if COVID gets into Africa

354
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,689
and, it's the end of everything,
but it never happened.

355
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:33,390
It just, in South Africa
it got quite, quite bad

356
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:37,500
but not in comparison, to other
markets like U.S. and Europe

357
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,880
not as bad as that.

358
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,830
But the rest of the African continent,

359
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:42,342
it wasn't, very bad at all.

360
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:45,040
And I think it's really that quick action

361
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,973
and that fear that actually
drove the right behavior,

362
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,253
amongst a lot of our people.

363
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,690
But Allie what was happening in

364
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:56,833
in Europe, and in the U.S. in March?

365
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,730
- Yeah, it was a lot of
just making that transition.

366
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:04,210
It's it honestly, I'm
baffled by what you said.

367
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:06,230
Cause it's hard to imagine a world where

368
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,840
you don't have access to clean water

369
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,620
but you're being told to wash your hands.

370
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:14,149
So, I can't it's pretty
shocking and pretty unbelievable

371
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:17,850
that Africa was really able
to keep the case count so low.

372
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:19,449
Exactly like what you're saying.

373
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,130
But once we, at least
in the U.S. and Europe

374
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:26,330
once we started to reach
April, that was where

375
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:29,639
we really saw the true
impact of the pandemic.

376
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,770
New York was deploying mobile morgues

377
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,800
because of the overwhelming
hospital deaths,

378
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,070
which was just horrifying

379
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:37,270
and something that you really
don't think you'll ever see

380
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:38,260
in the United States.

381
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:41,000
And parents were really
struggling to balance work

382
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,463
with their kids' schoolwork.

383
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:47,690
Security teams were facing a
lot of challenges in April.

384
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:50,670
A lot related to they had a month-ish

385
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:51,770
to get everyone settled.

386
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:55,000
But in some cases, employee
training is still required.

387
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,620
There's a shortage of laptops.

388
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,669
Those who have a little bit of experience

389
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:02,210
with remote work were
able to move on to some

390
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:06,700
of the more focused security
issues like supporting teams

391
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,580
getting ramped up with technology.

392
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,990
Assessing whether like
what risks were possible

393
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:14,980
due to add homework and
protecting the confidentiality

394
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:18,770
and tech and availability
of data of course.

395
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:23,300
And then also working with the
C-suite on chain of command

396
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:26,440
for what happens when
someone actually gets COVID.

397
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,900
Particularly in the context
of incident response

398
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:32,010
and how to prepare for
those types of situations.

399
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:35,540
In addition, you're seeing
such a massive uptick

400
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:38,580
in consumer web traffic,
that it was really

401
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:41,770
important to enhance
web facing threat Intel

402
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:43,150
so that we could really have a focus

403
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:47,750
on what threats were potentially
coming in from online.

404
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:50,660
So in some organizations,
the stress was really

405
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:54,750
starting to shift to some more
real security related issues

406
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:58,570
instead of let's just get
everyone a laptop and train them

407
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:00,919
but there is still a lot of challenges.

408
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,740
And like I said, for some
of them, they're still

409
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,763
kind of stuck in that March timeframe.

410
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:09,890
At the same time like WHO was
reporting a five fold increase

411
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:12,463
in cyber attacks, which is just it's wild.

412
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:17,730
How about you Kerissa?

413
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:20,270
- Yeah, I think, you know,
what as much sort of linked

414
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:23,760
into April, we were
experiencing some of the same.

415
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,320
And I think that I'll just
double click on two nuances.

416
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:32,320
I think, a lot of our technology partners

417
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:36,129
sit outside of Africa so in the East

418
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:38,440
or in Europe or the U.S.

419
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:42,450
And so supply chain risk just
became extremely real to us.

420
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:45,100
As we were starting to get all

421
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,689
of our people out the out
the door to work remotely

422
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:51,763
it was just impossible to
get equipment into Africa.

423
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,800
And so we had to work very creatively.

424
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,710
I mean, we, I remember buying laptops

425
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:59,803
in Kenya to be able to send to Zimbabwe.

426
00:22:00,875 --> 00:22:03,490
And we just used, very innovative means to

427
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:07,180
be able to get all our people
out there safely out the door.

428
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,920
And so that's supply chain scenario

429
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:13,560
and rightly so people
were prioritizing PPE

430
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,030
and health equipment

431
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:17,720
but they will offloading
all your VPN equipment

432
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,630
and all your laptops

433
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:21,390
because they needed to
prioritize life and likely.

434
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:25,800
So, but that created this huge bottleneck

435
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,450
that we really had to work around.

436
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:29,730
We were very successful
in working around it

437
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:30,720
as a group.

438
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,390
But, I do fear that smaller
entities that are localized

439
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:37,003
in one area in Africa
may not have fit as well.

440
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:40,200
And underlying that the
slide is something that I

441
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,630
think is quite unique to Africa.

442
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:45,160
I spoke earlier about those
homes that are actually

443
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,650
one room where you can't quarantine.

444
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:49,140
You can't actually separate yourself

445
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:50,700
from your family and your
kitchen is a bedroom.

446
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,390
It's your lounge, everything,
all of your living there.

447
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:55,720
You can't quarantine safety in that.

448
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:59,300
And so this is actually an
old mutual learning facility

449
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:03,090
that we've redone to actually
be a quarantine facility.

450
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,889
So people leave their families,

451
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:08,290
they go into one of these
facilities, they are able to

452
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:10,530
you can see the beads of
space apart from each other.

453
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:13,110
And they're able to actually safely live

454
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:15,620
in a proximity that
doesn't infect anyone else

455
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:16,729
in their homes.

456
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:19,040
And so that's the two nuances
that we saw happening,

457
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,730
in March and April, there Allie.

458
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:24,270
- Wow, it's fascinating.

459
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:27,020
The supply chain risk
is really interesting

460
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:28,100
of course, obviously, because

461
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,230
of what happens later in the year.

462
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:34,230
But also I know from, from
like the U.S. and Europe side

463
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:36,389
there were a lot of
conversations happening

464
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:38,300
about how do we maintain security

465
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,030
while everyone is going remote.

466
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:43,520
Because now that that's happening,
it's putting some strain

467
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,150
on customer expectations, around security

468
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:48,240
that we may have contracts
that we've agreed to,

469
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,410
but are going to struggle to
uphold in the first few months.

470
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:52,430
So it's that transition.

471
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:54,040
So very fascinating.

472
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,940
There's a lot of nuance there I think.

473
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:01,870
So one thing that's
really important to note

474
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:04,689
during this whole process
is that there's constant

475
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:06,780
conversation happening about

476
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,810
when employees can return to work.

477
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:11,820
In, this seems laughable now,

478
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:15,840
but in June of 2020 senior
executives predicted that 50%

479
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,480
of their employees or
more would be coming back

480
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,400
to workplaces by September of that year.

481
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,400
Obviously that didn't happen

482
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,050
but it's something that
security teams had to deal with

483
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:28,970
intermittently trying to
prepare for this potential

484
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:31,270
trying to prepare for the stray employee

485
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,760
who's going into the office.

486
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:36,490
And we really had to consider
what critical personnel

487
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:38,540
from a security perspective
needed to be there

488
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,909
to support those employees coming in.

489
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:43,020
What potential threats
could people be bringing

490
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,480
in back to the office, either

491
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,960
with their work laptops or with
any bring your own devices.

492
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,960
And then of course, the
potential third party risks

493
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:55,220
again from partners who are
moving back into the office,

494
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:57,510
and how they're handling their situation

495
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:59,230
considering our supply chain risks.

496
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:02,700
As well as maintaining the actual security

497
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:05,360
of the physical enterprise,
which would now again

498
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,270
be changing back as people
start to move into the office.

499
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:11,590
So there's this back and
forth kind of tugging war

500
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:13,020
between what are we gonna do?

501
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,379
Well, in reality

502
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:17,040
we're still facing so many
threats every single day

503
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,773
so many more than usual but all remote.

504
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,689
And around this time as well,

505
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:28,510
we're seeing a truly
devastating and dramatic uptick

506
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:30,990
in ransomware attacks, targeting hospitals

507
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:33,660
financial institutions, and governments.

508
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:36,480
Any critical organizations
that really need to be up

509
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,220
and running at this
time were huge targets.

510
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:42,750
And they were facing
attacks that ultimately

511
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:45,880
in the case of hospitals
inevitably killed people due

512
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,970
to a lack of business continuity.

513
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:50,370
And that's shown by what happened
with the ransomware attack

514
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:53,399
on a hospital in Germany, it's horrifying.

515
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,630
In Africa as well.

516
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:56,330
There were large hospitals attacked

517
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:58,159
because they're easy targets.

518
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:01,210
Typically they hadn't
invested heavily in security.

519
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:03,360
And that goes for hospitals globally

520
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:07,409
or they were using legacy
operating systems and programs.

521
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:08,770
There were more cyber attacks

522
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:12,900
in the first half of
2020 than in all of 2019.

523
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:16,510
So the uptick is massive
and obviously dealing

524
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:18,340
with a situation that's not comfortable

525
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:20,909
for anyone let alone
the security team who is

526
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:22,910
having their own struggles
with their children

527
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:26,420
and balancing work and
balancing incidents.

528
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,750
Kerissa, what was that
experience like for you?

529
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:31,340
- Yeah, Allie, I think
that's such a great point

530
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,820
about the security teams
that actually trying to

531
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,260
balance everything.

532
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,560
And I think one of the
other things they were

533
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:39,121
trying to balance was we had built all,

534
00:26:39,122 --> 00:26:44,122
our response processes
around having located teams.

535
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:46,690
We will be, we're putting
people into war rooms.

536
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:49,300
And, that was the thinking before COVID.

537
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,850
Like how do we actually co-locate

538
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:52,820
to be able to solve the problem.

539
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:56,360
And then going into COVID,
we were, we had to fit

540
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:00,250
we had to very quickly pivot
to get away from that mindset.

541
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:03,880
Some of some people did it,
they crudely others did it well.

542
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,510
And I think the experience has varied.

543
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:07,129
I think some people

544
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:08,780
that I've spoken to have said, well,

545
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:11,100
actually it was just absolutely horrific.

546
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,550
Having an incident in
that first couple of weeks

547
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:16,905
or months after going remote was horrific.

548
00:27:16,905 --> 00:27:19,030
We didn't know how to
respond to each other.

549
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:21,530
We couldn't collaborate effectively.

550
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:23,860
We didn't know how processes
work now that we were

551
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:26,820
in a completely remote,
but on the flip side,

552
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:29,590
there've been some really
great experiences as well.

553
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:31,090
And then personally, I've had a really

554
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:33,580
great experience last year, with having

555
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:35,699
because we have operations that
are so diverse all over the

556
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:39,340
all over Africa, having
everybody out of the same tool

557
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,620
working on the same technology,

558
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:44,370
looking at the same pane of
glass is hugely powerful.

559
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:46,312
And actually it may be a pivot

560
00:27:46,313 --> 00:27:47,810
that we don't ever go back from.

561
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:49,350
Maybe this remote model off

562
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:51,550
of response is actually
the one that sticks.

563
00:27:53,909 --> 00:27:55,659
- That's fascinating.

564
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:04,590
- So the property sector also
took a huge knock last year.

565
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:06,070
And I guess Allie mentioned that,

566
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:07,550
everyone kept going,
we're going to go back

567
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:09,547
into the office and we're
to go back into the office.

568
00:28:09,547 --> 00:28:11,970
And I guess that ended
up with people holding

569
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:14,770
on to property that they
didn't use throughout the year.

570
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:19,291
These are beautiful buildings
that we built just before.

571
00:28:19,291 --> 00:28:20,290
Yeah, about a year

572
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:25,290
before the COVID pandemic hit
great collaboration spaces.

573
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,399
Really pretty seating, really pretty,

574
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,280
green buildings completely empty.

575
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,370
And we're not the only corporates.

576
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:32,260
I mean, all the corporates

577
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:35,160
around the world are experiencing
the exact same thing.

578
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,440
The property sector in South Africa

579
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:40,030
saw a 50% knock in 2020.

580
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:44,080
And that's a global pandemic,
it's, and it's going to stay.

581
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,540
In this year we've seen people
try to repurpose buildings

582
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:48,649
because we believe that
potentially we're not gonna

583
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:51,893
use them at the same scale
that we were previously.

584
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,100
- So for everyone listening

585
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,330
I actually haven't met Kerissa in person

586
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:01,000
but when I saw this
office, I was so excited.

587
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,470
So I hope that they keep it

588
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:04,780
because I'd love to come visit when we can

589
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:07,021
and actually be in this beautiful space

590
00:29:07,021 --> 00:29:07,860
(laughs)

591
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,838
- Anytime coffee on Allie.

592
00:29:09,838 --> 00:29:12,399
(both laughs)

593
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,930
- Now, we reached the point of vaccination

594
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:16,830
which is incredibly exciting for those

595
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:18,960
of us looking to get back in the office.

596
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,700
Some organizations have
decided to go fully remote

597
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:25,110
with IT decision-makers
expecting permanent remote work

598
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:28,870
in their workforces to
double in this year.

599
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:32,010
Regardless those with
hybrid office environments

600
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:34,710
are gonna need to manage
security challenges

601
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:37,400
of having users, both at home and remote.

602
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,140
And that's where a future looking approach

603
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:42,700
is critical redefining security policies.

604
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:45,210
Assessing the monitoring
that you have in place.

605
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:48,030
Working with it on
maintaining a consistent

606
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:49,129
patching schedule

607
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:51,873
and also moving towards
a zero trust strategy.

608
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:04,030
- So I think one of the biggest impacts

609
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:08,660
we're going to see come
out of COVID-19 is that

610
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:12,775
it has completely
disrupted digital systems.

611
00:30:12,775 --> 00:30:16,540
Our customers and
consumers are now far more

612
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:19,760
comfortable using digital
channels for everything

613
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,120
and really some really unexpected things.

614
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,149
And that demand is just going to end

615
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:28,180
up increasing and increasing
and increasing plainly put

616
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:30,750
we don't have the global skills

617
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:33,850
for the future that COVID
has catalyzed the learning

618
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:36,449
and work Institute in the UK indicated

619
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:40,000
that the number of secondary
children taking it subjects

620
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,000
at GCSE has dropped 40% since 2015.

621
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:48,290
In contrast to that, Accenture says

622
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:51,460
that the UK will lose 185 billion

623
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:55,640
over 10 year period due to
a lack of digital skills.

624
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:59,640
The U.S. over the same period 975 billion.

625
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:02,423
South Africa, 154 billion.

626
00:31:03,341 --> 00:31:06,959
If we have, are going to
see such massive losses

627
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,790
going into the future, but
we are so ill prepared today

628
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:13,270
to create the skills that we need.

629
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:16,580
Today our education
systems and our educators

630
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:20,332
aren't well equipped to teach
our children about technology.

631
00:31:22,042 --> 00:31:23,610
That lack of inspiration

632
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:25,560
and excitement about technology

633
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:29,610
is leading to less children
wanting to study technology.

634
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:30,679
And that is symptomatic

635
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,290
of what we're seeing with the 40% drop,

636
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:36,389
of kids in high school,
wanting to study technology.

637
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:37,520
If our teachers and the people

638
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:40,770
around us are not encouraging
us and inspiring us to do it

639
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:43,433
because they themselves
don't know how to use it.

640
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:46,493
We have a perpetuating problem.

641
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:51,000
IT roles are changing faster
than we can name them.

642
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,260
And define them.

643
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:55,682
So, being able to train someone,

644
00:31:55,682 --> 00:31:58,280
in secondary education and university

645
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,810
for what that future will look like,

646
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:03,520
is becoming more and more challenging.

647
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:06,600
These are problems that
we need to talk about now.

648
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,620
'Cause if we don't have
the conversation, now

649
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:12,209
these problems will end
up being the next crisis.

650
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:14,070
And, we have to

651
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:17,460
each of us take a step
forward, engage our governments

652
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:19,596
engage our schools, engage,

653
00:32:19,596 --> 00:32:22,940
industry to be able to
tackle the skills challenge

654
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,520
with everything that we have.

655
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:27,770
Otherwise it's like
watching the next COVID-19,

656
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:28,733
but for skills.

657
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:35,520
- So how can you apply
everything that we've talked

658
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,030
about today?

659
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:40,830
For me, this talk is all about
learning from resilience.

660
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:43,850
Resilience being our capacity to adapt

661
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:45,610
in the face of adversity.

662
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:48,729
This comes for from really our acceptance

663
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:50,970
and our appreciation for change.

664
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:53,270
And especially our
ability to be comfortable

665
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:55,470
with being uncomfortable.

666
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:56,730
In enterprise security.

667
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:59,190
We serve organizations that need to adapt

668
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:00,600
and grow every day.

669
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:03,449
And we need to be able to adapt with them.

670
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:05,480
This pandemic has shown our strengths

671
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:08,440
and our weaknesses when it
comes to supporting the business

672
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,650
and the lesson we all need to take away

673
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:13,490
from this is that when
we're nimble and adaptable

674
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:15,510
when we don't let
ourselves get comfortable

675
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:18,333
with the status quo, we can be resilient.

676
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,020
- That's so true Allie, I
think there's three points.

677
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,879
I'll leave you guys with.

678
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,870
And three things that I hope

679
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:27,610
that you've learned from Africa.

680
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:32,550
The first one is crises can
happen and they can coincide.

681
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:34,419
If I think about what happened in Zimbabwe

682
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:36,720
if you have to try and
apply that to yourself.

683
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,110
What would have happened in COVID-19

684
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:41,040
if you had experienced a cyber breach

685
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:45,210
plus a electrical outage,
plus the pandemic.

686
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:47,830
You have to think about
this coincide citing crisis.

687
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:50,520
Yes, I agree. the livelylihood is low.

688
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,970
But the impact is huge

689
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:55,690
and it's at least worth a
conversation and a visit to say

690
00:33:55,690 --> 00:34:00,130
how would we actually manage
that in a lot of instances,

691
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:04,580
African businesses and African
people are more resilient

692
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:05,929
to things like power outages.

693
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:08,659
So when we went remote, working

694
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:10,670
a lot of companies had to scramble to say

695
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:11,949
how do we make sure there's residents

696
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:13,799
of power in people's homes?

697
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:17,040
Because our power systems
are so unstable already.

698
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,800
I have backup power in my home.

699
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:23,330
So when I went home, I
had resilience built in.

700
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:25,670
Because in my everyday life, I need it.

701
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:29,853
So, that resilience,
thinking about resilience,

702
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:32,509
is built into the fabric of us.

703
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:34,030
It's, what we do everyday because

704
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,590
of what we lived through and what we face.

705
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:39,550
And I believe that working
and living in Africa

706
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:41,989
produces some of the most
resilient people in the world

707
00:34:41,989 --> 00:34:42,933
because of that.

708
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:46,010
The second point that I'll make

709
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:48,840
is don't underestimate
the supply chain risk.

710
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,139
And even if you live in a part

711
00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:52,549
of the world that is
producing a large part

712
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:57,550
of their own equipment,
food and medical necessities

713
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:03,490
they all components that are
sourced from other countries.

714
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:06,350
It's, now becoming even more critical to

715
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:09,880
understand who our
suppliers, suppliers are.

716
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:14,700
And to understand way they,
get, the pieces and bits

717
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:19,310
and bobs that could put
together to supply us.

718
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:23,200
Because with a disruption, as big as COVID

719
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,377
it's not just your suppliers

720
00:35:24,377 --> 00:35:27,950
and where they decide
that puts you at risk.

721
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:31,319
It's all of the people
that they rely on as well.

722
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,040
And then the third point that

723
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,180
I would say of what I
think living in Africa

724
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:37,692
and COVID has taught me is.

725
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:44,240
There's, you can't plan for
everything, but that's okay.

726
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:47,130
It's okay to not have all the answers

727
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:48,130
and to plan for everything.

728
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:49,420
There's always going to be scenarios

729
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:51,140
that nobody's thought about.

730
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:53,870
But focusing that is the
resilience of your people.

731
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:56,069
And if you can focus on the
resilience of your people

732
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:59,780
and both strong, resilient
people, they will adapt

733
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:02,300
to whatever situation
is put in front of them.

734
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:04,430
And I think for me, that's so critical

735
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:08,560
that resilience thinking that
ability to adapt and make, do

736
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:12,930
and cross skill and do other
people's types of jobs.

737
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:15,540
Because and we're really
good in Africa doing that

738
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:18,759
because of Squarespace
resources once again.

739
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:22,270
But that resilience of our
people is a huge benefit task.

740
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:23,770
And it's something that
we need to consider

741
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:26,310
about how we scale that across the globe.

742
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:28,590
I really hope that you
guys have learned something

743
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:30,290
from Allie and I today

744
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:31,900
and I hope you've
enjoyed the conversation.

745
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:34,120
We really look forward
to all of your questions

746
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,993
so please post them and
we are happy to take care.

747
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:39,193
- Thank you everyone.
