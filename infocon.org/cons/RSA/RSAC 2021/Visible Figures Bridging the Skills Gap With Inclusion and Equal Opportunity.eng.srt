1
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:03,140
- Thank you for joining us today.

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:05,180
Just a reminder that if
you have any questions

3
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:06,660
please pop them in the chat

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,220
as we'll be answering them online

5
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,320
throughout the presentation.

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,463
With that said, let's get started.

7
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,149
Our ability to influence and affect change

8
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:17,939
is based on visibility.

9
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,180
to be visible is to be
discovered and perceived.

10
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:25,093
We have to ensure we both
see and are able to be seen.

11
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:28,500
Our visible future is a world filled

12
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,600
with intelligent humanized systems

13
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,360
where technology is diverse by design.

14
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,010
The world of constant disruption

15
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:38,890
requires diversity of
insight, influence and change.

16
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:43,040
It requires a workforce that
is visibly diverse by design.

17
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,850
So when we talk about
visibly diverse by design

18
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:47,060
we're talking about groups

19
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:50,300
comprises of people with
visibly unique attributes,

20
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,930
identities, backgrounds,
cultural experiences,

21
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:55,800
and neurodiversities capable

22
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,983
of meeting the needs of tomorrow's today.

23
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:04,870
Today we'll discuss the
whats, the why and the how

24
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:08,220
of building visibly diverse organizations.

25
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,600
Welcome to our lecture, visible figures;

26
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,899
Bridging the Skills Gap

27
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,363
with Inclusion and Equal Opportunity.

28
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:19,610
So on the agenda today,

29
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:21,190
the idea is that you will get to learn

30
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:23,560
how to build a visibly diverse workforce

31
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,220
prepared for the challenges of tomorrow.

32
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,670
We will look to accomplish this

33
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:30,500
by discussing the power of visibility

34
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,943
and why sharing of power is
critical to equal opportunity.

35
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,963
What lies ahead in our visible future.

36
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,490
We will discuss also
how we go about creating

37
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:44,350
that visibly diverse by
design workforce of tomorrow.

38
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:46,729
And finally, the next
steps needed from all of us

39
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:48,680
to make sure that this is gonna happen.

40
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,430
Our goals and learning objectives

41
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:54,930
are that at the end of
today's presentation

42
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:57,060
we hope that you will
leave with an understanding

43
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,263
of why visibility in
cybersecurity matters.

44
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:03,970
What are the visible future tech trends

45
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:06,220
and accompanying skills gap?

46
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:10,300
What is the definition of
visibly diverse by design?

47
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,760
And finally the next CISO program,

48
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,100
how we are building a visibly diverse

49
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,793
future-proofed workforce.

50
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,110
So let's talk about
the power of visibility

51
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:22,730
and I'll start with why
this is important to me

52
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:25,123
and also why it should
be important to you.

53
00:02:25,123 --> 00:02:27,423
So this is my visibility story.

54
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:30,613
I'm Khris Rides, I'm
the CEO at Tiro Security

55
00:02:30,613 --> 00:02:34,250
One of the co-founders
of the next CISO program.

56
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,640
I actually grew up in a
low income firm of London

57
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,059
where diversity was common
and going to college was not.

58
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,110
So I think going to college,

59
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:43,290
but if I hadn't done I'd
been one of the first

60
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:45,450
in my pretty large family to do so.

61
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:47,619
So I may not have been
necessarily book smart.

62
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:48,610
But I was street smart.

63
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:51,773
I was personable those are my superpowers.

64
00:02:51,773 --> 00:02:55,720
Well those alongside my good
looks and modesty of course,

65
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,669
but joking aside, it's
only relatively recently

66
00:02:58,669 --> 00:03:00,550
that realized that my gender and color

67
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:03,120
actually had a huge impact
on the opportunities

68
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,440
I got to succeed.

69
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,920
And they got me thinking a little bit more

70
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,380
about others that are not so privileged

71
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,560
and what they've had to deal with.

72
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,790
Over the years I've been lucky
to work in very diverse teams

73
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:16,769
but that's men and I've
actively had to take a stand

74
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:18,450
on how people would speak to me

75
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:21,799
and my colleagues and members of my staff.

76
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,000
They felt that because they
blended into the boys club

77
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,887
I was easy to talk to

78
00:03:24,887 --> 00:03:27,910
and it was suddenly okay
to make comments that

79
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:31,359
were at best ignorant and
at worst sexist or racist.

80
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,460
That was never okay.

81
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,470
And I sat in straight very quickly

82
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,873
regardless of who they were.

83
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:40,100
I'm also relatively recent
immigrants to the US,

84
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,079
but with mainly positive connotations

85
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,930
associated with my accent,

86
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:46,220
I realize I'm privileged
and because of this,

87
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,380
I feel like I should use my position

88
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,828
to try and provide equality

89
00:03:49,828 --> 00:03:51,783
for those that are not as blessed.

90
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,310
Now being from England,

91
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,947
I know a few of you
were thinking probably,

92
00:03:55,947 --> 00:03:57,140
"Is he English?

93
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,540
Maybe I can hear Australian."

94
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,060
But no, no, definitely English.

95
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,490
And therefore the Oxford
English dictionary

96
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:04,510
is one of my most favorite books.

97
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:07,109
It's the one I keep on my bedside table.

98
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:08,460
If I have struggle sleeping

99
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:11,300
I just pick that up and
have a read through that

100
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,500
I'll be basically very quickly.

101
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,160
So the English Oxford
definition of visibility

102
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,940
is A, the state of being
able to see or be seen.

103
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,630
B, the distance one can see

104
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:25,900
as determined by light weather conditions.

105
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,080
C, the degree to which something

106
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,580
is attracted general
attention or prominence.

107
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:33,190
And in the context of this talk for us,

108
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,620
visibility means, A, being seen

109
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,950
because when you're saying
people not only hear you

110
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,800
but actually listen.

111
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,660
B, it means regardless of
the conditions around you

112
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,340
looking into the future and
preparing yourself for it.

113
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,859
Future proofing of skills,

114
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,750
so that you're relevant, not just now

115
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,150
but into the years to come.

116
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:52,390
And C, it means attracting the attention

117
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:53,740
you need to be visible,

118
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:56,810
gaining prominence for the
amazing things that you do

119
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:59,070
and inspiring future generations.

120
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,450
So visibility means to be seen.

121
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:03,349
It means to be able to see
clearly into the future.

122
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:06,460
It means attracting the
attention you need to be visible.

123
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,893
Once you're visible
it's easier to be heard.

124
00:05:08,893 --> 00:05:10,900
And when people listen to you

125
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:14,200
you get the opportunities you
deserve to make a difference.

126
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,760
And the world is filled
with unheralded stories

127
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,230
of hidden figures.

128
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,820
Stories we would all want to hear,

129
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,570
people who made a difference

130
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,340
but people that didn't get the visibility

131
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,039
for the success that they deserve.

132
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:30,099
So we know of Katherine
Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan

133
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:34,100
and Mary Jackson from the book
or movie "Hidden Figures".

134
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,357
But did you know the
stories of Dr. Chien Shiung

135
00:05:36,357 --> 00:05:39,470
who was known as the
first lady of physics.

136
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:42,410
Francis Spencer, who along
with five other women

137
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:45,490
make up some of the very
first programmers in history

138
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:49,500
or how about Otis Boykin
who invented the resistor?

139
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,490
Their achievements or their legacy.

140
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:55,000
But imagine if we had better
visibility into their stories.

141
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,310
For example, when you hear about
people like Margaret Knight

142
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:03,200
who in a time when very few
women owned any IP at all

143
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,300
it was a time when women would

144
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,350
either patent their
ideas under male aliases

145
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:10,100
or even with just the
initials to hide their agenda.

146
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,360
During this time, Margaret
had to battle people

147
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,890
stealing her ideas.

148
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:16,099
In one court case, the
argument against her

149
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,940
was that no woman could
ever invent such a machine.

150
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,700
I mean, when you say that out loud

151
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,490
it just seems insane

152
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:25,630
you know that that sort
of thing would go on.

153
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:27,570
But what about Celia Payne

154
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:29,820
who discovered the makeup of the stars

155
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:32,840
only to be told that the
leading astronomer at the time

156
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,750
that she was wrong before
he published a book

157
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:39,640
with her findings in the
passing them off as his own.

158
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,240
These were examples of
people that needed to be seen

159
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,719
whose stories needed to be heard.

160
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,330
And we know just from our examples

161
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:48,669
that women and people of color

162
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:51,350
have to fight harder
to be visible in STEM.

163
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,860
That's still the case.

164
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,340
They still need to fight harder

165
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:55,890
and we need that to change.

166
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:59,053
We need a workforce that is
visibly diverse by design.

167
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:04,030
How is the cybersecurity
workforce doing on that?

168
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:06,359
How are we visibly diverse by design?

169
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:11,360
Well, women represent just 20%
of people in cybersecurity.

170
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,730
What's more worrying is that that number

171
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:16,953
is a huge improvement, three
years ago, it was just 11%.

172
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:22,470
Minorities represented 26%
of cybersecurity workers.

173
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:24,860
And although that's actually
above the national average,

174
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:28,070
it doesn't carry over to mass
managerial level positions.

175
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:31,050
In fact, minorities in
cybersecurity positions

176
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:34,000
at director level or
above is actually 7% less

177
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,883
than the national average.

178
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,790
Less minorities in hiring positions

179
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:41,820
will not help us make the changes we need.

180
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:45,240
Now less than 5% of board
members are women of color

181
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,810
and boards of major influences
when hiring a seaside.

182
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:50,590
It's not hard to see how bias

183
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:52,883
can have a negative effect on diversity.

184
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:56,370
We really, aren't doing
a great job at this.

185
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:58,423
And it's so, so important that we do.

186
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:04,140
We need a cybersecurity
workforce to be visibly diverse

187
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:04,973
and here's why.

188
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,667
The technologies of the visible future

189
00:08:07,667 --> 00:08:09,619
are diverse by design.

190
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,820
We're designing humanized systems

191
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:15,120
and building in bias
that's then amplified.

192
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,988
Why is that an issue to cybersecurity

193
00:08:16,988 --> 00:08:20,340
when bias is a weakness
and it can be exploited?

194
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:23,332
And a diverse workforce is
needed to reduce that bias.

195
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:26,300
You start thinking about
things like group think,

196
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,420
right monocultures dying.

197
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,420
We know that our adversaries

198
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:33,289
both diverse and as a result creative.

199
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:36,599
And in nature evolution cannot
occur without diversity.

200
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,169
And we know our adversaries
are actually evolving.

201
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:43,159
For our visible diverse
workforce to continue to evolve

202
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:46,160
we need to ensure that
they are both future-proof

203
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,199
and we can't do that without
having the visibility

204
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,360
into future technology.

205
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,230
And John's actually gonna
give you some insight

206
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:54,833
inside the visible future.

207
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:00,620
- Thanks Chris, my name is John Yeoh.

208
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,440
I am currently the Global Vice President

209
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,240
and Head of Research at the CSA.

210
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,150
And it puts me in a good
position to talk about

211
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:10,610
the future trends and
what's in our visible future

212
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:13,560
and also be sharing why
diversity and representation

213
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,423
is so important when
building new technologies.

214
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,910
It's important because it's
comparing for everyone.

215
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:23,140
Companies that have visible representation

216
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,750
they connect with more customers.

217
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,053
They expand that broader customer base.

218
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,530
Individuals that feel represented

219
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:32,699
they can become more visible

220
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,190
and more empowered to help make
decisions for the business.

221
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:38,850
And that's really where
my diversity story begins.

222
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:42,640
So I'm a product of Malaysian Immigrants

223
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,949
parents and siblings taught
to blend into a world

224
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:49,383
that wasn't immediately
accepting of their differences.

225
00:09:51,055 --> 00:09:52,370
These kind of treatments to

226
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:55,010
they caused my parents to teach
us the, hey you know what,

227
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:56,420
be the norm.

228
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,490
We need to be accepted, so fit in.

229
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:01,000
And it abandoned a lot
of our cultural roots,

230
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,550
native language, native clothes.

231
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:07,520
Thankfully not the food, but nevertheless

232
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,280
it really becomes a harsh reality to face

233
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:12,850
when, you know, you even convince yourself

234
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:15,430
and didn't see yourself as different

235
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:18,229
until someone reminds you of that.

236
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:21,030
And there's this thing
to to try and to fit in,

237
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:23,260
but you're never fully accepted.

238
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:25,770
And these things can last for years.

239
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:28,710
So you can imagine, you
know, how liberating it is

240
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:31,090
when differences are finally recognized

241
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:33,480
and accepted as strengths.

242
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,920
And when you're accepted by others

243
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,229
you finally accept who you
are and you can be yourself.

244
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:39,900
You can celebrate that.

245
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,002
You can be your best self.

246
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,530
So I think that's encouraging, right?

247
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:46,760
'Cause we want to have the
competence to speak up.

248
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,890
You know share your experience
at an RSA conference.

249
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:51,620
Maybe share a different experience

250
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:54,980
or perspective and have
a voice at your company.

251
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:58,390
So best selves, they're
gonna make better employees

252
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:00,569
and that's what we're here for.

253
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:03,550
It's all we all want to
become a better society,

254
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:05,223
to build better businesses.

255
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,790
If I could rewrite to
my story a little bit

256
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,780
maybe I'd ask you, you
know, why are we taught

257
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:14,193
to blend in when the world
needs us to think differently?

258
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:18,390
I think innovation happens when
we think differently, right?

259
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:20,620
And we're empowered to be creative.

260
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,240
That's how we advance.

261
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,450
That's how we evolve and into
a world full of technologies

262
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:28,720
and with an evolving workforce,

263
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,200
we wanna secure those
innovations and technologies.

264
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,930
I think all these things really

265
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:37,282
have become what we wanna
call diverse by design.

266
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,890
And so that's what we will talk about next

267
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:41,837
is diversity by design.

268
00:11:41,837 --> 00:11:43,337
You know, what does that mean?

269
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:46,839
You know, companies, teams, people,

270
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,550
technologies I think they can all be seen

271
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:49,933
as diverse by design.

272
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:52,900
If you look at what we're doing right now

273
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:56,250
today we're entering the
4th industrial revolution.

274
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,320
We're seeing artificial intelligence

275
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,520
in a real-world applications.

276
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,680
And I know this ranges
from simple automations

277
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:06,370
to major deep machine learning practices

278
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:09,160
and it's incorporated
into our daily lives.

279
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,990
I mean, you see it on
the RSA exhibit floor,

280
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:16,100
all the RSA vendors and it's
marked for the first time

281
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:19,620
by the interconnection of
what we call physical digital

282
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,343
and the biological worlds.

283
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,975
And I think we don't always realize

284
00:12:23,975 --> 00:12:27,350
the way these three things are connected.

285
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:30,500
And it means that emerging technologies

286
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:35,120
must equal an emerging workforce.

287
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,500
I mean, right, like why
should the workforce

288
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,863
be as diverse as the
technologies that drive them?

289
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:45,310
And not just an altruistic thing but

290
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:47,329
we do it because it
improves the technologies

291
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:51,280
that are linked by the physical
and digital now to humans

292
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,370
because these technologies

293
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:54,997
are created by, they're operated by

294
00:12:54,997 --> 00:12:57,142
and they're functioning for humans.

295
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,360
I do remember it was an RSA conference,

296
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,110
you know years ago when Bruce Schneier

297
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:06,630
you know the famous very
well-known cryptographer

298
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:10,600
and futurist a regular
guest appearance at RSA.

299
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,750
But he said that, "The rise in technology,

300
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,540
artificial intelligence,
the internet of things

301
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:20,030
is not here nor should it
be meant to replace people

302
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:22,920
but to aid people in what we do."

303
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:23,752
I mean, right?

304
00:13:23,753 --> 00:13:26,020
So we're here to build technologies to aid

305
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,579
and not to replace people.

306
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,050
And we see this in a
lot of different ways.

307
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:30,750
Yeah, I know jobs evolve

308
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:33,820
but ultimately technology
helps humans complete a purpose

309
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:37,220
or an action, which helps
us make better decisions

310
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,573
decisions for the business.

311
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,150
And so adding diversity to
the workforce is no different.

312
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:46,189
Adding diversity to the
workforce is meant to

313
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:47,760
improve the workforce.

314
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,920
To add to, and to compliment the skills

315
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,959
that we already have in place

316
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,173
and not limit what teams can do.

317
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:57,670
Chris talked about
multicultural thinking, right?

318
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:01,370
And it's evolved with the
addition about diversity,

319
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:04,063
different skill sets,
different backgrounds.

320
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,810
And so I'll close on this with this,

321
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:10,400
the concept of diversity by design.

322
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:15,400
As so as technology evolves so
the people that encompass it.

323
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,390
And we certainly know that adversaries,

324
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:22,460
they take advantage of this to get ahead.

325
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:25,210
So technologists security professionals

326
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:26,800
we need to do the same thing.

327
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,740
If we're expected to be
diverse and we wanna hire

328
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:33,290
a diverse workforce of the future,

329
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:35,810
I think it's expected
that we have the skills

330
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:40,800
you know for the future skills
of a security professional

331
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,992
that's of the future.

332
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:44,960
And so that's what we wanna do, right?

333
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,840
We're gonna build skills today

334
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:50,590
to future-proof
cybersecurity for tomorrow.

335
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:55,150
And it looks something like InfoSec 2.0

336
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:57,010
I guess you call it that, right?

337
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:58,670
So the InfoSec of tomorrow

338
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:01,530
or what we call cybersecurity today,

339
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:03,740
we must understand the evolution of IT.

340
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:06,843
You know, how do we get
here? What are we doing?

341
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:11,329
So if anything, this past year

342
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:14,050
really gave us a real
glimpse into the future.

343
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:17,270
You know, Chris, so Finley
called this the visible future.

344
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:19,280
What does the visible future look like?

345
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,520
And we saw companies were forced to adapt

346
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:25,040
to very unpredictable
circumstances, right?

347
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,540
I mean, we saw something with the pandemic

348
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,329
that we'd never seen before.

349
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:33,260
But at the same time we had to accelerate

350
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,380
the use of these newer technologies.

351
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:39,080
So this is truly one
of the largest windows

352
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,670
in our industry where diversity,

353
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:44,069
and by that, I mean
representation and thinking.

354
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:45,979
It's needed the most because the drivers

355
00:15:45,979 --> 00:15:48,370
influencing change in our industry

356
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:50,420
have been so dramatically transformative.

357
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:54,266
I mean this influence
of the security picture.

358
00:15:54,267 --> 00:15:57,270
So we start by recognizing
some of these key changes,

359
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:58,329
the virtual workforce.

360
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:00,315
And I know we've seen this before.

361
00:16:00,315 --> 00:16:02,330
Many of us been working at home

362
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:04,450
for quite some time included.

363
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:07,270
But not to the scale and the degree

364
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:09,250
that took place this past year.

365
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,570
Organizations were forced

366
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,820
to move almost entire staffs, right?

367
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:17,820
And then networks to a work
from home model, imagine that.

368
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,410
And so adopting new tools

369
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:23,276
just to stay connected to
stay secure with each other,

370
00:16:23,276 --> 00:16:26,454
even be able to maintain
your customer relationships

371
00:16:26,454 --> 00:16:28,780
and connect with future customers.

372
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:29,699
Those were pretty important.

373
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:34,458
So how do we understand
this new threat landscape

374
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:36,336
for protecting a full virtual workforce

375
00:16:36,336 --> 00:16:38,940
and virtual customer base?

376
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:42,160
If we don't have the same
diversity on our security teams

377
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,189
and in our leadership
teams, we can't do that.

378
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:47,113
We're not going to recognize that.

379
00:16:48,886 --> 00:16:51,469
Digital transformation I know

380
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:54,318
this is a move has been
happening for quite some time.

381
00:16:54,318 --> 00:16:57,090
Businesses see value
right in accessibility

382
00:16:57,090 --> 00:17:00,040
moving faster outsourcing things that are

383
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:04,603
outside of our core business
needs or core business focus.

384
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:08,719
It's really made cloud that done

385
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,369
compute model of the future.

386
00:17:10,369 --> 00:17:13,464
We're moving from these
CapEx to OPEX models.

387
00:17:13,464 --> 00:17:17,679
The IoT becomes this extension
of our IT ecosystems.

388
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,250
And this is how we're evolving, right?

389
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:23,950
These disaster recovery,
backup collaboration, speed.

390
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:26,819
These are all benefits of a digital world

391
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:29,373
that ultimately benefits the business.

392
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,980
And so the business model adopts

393
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,885
all these diverse tools

394
00:17:34,885 --> 00:17:37,780
that it really needs to include

395
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,603
a more diverse customer base.

396
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,410
And we need a diverse security staff

397
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:46,050
to secure those customers
and that business.

398
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:47,970
So emerging technologies here, you know

399
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:49,660
really encompasses everything.

400
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,350
It's how we transform.

401
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:53,600
It's how we innovate. It's how we grow.

402
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,629
The security skills need to match that.

403
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:58,830
And so the cybersecurity workforce

404
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:00,179
needs to keep up with that.

405
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:05,580
And so, you know, by
ensuring that, you know,

406
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:08,310
our staff our cybersecurity up-to-date

407
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:11,030
can really see these upcoming it trends.

408
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:13,840
I think that's the important
thing is looking at key stats

409
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,090
and visible stats that really

410
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:18,590
validate kind of what we're seeing, right?

411
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:21,937
So are we seeing trends
for the visible future?

412
00:18:21,938 --> 00:18:25,008
Are we seeing how the businesses
is adapting and evolving?

413
00:18:25,008 --> 00:18:27,840
Are we making sure that we're
focusing on the right areas?

414
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,639
You know future-proofing our skills.

415
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:34,120
Okay, so let's look, what
are we looking at here?

416
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,310
So there's supposed to
be this massive shift

417
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:37,580
the digitalization.

418
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,897
So let's follow the business in that.

419
00:18:38,897 --> 00:18:42,470
And we can reflect on maybe money spent

420
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:44,070
on information technologies.

421
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:46,760
So in 2020, IT spending was down.

422
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,480
And this is the first
time in over 10 years

423
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,080
that I've tracked the status it's down.

424
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:55,340
It's usually up, you know,
anywhere from a low at 3%

425
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,943
you know, up 7% annually.

426
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,352
Maybe this doesn't
surprise anybody, right?

427
00:18:59,353 --> 00:19:03,060
Because we were in a
pandemic-forced business model

428
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:06,149
no costs had to be directly
related to the business.

429
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,470
We didn't know what to expect.

430
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:11,000
So IT spend overall those down 4%.

431
00:19:12,331 --> 00:19:13,340
We can probably agree

432
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,169
that overall costs were down too, right?

433
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:17,259
So only critical business costs

434
00:19:17,259 --> 00:19:21,593
that were needed to keep the
business afloat were spent.

435
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:24,850
I think what's really
underlying within the stat

436
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:27,520
is that overall yes, we
saw IT spend was down,

437
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:32,520
but interestingly enough
public cloud spend was up 19%.

438
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:35,383
Cloud security spend it was at 33%.

439
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:38,500
Some of the time when
businesses had to invest

440
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,740
in business critical functions, right.

441
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,280
Cloud and security

442
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,500
were and I think they continue
to be part of that story.

443
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,370
That's really
future-proofing organizations

444
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:49,370
in a time like this.

445
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,710
And it's not just, you know,

446
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:53,590
the spend in the cloud

447
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:55,139
but look at how we're utilizing cloud.

448
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:58,390
So the workload use is also evolving.

449
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:03,390
We see this rise and the use
of virtual machines at 59%

450
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:05,370
but the new methodologies,

451
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,243
container architectures 82%.

452
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:09,293
Serverless environments,

453
00:20:09,293 --> 00:20:11,719
you know functions as a service, 71%.

454
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,580
Even the even the use of workloads

455
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,523
in the cloud is diversified and evolving.

456
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:22,840
This certainly leads to
other IT evolving factors

457
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,209
you know clouds used up

458
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:27,240
the power of these next gen technologies.

459
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,830
Think about procuring, managing

460
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:32,810
and orchestrating these
125 billion IoT devices.

461
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:36,679
The IoT industry was at
760 billion last year

462
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,703
billion dollars.

463
00:20:39,109 --> 00:20:41,169
and the expansion of 5G networks

464
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:44,040
and we're lighting up
corporate headquarters

465
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,983
and points at 10 gigs you
know, 10 gigs per second.

466
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:51,090
We have the ability to automate

467
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:54,290
incorporate machine learning,
artificial intelligence

468
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:56,350
as part of our world today, right?

469
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:58,990
Again, we see it on the showroom floor.

470
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:00,223
That's how we advance.

471
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:04,530
It's a $15 trillion industry coming up.

472
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:06,973
So are we focusing on
the right areas here?

473
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,540
Blockchain, we can talk
about this a lot too

474
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:13,850
but it's finding its application

475
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:15,919
in a lot more ways than people think.

476
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,510
And companies are investing real money.

477
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:20,950
I mean, $20 billion a year
on blockchain projects.

478
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:22,690
Are we paying attention to
all these other technologies

479
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:25,680
that seemed like science
fiction before quantum

480
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:28,000
AR/VR technologies that

481
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:31,758
we needed to come up with new
ways to approach security.

482
00:21:31,758 --> 00:21:33,790
We need to secure these new environments

483
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:34,790
and maybe buck the trend

484
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:37,389
and some of these traditional
cryptographic systems.

485
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,930
So technologies and statistics

486
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:43,901
these are all things that
demonstrate our digitalization

487
00:21:43,901 --> 00:21:47,733
and validate the direction
of the business security.

488
00:21:47,733 --> 00:21:49,399
You know, which is cybersecurity.

489
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,120
This is the critical scale
to keep the companies

490
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:55,723
the employees and the customers
connected and protected.

491
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:58,540
And I think this also demonstrates

492
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:01,639
that security now has a seat at the table.

493
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,733
The numbers show it.

494
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:05,860
Security is and it will continue

495
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:08,429
to be a board level conversation.

496
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:09,370
And this is just another way.

497
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:12,179
I think IT security has
evolved always needed.

498
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:15,453
Yes, recognizes as a
critical need will finally.

499
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:19,790
So as security becomes more visible

500
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:21,960
we need to repair all our
security professionals

501
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,270
with the skills necessary to do that

502
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:27,269
necessarily to build security
programs for tomorrow

503
00:22:27,269 --> 00:22:30,873
necessary to become the CISOs of tomorrow.

504
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:33,990
And so we do wanna talk about

505
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:36,180
what that would look like, right?

506
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:39,150
What does the next CISO look like?

507
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:40,690
And we'll talk even more about that.

508
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:42,670
I know later on but

509
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:47,110
what we do need to do is
prepare new diversity hires.

510
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:49,610
We need to prepare current security teams

511
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:52,740
even today's CISOs on
that the skills needed for

512
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:55,080
you know to be a CISO of tomorrow.

513
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,379
And we want to bake these skills

514
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,650
in as early as possible, right?

515
00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:02,650
So we need to secure trending technologies

516
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:04,951
and the methodology we just talked about

517
00:23:04,951 --> 00:23:07,300
it takes time to
implement anything, right?

518
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:10,070
So if we're preparing
for the quantum realm

519
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:12,730
you're gonna wanna have
quantum safe mentors in place

520
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:14,892
early in the cycle.

521
00:23:14,892 --> 00:23:18,860
If your executive board asks
you about a new technology

522
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,610
and you wanna have answers, right?

523
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:21,530
Especially if it's something

524
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:23,560
that can drive the business forward.

525
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:26,379
So visibility into the
digital tools that we have

526
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:29,300
how are you using them,
how they're using us?

527
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:32,250
Do we have an intelligent
ecosystem around that?

528
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:35,030
Addressing the disappearing perimeter

529
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:37,190
of not just networks and devices,

530
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:38,700
but even our workforce now.

531
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,860
When you take these new
approaches to securing them

532
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:43,923
zero trust, new identity models,

533
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:48,040
we need these to protect the
end users of the end points.

534
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,360
And we need to understand this

535
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,370
ever-changing threat landscape, right?

536
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:53,800
How is our digital footprint changing?

537
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,473
How does the attack model change?

538
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,690
Our traditional GRC approaches.

539
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:02,550
Are we applying risk
methodologies to cloud

540
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:03,783
with this expanding,

541
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,470
supply chain that we're seeing.

542
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:08,260
In fact, we've seen this exploited

543
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,650
already earlier this year,

544
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:13,013
and it's a part of one
of our RSA keynotes.

545
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:15,910
Digital asset management.

546
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:17,830
Are you tracking the micro architectures

547
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:21,210
from the tens of thousands of
containers that you're using

548
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:23,770
to the hundreds of SaaS services,

549
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:26,577
to where my data's sitting
in a cloud availability.

550
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:31,270
And you know, the skills
they're not just technical

551
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:33,610
there's the human element
that's really important.

552
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:36,689
You know, the soft skills
needed design thinking

553
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:39,760
communicating to the
board and to the company.

554
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:43,950
Are we ensuring that we
have this expanded workforce

555
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:47,080
that's diverse as the
technologies that we're using

556
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:50,490
and the humanizing, the technology itself.

557
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:51,990
This is something we don't
always thinking about

558
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:54,380
but we wanna ensure that biases

559
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:58,020
and ignorance isn't built
into our future technologies,

560
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,200
technologies that are meant to work for

561
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,593
and protect all people.

562
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:05,010
So I think all in all the the workforce

563
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:07,420
needs to be very qualified

564
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:10,060
but diverse workforce
needs to be qualified.

565
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:12,659
Future proof skills involve understanding

566
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:15,820
of this diversity in technologies

567
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:18,409
the diversity the humans
that build protect

568
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:20,750
and secure those technologies.

569
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,740
And I'm gonna end on
one final note here too.

570
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:25,240
I wanna end on no, these changes,

571
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:29,770
this evolution in IT, this
diversity must be recognized

572
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:33,113
and it must be used to build
security for the future.

573
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:38,689
Now, as a diverse workforce
we need to be the change

574
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:40,640
in the world that can be seen.

575
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,690
You know that we recognize
and having a dynamic workforce

576
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:45,950
and emerging technologies that drive them

577
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:47,600
and become visible.

578
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,040
Now become visible by
combining industry knowledge

579
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,720
to our strengths that make us unique.

580
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,050
That have the courage to do so.

581
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:57,253
And so we can be visible figures.

582
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:00,780
No one person that did have the courage

583
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:03,639
to do something like this
is Jenai Marinkovich.

584
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:07,000
I'm a big fan and she's
gonna be sharing her

585
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,770
diversity story next.

586
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:11,370
Someone to pass the Jenai
and have her take it away.

587
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:17,729
- Thank you, John, and
it means a lot to me.

588
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:19,000
I appreciate it.

589
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,820
At the end of the day, I
simply near and amplify

590
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:23,202
the bravery and the courage

591
00:26:23,202 --> 00:26:25,770
of the people with whom I interface.

592
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:27,970
And we'll be talking
about these brave people

593
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:29,610
as part of our talk

594
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:32,689
about how to build the
visibly diverse workforce

595
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:33,553
of the future.

596
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:37,280
Again, my name is Jenai Marinkovich

597
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,220
and I'm the Virtual Chief
Information Security

598
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:41,550
and Technology Officer for Tiro Security.

599
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:45,040
And I'm one of three founders
of the next CISO program.

600
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,990
My visibility story is
the fight to be seen.

601
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:49,920
I'm black and I'm female.

602
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:53,180
I'm not so tall and I'm very different

603
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:55,850
but I do have this larger
than life personality.

604
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:57,610
And I've spent the last 20 years

605
00:26:57,610 --> 00:26:59,770
in an industry that's
been dominated by males

606
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:02,200
with very large personalities.

607
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,500
And this has been my
history since childhood

608
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,450
trending towards industries and fields

609
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:08,340
and even activities
that have been dominated

610
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:12,490
by males and adrenaline-based
always running at 150%.

611
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:14,960
To actually be seen, to be heard

612
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,040
I've always felt like I had to be visible

613
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,290
to prove that I was as strong or stronger

614
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:21,440
that I was as fast or faster

615
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,560
that I was more agile, more
fearless than my counterparts

616
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,540
because I needed people to trust me.

617
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:28,620
And I needed them to have faith in me.

618
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:31,010
And to trust me, you
know, to lead them through

619
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:33,710
say a burning building off to safety.

620
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:35,040
And for me, I felt

621
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,040
that this trust needed
to be visibly earned

622
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,040
or it simply wasn't real.

623
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:42,050
And as a futurist, I've spent
the last 10 years in security

624
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:45,379
and technology predicting and
responding to future trends

625
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,900
which has given me this unique insight

626
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:49,210
into what ultimately needs to be done

627
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:52,490
to prepare our people for
the difficult times ahead.

628
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:55,360
And in order to get my
signal heard above the noise,

629
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,082
visibility has been key.

630
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,460
We are all paving new paths

631
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,230
for this next generation of leaders.

632
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:04,800
And it's critical that we
share our visibility journeys.

633
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,480
And while our journeys
may not have been optimal

634
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,600
to an extent they've been necessary

635
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,449
as they've provided the
cumulative experiences

636
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:14,240
required for us to lead

637
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,253
through these very very
challenging times that lie ahead.

638
00:28:19,357 --> 00:28:21,500
These challenges that have inspired us

639
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,060
to form the next CISO program

640
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:25,340
which is an apprenticeship
comprised of groups of people

641
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:27,709
with visibly unique attributes, identities

642
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:31,230
and racial backgrounds, cultural
and employment experiences

643
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:33,764
and narrow diversities
that are ultimately capable

644
00:28:33,764 --> 00:28:38,764
of meeting the needs of of
our industry tomorrow today.

645
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:44,760
So the three founders Melissa
Elza from Honeybee HR.

646
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,480
She's a brilliant Chief People Officer,

647
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:51,730
Chris Rides, who spoke
earlier that CEO of Tira Sec

648
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:52,900
and myself we all sought

649
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:56,070
to collectively solve
these big challenges.

650
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:57,570
And here's what we were looking at.

651
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:58,780
Here's what we were facing.

652
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:02,360
First, we have 3.5
million cybersecurity jobs

653
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,919
that will be opened by the end of 2021.

654
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:08,960
Second we will and are
experiencing significant job losses

655
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,930
globally, due to automation
accelerated by the pandemic.

656
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:14,670
And as someone who lives in rural America,

657
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:17,230
I can tell you I am seeing this firsthand.

658
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:19,030
But is it possible to cross train

659
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:21,570
this workforce into cybersecurity?

660
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:23,939
Third, hiring authorities cannot afford

661
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:26,320
to onboard inexperienced people.

662
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,639
And there's many different reasons why.

663
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,300
Leader are time-starved,
they're oversubscribed.

664
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:34,440
It takes between six and 12
months to get a junior person

665
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,080
to the point where they're actually taking

666
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,639
work off of the manager's
plate, and the risks are high.

667
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,310
And so at the end of the day

668
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:43,409
we looked at all of this
and it's overwhelming.

669
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:47,220
And we asked is there an
opportunity that can be identified?

670
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:50,050
Can we leverage the increasing resource

671
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:52,780
and skills gaps to provide equal access

672
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:55,453
by building these visibly
diverse organizations?

673
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:58,980
So we posited three questions.

674
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:01,666
What are the skills necessary
to get a non-technical person

675
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:05,350
a fit for purpose day
one as a GRC analyst?

676
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:06,699
What are the skills necessary

677
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:09,790
to future-proof your
skills or the job skills?

678
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:12,263
And the 3rd is how fast
can we get you ready?

679
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:20,990
So our response was to build
a program, a pilot program.

680
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:22,520
We are design thinkers

681
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,500
and we knew that to test out our theories,

682
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,100
we needed a framework to do that.

683
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,590
So we built a prototype.

684
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:30,750
A pilot program comprised
of visibly diverse people

685
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:33,599
who would produce junior
GRC analysts with future

686
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:36,540
preskills fit for purpose in seven months.

687
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,430
Visible diversity is key here.

688
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:40,200
We react and respond to the way

689
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,040
in which the world perceives us.

690
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,813
It is defined, it defines our way

691
00:30:44,814 --> 00:30:47,803
and our view and our
experiences of this world.

692
00:30:47,803 --> 00:30:50,760
People who look different,
think differently.

693
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:53,040
And an organization is simply not diverse

694
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,923
if it's not visibly diverse.

695
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:59,980
As part of this initiative,
we designed a 7-step process

696
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:03,430
for building a visibly diverse
program with the first one

697
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:06,963
step one, aggressively seeking
out all forms of diversity.

698
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,240
We literally talked to everyone we know.

699
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,560
We went to various groups

700
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:15,030
dedicated to increasing
representation in tech,

701
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:16,520
spoke to our various mentees.

702
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,435
And we offered up the first 20 spots

703
00:31:18,435 --> 00:31:21,082
to people who were
interested in the class.

704
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:24,830
We sought out all forms of diversity

705
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:28,360
from race, identity,
culture, age, neurodiversity.

706
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,629
And we expanded our search

707
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:31,860
to include junior
personnel with no college

708
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:34,860
or advanced degrees and
limited work experience.

709
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:35,939
Now that is not to say

710
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:37,910
that our students lack college experience

711
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:38,880
or advanced degrees.

712
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,830
It just simply for this program
was not a barrier to entry.

713
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:44,840
So how did we do?

714
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:49,216
Well, the program is right
now, 59% female, 41% male

715
00:31:49,217 --> 00:31:52,240
65% of the students are Black.

716
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,623
12% are Asian, Hispanic, and White.

717
00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:00,300
Our second step was to train CISO skills

718
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:02,649
at the very beginning
of our students' career.

719
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:04,720
And this is a topic that's very near

720
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,113
and dear to one of our founders, Melissa.

721
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,460
You see this entire conference
at the end of the day

722
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,750
it's about resilience

723
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:16,167
and the pandemic if nothing
has taught us to be resilient.

724
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:18,980
You may be called to serve as a CISO

725
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:22,120
at any point in your career,
depending on your company.

726
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,639
And making sure that we introduce

727
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,810
some of these skills at
the onset of your career

728
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:28,840
is critical to future-proofing
this next generation.

729
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:31,776
So we exposed juniors to
strategic futures thinking

730
00:32:31,777 --> 00:32:34,610
thank you, Amy Webb at
the Future Technology

731
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:38,669
or the Future Today Institute
for providing such frameworks.

732
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:40,710
We made that they understood business

733
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:42,350
and key business processes,

734
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:44,490
GRC, which we'll dive into in a bit,

735
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:46,540
and finally ensuring that each student

736
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:50,053
had the ability to articulate
their value proposition.

737
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:54,330
The third step is design
and design thinking.

738
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:56,350
I've had the honor to work with

739
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:59,129
and for design companies
for the last seven years.

740
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:01,260
And I won that technology advisory board

741
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:03,600
for the award-winning design firm beyond.

742
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,780
Beyond creative organization
under the leadership

743
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:08,470
of Karen Pascal provided an entire month

744
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:11,570
of training on the fundamentals
of design to our students.

745
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:13,780
We needed our people
to be creative thinkers

746
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:17,270
to understand how design
and technology interrelates

747
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:19,879
how to use personas, archetypes, journey,

748
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:23,160
and empathy mapping to help
communicate to your audience.

749
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,170
And I know that many

750
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:26,250
of the systemic problems we've experienced

751
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:28,160
over the years are because our industry

752
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,530
lacks experience in the
fundamentals of design

753
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:32,173
and we intended to change that.

754
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,798
Our next step is a
continuation of the design step

755
00:33:36,798 --> 00:33:38,290
and that's to help build out

756
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:40,350
this next generation of human skills.

757
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:41,810
As John and Chris mentioned,

758
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:43,600
we are moving into a world of thinking

759
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,010
and intelligence systems.

760
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:47,300
There's a concept called
the augmented workforce

761
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:50,669
where you will be working
alongside digital assistants.

762
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:54,400
If much of your rope, repetitive
tasks are automated away

763
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,650
what does your job look like?

764
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:57,590
And what skills become critical?

765
00:33:57,590 --> 00:34:00,500
Skills, such as empathy or
ability to see the world

766
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,570
through another's eyes,

767
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:04,230
storytelling and cognitive flexibility,

768
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:06,400
and especially emotional intelligence

769
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:09,340
all become competitive
differentiators in this world

770
00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:14,049
Step five was to provide
a good foundation in GRC.

771
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:16,719
It's important that you read the manual

772
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,199
before you take over the ship.

773
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:20,129
And there's no better
manual for understanding

774
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:22,600
how a cybersecurity capability operates

775
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,060
than understanding risk
and control structures.

776
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:27,929
As such, we chose to focus on ISO 27001

777
00:34:27,929 --> 00:34:30,089
because it's a programmatic
risk-based framework

778
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:31,887
against which companies can get certified.

779
00:34:31,887 --> 00:34:34,179
We honed in on data privacy

780
00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:36,375
with a special focus on kids' privacy,

781
00:34:36,376 --> 00:34:39,909
and we expose the students to applications

782
00:34:39,909 --> 00:34:42,922
such as auditing frameworks
around intelligence system.

783
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:48,179
So to support this focus
on intelligence systems,

784
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:52,949
we engage the help of Dr,
Celestine who has a PhD in physics

785
00:34:52,949 --> 00:34:56,609
and provided again, an entire
month of classes and training

786
00:34:56,610 --> 00:35:00,010
around auditing and assessing
artificial intelligence.

787
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:01,510
The students also receive training

788
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:02,870
from the cloud security Alliance

789
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:06,000
to help establish a foundational
understanding of cloud.

790
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,750
Cloud is the glue that enables
all emergent technology

791
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:11,000
and it's critical that we
start teaching students

792
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,670
about current and future technologies.

793
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:15,880
We also discovered
something very interesting

794
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,720
and that there's this opportunity

795
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:21,359
at the nexus of GRC AI and cybersecurity,

796
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,040
and that social justice.

797
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,740
We need to ensure that thinking
systems are explainable,

798
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:28,669
interpretable, transparent, accountable,

799
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:31,500
consider the context and
reflect on the impact.

800
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,460
So for our social justice warriors

801
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:35,411
who want to make a real
difference in technology,

802
00:35:35,411 --> 00:35:38,203
auditing of algorithms
may be a place for you.

803
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:43,140
And finally, and quite frankly,
the most important part

804
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:46,339
was to provide the students
with access to real work

805
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:48,370
with real commercial clients.

806
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:51,660
And we needed to make sure that
that work was also diverse.

807
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:53,250
The students that to do things

808
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:57,290
like perform end-to-end
audits ISO 27001 audit

809
00:35:57,290 --> 00:36:02,290
or help build an entire ISO
27001 program from scratch.

810
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:05,820
They had the chance to
do application-based risk

811
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,920
assessments, including risk assessments

812
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:11,350
of AWS resources and services.

813
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:14,460
The clients themselves
run cloud-based platforms

814
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:15,670
as their products.

815
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:19,040
And they also provide engineering
and development services.

816
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,580
We got to really work with the students

817
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:22,810
to help understand
business and their cultures

818
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:23,750
how to communicate.

819
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:25,730
And quite frankly, how to innovate.

820
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:27,970
When John talks about brave people,

821
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:30,270
I think about these
students on client work,

822
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:32,913
and I'm so proud of
them each and every day.

823
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:36,373
And so what's our final learn?

824
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:41,610
As both Chris and John,
so eloquently presented,

825
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:44,505
we are at the fourth stage
of the industrial revolution.

826
00:36:44,505 --> 00:36:47,480
And this is an era that's
marked by the interconnection

827
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:50,140
of physical, digital
and biological worlds.

828
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:51,900
When you stream our experiences

829
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,940
across virtual and augmented realities

830
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:57,130
you give rise to the
intelligent ecosystem.

831
00:36:57,130 --> 00:36:58,830
Leaders and futurist across the world

832
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:00,500
predict we may see the first human

833
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,600
on Mars within the next five to 10 years

834
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,890
which means the colonization
will begin soon thereafter

835
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:09,379
we are at the Dawn of
interplanetary travel.

836
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:12,280
We are at an inflection
in human evolution.

837
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,970
The human attributes that
made us successful in the past

838
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:17,200
may not serve us well in the future.

839
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,960
Creating a diverse workforce

840
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,930
is not just a competitive advantage,

841
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:23,040
it's crucial to our survival.

842
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,450
And providing equal access to this field

843
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:28,480
by relatively training
visibly diverse cybersecurity,

844
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,846
and GRC workforces

845
00:37:29,846 --> 00:37:33,740
and empire powering us to own
our own visibility narratives

846
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:37,093
is key to preparing us for the
next phase in our evolution.

847
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:39,920
So what can we do?

848
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,110
How do I apply what I've learned today?

849
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:45,860
First seek out programs
such as the next CSO program

850
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:47,270
or the Cloud Security Alliance

851
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:50,020
where we train and apprentice
diverse candidates.

852
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:51,810
Second in the next three months,

853
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:53,270
coordinate with programs

854
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:55,570
to hire mentor trained diverse candidates

855
00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:58,170
and engage with companies
such as next CISO

856
00:37:58,170 --> 00:38:00,170
to design internal
programs at your company

857
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:02,030
to help leverage our framework.

858
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:04,060
And within six months, couple of things.

859
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:07,420
One, begin hiring diverse candidates.

860
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:09,250
Aggressively seek out people

861
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:10,773
who are demonstrably different

862
00:38:11,806 --> 00:38:13,510
and use some of that extra funding

863
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:15,340
you might have to hire design firms

864
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:16,840
like beyond to help you solve

865
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:19,883
some of your most difficult
cybersecurity challenges.

866
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:22,940
We'd like to thank various groups

867
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:25,520
that provided us access to
training and certificates

868
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,340
such as Exton with ISO 27001,

869
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:31,920
the CCSK from the CSA,

870
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:35,240
Gracie for fundamentals of auditing and AI

871
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,950
and Gracie and authentic

872
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:38,913
for Fundamentals of Children's Privacy.

873
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:42,870
And thank you to all of the organizations

874
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:44,609
who helped us get to where we are

875
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:47,413
including RSA for giving
us this platform to talk.

876
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:51,339
We'd like to thank our audience

877
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:52,810
for gifting us with the opportunity

878
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:55,220
to share our visibility stories, thoughts,

879
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:57,709
convictions, on what it'll
take to build, protect

880
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,350
and defend this new world.

881
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:02,100
To quote the movie mission to Mars,

882
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:04,830
the universe is not
chaos, it's connection.

883
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:06,430
Life reaches out for life.

884
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:08,009
And that's what we were born for

885
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:11,490
to stand on a new world and
look beyond it to the next.

886
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:12,640
It's, who we are.

887
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,609
So let's do this together arm in arm

888
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:16,760
and brave this new world together.

889
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,943
Thank you very much.
