1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:02,690
- All, good afternoon, everyone.

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:04,019
My name is Lauren Horaist.

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:07,699
I lead QRadar Product
Management here at IBM Security.

4
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,330
And our session today is gonna be

5
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,760
about moving beyond the end
point and really extending

6
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:16,680
into how an open ecosystem
for XDR can help companies

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,180
like yours, strengthen
your security posture,

8
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:20,012
and at the same time,

9
00:00:20,013 --> 00:00:22,270
simplify the lives of your security teams.

10
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:24,070
So we will be taking Q&A throughout.

11
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:25,640
So please, if you have any questions,

12
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,020
feel free to enter them
into the chat and we'll get

13
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:31,070
to them either during
the session or afterwards

14
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:32,650
I'm happy to definitely save time

15
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:34,550
at the end to address those.

16
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:35,459
So before we dive

17
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,370
into really kind of what is open XDR,

18
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:41,930
I think it's worthwhile to
think about how we got here.

19
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:46,260
Why is XDR a topic that
is prevalent today?

20
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,480
And I think it kind of starts

21
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,650
with a history over the last, what, gosh,

22
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:53,920
10 plus years of, the
enterprise has been evolving.

23
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,220
It's becoming more dispersed pre 2020.

24
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,570
We had applications,
would be in the cloud,

25
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:03,100
users becoming more
mobile and more remote.

26
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:07,040
And in case any
organizations hadn't started

27
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,200
down those trends yet,
they certainly had to adapt

28
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,603
very quickly last year.

29
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:15,660
With COVID and everyone
working remotely from home,

30
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:18,380
everyone like we are
today is now a virtual,

31
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:20,410
people are on their
laptops from their homes

32
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:23,110
logging into cloud-based applications.

33
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:24,050
And we've also seen a lot

34
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:25,869
of organizations shift their workloads

35
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:29,000
and their applications to
cloud very much since last year

36
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,380
in order to get out of the
physical data center business.

37
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,039
And so as this has happened,

38
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,990
obviously our enterprises have
become much more scattered

39
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,149
or much more dispersed.

40
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:40,610
And from a security perspective

41
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:42,679
what this has really meant is that

42
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,370
security teams are looking
to really put those controls

43
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:46,820
in wherever they can.

44
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:50,210
They're trying to match
where the threats are,

45
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,759
match where the data is matched,

46
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,100
where users are getting

47
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,949
into different data and
systems that are valuable.

48
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:59,930
And what we're left with
now is a security stack.

49
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:02,130
That looks a lot like our
enterprise, it's scattered,

50
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:05,140
it's dispersed and things
tend to operate in silos.

51
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:09,300
And what this has created is that,

52
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,830
we've got a lot of
different tools out there

53
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:15,180
and they all provide value
in and of themselves.

54
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,750
But when we look at this, it's almost

55
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,910
like they're just pieces of a giant puzzle

56
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,680
where these individual tools are valuable

57
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,100
but when you can bring them
together and unify them

58
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:28,180
you can get so much
more value out of that.

59
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:31,170
And this isn't even just
a technology challenge

60
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:32,003
that we're facing.

61
00:02:32,003 --> 00:02:36,369
This also impacts the way
that our security teams work

62
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:39,220
The disconnected impact of our tools

63
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,900
and the disconnected
nature of our tools means

64
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,170
that analysts are working
with multiple things a day.

65
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:49,190
It's not uncommon to see
analysts that we talked to switch

66
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:51,890
between eight to 10 products every day

67
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:54,369
just to try to keep up,
maybe even more than that.

68
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:56,480
When you think about all
the products that you have

69
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,000
in your stack, whether you're talking

70
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,940
about endpoint security, cloud security,

71
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:05,060
email and phishing detection
products, since you begin,

72
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,170
the list goes on and on and on.

73
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:09,989
And individually, these
tools are all very helpful

74
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:12,210
and they serve important purposes

75
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:14,200
but when they're
disconnected, it becomes like

76
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,869
this never ending game of whack-a-mole.

77
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,700
We've got teams continuously swiveling

78
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,119
between different solutions,
different screens,

79
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,110
different products, trying to keep track

80
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:25,180
of all these different alerts coming in.

81
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,930
And even when the alerts actually are part

82
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:30,460
of the same attack campaign

83
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,860
it's really difficult to see this.

84
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:36,560
So in the scatter dynamic,
we end up with one,

85
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,550
we've got analysts that are overwhelmed.

86
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:40,590
There are too many alerts

87
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:43,910
in too many different systems
and they just can't keep up.

88
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:47,670
We've got architects and
engineers trying to manage

89
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:50,140
and kind of piece together,
all these disconnected products

90
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,859
and just the administrative burden

91
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:54,530
of that in and of itself is overwhelming.

92
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:55,363
And then lastly

93
00:03:55,363 --> 00:03:58,220
from just a business and
budgetary perspective,

94
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:01,570
we're spending a lot of money
on these different things

95
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:03,530
but we're not getting nearly as much value

96
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:05,860
as we potentially could.

97
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:09,490
So it's just, it's become
very unsustainable.

98
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:12,040
We're spending money
on disconnected tools.

99
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,519
Our teams are overwhelmed.

100
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,900
Alerts are still being missed

101
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:19,120
and ultimately it just
becomes very, very tiresome.

102
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,053
And it's not a great way to work.

103
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:23,883
And that's where some

104
00:04:23,883 --> 00:04:26,919
of these conversations around XDR start.

105
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,470
How do we change this dynamic

106
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:30,320
that we're living in now?

107
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,750
And this is where there's some key aspects

108
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,080
that can really help.

109
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,900
And when we've looked at teams
that have excelled very much

110
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,859
in security operations.

111
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,130
We actually, there was a
study that we had worked

112
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:45,320
with the Ponemon Institute
on last year that looked at,

113
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,159
it was about 3,400 different

114
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,590
security practitioners
worldwide from different teams.

115
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:52,423
And when we looked

116
00:04:52,423 --> 00:04:55,710
at the SOC organizations
that were most effective,

117
00:04:55,710 --> 00:05:00,000
they really excelled in
automation and integration

118
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,910
because those are things
that enable better outcomes.

119
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:04,020
And when we look at this,

120
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,830
when we think about kind
of how tighter integrations

121
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:09,640
across these siloed
solutions can help and how

122
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,020
they're infusing automation

123
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,599
throughout the entire
detection investigation

124
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,890
and response process can help,

125
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:16,723
there are a couple

126
00:05:16,723 --> 00:05:19,330
of key outcomes that we're able to achieve

127
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:20,820
as a security team.

128
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,640
So firstly, we can get deeper insights.

129
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,229
We've got more actionable insights.

130
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,940
And so what's happening in the network.

131
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,980
So when threats arise,
your solution can do things

132
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,860
like automatically enrich that alert

133
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:34,260
with information from front intelligence.

134
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,789
It can automatically
pull what happened before

135
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:39,583
and what happened after
that alert was generated.

136
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,300
When it comes to a response perspective,

137
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,840
are there actions that we
can take to automatically

138
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,869
execute some containment activities,

139
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:52,460
all for the end goal of
by the time your analyst

140
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:56,599
gets to that incident to
address, they're more efficient

141
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,450
because they have the information
at their hands already,

142
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:01,270
they're in a much better starting point.

143
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,930
And now they're able to make faster,

144
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:05,543
more informed decisions
about triage and response.

145
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:07,860
They also get,

146
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,830
we think about that context switching

147
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,010
that's constantly happening

148
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:13,223
and we don't have these integrations,

149
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,630
when we do have these integrations,

150
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:18,830
our teams can be far more productive

151
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,599
and far more effective because instead

152
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:25,330
of looking at eight, 10,
potentially more solutions,

153
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:29,550
right now you can look at
one or maybe one or two.

154
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:32,220
And that's a much better experience.

155
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,510
Because as humans,

156
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:36,060
we're not designed for context switching.

157
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,220
If I have to look at
eight different things

158
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,334
and do a search or run

159
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:42,780
some analysis on eight different systems

160
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,729
and then piece that data back together,

161
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:46,580
it's introducing the risk of human error.

162
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,580
It's wasting time.

163
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,210
It's losing focus too.

164
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:51,130
It's causing the
individuals to lose focus.

165
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:54,159
So the more that we can
integrate our tools together

166
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,960
for these unified workflows,
the more efficient

167
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,919
and productive and
focused our teams can be.

168
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:03,710
And then lastly, when we're
talking about integrations,

169
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:06,070
I say, if you kind of read the title here

170
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:08,130
it's about demanding simple integrations.

171
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:10,490
It's about not having you

172
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:12,500
as your own team, building this work.

173
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,630
It's about pushing for vendors

174
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:17,310
and pushing the vendors that
you work with today to work

175
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:21,230
with each other, to build
these integrations for you.

176
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:23,370
So the more integration
work that you can push out

177
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:27,020
to your vendors to do for
you, then the last obviously

178
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:29,440
development effort that
you have to invest.

179
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,930
And the more time that you can spend

180
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:33,030
on those security projects
that are more strategic

181
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:35,200
to your business or address more

182
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,240
of those custom use cases
that are very unique

183
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,253
to what you do.

184
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:40,599
And I think just kind of to expand

185
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,940
on this a little bit
further, when we looked

186
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:45,113
at some of these stats out of the survey,

187
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,970
we looked at those common practices.

188
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:48,803
What was really interesting is

189
00:07:48,803 --> 00:07:53,460
that 63% of the top performing
teams, they put that clear,

190
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:57,109
clear focus on interoperable
tools because for them,

191
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,960
that's what really drove their ability

192
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,440
to more effectively respond to attacks.

193
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:06,080
And then also 73% of those
organizations put very

194
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,570
strong focus and actively used automation

195
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:10,080
throughout the entire detection,

196
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,229
investigation and response process.

197
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:14,300
So automation machine learning,

198
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,660
orchestration fully built

199
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,680
into their end to end processes

200
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,933
to strengthen their overall resilience.

201
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:25,120
So, if you're thinking, all, that's great.

202
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,170
What does this have to do

203
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:30,603
with XDR, what's the context
here, is XDR even a thing?

204
00:08:30,603 --> 00:08:33,870
I think every year we come to conferences

205
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:37,669
like RSA and Black Hat and
there's always a new buzz word

206
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:40,409
and it becomes the question
of, is this just a buzzword

207
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:43,990
or is it something that
can really help my team?

208
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,940
And I think before we
can answer that question

209
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:50,490
it's important to level set
on what does XDR mean today

210
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:54,480
and kind of how is it sort
of defined as best as we can?

211
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,059
And I say sort of defined as best

212
00:08:56,059 --> 00:08:58,900
as we can because, if you've been reading

213
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:02,620
about XDR or talking
into colleagues talking,

214
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:05,360
to analysts in the industry,
talking to vendors,

215
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,360
I think everyone has a little bit

216
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,390
of a different perspective
there and that's okay.

217
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:13,150
It's a very, it's an early industry.

218
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:14,670
I think it's actually kind of interesting

219
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:15,560
that even when you talk

220
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,959
to different analysts within
the same analyst firm,

221
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,410
they have slightly different views

222
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:21,699
on what is this XDR thing

223
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,050
and what does it become
in three to five years?

224
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,630
I think, but despite those differences,

225
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,530
there are certainly nuances

226
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:32,530
that every individual has different takes

227
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:36,360
but fundamentally there are
few key fundamental pillars

228
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,143
that everyone seems to agree on.

229
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:43,070
First and foremost, is that
centralized and normalized data.

230
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:45,850
What we're seeing today, I
would say sitting here today

231
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:50,660
in May, 2021, that
centralization of data typically

232
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,189
in an XDR world tends to come

233
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:54,520
from a vendor's own security stack.

234
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,430
So bringing together

235
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:58,760
their own insights in one unified place.

236
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,900
Secondly, the second core aspect has to do

237
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,660
with correlation to turn security data

238
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:06,500
into alerts that are meaningful

239
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,600
and provide actionable insights.

240
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,480
And then lastly,

241
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,070
having this more centralized
incident response,

242
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:15,120
I wouldn't nuance that
incident response piece with,

243
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,650
what we typically see right now

244
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:18,800
within kind of this XDR dynamic is

245
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,819
that that's not gonna be a full SOC.

246
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,850
A full SOC is very different,

247
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:26,000
met more for those more complex,

248
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,700
more coordinated responses
where we're seeing today

249
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,500
from an XDR perspective is more focused

250
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,330
on those kinds of response actions,

251
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:38,300
those individual actions for
enrichment, for containment,

252
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:42,030
not necessarily the full
end-to-end cross-functional

253
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:42,973
kind of response

254
00:10:42,973 --> 00:10:44,359
that you would get with the SOC.

255
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,610
So I think kind of going through,

256
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:49,900
looking at this, kinda sounds familiar

257
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,819
to what you probably have
been hearing for a while.

258
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:52,653
And so I think

259
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:54,270
that maybe begs the question again of,

260
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:59,270
is this a buzzword or is there
a version of XDR out there

261
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,045
that can actually help to
transform SOC processes?

262
00:11:02,045 --> 00:11:04,050
Well, breaking down these silos

263
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:05,829
across the different scattered solutions

264
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:07,800
and making you guys more effective.

265
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,030
And I think that, I would argue

266
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:12,530
that there certainly is a version of XDR

267
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:15,089
that can help truly transform

268
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:17,180
what our SOC processes look like.

269
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:21,489
And this is where we get
to this notion of open XDR.

270
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:26,260
So our view is that, we somewhat agree

271
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,270
with the pillars that are
kind of out there today.

272
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,370
And I would say, we
definitely agree with them

273
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:32,470
but with a little bit of a different take.

274
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:35,660
Kind of quite frankly, where they are now

275
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:38,770
I think doesn't go far enough
in making your lives easier.

276
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:41,949
I think the reality is
that all of you listening

277
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:43,900
on the phone right now,
all of you guys listening

278
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:47,340
to this session, you've
already made investments.

279
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:50,873
And a lot of those investments
already work for you.

280
00:11:50,873 --> 00:11:54,030
So to quote the very American phrase of,

281
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:56,250
if it ain't broke, don't fix it.

282
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,380
I mean, if things work for you,

283
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:02,560
don't spend the money the
time, the effort trying to move

284
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,869
to a different solution,
just to get into this kind

285
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:08,270
of unified kind of single vendor stack.

286
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:10,449
Take advantage of those things that work

287
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:13,910
for you today and get more out of them.

288
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:14,780
That when we think

289
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:17,943
about this notion of centralizing and,

290
00:12:17,943 --> 00:12:20,943
come to this first pillar
centralizing and normalizing data.

291
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,160
Make sure that you're able to do that

292
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,240
across all of the vendors
in your environment today.

293
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,460
Your thing, your different
tools, your solutions,

294
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,730
they have to play well together.

295
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:34,250
It's not about ripping and placing at all.

296
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:37,620
It's about keeping what you
have and getting more value

297
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,990
out of that, especially
if it works for you.

298
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:42,800
If it doesn't work for you,
that's a whole other story.

299
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,617
But for the things that do work for you,

300
00:12:44,617 --> 00:12:46,303
you get more value out of it.

301
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,930
Secondly, when we look at
kind of the second pillar

302
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:52,949
around prebuilt tuned correlation

303
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:56,580
that turns security data into
those high efficacy incidents.

304
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,180
I think that this actually,

305
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,829
I'd say there's two pieces here.

306
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:03,190
So one is I kind of
highlighted the prebuilt

307
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:04,060
end to end for you.

308
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:04,892
And I say that

309
00:13:04,893 --> 00:13:08,600
because when we look at the
different security use cases

310
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,103
that you guys have to face,

311
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:15,030
I would say probably 70% of the incidents,

312
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:17,240
the alerts that you're dealing
with are probably coming

313
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,290
from repeatable use cases that can apply

314
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:23,089
to a lot of different
companies, not just yourselves.

315
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:24,910
Of course, you're gonna
have unique environments,

316
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:27,810
unique applications,
unique threatened models

317
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:28,959
that are gonna be,

318
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,010
maybe you're targeted from
a different attacker group

319
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,620
because of a specific thing
that your business does.

320
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,450
And that's obviously gonna be custom.

321
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:38,660
But for that other 70% that can apply

322
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,823
to a lot of different organizations,

323
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,440
why build it yourself?

324
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,630
Let's see how the industry
can help you do that.

325
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:49,930
So looking into your vendors
again, for more of that

326
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:54,329
out of the box, detection
capability and tuning capability,

327
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:55,480
and that's kind of the first phase.

328
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,140
And then the second phase of that is

329
00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:00,170
that if you are doing the
kind of that first pillar,

330
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:01,469
and you're being able to centralize

331
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:04,490
and normalize that data
across all of your systems,

332
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:05,790
now you're also in a position

333
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:08,030
where you can run those
more advanced analytics

334
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:10,459
to get to those higher efficacy alerts

335
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:14,580
around not just known
things that are malicious,

336
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,980
but also those unknown anomalies

337
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,580
that are indicative of threats.

338
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:21,420
So being able to apply those more advanced

339
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:26,360
machine learning user
entity network analytics

340
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,890
to get to those unknown threat detections.

341
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:31,760
And then lastly, kind
of as this last pillar

342
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,330
is around response.

343
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,330
So certainly believe

344
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:37,800
that incident response
should be centralized

345
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:41,390
but I think there's also
much like the second pillar

346
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:44,850
when it comes to pre-built, there's a lot

347
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:47,130
of things that can be done on your behalf.

348
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:52,130
So, if you see, let's
say a user suddenly has,

349
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:54,090
they'll take a very simple example.

350
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:56,900
User has 10 bell log-ins and
then maybe a successful one

351
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,920
from a different geography.

352
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,610
That's a really straightforward use case,

353
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:02,810
you might wanna change
that user's password.

354
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:04,469
So that means you'd probably wanna have

355
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:07,320
an automated response action
that can do that automatically

356
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,540
without having to have an analyst go talk

357
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:13,270
to someone in IT to then go
actually make that change.

358
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:14,210
So those are the kinds

359
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:18,040
of things that can be
prebuilt very easily.

360
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,260
And also when we talk

361
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:22,370
about being able to execute
those response actions,

362
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:23,830
you have to have those integrations

363
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:25,770
across your different systems.

364
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:30,250
So I would guess that for
everyone who's listening today,

365
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:34,440
no two of you have the
exact same combination

366
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,810
of tools in your it and security stack.

367
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:41,069
There's probably a lot
of overlap, certainly,

368
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:42,080
but they're not gonna be the same.

369
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,040
And this is why from an
integration perspective

370
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,270
it's really important for
vendors to be very open

371
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:48,970
so that we can work

372
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:51,177
with the different solutions
with security solutions

373
00:15:51,177 --> 00:15:54,510
and IT solutions that are
already in your environment

374
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:55,410
so that when we go

375
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,060
automating these response actions

376
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:01,430
you don't have to do a ton
of integration work first.

377
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:03,829
It's a very, it's just
made very simple for you.

378
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:08,620
So when we look at kind
of this notion of XDR

379
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:11,990
and our view was that it's
very much more than a buzzword.

380
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:12,823
It's really more

381
00:16:12,823 --> 00:16:15,620
of a practical approach
that helps you really

382
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:19,730
transform how our security
solutions work together,

383
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:21,720
how your SOC ultimately works

384
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,700
so that you can get those
deeper, more connected insights,

385
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,700
those more unified workflows

386
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:30,420
and ultimately be able to act
faster and also get more value

387
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,469
out of the tools that work for you today.

388
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:36,840
So we continue a little bit further

389
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:40,240
down this kind of this
notion of being open.

390
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,020
So we talk about open
XDR very much integrating

391
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,920
across different technologies

392
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,902
bringing things together that work.

393
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:50,080
Absolutely, but we don't think

394
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,850
that open ends with integration.

395
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:54,140
Open is much bigger than just integration.

396
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,189
And this is where I think we

397
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:57,540
as an industry can do a much better job

398
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:00,410
of unifying around different
standards so that you guys

399
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:02,959
as customers can benefit
from that really getting

400
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,670
to this point where we can
ultimately reach that goal

401
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:08,730
of kind of create once
and use multiple times.

402
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:11,790
And when we look at how can you get there,

403
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:12,750
it's really open approach

404
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:13,859
includes a couple of things.

405
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:16,329
So common use case formats.

406
00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:18,149
So things like using Sigma rules

407
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:21,230
or snort rules as a
standard where you can,

408
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:24,450
if you're getting some of those
use cases from your vendor,

409
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:25,690
those can be deployed actually

410
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:27,720
to any solution in your organization.

411
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,540
That's the ultimate goal
so that you don't have

412
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,760
to write the same use cases

413
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,250
and different solutions that you use

414
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:36,090
in different environments
or for different use cases.

415
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:38,510
So having those more common formats,

416
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:41,470
having things like
common query taxonomies.

417
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:43,960
So STIX is a great example here.

418
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,960
So if you're able to get

419
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,760
to this kind of common
query language, you can get

420
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,540
to a point where you could
actually one query one time

421
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,220
from one interface.

422
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,040
And because things are integrated,

423
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,360
because things speak the same
language, that same query

424
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,909
let's say that you're doing
during an investigation

425
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:03,610
or during a threat hunt
can actually go out

426
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:05,790
and run that query on
your different solutions

427
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:07,760
and bring back the
results in a unified way

428
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,550
that makes sense to an analyst.

429
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:14,550
So during those let's say
stressful investigations

430
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:17,940
or those threat hunts,
you're not having to go

431
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,730
to those eight, nine,
10 different systems.

432
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:22,140
You're able to go to one system

433
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:25,653
but get back all that
useful, valuable, rich data.

434
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:29,120
I would say also, thinking ahead also

435
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:29,953
and just in terms

436
00:18:29,953 --> 00:18:33,430
of what are your use cases
aligning to MITRE attack,

437
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:34,670
being able to understand,

438
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:37,430
of all the different
solutions in your environment,

439
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:39,560
what's your security foster.

440
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,919
Where do you really stand

441
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,870
and how do these different
products come together

442
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:46,290
to help you bolster your coverage there?

443
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:47,420
And being able to use that

444
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:50,420
as a guide for where are you strong?

445
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,560
That's great, but where you're weak,

446
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,379
how can you improve that over time

447
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,980
and grow your security posture
either through new use cases,

448
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:00,270
new integrations,
potentially new capabilities.

449
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:02,580
And then the last piece
here around having this kind

450
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:05,379
of open standard and
ecosystem focused approach

451
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:08,820
is that you want to get to a
point where you have very plug

452
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,679
and play integrations and that,

453
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,640
those tools are very compostable

454
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:17,630
so that whatever tools you're
using, whoever makes them

455
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:18,996
you're able to easily add them

456
00:19:18,996 --> 00:19:21,940
and integrate different
capabilities over time

457
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:22,980
to get more value

458
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,680
and get more insights and get
more efficiency ultimately.

459
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,360
So you're really only looking at kind

460
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,030
of what the open approach XDR is,

461
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:34,050
it's about integration, but
also using those open standards,

462
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:36,909
open formats and leveraging open framework

463
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:39,113
so that your life just
becomes much easier.

464
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,000
So we look at, what does this look like?

465
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,940
if you were to take kind of an example

466
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:48,010
of what does an open approach

467
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:50,820
to XDR mean actually in practice.

468
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:53,409
And, I think not surprisingly,

469
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:55,200
since we've been talking a lot about this,

470
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,360
firstly it means keeping
what works for you,

471
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,449
being able to very easily

472
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:02,560
and tightly integrate the
solutions that you have

473
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,127
in your organization today.

474
00:20:04,127 --> 00:20:06,370
And I think a lot of that becomes

475
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:09,000
on us as the vendors, that onus is on us

476
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,700
to make those integrations easier

477
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,030
for you so that you can get

478
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:15,920
to this point where you can
have compostable security

479
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,900
as part of a more unified,

480
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,540
open and connected security platform.

481
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,610
You should be able to
bring together things

482
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:26,300
like EDRs, network solutions

483
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,800
and cloud workload
protection solution Sims,

484
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,940
UVA's, you name it.

485
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,600
All the things that, again,

486
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,129
that will work for you can connect in.

487
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:36,850
And when you get to this state
where you can effectively

488
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:38,459
and easily integrate your tools

489
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:41,430
and integrate your
telemetry, your insights,

490
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:44,650
now you've got better
enterprise wide visibility.

491
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:46,390
You've gotten detection
use cases that are based

492
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:47,320
on open standards.

493
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,010
So you're not building the same use cases

494
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:51,310
and multiple solutions.

495
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:54,460
You can have one kind of use case

496
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,300
that you can deploy across.

497
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,210
You can get those unified analytics

498
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:00,760
for better visibility into
those unknown threats.

499
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,610
So being able to run those
more machine learning

500
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:06,157
based analytics across
all of your solutions.

501
00:21:06,157 --> 00:21:08,330
We talked about that scenario

502
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:10,659
of why you would want a
unified query language.

503
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,190
So when you're doing an investigation

504
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:15,410
or a threat hunt, have
one place, one workflow,

505
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:19,610
for running that to be able
to go out and enrich that,

506
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:21,310
get all the data, bring all that data back

507
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,940
from the different solutions that are part

508
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:23,773
of your environment

509
00:21:23,773 --> 00:21:26,469
without having to have
one massively large data.

510
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:28,710
Like keeping the data where it is

511
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:31,570
but using integration to make sense of it.

512
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:34,090
And, I think lastly of
course, is that when you get

513
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:36,639
to that response piece
is that you can have

514
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,770
those pre-built response
actions that are connected

515
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:42,379
with integrated solutions,
both in your security stack

516
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:45,100
and your IT stack so that
when threats are detected,

517
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,159
regardless of where they originate,

518
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:50,330
regardless of what response,
what sort of systems

519
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:52,439
have to have actions taken on them,

520
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,340
you can do that.

521
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,270
You can automatically
kick off those processes

522
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:56,879
for enrichment and containment

523
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,560
and any other response processes

524
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,159
that you would want to automate.

525
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:06,139
So we'll look at, what's
really the value here.

526
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:08,700
And I think one of the
things that we really see

527
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,310
as the value of taking an open approach

528
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:13,129
to extended detection and response

529
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:17,350
is that you can finally
properly unify your controls.

530
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:20,090
And when you can properly
do that, now you get

531
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:22,949
to a point where your team
is able to act faster,

532
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:27,620
act more effectively, more
efficiently and grow the maturity

533
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:30,520
of your security posture, mature stack.

534
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:33,312
Because ultimately our goal is to,

535
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,540
let you guys focus on
the things that matter

536
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:38,690
to protecting your business.

537
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,900
And so within this kind of open approach,

538
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,690
you can get more value

539
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:44,740
out of those solutions that work for you.

540
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,810
You can stop duplicating
the work that you're doing

541
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:48,800
across different systems,
and instead be able

542
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,840
to kind of build things
once and replicate them

543
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,929
out to your different connected solutions,

544
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:56,650
streamline your full process

545
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:59,600
of detection, investigation, and response.

546
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,860
And, I think ultimately,

547
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:04,429
as you're able to bring these
things together, you can,

548
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:06,580
one, become more productive.

549
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:10,010
You can take all that in
and burden off of yourselves

550
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:11,140
and push that on your vendors

551
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:14,590
so that you can focus your time
on building your own roadmap

552
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:18,169
on improving your own controls
and not having to focus

553
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:20,470
on kind of that in the
weeds development work.

554
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,750
So kind of going through this
and talking through this,

555
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:29,010
when we think about kind
of what can you do next?

556
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:30,680
How can you start your journey

557
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:34,480
to an open extended detection
and response capability?

558
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,130
I think there's a couple things

559
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:37,580
that we would certainly recommend.

560
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:42,233
So, firstly, look at what's
in your security stack today.

561
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:46,700
One is, identify where
you've got integration gaps

562
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,580
that creates silos.

563
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:51,260
Are there things that could
be better integrated today

564
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,720
to make your lives easier?

565
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,100
I'd say, secondly is,

566
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,209
look at your incident response processes,

567
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:59,740
are there steps that you
guys have to manually take

568
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,640
that could instead be automated?

569
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,840
I think those are really
great starting points

570
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,750
to understand, where you can kind of start

571
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:09,490
with building your integration
and your automation roadmap.

572
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:11,090
I'd also say when you were doing this,

573
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:12,639
as you're looking at those solutions

574
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,110
in your environment that
maybe have those gaps,

575
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:18,250
are there certain tools that
are difficult to integrate

576
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:20,463
with other parts of your portfolio,

577
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:23,450
other parts of your security stack.

578
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:26,310
Because if so, those
are gonna be the tools

579
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:28,790
that are gonna cause you
headaches and higher costs

580
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:31,540
because they're kind of living
out in their own Island.

581
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:33,770
So maybe think through,

582
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:36,350
do you really need those
things or is there maybe

583
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:39,050
other functionality
through in other products

584
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:41,470
that could help you
achieve that same outcome?

585
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:44,130
Because in an open extended detection

586
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:47,270
and response world where
things are connected,

587
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:50,210
where you are more effective
and more efficient,

588
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:52,770
you need those solutions
to be well integrated

589
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:54,460
and they need to have the
ability to be integrated.

590
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,040
So maybe think through,

591
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,270
do you have the right solutions

592
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:59,740
or are there things that
you could maybe consolidate

593
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:02,110
in order to get greater value?

594
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:03,699
So kind of once you have that baseline

595
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:06,510
I would say definitely
in the long-term look at,

596
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:08,090
how you can execute on that roadmap,

597
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:12,220
think about those areas
where, what are the things

598
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,590
that you're doing that would
provide the greatest value?

599
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:17,179
So what are the things
that are highly repeatable,

600
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:19,490
the actions maybe that
are highly repeatable

601
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:20,650
that they happen,

602
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:23,350
they're done frequently
and they're very manual.

603
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:25,419
That's a great starting point.

604
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:28,360
What gets done a lot manually,
that could be automated.

605
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,520
And then another aspect would be,

606
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,420
are there certain things
that have to get run

607
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:36,430
in the same way across
multiple different solutions.

608
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:38,490
Are there ways where you
could maybe integrate

609
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:40,100
those things together in some capacity

610
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,820
so that instead of doing the same action

611
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:44,379
eight times in eight different
solutions you could do

612
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:46,900
at once and still get the same result.

613
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:49,097
So things like that,
that can really help you.

614
00:25:49,097 --> 00:25:51,570
And I would say throughout this process,

615
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:54,439
talk to your vendors for sure.

616
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,273
Talk to them

617
00:25:55,273 --> 00:25:57,120
about working together
on these integrations,

618
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,219
do what you can to make your life easier

619
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:02,300
because for us on the vendor side,

620
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,730
if we build an integration
and we enable that for all

621
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:08,440
of our customers, it's a
lot less time than all,

622
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:11,130
thousands of you guys
doing that same thing over

623
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:11,963
and over again.

624
00:26:11,963 --> 00:26:12,796
It kind of goes back

625
00:26:12,796 --> 00:26:15,650
to that nature of do it
once, use it many times.

626
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:18,100
That's where your vendors
can certainly help you.

627
00:26:19,222 --> 00:26:21,030
And ultimately, right
at the end of the day

628
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:22,980
in order to be successful,

629
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:26,960
you've gotta be efficient and
an open integrated approach

630
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,020
to extended detection and response

631
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:31,600
can really help you become more efficient

632
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,639
and become more productive as
a security operations team.

633
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,740
So I would certainly encourage
you following this session

634
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:41,420
to go back after RSA conference is over,

635
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:43,570
take a look at your security stack,

636
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:45,639
think about how those tighter integrations

637
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:48,490
and improved automation can really help

638
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:50,860
bring you more unified,

639
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:53,409
more actionable insights
throughout your full detection,

640
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:55,670
investigation and response process

641
00:26:55,670 --> 00:27:00,520
because ultimately your
goal is to become faster,

642
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,720
obviously reduce time spent

643
