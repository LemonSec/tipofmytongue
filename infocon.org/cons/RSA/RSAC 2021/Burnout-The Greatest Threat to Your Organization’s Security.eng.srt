00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:05,229
- Hi everyone, my name is
Chloe Messdaghi and welcome to

2
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:09,280
Burnout - The Greatest Threat
to Your Organization Security.

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,850
I'm very excited to give this talk

4
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:14,309
because I feel like we
could all use this talk.

5
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:17,120
This talk doesn't only just cover about

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,880
how you can prevent burnout
to set but this is more

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,447
about how do we do better
for our security teams

8
00:00:24,447 --> 00:00:27,830
and what we need to
know about our industry

9
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:31,083
and why we keep having this
burnout cycle happening.

10
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:34,390
For those that don't know who I am,

11
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:36,829
I am the co-founder of WoSec

12
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:39,210
but also the founder of WeAreHackerz,

13
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:41,491
and also co-founder of
Hacking is NOT a Crime.

14
00:00:41,491 --> 00:00:44,743
My day job is basically
growing out startups

15
00:00:44,743 --> 00:00:47,390
from internally and externally.

16
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:50,397
A lot of times they say
that we don't grow as fast

17
00:00:50,397 --> 00:00:55,165
when our teams are feeling
unappreciated or feeling unheard,

18
00:00:55,165 --> 00:00:57,730
or also because they're burned out

19
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:00,959
and that's something that's
very prevalent in our industry.

20
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,780
So I'm very excited for this talk.

21
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:03,910
So let's begin, shall we?

22
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:05,053
First things first.

23
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:07,853
Let's go here.

24
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,803
Does this seem look familiar to anyone?

25
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:16,770
Okay, so this was RSA
Conference just last year ago.

26
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:19,380
We were all in that room together.

27
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,300
We were holding hands.

28
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,480
Maybe not holding hands
but we were shaking hands.

29
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,640
Maybe doing some elbow bumps.

30
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,640
But we also were giving hugs.

31
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,270
We were also going to happy hours.

32
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:33,140
We were on the conference floor.

33
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:36,800
We even had to kind of
yell into each other's ear

34
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,259
because it's so loud
at the social hangouts.

35
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:43,690
But little did we know
what was lying ahead

36
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:45,343
just a couple of weeks later.

37
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,180
It's really crazy because think about

38
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,780
we actually even attended
karaoke for some class

39
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:53,273
but it was a glorious
time as you can remember

40
00:01:53,273 --> 00:01:56,720
and then this all happened.

41
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,600
And we're in 2021

42
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,570
but it just felt like
it just never stopped.

43
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:07,570
It's like still 2020 in many
ways and we're just hoping

44
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,880
for things to get better at this point.

45
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,710
But the reality is that
we're now playing catch up

46
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:13,893
probably at this time.

47
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,650
We've been playing catch up.

48
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:20,190
Maybe during that time, we
felt burned out here and there

49
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:23,510
throughout the year, but
now we're really feeling it.

50
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,049
I mean, we didn't have a survival guide

51
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:28,610
on how to deal with a
pandemic and let's be real,

52
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,810
we're walking on a very fine line

53
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:35,280
of being just barely okay and terrible.

54
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,430
Not just like okay and good.

55
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:40,451
It's barely okay and terrible.

56
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:43,970
And all of us have been
dealing with burnout.

57
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:47,490
Well, maybe not New Zealand.

58
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:50,585
I'm looking at you as lucky people.

59
00:02:50,585 --> 00:02:55,585
Let's be real, even in New
Zealand and ever before 2020,

60
00:02:56,068 --> 00:03:00,320
even within security,
we've known about burnout

61
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:05,203
and have been through it before
all the chaos fell in 2020.

62
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:09,320
With burnout, we are placing ourselves

63
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,760
and organizations at a huge security risk.

64
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,440
We will most likely click a link

65
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,630
because we are not 100% who we are.

66
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,359
I mean, have you ever tried to function

67
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,040
as a 5% battery charge?

68
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,230
No, you cannot function well.

69
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:24,489
I mean, there's a reason
why we have to drink coffee

70
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:28,520
or tea before we do anything
first thing in the morning

71
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,563
because we're not awake.

72
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:34,900
This is a problem because
we may not patch right

73
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,250
or be completely overwhelmed
by what is needed

74
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,406
to be patched immediately.

75
00:03:40,406 --> 00:03:43,210
But let's also be very
real right now because

76
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:48,150
sometimes we're kind of
seen as bots, not humans.

77
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:50,790
And this is not just
us within our industry

78
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:55,440
but people outside our
industry see us as bots.

79
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,950
And to be honest with you, is that humans,

80
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:01,887
we're not supposed to be working 24/7

81
00:04:01,888 --> 00:04:03,770
because you have to think about

82
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:07,020
when we're working all
hours and always expected

83
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:12,020
to be on calls or responding
to Slack, email, Signal.

84
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:16,332
How do we even balance a
personal life and a work-life?

85
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,173
Because burnout occurs when
we do not practice self-care.

86
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,960
When our work demands more from us

87
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,080
and we spend less time
with our personal life,

88
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,539
the balancing is completely
gone and stress increases.

89
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:35,350
We start feeling very guilty actually

90
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:37,040
and we struggle to sleep because we feel

91
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,173
like we are trying so hard not to drown.

92
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:43,820
You may even notice changes
on your team for example,

93
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,610
such as employees being withdrawn

94
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:48,880
or fast to become sad
or angry or irritated

95
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,504
or delays an email responses

96
00:04:50,504 --> 00:04:52,710
or pushing out project deadlines.

97
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:55,430
This person probably
was your high achiever

98
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:57,230
who would respond to an email

99
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,510
within 10 minutes of receiving it.

100
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:02,570
Now they don't respond to it
for a whole day or two days.

101
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:03,840
These are signs.

102
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,099
And this is something
that you don't need to be

103
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,790
in the office to recognize.

104
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,980
Even when we're remote, we can see that.

105
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:12,270
It's looking at the time delays

106
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:16,320
but also seeing what is
going on with our personnel.

107
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,849
Now, it should also be stated
that those with a smiling face

108
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:22,630
every single moment,
they might not be okay.

109
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,270
So it's really important
for you to understand.

110
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,520
It's not to judge on the outside

111
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,092
because you don't know what's
going on behind the scenes.

112
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:34,460
Right now, working from home and remotely

113
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:37,799
has increased the number of hours worked.

114
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,923
That means increase expectation
and has a really increase

115
00:05:41,923 --> 00:05:46,563
of blurriness of work, time and limits.

116
00:05:46,563 --> 00:05:49,440
Some people have quit
because they cannot handle

117
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,960
the juggling of work and personal life

118
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,349
because their company failed them.

119
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:57,330
I want you to understand
that the company failed them

120
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:00,130
because they weren't
able to be more flexible

121
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:04,730
and they don't practice
inclusion and equity.

122
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:05,890
And you might be wondering

123
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:07,860
why am I bringing up inclusion and equity,

124
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:12,860
because DEI, diversity, equity, inclusion.

125
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,898
The reason why we see such
a high turnaround of women

126
00:06:16,898 --> 00:06:20,899
or those that are
marginalized in this community

127
00:06:20,899 --> 00:06:25,899
is because the inability
to have flexibility

128
00:06:26,198 --> 00:06:31,198
and we have seen this really
hit our economy very hard.

129
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:34,520
This is because the
employer is not doing enough

130
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:39,159
to support the employee
because they are not respecting

131
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,230
boundaries or they're not
trying to hold responsibility

132
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:45,090
of having a life in a work-life balance.

133
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:48,810
And we need to have a very
blunt conversation too

134
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:51,570
because we haven't had a nine-to-five job

135
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:54,030
for ages in InfoSec.

136
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:58,070
And this is the contributing
factor of employers

137
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:00,719
pushing employees when it comes to like

138
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,610
working from nine to five
but they say nine to five,

139
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:08,820
but yet they still send
emails, Slack you at off hours,

140
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:12,590
even text message you,
call you after work hours.

141
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:15,080
This really does place you and your team

142
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,340
at a losing situation
because they feel obligated

143
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:22,739
to respond and this is why
the burnout cycle continues.

144
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:25,240
It's because there is no boundary.

145
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,880
It used to be, we walk in an
office and when we left office

146
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,060
then we felt like we had
some control over our life

147
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:35,140
and there was a sharp
contrast of after hours.

148
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:40,140
But now, our after hours and
our office is in the same home.

149
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,950
Same space.

150
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:46,060
This makes it very, very difficult.

151
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:51,060
By the way, did you know that
more than 40% of employers

152
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:55,712
send messages to their employees
during their after hours?

153
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:58,342
Don't be those people.

154
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:04,419
For those who are not aware
of really what burnout is

155
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:06,918
and what it starts to form and look like,

156
00:08:06,918 --> 00:08:09,260
it can be that it used
to take a few minutes

157
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:12,593
to respond to an email and
now it takes an hour or so.

158
00:08:12,593 --> 00:08:16,010
You may feel exhausted and trapped

159
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:18,670
or sometimes people feel empty.

160
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:21,110
You push yourself to a breaking point

161
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:24,020
where you no longer
come up with new ideas.

162
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,340
You're not even creative anymore

163
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:28,570
but rather like taking
meds to help with aches

164
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:30,260
such as tension headaches,

165
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:33,409
or taking meds to help with upset stomach,

166
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:36,262
or sleeping meds then you can
sleep throughout the night.

167
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:40,919
The whole thing is that we're
becoming so overly anxious

168
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:45,920
over events and deadlines and
this is the turning point.

169
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,240
Because when you start getting anxious

170
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,530
over events and deadlines,

171
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:53,490
you easily cry or get
angry faster than usual.

172
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:56,060
You may not even respond
to your friends or family

173
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:58,109
when they call or text for some time.

174
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,830
And then the guilt starts entering

175
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:03,150
because you're not being
able to be there for them.

176
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:05,002
Your personal life starts slipping.

177
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:09,010
Now, your life is now
your work and you start

178
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:13,390
to feel underappreciated
for your work at work.

179
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:16,850
And then this is when
resentfulness comes in.

180
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:20,440
And then from being
resentful at your work,

181
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,583
this is when you start
hating and dreading your job

182
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:24,640
because you don't feel appreciated

183
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,610
for giving up all these
things in your personal life

184
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:31,150
to be there, to help out this company.

185
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:32,449
And this is the moment

186
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:35,740
where people end up
walking away or quitting

187
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:41,280
because what we have been
doing is putting employees

188
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:45,393
at a huge health risk by staying
in a burnout environment.

189
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:47,830
Take a look at this slide.

190
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:50,580
This is what happens to your
body according to the CDC,

191
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,290
when you're dealing with burnout.

192
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:54,709
No matter how much sleep you get,

193
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:57,800
you just feel exhausted and
you feel emotionally depleted

194
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,380
which can mimic depression.

195
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,040
And you may even struggle with sleep

196
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,069
such as trouble falling
asleep or staying asleep.

197
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,470
And when we're stressed
out, Cortisol increases

198
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:09,260
and it gets hard to shut down our minds

199
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:12,350
which causes us to toss
and turn reduced deep sleep

200
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:14,223
or even get enough REM.

201
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:19,860
And when we don't get proper
sleep, stress levels increase

202
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,370
and mental state can
start shifting to anxiety

203
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:24,840
and depression symptoms.

204
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,420
And when we are overly anxious

205
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,530
or experience depression symptoms,

206
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:31,010
we start to get sick way more often.

207
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:33,620
When you have employees
that start calling in

208
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:36,127
sick all the time, they're
probably burned out

209
00:10:36,127 --> 00:10:38,540
and they're too sensitive to
share that they're burned out

210
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,983
or something's going on
in their own home life.

211
00:10:42,082 --> 00:10:43,760
But you also need to understand that

212
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,120
when that starts happening,

213
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,770
that means that you may
need to reevaluate your team

214
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:50,420
and see if whether or
not you're micromanaging.

215
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,140
Because actually a lot of times

216
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,343
when people start getting
sick all the time,

217
00:10:53,343 --> 00:10:56,620
it's because they're
feeling micromanaged a bit

218
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,940
or they feel overwhelmed

219
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,883
with too much demands and pressures.

220
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,378
Now, the other thing to note is that

221
00:11:02,378 --> 00:11:04,620
when we start getting sick often,

222
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,060
these are usually like
gastrointestinal issues,

223
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:09,109
headaches, infections, colds, flus,

224
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:12,840
cold sores, rashes or irritated
skin, lower immune system.

225
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:16,070
And when our immune system
is low and stress is high,

226
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:16,903
believe it or not,

227
00:11:16,903 --> 00:11:18,700
your joints and muscles actually get stiff

228
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,730
because your body's on
survival mode thinking

229
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:24,120
that there's some perceived
threat in the environment.

230
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,833
It can even turn into
muscle weakness and fatigue.

231
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:30,699
If left untreated,
prolonged stress increases

232
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:33,950
high blood pressure,
heart attacks and strokes

233
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:36,890
because there's too much adrenaline

234
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:39,403
and Cortisol over an extended period.

235
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,939
Clearly, burnout is not a joke.

236
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:45,350
It's extremely serious.

237
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:47,440
And we have a real problem in our industry

238
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,557
that is leading our
colleagues and ourselves

239
00:11:50,557 --> 00:11:54,113
into this really, really
terrible situation.

240
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:59,652
So let's look at the
reality of our industry.

241
00:12:01,736 --> 00:12:04,040
So these are some facts
that were collected

242
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,870
from Dark Reading but I
want to say that these facts

243
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:09,380
and figures, this research
was not really conducted

244
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:14,130
until like, not even in
the middle of the pandemic.

245
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:16,000
So please note that these statistics

246
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,350
actually are probably much higher.

247
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:21,300
So bear with me.

248
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:24,270
But 21% of CISOs said that they have taken

249
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:27,620
a leave of absence because
of job-related stress.

250
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:30,800
And 41% of CISOs took the significant step

251
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,170
even though many reported
being afraid to take sick days

252
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:38,890
and 35% neglected to take
all their allotted time off.

253
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:41,560
Now, 48% of CISO said
that their work stress

254
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,270
had impacted their mental health

255
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:48,340
while 35% said it impacted
their physical health.

256
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:52,070
Now, 40% of CISOs said that
their work stress has impacted

257
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:54,740
their relationships with
their families or children.

258
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,820
And 32% said it had
impacted their relationships

259
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,540
with spouses or romantic partners.

260
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,010
And 32% said it impacted
their relationship

261
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:04,023
with their friends.

262
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:09,070
And 23% said that they're
using medication or alcohol

263
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:10,530
to manage stress.

264
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:13,069
Like I said, please note
that these statistics are

265
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:16,200
probably much higher now
because of what has happened

266
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,403
during the pandemic.

267
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,960
Now, the other thing is to
understand that all of that

268
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:27,270
you're probably wondering,
why are CISOs so overwhelmed?

269
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:31,010
Just like every other security
member, it's the demand.

270
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:34,160
But also there's a reason
for why CISOs are getting

271
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,719
burned out and why CISOs
actually end up not having

272
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,290
that position for a
long time besides always

273
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:42,511
being the responsible
party if there's a breach.

274
00:13:42,511 --> 00:13:47,511
But 94% of American CISOs
and 95% of UK CISOs reported

275
00:13:47,971 --> 00:13:50,060
working more than their contracted hours

276
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:52,160
on average 10 hours more.

277
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,280
In addition, 83% of American C-suite execs

278
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:58,790
and 73% of UK execs
confirmed that they do indeed

279
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:01,943
expect security teams
to work longer hours.

280
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:07,000
In other words, we, as
security professionals

281
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,863
and CISOs are expected to
work beyond normal hours.

282
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,069
It is the norm.

283
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:19,170
There's no other type of
role out there that you are,

284
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:22,439
maybe sales but think about that.

285
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,410
That's 24/7.

286
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:25,483
That's the middle of the night too.

287
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:30,863
And CISOs as a manager and
leader dealing with all this,

288
00:14:33,238 --> 00:14:36,340
you have to understand
the amount of stress it is

289
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,880
to be a CISO.

290
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:41,749
You get burned out so fast
because of the demands.

291
00:14:41,749 --> 00:14:46,430
This could become something
very dangerous for employers,

292
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:50,000
also for employees because
security risk and increasing

293
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,840
possibilities of managerial
issues are very true.

294
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,050
And coping with such
issues can lead to them

295
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:58,510
self-medicating on the
job as we've learned

296
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:03,300
and also walking a very thin
line of what is appropriate.

297
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,020
But once again, this is not a CISOs fault.

298
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,750
I want you to understand that.

299
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,026
This has nothing to do
with the CISOs fault

300
00:15:10,026 --> 00:15:13,034
of why this is like this.

301
00:15:13,034 --> 00:15:15,326
It's because we have a
system that is very broken

302
00:15:15,326 --> 00:15:19,594
and industry that isn't
sufficient in the long run.

303
00:15:19,594 --> 00:15:22,360
It is this industry that
continues to fail us

304
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,550
and runs on people being burned out.

305
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:28,760
Of course, it's not trying
to do that, but it is.

306
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,633
It's set up for us to get burned out.

307
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,423
And let's take a moment there.

308
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,420
We have a foundation
that doesn't empower us.

309
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:42,579
We have a foundation that
disempower us in every single way.

310
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:45,160
And there's no wonder
we have a rotating door

311
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:49,130
and a mental health
crisis in our industry.

312
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:51,853
I'm about to show you why it's like this.

313
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,410
So why are we burned
out in the first place?

314
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:59,120
I think you guys have
ideas already since most

315
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,320
of you are probably already in
this industry for some time,

316
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,110
or maybe you've been in
this industry for one year

317
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:06,360
and you recognized really, really fast

318
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,873
that we have some issues.

319
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:14,540
By being in security, we are
monitoring and operating 24/7.

320
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:17,800
Sometimes I worked throughout the night.

321
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,839
And sometimes we cannot
sleep well because we're

322
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:23,100
always at the edge of
our seat just knowing

323
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:27,980
that when it comes to security attackers,

324
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,900
they attack at any hour.

325
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,300
And sometimes it usually is the weekends

326
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:35,530
or in the middle of the night
or it's the holiday season

327
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:37,130
because those are usually the times

328
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:39,800
where there's less personnel working

329
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,410
and attackers know this.

330
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:43,000
So this makes it even more stressful

331
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,120
when you're trying to enjoy your weekend

332
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,590
because you know the
possibility is very much real.

333
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:52,550
And because of that fear of
always that a breach may occur

334
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:55,609
because it will occur, believe it or not,

335
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:57,370
if you think you will never have a breach

336
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:00,660
in your whole entire
life, you are definitely

337
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:04,280
not understanding how
InfoSec is running right now.

338
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,240
Breaches are occurring all the time.

339
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,349
It's just a matter of time
when it is gonna happen.

340
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:12,669
But the thing is that the reason
why we're even more worried

341
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:14,990
about a breach happening
is because we know

342
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:17,550
if there's a breach,
it will be most likely

343
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:20,399
an ad hoc style to fix it.

344
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,757
Don't believe me?

345
00:17:21,757 --> 00:17:24,179
According to the parliament Institute,

346
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:27,480
while security response
time is slowly improving,

347
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,780
the vast majority of
organizations surveyed

348
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:32,910
about 74% are still reporting
that their plans are

349
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:36,060
either ad hoc, applied inconsistently

350
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:38,909
or that they have no plans at all.

351
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:42,340
Additionally, more than half, 52% of those

352
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:45,280
with security response
plan said that they've

353
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,680
never reviewed it or
have no set time period

354
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,020
for reviewing or testing those plans.

355
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:54,600
And with COVID-19 right
now and working from home,

356
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:58,003
how many of those plans have been updated?

357
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:00,507
Think about that.

358
00:18:00,507 --> 00:18:03,880
This is one of the reasons
why there's a 400% increase

359
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,530
of successful breaches right now.

360
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:09,129
So what did we do about it?

361
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,130
We totally forget the human element

362
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:12,280
when it comes to planning.

363
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:17,280
Instead, we just throw tools at a problem.

364
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:20,649
So instead of doing better planning

365
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:22,683
and having less disruption, we throw tools

366
00:18:22,683 --> 00:18:26,690
because it's so much easier
for us to throw tools

367
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:29,370
than to have an understanding
of the human element role

368
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:30,592
that plays here.

369
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:35,730
And spoiler alert, we actually
are making the situation

370
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:39,190
much worse by doing so because
when we add tools to it,

371
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:40,023
guess what?

372
00:18:40,023 --> 00:18:43,639
It's not in the planning coordination.

373
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,400
And the other thing is
the coordination's off

374
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,024
so every time you add a new tool to it,

375
00:18:47,024 --> 00:18:50,159
it's not updated in your
plans if you have a plan

376
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,290
and the coordination
could be completely off.

377
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:55,170
And these third-party tools,

378
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:57,600
we don't really know how
secure they really are

379
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:01,070
and this is really stressful.

380
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:04,270
Are you stressed yet if
you're listening to this?

381
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:08,000
so perhaps your Cortisol
levels rise in a little bit.

382
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,833
No?

383
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:11,973
Well then I will imagine a situation.

384
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:16,580
I want you to imagine
you're part of a crew

385
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:20,030
and you've just found
out your ship is sinking.

386
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:22,010
But you found out after for some time

387
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:24,250
because you weren't alerted by your system

388
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,440
because you didn't update it

389
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,993
so the updates didn't
help with notifications.

390
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:32,020
So your customers are aboard

391
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:34,620
and trusting you for their safety.

392
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,870
Your team is scared and some are paralyzed

393
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:38,709
by the fear of failing.

394
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:43,710
So even though if they did
practice of how to escape safely,

395
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,219
that they might be freaking
out because they're now

396
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:48,610
in a panic mode and they
don't actually know how

397
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:50,129
to function in a panic.

398
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:51,900
And this is actually why
it's really important

399
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,609
to constantly practice
as well because the more

400
00:19:55,609 --> 00:19:58,790
you have a memory of what
you're supposed to do,

401
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:01,090
this reduces that stress, that panic mode

402
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:03,193
but also you don't know
how you're gonna react

403
00:20:03,193 --> 00:20:06,570
when you're in one of
these types of situations.

404
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:08,770
Now going back to this thing.

405
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:10,150
You have your crew.

406
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:11,160
They're scared.

407
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:14,570
They're paralyzed with fear
but your customers are also

408
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:17,409
trusting you for their safety.

409
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:20,410
You are notified a little
too late when it comes

410
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:22,320
to your ship is sinking.

411
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,780
So now you're really trying
to get everything together

412
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:29,780
really, really fast, but
there's a catch here.

413
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:33,290
Your entire team hasn't
slept well and a seasick.

414
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:37,670
So they're not exactly 100%
the state of mind usually.

415
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,780
If anything you could kind
of say that their function

416
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,020
at the same rate as in scope

417
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,923
as someone who's actually burned out.

418
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,730
Okay, so now you have the backstory.

419
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:50,649
Now, you'd imagine your captain
pulls out a safety binder

420
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:52,810
to know what is the protocol.

421
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:55,520
Thank God there is a
safety binder on there

422
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,980
with the protocol, right?

423
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:59,330
So the captain takes it out.

424
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:02,720
But unfortunately, the
binder that you have was

425
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,070
not the updated one on the ship

426
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:08,560
and no one knows what
they're supposed to be doing.

427
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:11,250
So you're using an old procedure

428
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,303
but have new features to the ship.

429
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:16,620
Are you stressed out now?

430
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,469
Because this is what
it's like when dealing

431
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:22,420
with bad plans and when the
human element is taken out.

432
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:24,363
It leaves you with a wreckage.

433
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:29,100
And the truth is bad actors are everywhere

434
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,980
in a tight at all hours,
your days drop often.

435
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,840
And we constantly need to be up to date

436
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,100
of what the bad actors are using

437
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,419
and this takes time and energy.

438
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:40,950
This is why we're struggling.

439
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:44,160
We're part of the crew and
when we don't function well

440
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:47,726
or communicate well, it becomes
a really scary situation.

441
00:21:47,726 --> 00:21:51,080
The reason we're in
security is because we know

442
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,990
how incredibly important
it is to be secure

443
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:56,710
but we also need to come
to terms that if we work

444
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:59,820
around the clock all hours
and don't practice self-care

445
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:03,623
or even promote employee
wellness, what's the point?

446
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:08,710
Because there can be a danger
to the organization as well

447
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:12,403
if we are running a low
battery and not feeling well.

448
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,320
This is why burnout matters.

449
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:20,623
This is why we keep turning
to tools and not find a plan.

450
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,290
Our timing to prep,
practice, and self care.

451
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:28,830
We become that security team that sinks.

452
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:33,133
We won't be able to fix a
breach fast and this is scary.

453
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:39,270
And please don't turn around
and blame your employees

454
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:41,670
if they're not performing as well.

455
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:45,170
And because the majority of
you, that is what happens.

456
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:47,610
You let the team member go
without checking and see

457
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:50,770
what you have done that has
reduced their performance

458
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:52,177
because chances, they're burned out

459
00:22:52,177 --> 00:22:54,709
and feeling very much alone.

460
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:58,300
And especially if you're
micromanaging, just don't do that.

461
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,899
Micro-managing has never worked.

462
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,330
Ever!

463
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:06,210
So maybe you need to check in
on your management skills too

464
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:08,100
because this is the moment that you need

465
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:11,433
to look at yourself if
you're a manager or a leader.

466
00:23:11,433 --> 00:23:14,680
What are you doing that's
making the situation

467
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,083
worse or better?

468
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:19,240
Because right now with COVID-19,

469
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:22,180
we are taking care of family members.

470
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:24,260
We're on camera daily.

471
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:26,550
We're unable to leave our homes.

472
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:28,330
We can't see our friends and family

473
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:30,100
and some of us live alone.

474
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,230
Some of us put off some
really important events

475
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:33,063
in our life.

476
00:23:33,063 --> 00:23:34,963
Some of us have lost people.

477
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,760
Our colleagues are struggling.

478
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,360
We're worried about keeping our job.

479
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,949
Because it's not just a
pandemic we're dealing with.

480
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:47,900
We're also dealing with
an economic crisis too

481
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,130
and a mental health crisis.

482
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:53,600
But we're also worried about
affording life that we have.

483
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,980
And we're worried we have COVID

484
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:58,403
and we're also worried if we
may not make it through COVID.

485
00:24:00,274 --> 00:24:02,629
I think we need to come to a point

486
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:05,070
that we're not a machine here.

487
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:09,300
We're human and the human
element created security

488
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,740
and runs on security.

489
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,420
And we're all struggling with staying okay

490
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:15,363
before COVID and during COVID.

491
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:18,470
Except New Zealand.

492
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:21,493
Okay, New Zealand. (sighs)

493
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,590
I'm so jealous.

494
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:25,020
So jealous.

495
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:28,389
I can tell you there's a lot
of people jealous right now.

496
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:32,290
But one thing I can take
away from New Zealand though

497
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:37,290
is that the prime minister
did a phenomenal job.

498
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:38,460
Think about it.

499
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:41,270
She worked with people and planned.

500
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:44,030
And when you plan,
there's less disruption.

501
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:47,523
So how can we lead like
this prime minister?

502
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:51,030
I'm gonna give you four
ways how you can invest

503
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:54,253
in your team right now, at this moment.

504
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:59,670
Investment number one, listen
and take action together.

505
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:01,720
Be strong, be kind.

506
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,520
Ask your team what they need.

507
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,250
Don't just listen, actually take actions.

508
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:08,390
When we listen to each other
and strategize together

509
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:11,380
on how to improve the
team and our department,

510
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:13,530
it reduces the stress
because stress happens

511
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:15,639
when we're not being listened to

512
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,069
or feel uncomfortable to speak up.

513
00:25:18,069 --> 00:25:21,730
Your colleagues may share that
certain tools aren't needed

514
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:25,710
or there's a tool that does
five things that one does

515
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:27,580
that is much better.

516
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:30,600
And they make sure what
is missing on the team

517
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,939
or perhaps less meetings are needed.

518
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:36,940
By working together on
what are the issues,

519
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:40,670
we can actually collaborate
together and find ways

520
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:43,270
how to reduce the issues
or completely resolve them.

521
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:47,090
Investment number two, plan together.

522
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:48,699
Strategize together.

523
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,549
With collaboration and listening,

524
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:53,580
working together with a
team to make strategies

525
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:56,409
and revisit your security response plans.

526
00:25:56,410 --> 00:25:58,290
Make it up to date.

527
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:00,530
And if you don't have one, make one.

528
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:02,259
This is the time to do so.

529
00:26:02,259 --> 00:26:04,763
Revisit the plans that you have though.

530
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:08,370
And every time a new
tool is removed or added

531
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:11,419
or a new team member change
or environment change

532
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:14,420
since everyone working remotely and so on,

533
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:16,960
that needs to be updated.

534
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,397
By creating making solid plans

535
00:26:18,397 --> 00:26:21,070
and running through over and over to prep,

536
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:24,520
it helps speed up the recovery
and reduces the stress

537
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,850
when a breach occurs that
there's a plan to follow up

538
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:28,090
that's up to date.

539
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:31,709
Just remember that example
of that cruise ship.

540
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:33,460
It helps when a plan is up-to-date.

541
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,440
You owe it to yourself, your colleagues,

542
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,960
your org, your customers, because it means

543
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,350
that you acknowledge the
human element is there.

544
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:45,250
Because we don't know
how we're going to react

545
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:49,000
when we're in a disaster
until we're in a disaster.

546
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,920
So it's better to prep as much as possible

547
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,530
so then we can actually sleep
a little bit better at night.

548
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:57,010
And we know that if we're called
in the middle of the night,

549
00:26:57,010 --> 00:26:59,470
we know that we have a
plan that's up to date

550
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:00,943
that we can run through.

551
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:04,660
I mean, look at New Zealand.

552
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:05,953
They planned.

553
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,300
And COVID-19, I mean, look at it.

554
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,120
They had 25 deaths.

555
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,320
You know how many we have in the US?

556
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:17,120
We have over 563,000 deaths.

557
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,969
And this is because someone didn't plan

558
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:23,180
or take actions or listen to their team.

559
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:25,780
Investment number three,
encourage self-care.

560
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:28,060
Studies have shown that
when dealing with burnout,

561
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:31,330
taking one week off away
from work or anything related

562
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:34,260
to work, that means turn
off your devices too,

563
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,340
provide recovery for burnout.

564
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:38,070
If your employees burned out,

565
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:40,060
make sure they feel
supported to take time off

566
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:42,800
and also encourage it often to the team.

567
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,020
And there's something you should know

568
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:49,020
that companies that say you
have unlimited paid time off,

569
00:27:51,071 --> 00:27:54,490
chances are people are not
going to take all that time off.

570
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:57,610
Actually a lot of studies show
that if you give that option,

571
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:58,820
they're going to take less time off

572
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:01,023
because there's this sense of

573
00:28:01,023 --> 00:28:03,530
"I feel uncomfortable taking time off"

574
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:06,010
or "I feel uncomfortable
asking for time off."

575
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:08,110
And this is the promise
that majority of employees

576
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:10,040
in security are afraid to take time off

577
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,010
because they feel guilty
for not being there

578
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:15,350
to help their team and giving
more to their colleagues

579
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:18,050
or coming back to a dumpster fire.

580
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:20,500
If you can give everyone
one day off a month

581
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,200
for a mental health break

582
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,760
and always try to do Monday or a Friday,

583
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:28,910
it becomes a really nice
thing to do to your employees.

584
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:30,730
Everyone likes the three-day weekend.

585
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:33,030
Lastly, make sure you
have one day per week

586
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:37,330
dedicated to not having
any meetings whatsoever.

587
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:40,852
That means no more Zoom for one day.

588
00:28:41,778 --> 00:28:44,330
This allows your colleagues to do catch up

589
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:48,169
on any items or projects but
also go through their emails.

590
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:52,660
Investment number four, be
kind and respect boundaries.

591
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:54,690
Please be kind to one another

592
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:57,000
because from what we have learned,

593
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,400
when we work together and
understand how we impact others,

594
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,560
we start practicing empathy.

595
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:08,290
And empathy is certainly missing
at times in our industry.

596
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:10,720
But by listening and being
there for one another,

597
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,220
it reminds us that there's
people who care for each other

598
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:17,290
because we cannot assume
how someone is doing

599
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:20,550
by how they look or by their performance.

600
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:23,250
We do not know what each
other is going through.

601
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:26,610
So instead of going at someone, reframe.

602
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:30,540
Take a step back, reframe and
think before you speak or act

603
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,350
because you really don't know

604
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:35,533
how that will impact the other person.

605
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:39,159
So as New Zealand states, be kind

606
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:42,960
because that's the element
we need to stick together

607
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,980
to protect the world from the darkness.

608
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:50,050
But also know that being kind
is respecting work boundaries

609
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:53,033
such as six feet of a
distance and wear a mask.

610
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:59,240
I'm going to tell you what you
can do right at this moment.

611
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:03,650
So right now, take a screenshot
of this or write it down.

612
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:06,152
Whatever makes it easier for you.

613
00:30:06,152 --> 00:30:08,940
These are things that
you could do right now

614
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:12,000
which will only take only
a few minutes of your time.

615
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,140
One, send a weekly one-on-one

616
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:16,700
for 15 minutes with each employee.

617
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:19,010
This allows you to go over their projects

618
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:21,240
and to know what to, for them

619
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,850
and you to be on the same
page on what to prioritize.

620
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:26,679
This is not meant to micromanage.

621
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,990
Please note that by having
these weekly one-on-ones,

622
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:30,130
that means that you don't have

623
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:31,600
any more one-on-ones with them.

624
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,699
That means once a week, 15 minutes.

625
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,720
You don't have to take
the whole 15 minutes.

626
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:39,280
Just a quick check-in to know
how each person is doing.

627
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,790
Make Monday or Fridays a no meetings day.

628
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:44,190
This is really important
because we need a day

629
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:46,078
where there's no Zoom.

630
00:30:46,078 --> 00:30:48,410
Set up a meeting with
the team to explore ways

631
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:50,260
to improve together.

632
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:52,379
This could be a monthly arrangement.

633
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:55,770
This could be a bi-weekly
arrangement to figure out

634
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:58,590
how you can work together
to improve things.

635
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:01,020
And then also create an anonymous survey

636
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:03,760
so when someone does submit
some recommendations,

637
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,640
it's not traced back to
them because this is one

638
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,454
of the reasons why people
don't fill out a survey.

639
00:31:07,454 --> 00:31:10,100
So if you're going to make a survey,

640
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,500
you better make that anonymous.

641
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,100
Don't have a tracker on it.

642
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,963
We need to make sure that people can share

643
00:31:14,963 --> 00:31:17,555
their real thoughts and
feelings without having

644
00:31:17,555 --> 00:31:20,683
to worry about their job
being on the line by doing so.

645
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,830
Lastly, remember, when we work together

646
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:29,230
and listen to each
other, magic does happen.

647
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:30,790
When we work together making sure people

648
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:33,424
get personal time off without them fearing

649
00:31:33,424 --> 00:31:38,020
of taking time away, we're
becoming collaborative.

650
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:40,980
When we collaborate, we
reduce the stressful items

651
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:43,310
that hold back the team from thriving.

652
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:45,000
When we focus on balancing work

653
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,890
and personal life for everyone,

654
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:50,220
that's when we no longer
have a dumpster fire.

655
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:54,370
Burnout as a security concern, no more.

656
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:57,669
Because we know we are human
and the human element rules

657
00:31:57,670 --> 00:31:59,540
the world that we live in.

658
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:01,653
And whenever in doubt, just remember,

659
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,530
if New Zealand can plan well so can you.

660
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:08,940
Because in all of us, there's
a Frodo within us who is

661
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:11,493
on the journey to get rid
of a malicious threat.

662
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:15,253
So quick overview to reduce burnout.

663
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,427
Just note, burnout places you

664
00:32:18,427 --> 00:32:20,990
and your team as security risk.

665
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:24,700
Not just security risk,
personal, health risks too.

666
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:27,370
So it's important that we
collaborate to form strategies

667
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:28,600
to improve the team.

668
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,510
Don't just go at it on your own.

669
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:31,960
Work together.

670
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,872
You have a team of people.

671
00:32:33,872 --> 00:32:36,600
Every single person has
a different background

672
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,980
and they're gonna have different ideas

673
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:41,790
and it'd be cool to test them out too.

674
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:43,050
It's just important for us

675
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:45,600
to really communicate better on this one.

676
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,610
Now, the other thing is start making plans

677
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:49,219
and revisit security response plans.

678
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:51,863
If you don't have a
security response plan,

679
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:56,680
you should take a moment there

680
00:32:56,680 --> 00:33:00,752
and make that a priority
at this very moment.

681
00:33:00,752 --> 00:33:02,990
We need security response plans.

682
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:05,530
It's so important that we have them

683
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:07,620
and that they're up to
date because it helps

684
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:10,330
our team feel less weight
on their shoulders.

685
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:13,330
But also it makes you
guys have a better idea

686
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:15,852
of what to expect when you run through it.

687
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:18,520
And remember to promote self-care

688
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:21,960
and being kind and
respectful to boundaries.

689
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:26,240
That means no employee
should have to think

690
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,750
that they need to come
into work or respond

691
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:33,283
to a Slack message or an
email after work hours.

692
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:35,740
You can send emails, that's okay.

693
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:37,710
If you want to send emails, that's okay.

694
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:41,530
But the reality is that
a lot of employees feel

695
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:44,010
when they get something,
they get a Slack message,

696
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:45,370
they have to respond.

697
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:46,850
That could be like 10 o'clock at night.

698
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:48,070
That could be in the
middle of their dinner

699
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:49,460
with their family.

700
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,030
And that's not okay anymore.

701
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:52,260
We need to understand

702
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:54,770
that people have a life outside of work.

703
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:58,060
Our work and our life are yes,

704
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,760
they play a role with each other.

705
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,060
But the reality is that we
have a life outside of work

706
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:06,210
and our work should not be our life.

707
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,290
And that's the one thing
I definitely can take away

708
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:12,590
from this pandemic is don't
let your work become your life

709
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:15,050
because you miss out on
all the beautiful things

710
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:16,483
around you because of it.

711
00:34:17,409 --> 00:34:19,810
And so that's why we need to do better.

712
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:22,389
Wouldn't it be great if we
had such a balanced industry

713
00:34:22,389 --> 00:34:26,029
where we can love our
work, our job, but also

714
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:29,980
love our personal life, that
we have a personal life?

715
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:33,013
That's what we need to
be practicing more today.

716
00:34:35,389 --> 00:34:40,208

because I really hope
that we can come together

726
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:06,073
and come up with more
solutions to make our industry

727
00:35:06,074 --> 00:35:09,180
a little bit better and safer.

728
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:12,144
And it's so important that we do so.

729
00:35:12,144 --> 00:35:15,870
so thank you everyone and stay safe.

730
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:18,779
And I'm happy to answer any
questions that you have.
