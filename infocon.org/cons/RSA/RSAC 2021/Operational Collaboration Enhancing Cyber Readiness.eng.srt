1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:02,679
- Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:03,720
Welcome to the panel

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,250
on operational collaboration,
enhancing cyber readiness.

4
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:08,680
My name is Greg Rattray.

5
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:13,469
The panel is going to focus
on the recent work that myself

6
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:14,890
and the other panelists have done

7
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:16,790
as part of the New York cyber task force

8
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:19,610
where I had the honor to
be the executive director.

9
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:24,610
I'm also a senior adjunct
professor at Columbia University

10
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:27,962
where there was real sponsors
of the task force work.

11
00:00:27,962 --> 00:00:32,962
And I am the founder and
partner at next peak consulting.

12
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,130
I'm going to let each of the
panelists introduce themselves.

13
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:39,023
So Erica, over to you.

14
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:41,190
- Thanks.

15
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:42,489
Hi, I'm Erica Borghard.

16
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:46,360
I'm a senior director on the
cyberspace solarium commission.

17
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,410
Michael, over to you.

18
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:51,670
- Hi, thanks Erica.

19
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:52,570
I'm Michael Daniel.

20
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:55,630
I'm the president and CEO
of the cyber threat alliance

21
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:58,060
which is a group of
cybersecurity companies

22
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:00,589
that share threat
intelligence with each other.

23
00:01:00,589 --> 00:01:01,742
Christopher.

24
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,099
- Thanks Michael,

25
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:04,932
I'm Chris Button,

26
00:01:04,933 --> 00:01:06,700
I'm the chief intelligence officer

27
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,860
of the analysis and resilience center.

28
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:13,860
The arc we analyze and
develop resiliency measures

29
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:18,770
for systemic risk in the
financial services sector

30
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:23,770
in the energy sector and
work with the government to

31
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:26,429
to identify solutions
and warn against threats,

32
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:27,280
back to you Greg.

33
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,023
- Thanks Chris.

34
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,240
Very quickly.

35
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,330
You know we're going to go

36
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:37,470
through an initial presentation
that really talks to

37
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,770
you know, the, the topic here,

38
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:42,429
and particularly the work

39
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:45,647
of the recent New York cyber task force.

40
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:48,890
And then we'll turn it to perspectives

41
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:52,360
from the people you just met
as in terms of the panelists

42
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:56,463
and a little dialogue
between the four of us.

43
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:00,720
So what do we mean by
operational collaboration?

44
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,410
It's actually a word that has come more

45
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:07,000
into usage in the cyber
security community.

46
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,080
As Erica might mention
the solarium commission

47
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,640
report itself actually used
the, the concept, you know,

48
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,309
in my mind it's the public
private partnerships to

49
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:21,530
enable coordinated cyber defense actions.

50
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:22,960
Again Michael will probably speak

51
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:26,930
as some specifically the types
of actions we're talking to

52
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:30,440
but additionally to do the
proactive work in joint planning

53
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,820
and capacity building for cyber resilience

54
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,290
which is one of the principle purposes

55
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:36,970
of the analysis and resilience center.

56
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:41,880
And Chris will probably talk
to those concepts as well.

57
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,530
It really sort of some of the bottom line

58
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:48,120
up front from the task
forces work is, you know,

59
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,670
as we considered, you know,

60
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:53,260
how to move forward and
you know use this concept

61
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:57,519
in light of the current state
of public private partnerships

62
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,875
in the United States for cyber security

63
00:02:58,875 --> 00:03:03,120
we definitely identify
challenges I'll go through

64
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,210
and sort of how we thought

65
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:06,290
through the problem here in a moment,

66
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:11,070
but to really baseline on
our findings, you know,

67
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:12,060
we have not really

68
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:17,060
identified national security
level contingencies that drive

69
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:21,780
you know, how we think
about both in the public,

70
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:26,430
and the private sectors you
know being able to respond

71
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:29,270
to these contingencies
and have the capacities

72
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:32,670
and the investment necessary to do so.

73
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,440
One of the reasons I think we believe

74
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:39,040
that this has occurred is we
still are absent a focal point

75
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,340
for coordinating the
national security level

76
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:47,250
cyber readiness effort in, in the country.

77
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,870
We do look to the
recommendations that were

78
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:53,960
of the commission that were instantiated

79
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,536
in the national defense authorization act.

80
00:03:57,536 --> 00:04:01,610
And you know are hopeful that
a national cyber director

81
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:03,820
within the federal
government will play a role

82
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,980
but remind everyone that it's much more

83
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,510
than a federal government
challenge in terms

84
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:10,579
of once we build a system

85
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:13,240
and we'll talk to what
that system looks like.

86
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,470
And then, you know, I think,

87
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:17,930
at the core as we discuss
these issues, you know,

88
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:20,675
that both the technology industry

89
00:04:20,675 --> 00:04:23,500
and critical infrastructure
and the private sector

90
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,980
need to be real national security partners

91
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,480
and work shoulder to
shoulder with the government.

92
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,900
If we look a bit at how
the task force did its work

93
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,260
I think one of the things
and I hope you will have

94
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:39,650
an opportunity to take a
look at the task force report

95
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:44,219
but we focused very much on
looking forward into the future

96
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:47,300
and not sort of current
organizational constructs

97
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:50,270
in the government building
upon a lot of the work

98
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,640
that has existed, you know,

99
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,240
to build public private partnerships.

100
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,840
But we wanted to make sure we're

101
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,469
working at the high level
at the level of what

102
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:02,270
our national security risk drivers,

103
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:03,539
and we identified a set

104
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,620
of national security drivers for rest.

105
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:08,110
And then we formed those into scenarios,

106
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:11,050
which I'll touch upon here in a moment.

107
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:14,450
But I think we think one of
the most valuable elements

108
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:19,150
of our work is actually taking
that thought pattern forward

109
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:22,539
into the future and
actually raising sort of

110
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:29,580
our consideration of what it means to

111
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,140
be ready to not just
things we've already seen,

112
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,330
but to the more severe,

113
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:35,190
but plausible things that might occur.

114
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:39,250
And we derive the set
of scenarios from that.

115
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,360
I'll show those here in a moment

116
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,550
but if you have the chance
to look at those scenarios

117
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:46,170
I think the experts on
the taskforce thought

118
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:49,270
that they were very much
a good representative

119
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:52,483
of suite of the things
that could challenge us.

120
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:57,539
And then we use a methodology
that sometimes referred

121
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:00,740
to as a day after methodology
that was pioneered

122
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:03,550
by the RAND corporation to take ourselves

123
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:07,620
into crisis situations that
might occur five years from now

124
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:08,493
based on these scenarios,

125
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:12,670
think about what we would
not have been ready with

126
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:15,230
and then come back to recommendations

127
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:17,600
that we could have things we could do now

128
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,073
which I'll outline here in a moment.

129
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:27,210
So not to sort of repeat
the specifics on the slide

130
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:29,270
but to understand challenges.

131
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:31,190
We do think the work is innovative

132
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,770
in the sense that we really started

133
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:37,508
with what are the things that
could cause us severe risks

134
00:06:37,508 --> 00:06:40,890
in the evolving cyber environment.

135
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:43,250
And we came up with the
drivers that you see here

136
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,490
on the slide, and to know, you know,

137
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:48,350
some of those are
traditional cyber security

138
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:52,000
technical concerns, the
technical ecosystem itself,

139
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,586
but also, you know,

140
00:06:53,586 --> 00:06:58,586
the nature of geopolitics
all these things are a mix

141
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:03,356
of the types of concerns
that we tried to pick a

142
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:06,000
an illustrative set of four scenarios.

143
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,660
So again they're available in the report

144
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,600
you see them here in the slides.

145
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,531
I think one

146
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:14,220
of the more innovative things
that we did was to talk

147
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,540
about in scenario four

148
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:18,610
the notion that the
domestic extremist groups

149
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:22,400
could cause substantially
disruptive risks was interesting.

150
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,630
We made that decision
back in the summer of 2020

151
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:27,330
and I think we're all, you know,

152
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:29,010
continue to be concerned that, you know,

153
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:34,010
there are domestic groups could cause risk

154
00:07:34,257 --> 00:07:36,830
and cyberspace might
be one of those places.

155
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:39,240
So if you get the opportunity
you might be interested

156
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,283
in looking at that.

157
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,240
In terms of recommendations,

158
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,500
and I've got a couple
more slides that really

159
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,207
explain an element of this,

160
00:07:48,207 --> 00:07:51,960
I'm going to focus here on that.

161
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,909
One of the things that we
felt like is essential is

162
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:57,310
it's hard to plan for national security.

163
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,283
If you don't,

164
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:04,500
if you don't start with a
prioritized list of situations

165
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,640
and need to get ready in
both military planning

166
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,676
but also in emergency management planning,

167
00:08:10,677 --> 00:08:13,890
you drive a lot of your understanding

168
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:16,110
of what you need to do,
who needs to be involved,

169
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:19,190
and how much you invest by
identifying contingency.

170
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:21,840
So we really think that's
an urgent challenge.

171
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,469
I'm going to talk to the
nature of what we recommended

172
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:27,500
in terms of the national
cyber response network

173
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,830
and how to get that network capable

174
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:33,653
and ready here in the next
couple of couple slides.

175
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,110
So this is a complicated diagram

176
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:40,260
but it's complicated on purpose.

177
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,370
It's actually meant to be this really

178
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:46,000
an illustration to show
a couple of things.

179
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,360
First that it's a system of, you know,

180
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,070
nodes working together.

181
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:56,070
It's not a top down, you
know, directed, you know,

182
00:08:56,810 --> 00:09:00,030
a set of actions that the different nodes

183
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:04,490
in the system that we envision
need to be coordinated.

184
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:06,610
And there needs to be some common approach

185
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:09,780
to how they conduct their operations

186
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:13,829
common information flows
and situational awareness.

187
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:15,500
We also wanted to stress

188
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,760
that it certainly involves
nodes that are governmental

189
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,380
and not just in the federal government

190
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:23,490
but also in the private sector

191
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:25,960
both the operators of technology

192
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:29,250
and infrastructures group that they form.

193
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,660
And I think we also want
to stress the notion

194
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:34,319
that we don't see these nodes,

195
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,020
are very much building on you know

196
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:40,100
a lot of the work and organizations
that have taken place.

197
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:43,780
We're not calling for a new
system with a new set of nodes.

198
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:48,780
It's really a new way to
operate our capabilities,

199
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,100
assess whether they can
actually meet the challenges

200
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,143
we've identified in the scenarios.

201
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,140
So if I take a quick look you know

202
00:09:56,140 --> 00:10:00,780
what we hope for is that if we
understand the contingencies

203
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:04,140
we'll increasingly know which
nodes would be responsible

204
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,530
for conducting what sorts

205
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:09,189
of projected operations or
act, you know, responses,

206
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:12,270
in those contingencies
that you would have a basis

207
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:14,533
for assessing whether they were capable

208
00:10:14,533 --> 00:10:17,900
for giving contingency,
if they were activated,

209
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,800
of performing the things that we think

210
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,589
that that would be necessary.

211
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:24,270
And then the sort of
last major recommendation

212
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:26,329
that we fundamentally believe training

213
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:30,260
and exercising and working
together proactively

214
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:34,140
before we have a crisis will
make us much more capable.

215
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:37,463
In the case of a specific scenario.

216
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:43,100
I'm not going to go
into the next five sort

217
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,040
of recommendations that
we made which really are

218
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:51,040
about enabling just a couple
of thoughts which was one

219
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:54,980
you know we distinguished between the sort

220
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:59,230
of recommendations that were
about sort of instantiate

221
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:03,743
you know, instantiating
contingencies and the new network.

222
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:07,350
We think in terms of enabling

223
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:09,030
these are things that
would need to occur to

224
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:13,020
make that network function
at a higher, higher level.

225
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,569
Many of which have been discussed

226
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:17,140
in other sorts of reports and analysis

227
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:21,500
including the solarium
commission, you know, everything,

228
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,640
you know, that's listed here on the slide.

229
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:27,100
So again, encourage people to dig in,

230
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,130
I guess the one, again,

231
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:32,950
maybe the point to where
I think we added a new set

232
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:37,510
of thinking is the notion of
building trust and confidence.

233
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:39,590
One of the things we found
over and over again in

234
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:44,590
our work is a limitation that
has really crept increasingly

235
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:49,120
into the system is the
fact that the different

236
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,090
nodes need to understand they'll

237
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:52,840
have confidence in each other.

238
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,170
So we explicitly called out the types

239
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:57,729
of things that would be necessary for

240
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:59,287
for trust between the private sector

241
00:11:59,287 --> 00:12:02,403
and the government and in
between nodes in the system.

242
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:08,400
So with that, I think I've
reached the end of the my time,

243
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,010
at least that to get us started

244
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:13,253
and Erica I will turn it over
to you for your thoughts.

245
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:16,070
- Great thanks so much, Greg.

246
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:20,220
So you know from my perspective
an important contribution

247
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:23,470
of the New York cyber task
force was to stress test some

248
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:24,660
of the recommendations

249
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,209
from the cyberspace solarium commission

250
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:29,060
about operational collaboration

251
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:32,359
through the different scenarios
that Greg just spoke to.

252
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:36,258
And also to sort of
explore how we could extend

253
00:12:36,258 --> 00:12:39,040
the commission's
recommendations to address

254
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,860
in more detail, how they
might be implemented.

255
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,930
To give you some brief
background on the commission,

256
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,130
the cyberspace solarium commission is

257
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:48,610
a congressional commission.

258
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:49,650
It was established

259
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:53,000
in the 2019 national
defense authorization act.

260
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,370
And its purpose was to develop a strategy

261
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:59,480
and a set of policy recommendations
to defend the nation

262
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,960
in cyber in cyberspace

263
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,960
against cyber attacks of
significant consequences

264
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,270
and a core part

265
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:08,319
of the commission's ultimate
recommendations was grounded

266
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,360
in improving how the
government can work together

267
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,260
with the private sector to
defend the nation in cyberspace

268
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,819
the commission put forth a number

269
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,620
of different recommendations
that were aimed

270
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,300
at achieving that.

271
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,132
Some of them

272
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,437
like the Senate confirmed
national cyber director

273
00:13:23,437 --> 00:13:27,940
were subsequently created
into law and the 2021 NDAA.

274
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:32,260
Others the commission is
continuing to sort of elaborate on

275
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,920
and work toward.

276
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,209
And I would say overall the
take home point in terms

277
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:40,010
of the New York cyber task
force is that our task

278
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:44,420
force strongly validated the
solarium commissions emphasis

279
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,079
on operational collaboration

280
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,870
between the government
and the private sector.

281
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:52,160
So moving beyond existing
information sharing models

282
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,550
to more meaningful

283
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:56,770
and institutionalized and
ongoing collaboration.

284
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:59,125
And I just thought I would highlight three

285
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:02,290
solarium commission
recommendations that I saw

286
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:05,120
as being sort of a common thread

287
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,700
throughout the different scenarios

288
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,080
at the New York cyber
task force workshops.

289
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,250
And then the kind

290
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:14,460
of helped inform the task
force's ultimate recommendations.

291
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:17,840
The first is creating a
joint cyber planning office

292
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,890
with Insiza

293
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:22,810
which was established in
law in this past NDAA cycle.

294
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:24,959
And the point of the
joint separate planning

295
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:29,450
office was to facilitate
this comprehensive planning

296
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:31,850
of defensive cyber security
campaigns that would

297
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:33,910
include both federal government

298
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:36,620
and private sector stakeholders.

299
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:39,240
The second solarium recommendation that,

300
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,230
you know played heavily

301
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:44,030
in the New York cyber task
forces scenarios was the idea

302
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:47,890
of this integrated cyber
center also with Insiza

303
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:50,960
to support critical infrastructure
security and resilience.

304
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:54,550
And this is another recommendation
that was incorporated

305
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:57,410
into the 2021 NDAA.

306
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:59,500
And then finally the
commission recommended

307
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,480
creating a joint collaborative environment

308
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,950
which did not make it
into this past NDAA cycle.

309
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:08,450
We'll see what happens in
the next the NDAA cycle

310
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,240
but the joint collaborative environment

311
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,330
was meant to be sort of a central hub

312
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:14,113
for fusing information from the government

313
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:15,800
from the private sector

314
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,930
at classified and unclassified levels

315
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:20,949
about cyber threats, malware forensics,

316
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:22,610
data from network monitoring programs,

317
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:24,630
and so on to enable getting

318
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:26,550
at that more comprehensive picture

319
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,479
of the threat environment

320
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,090
and that shared situational awareness

321
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:32,200
and the joint collaborative
environment was meant to feed

322
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,920
into and support the efforts

323
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,500
of the joint cyber planning office

324
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,420
and integrated cyber center.

325
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:40,649
So as we workshop the
four different scenarios

326
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:44,420
in the New York cyber task
force and stress tested some

327
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,839
of these commissioned recommendations

328
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,660
I think the New York
cyber task forces report

329
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:53,860
presents a vision of what the
commission's recommendations

330
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:57,430
on operational collaboration
might look like in practice.

331
00:15:57,430 --> 00:16:00,709
And to me there's sort of two
points that stand out in terms

332
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:04,100
of how the New York cyber task
force pushed the ball forward

333
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,637
in terms of the solarium
commission's recommendations

334
00:16:06,637 --> 00:16:08,709
and operational collaboration.

335
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:11,348
The first and Greg mentioned
this in his discussion

336
00:16:11,348 --> 00:16:12,890
is this idea

337
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:16,270
of institutionalizing
collaboration on a routine basis

338
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:18,870
before a crisis takes place.

339
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:21,300
Stakeholders need to
learn how to work together

340
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:24,560
and to iterate working together
before a crisis happens.

341
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,219
And this requires a lot of things.

342
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:30,160
It requires establishing shoulder
to shoulder joint training

343
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,919
and routinely exercising
playbooks that are developed

344
00:16:32,919 --> 00:16:34,960
with stakeholders from the government

345
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,970
and the private sector
before crises occur.

346
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:40,445
So that if, and when they do happen,

347
00:16:40,445 --> 00:16:43,020
response teams don't have
to waste valuable time

348
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:46,150
trying to figure out how
to actually work together.

349
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:48,910
And I also think what's
interesting is there is you know

350
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:51,870
there should be a learning
element to these exercises.

351
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,740
So that gaps that are identified

352
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:56,060
through them can then be remediated

353
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,790
and addressed in advance.

354
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:01,439
The second important point
from my perspective has to do

355
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,790
with real collaborative analysis.

356
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,980
It's important to have rapid

357
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:09,270
and synchronous threatened
information sharing

358
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:12,170
but that alone is insufficient.

359
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:14,460
What you also need is this sort

360
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:17,190
of vision of co-located analysis,

361
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:20,520
where the government and
private sector analysts

362
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,960
are able to sit side by
side and work together

363
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,980
on shared threats

364
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:28,420
and this would also help
improve strategic warning.

365
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:30,910
So being able to not just respond

366
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:34,010
to malicious behavior
after it's already occurred

367
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:37,970
but ideally to anticipate
impending adversary activity

368
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:39,733
and get left of boom.

369
00:17:40,725 --> 00:17:42,270
And so for this to happen

370
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,030
the private sector has to be involved

371
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:46,420
in helping to define what indicators

372
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,720
and warnings are of adversary activity.

373
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,720
Not only because they see so much,

374
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,410
the private sector see so much

375
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,570
of how threat actors are
operating on their own networks

376
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:58,340
but also because they have unique

377
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,580
and industry specific
knowledge and expertise

378
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,260
that can help identify what
those indicators should be.

379
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:07,780
So overall I'm hopeful that
the New York cyber task forces

380
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:10,379
work can help inform ongoing efforts

381
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,290
at improving operational
collaboration that are

382
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:13,680
happening right now

383
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,810
and being implemented across
the federal government.

384
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:17,360
And I look forward to seeing how

385
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,973
how our work plays out over the next year.

386
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:20,403
So over to you, Michael.

387
00:18:21,515 --> 00:18:23,190
- Thanks, Erica.

388
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:27,300
So I want to talk a
little bit today about how

389
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:31,072
we actually make operational
collaboration work in practice.

390
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:35,160
And so that term, Greg has mentioned it,

391
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,260
Erica has been talking about it.

392
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,020
So what do we actually mean?

393
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:41,160
To me operational
collaboration means not just

394
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,950
sharing information

395
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:47,370
but actually taking
operational activities actions

396
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:52,370
and synchronizing them in
time and intent so that the

397
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:55,229
you can better achieve
strategic objectives

398
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:57,893
of either disrupting what
the bad guys are doing

399
00:18:57,893 --> 00:19:00,890
as Erica was talking about left of boom,

400
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:03,900
or if we find ourselves
after an event has happened

401
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:07,420
and needing to respond to it
and to stop an ongoing event

402
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:11,090
for example, that we can
do that more effectively.

403
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:14,500
And given the capabilities that reside

404
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:19,500
in the private sector, the
ownership of the assets,

405
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,320
the literally the IT
infrastructure of most

406
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,350
of the planet is owned
by the private sector.

407
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:27,370
So how do you, you need
the private sector,

408
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:30,569
and the government actually
working together to make that

409
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:33,690
to make those effects happen and to happen

410
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:36,146
at the scale that we want them to happen.

411
00:19:36,146 --> 00:19:37,470
Now we've been struggling

412
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:41,810
with information sharing for 20, 25 years.

413
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:43,379
So if we think information sharing is hard

414
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,807
operational collaboration is even harder.

415
00:19:45,807 --> 00:19:49,440
Now it happens and it happens frequently.

416
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,860
As a matter of fact,
there are ad hoc groups,

417
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:54,500
that come together that
take action together.

418
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,333
We've seen it.

419
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:59,520
We saw just this past fall with emo tech

420
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,780
and a very effective take-down
operation that happened

421
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,020
against them.

422
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:07,449
The challenge is that those
operations do not happen

423
00:20:07,449 --> 00:20:11,720
at the scope and the scale
and the cadence that we need.

424
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,310
And particularly when you start looking at

425
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:16,360
the scenarios that the New York
cyber task force was dealing

426
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:21,020
with these very high end
cyber events that are

427
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:24,370
highly disruptive across
much of the infrastructure

428
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:26,040
it's unlikely that sort

429
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:31,040
of these ad hoc informal
groups will be sufficient all

430
00:20:31,427 --> 00:20:32,612
on their own.

431
00:20:34,449 --> 00:20:36,977
And so how do we actually make that?

432
00:20:36,977 --> 00:20:37,850
How do we make that happen?

433
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:39,040
How do we scale up?

434
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,010
How do we broaden the scope?

435
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:42,590
How do we increase the cadence

436
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:44,429
of what we're trying to achieve?

437
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:46,850
And that is what the New
York cyber task forces

438
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:49,060
recommendations really focused on.

439
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,830
And a major piece of that

440
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,860
was that national cyber readiness network

441
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,558
that Greg was referring to.

442
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:56,020
And what that really is

443
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,690
is it's actually taking the internet,

444
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,500
the structure of the internet itself

445
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,570
and making it work for the good guys

446
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:05,409
as opposed to just against the
bad and against the bad guys

447
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:07,380
as opposed to just for the bad guys

448
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:12,060
which is that the internet
itself is a network of networks.

449
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:15,780
It is a series of nodes that
are highly connected together.

450
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:18,530
So we want to do that in

451
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:22,710
in a readiness network and
make those connections firmer

452
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:26,490
make those connections
more real if you will.

453
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:27,700
And so you can think

454
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:31,695
of it as really a node and cell concept.

455
00:21:31,695 --> 00:21:35,970
So the nodes would be
permanent organizations

456
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:39,130
and out in the private sector,
some in the government,

457
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:41,100
but the ones in the
private sector would really

458
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,159
serve a couple of purposes.

459
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:47,910
One, they would help build
that longterm relationship,

460
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:49,310
those legal agreements,

461
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:51,187
that the government has to have in place

462
00:21:51,188 --> 00:21:54,830
in order for it to function
well, it would be there.

463
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:56,810
Those places could be the repositories

464
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:58,740
for the lessons that have been learned

465
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:02,670
on previous operations to
improve future operations.

466
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:04,990
They could be the enablers
of the infrastructure.

467
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,570
So you don't have to rebuild
it every time you want to go

468
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:09,463
and do a new collaboration.

469
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,649
In essence you can sort of think

470
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:15,643
of them as the co-work spaces
for operational collaboration.

471
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:20,200
The action is actually carried
out by what you can think of

472
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,740
as threat cells or, you know,
action groups, working groups,

473
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,220
whatever you want to call them.

474
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:28,750
But these are more informal
elements that come together

475
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,500
as needed to deal with a particular threat

476
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,820
with the relevant players
from both the public

477
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,092
and the private sector,

478
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:39,840
they can come together
underneath one of these cells

479
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,510
in essence and sort of fall
in on the infrastructure

480
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:43,980
that's already there.

481
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:46,100
And so that builds on Greg's point,

482
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,840
builds on Erica's point
about like that way

483
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,520
you're not rebuilding
everything every single time.

484
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:53,510
You're trying to do a collaboration.

485
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:56,620
And in this way,

486
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,745
we think that you can
dramatically scale up,

487
00:22:58,746 --> 00:23:00,100
broaden the scope

488
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,959
and increase that cadence of operations so

489
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,200
that we can start to
have a meaningful impact

490
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,660
on the adversary's, both
proactively, left of boom,

491
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:13,880
and to really shrink down
and reduce the impact

492
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:17,230
of anything that does go wrong
so that we can also respond

493
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:21,350
and recover much more quickly
from those kinds of events.

494
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:24,367
Now obviously you know the
private sector operates

495
00:23:24,367 --> 00:23:27,980
in very different ways from the government

496
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:31,810
and these in informal
ad hoc groups that exist

497
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:33,960
outside of any sort of
formal arrangements.

498
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,230
Of course they are going
to continue to exist

499
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:39,013
and they will continue to
get together and do stuff.

500
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,210
And this is not meant to say
that those things should stop

501
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:47,690
but we want to provide a way
a structure that bridges some

502
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:49,520
of those gaps between the private sector

503
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,026
and the public sector in
a way that will actually

504
00:23:52,026 --> 00:23:56,570
improve the cybersecurity
of the entire ecosystem.

505
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:58,580
So I just want to close by saying,

506
00:23:58,580 --> 00:23:59,413
I'm really proud

507
00:23:59,413 --> 00:24:01,410
of the work that the New
York cyber task force did.

508
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:02,800
I think that looking

509
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,680
at challenging scenarios
that push the envelope

510
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:09,180
but are still realistic, you know,

511
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,810
that could actually happen

512
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:13,629
and force us to really think
about where the shortfalls

513
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:16,550
and the gaps are, was
really, really important.

514
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:19,480
And as Greg said I highly
recommend taking a look

515
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,240
at that report because
I think it did a lot

516
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,150
of really good work
and built upon the work

517
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:27,800
of the Slater commission
quite effectively.

518
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,690
But now I'm going to turn
it over to Christopher.

519
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:31,530
So he could talk a little
bit about his experience

520
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:33,570
actually making operational
collaboration work

521
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:36,023
from the perspective of
the financial sector.

522
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:38,320
- Thank you, Michael.

523
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,320
And I'll just piggy back
on Michael's compliments

524
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:45,280
on the task forces work
Greg, and thank you, Erica.

525
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,899
I think you've covered you know

526
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:51,900
what operational collaboration
looks like, you know,

527
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:54,560
in a pretty detailed way.

528
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:57,310
Let me tell you what my organization does.

529
00:24:57,310 --> 00:25:02,003
Cause I think sometimes,
you know, there's this,

530
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:05,840
when we're talking about
operational collaboration

531
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,550
I'm reminded of my early days

532
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:10,820
or the early days of the
department of Homeland security.

533
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:12,373
When, you know,

534
00:25:12,373 --> 00:25:16,210
when I first heard the term
information sharing and

535
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:18,390
which I and this was in
the context of review

536
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:22,100
in like a 200 page document
describing an information

537
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:25,392
sharing environment and I didn't get it.

538
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,429
Yeah I mean, that was my initial reaction.

539
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:31,700
I mean, the concept of
info sharing I got, right.

540
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,533
You know

541
00:25:32,533 --> 00:25:35,139
communicate things down here
that will help better defend

542
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:37,833
against X, Y, or Z there and vice versa.

543
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:42,240
But the thing I didn't get
was why do we need you know

544
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,760
200 pages worth on that.

545
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:48,540
But as I, you know, got acquainted, I,

546
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:51,240
it turns out my initial
impression was right.

547
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,040
You know, I didn't get it.

548
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:56,600
And then doing that simple
thing requires you know

549
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,560
breaking down a lot

550
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:00,820
of institutional barriers,
thinking through authority,

551
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:04,520
real authorities issues,
there's technology issues,

552
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:07,970
there's geography issues or resources.

553
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:10,476
There's all of these
things that need to happen

554
00:26:10,476 --> 00:26:13,427
in order to make a muscle
movement like that happen.

555
00:26:13,427 --> 00:26:17,679
And I bring that up because I mean

556
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,500
first information sharing went

557
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:24,270
from concept to a professional
discipline with you know

558
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:26,379
pretty well understood norms

559
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:29,570
over however long the development was

560
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:32,748
was certainly since the first
time I became acquainted

561
00:26:32,748 --> 00:26:34,688
to where it is today right,

562
00:26:34,688 --> 00:26:36,699
it's a well understood thing.

563
00:26:36,699 --> 00:26:41,699
And but my initial reaction to
that is I think you also get

564
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:43,630
that a lot when you start talking

565
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:45,640
about operational collaboration.

566
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,390
Right you know, well, yeah, great idea.

567
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:48,260
We should work together.

568
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:49,840
Right aren't we doing that?

569
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,909
And to both Michael and Erica's points

570
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:56,930
that's where we are in
some ways but be careful

571
00:26:56,930 --> 00:26:59,410
with that instinct that say
we're already doing it right.

572
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:04,283
Because all of the authorities
resourcing, you know, issues,

573
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:07,810
all the issues I just described

574
00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:10,684
for standing up an information
sharing environment exists

575
00:27:10,684 --> 00:27:13,700
in order to connect
those bubbles that were

576
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,070
on Greg's, you know,

577
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:18,803
the slide that Greg showed
and operationalize those.

578
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:24,970
So our role, I want to be,

579
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:29,010
this too was lesson learned in the past.

580
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:31,230
You know be specific
about what you're doing

581
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:32,620
and what you need.

582
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:36,459
And don't pretend that
you know meeting this much

583
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:39,830
of a requirement, you know,
it's the whole thing right?

584
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:42,659
Because that too interferes with progress.

585
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:46,790
Michael's organization has
a really distinct role,

586
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,443
you know in ecosystem.

587
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,390
Mine is this,

588
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:53,250
our organization, the arc,

589
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:58,250
we so we're founded on the
pretty simple concept that

590
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:04,120
that there are critical
functions, DHS as defined them.

591
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:09,120
And those functions are
supported by critical assets.

592
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:13,210
And some of those assets
reside in the private sector.

593
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:14,623
And regardless of the fact

594
00:28:14,623 --> 00:28:16,820
that in the private sector is tough

595
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,659
successful cyber attack
on those would have

596
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:22,233
could have a national
security level impact.

597
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,990
What we do is try to understand

598
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:31,320
at a very deep level what those assets are

599
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,179
and then work to

600
00:28:34,301 --> 00:28:37,040
well take some upfront resiliency measures

601
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:42,040
and build in the some sort
of intelligence capabilities

602
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:44,890
so that we can identify
threats to those systems.

603
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:47,880
It's the reduce the impact

604
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,963
of the likelihood of an event
that Michael spoke to earlier.

605
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,400
Doing that requires, you know,

606
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,080
requires a collaborative effort.

607
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,953
That sounds a lot like the
operational collaboration

608
00:29:01,953 --> 00:29:03,760
that we're all describing here, right?

609
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:08,120
We work closely across members

610
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:12,437
across the financial service
sector, the energy sector.

611
00:29:12,438 --> 00:29:17,438
We work with double digit
numbers of government agencies.

612
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,940
We work with the ice act.

613
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:22,680
We work with, you know,
trade organization.

614
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,790
I'm sure I'm forgetting someone

615
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:27,440
but the point behind the effort is

616
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,963
that understanding those
risks and doing something

617
00:29:29,963 --> 00:29:34,550
about them at a deep level
requires something more than

618
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:37,248
than the regular meetings, you know,

619
00:29:37,248 --> 00:29:41,110
and it's more than what we're doing now

620
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:43,729
but I will say this, that,

621
00:29:44,766 --> 00:29:48,560
and Michael's introduction
you know the example

622
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:51,107
of a place where we're doing
operational collaboration

623
00:29:51,107 --> 00:29:54,160
the arc is finding its way

624
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:57,653
with a multitude of
government partners and

625
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:02,180
and private sector firms
and all the whole ecosystem

626
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:06,960
I just mentioned in a way
that is, is, you know,

627
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,780
solving a lot of those problems

628
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,910
that we talked about that there's

629
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:14,290
is it the shoulder to
shoulder collaboration

630
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:18,273
which shoulder shoulder in
2020 is not the greatest way

631
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:22,170
of thinking about it,
but in longterm, it is.

632
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:25,060
But the you know is it
the shoulder to shoulder

633
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:25,893
kind of collaboration we're talking about,

634
00:30:25,893 --> 00:30:28,093
in some places it is.

635
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:33,100
In some places it's less than
that, but you're, you know,

636
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:37,020
I think the ecosystem is
moving in the right direction

637
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:39,907
and we're solving a lot of these problems.

638
00:30:39,907 --> 00:30:42,514
And so I know we're getting short on time

639
00:30:42,515 --> 00:30:45,797
so Greg I believe this
before I turn it back to you.

640
00:30:45,797 --> 00:30:47,193
- Thanks Chris.

641
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,220
Yep and I think we

642
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:52,210
we've got some time for
questions and, you know,

643
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:54,481
I think I'd like to pose
the first one really

644
00:30:54,481 --> 00:30:56,930
to the others and maybe just I'll

645
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:59,600
I'll lead in with the
thought, but you know,

646
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,780
now we've laid out a pretty expansive set

647
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:06,110
of things that the think
about it could be done.

648
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:10,229
I'd ask everybody what
the specific next step is

649
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:13,170
and also to lean in with my belief that

650
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:16,320
you know that the first
step is to actually

651
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,830
establish some national
cyber contingencies

652
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:21,590
that we would plan towards, right.

653
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:22,480
That we need to move

654
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,820
beyond reacting to the
events of the day and really

655
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:29,610
establish what those national
cyber contingencies are

656
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:30,949
and have a system for that.

657
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:31,940
But with that

658
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:34,420
I'd ask each of you to
sort of if you were to

659
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:39,420
have one thing that you
would have be the focus

660
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:43,690
of these efforts in this upcoming
year, what would that be?

661
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:46,530
Erica I guess I'll start with you and then

662
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:50,010
sort of the same batting
order that we used previously.

663
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:52,480
- Sure so I guess you
know from my perspective

664
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,260
especially coming from the
solarium commission, you know,

665
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:57,070
I would say on the government side

666
00:31:57,070 --> 00:32:00,000
I think the clear next step is
for the president to nominate

667
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,550
and the Senate to confirm
a national cyber director

668
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:06,730
you know, as well as to figure
out how the office, you know,

669
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:09,010
the overall office of the
national cyber director

670
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:09,843
should be structured,

671
00:32:09,843 --> 00:32:11,010
how it should be staffed,

672
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:13,210
how it will interact
with the private sector,

673
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:14,932
how to define roles and responsibilities

674
00:32:14,932 --> 00:32:17,710
in relation to other
stakeholders in the government

675
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:20,070
especially the deputy
national security advisor

676
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:22,110
for cyber and emerging
tech and with Insiza.

677
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:24,729
And so I think that the NCD exists

678
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:27,770
and so figuring out, you
know, how to, you know,

679
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:30,353
create it is, is the next clear step.

680
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,667
- Thank you, Michael.

681
00:32:33,929 --> 00:32:36,600
- I think Greg, I think that, you know,

682
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:40,330
in addition to actually standing
the office of the national

683
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:44,619
Cyber director I agree
with you that picking a few

684
00:32:44,619 --> 00:32:48,470
and starting contingencies
and starting to plan

685
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:51,430
towards them, they will
inevitably not be the right ones,

686
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:55,670
in the sense of that contingency
probably won't actually

687
00:32:55,670 --> 00:33:00,550
happen but it's the process
of planning for a contingency

688
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:02,399
that will enable you to
deal with whatever it is

689
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,650
that actually does occur.

690
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:07,480
It's kind of like the old
saying that of, of Eisenhower's,

691
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:10,440
you know, the plan is nothing
planning is everything.

692
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,913
So it's actually the,
that's the value of those,

693
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:16,020
you know, national cyber contingencies.

694
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:19,920
The other piece that I would
say is we just need to try

695
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:23,480
like we need to actually try
some operational collaboration

696
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:28,480
efforts at a broader scale
and see where we go wrong.

697
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:30,790
Right, where does it fall down?

698
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:33,483
Where does it, you know, trip over itself?

699
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:37,549
And build on those lessons learned

700
00:33:37,549 --> 00:33:41,120
and so that we can do
better the next time.

701
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,229
So I would you know I would
say I think it's going to

702
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:46,950
be very important for the government

703
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:49,190
and the private sector to
just start exercising some

704
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:52,780
of this you know we
can analyze it to death

705
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:55,670
and the government is very,
very good at doing that.

706
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:57,963
And we just need to, we just need to try.

707
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,240
- Appreciate it.

708
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,360
And, you know, no, you turned
to you, Chris, and, you know,

709
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,889
my belief is the FSR
can now the arc was one

710
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:08,280
place that we've been trying.

711
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,120
So as a person

712
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:12,480
at the frontline of
operational collaboration

713
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,949
what do you think the
sort of thing you'd focus

714
00:34:15,949 --> 00:34:17,529
on this year would be?

715
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:19,580
- I agree with that.

716
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:22,167
I think there's two parts
of the question, right?

717
00:34:22,167 --> 00:34:24,710
You know, the corporate side
and the government side.

718
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:27,620
I think on the corporate
the private sector

719
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:31,279
the corporate leadership
side that standing

720
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:35,870
up organizations like mine,
like, like Michael's, you know,

721
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:38,109
where the private sector
is coming together

722
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:42,010
in that node that the
government can interface with

723
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:45,330
in a scalable way around
these national security level

724
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:46,909
cyber readiness problems.

725
00:34:46,909 --> 00:34:49,589
I think there's a very
much an element of like

726
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:51,226
let's make that work

727
00:34:51,226 --> 00:34:54,859
and the way Michael's describing,
on the government side,

728
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:59,860
I think that the you know,
not to, you know, say,

729
00:35:01,049 --> 00:35:01,882
I don't want to say, keep
doing what we're doing, but I,

730
00:35:01,882 --> 00:35:04,460
there are models that exist already

731
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:08,430
for how operational
collaboration can work, right?

732
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:09,712
It's where it's work.

733
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:13,460
Proved that we can work together

734
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:16,320
in ways that are, if not,

735
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,150
exactly as described
in the cyber task force

736
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:21,920
that are approaching

737
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,730
and that it is repetition
and the exercising

738
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:28,750
that muscle move in the expansion of it

739
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:32,400
I think like recognize that
national security treatment

740
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,633
and then keep building on that concept.

741
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:39,360
- Thanks we just have
a couple minutes left.

742
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:44,100
So I'm gonna you know Michael
you had raised a point

743
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:47,576
for us as we were discussing
the panel to lay that out

744
00:35:47,576 --> 00:35:51,410
and I'm going to actually go
to you to answer the question

745
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:53,290
which is, you know, you and I, actually,

746
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:56,980
everybody in this panel has
worked together to some degree

747
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:59,950
this sort of notion that you know

748
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:02,089
the governments need formal structures

749
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:05,317
and authorities to get things done

750
00:36:05,317 --> 00:36:07,020
and feel authorized to act.

751
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:09,830
But the private sector is often you know

752
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:13,540
much less structured and actually can feel

753
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:17,660
like if that's enforced upon
them, you resist collaboration.

754
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:21,140
How do we square the, those two circles?

755
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:22,600
- Yeah I think that this is one

756
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:26,630
of the most challenging
parts of, of the area,

757
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:28,180
because as you said, Greg,

758
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:31,569
like for the government for
very good reason, right?

759
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:33,080
Because we're a nation of laws

760
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:35,450
and we believe in limited government.

761
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:37,490
So we don't want the government to just

762
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:40,279
have free rein to go do whatever
it wants whenever it wants.

763
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,890
Right we want it to have structure

764
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:44,450
and process and constraints, right?

765
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:46,730
We want those things on the government

766
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:50,450
but a lot of times that's an
anathema to the private sector.

767
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:52,710
And so if you start talking

768
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:55,170
about MOU's and legal
agreements and you know

769
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:58,640
their head starts to explode
and then they just walk away.

770
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:03,390
And so what we really have to
think about doing is creating

771
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:05,549
and that's why I think
these nodes that could exist

772
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:09,430
in the private sector that
are non-profits for example

773
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:11,049
things like the arc, things like CTA,

774
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:13,510
there are other organizations
that could do that

775
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:16,439
that can serve as that
bridging function that allow

776
00:37:16,439 --> 00:37:19,490
that informality to happen
on the private sector side

777
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:21,810
but give the government
someplace that they can plug

778
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:25,460
into reliably over and over again

779
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:29,751
in a way that they can put
into their formal processes.

780
00:37:29,751 --> 00:37:31,680
And yet still allow

781
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,390
for that informal collaboration
to happen and allow

782
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:37,759
for whoever kind of shows
up at the, you know,

783
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,920
at the party that's interested can do so.

784
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:44,310
And I think it's going to
require flexibility on both sides

785
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:46,130
the government to realize that the,

786
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:48,130
a lot of the private sector
players are never going to play

787
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:51,330
by play by their rules,

788
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:53,850
but also the private sector
realizing that the rules exist

789
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:55,870
for the government for a good reason

790
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:59,790
and that some accommodation
needs to be made for them.

791
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:03,144
And so I think it's really
doing that education of

792
00:38:03,144 --> 00:38:06,379
of both sides and building that trust

793
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:09,516
over time and establishing
those places as kind of the

794
00:38:09,516 --> 00:38:12,290
that that's the known
clubhouse, if you will,

795
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,060
where you can go to actually do that kind

796
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:16,190
of operational collaboration

797
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:17,440
and it's going to take time to build that

798
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,550
but I think that's what we need to do.

799
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:20,383
- Alright.

800
00:38:20,383 --> 00:38:21,290
Thank you, Michael.

801
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:24,009
I think we're probably at the point

802
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,850
at which I want to thank everybody.

803
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:29,640
I, the three of you for
participating both in the panel,

804
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,759
but also all the work that you did

805
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,570
as part of the task force,
but the work you do every day,

806
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:39,740
and thank RSA and the
audience, hopefully, you know,

807
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:43,049
we brought forward a concept,
operational collaboration,

808
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:45,750
but also the notion that
we're not yet ready.

809
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:46,583
I'd asked you

810
00:38:46,583 --> 00:38:48,870
if you have the opportunity
to read the report.

811
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:51,569
I think you know a group worked mightily

812
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:54,857
over a year to lay out some
really important thinking

813
00:38:54,857 --> 00:38:58,040
and some practical
recommendations on next steps.

814
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,050
So the extent to which we're all part

815
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:03,490
of a community and need to
work together in a you know

816
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:06,330
bonds of trust across the
government and the private sector.

817
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:09,110
I just ask everybody to go
forward and do that work.

818
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:11,050
So thank you very much.

819
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:12,463
And everybody be well.

820
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:17,130
- Thanks Greg.

821
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:18,286
- Thank you.

822
00:39:18,286 --> 00:39:19,119
- Thanks.
