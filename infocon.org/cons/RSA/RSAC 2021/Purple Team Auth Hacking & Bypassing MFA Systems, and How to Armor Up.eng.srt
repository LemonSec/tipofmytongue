1
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:03,320
- Hi, I'm Dan Houser.

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:06,930
I've been doing security
full-time for about 21 years,

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:09,280
mostly in strategy and architecture.

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,299
I'm gonna talk to you today

5
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:12,580
about multi-factor authentication,

6
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:14,420
how it can be hacked and bypassed

7
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:16,770
and how we need to change to armor up.

8
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:17,602
Well, first of all,

9
00:00:17,603 --> 00:00:20,280
why do we even have
multi-factored authentication?

10
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,130
Well, we all know why,

11
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:23,820
it's 'cause passwords
are completely terrible.

12
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,980
We've seen very broad
adoption by industry,

13
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:28,680
Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp.

14
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,169
The list goes on,

15
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:34,770
and industry has adopted
MFA across wide sectors,

16
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,313
perhaps mandated by banking
regulators, by fiat.

17
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:40,089
And I don't know if
we're exactly there yet

18
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:41,810
but it seems that we're very close

19
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:46,593
to legally that MFA is a
reasonable standard of due care.

20
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:48,733
But does it work

21
00:00:48,733 --> 00:00:51,690
when we take a multi-factor
authentication solution

22
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:54,280
intended for a very specific use case

23
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,400
and apply it elsewhere?

24
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,330
Because multi-factored auth works great

25
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:59,080
for a specific use case,

26
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,353
like banking via an ATM,

27
00:01:01,373 --> 00:01:05,560
chip and PIN purchase, e-commerce, voting.

28
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,520
All of these are multi-factored
authentication solutions

29
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,270
that work very well,

30
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:13,369
but we're challenged when
we take a point solution

31
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:16,050
designed to solve a very specific problem,

32
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:19,520
and extend it to a broad
use case in an enterprise

33
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,630
with many integration points
and many entry points.

34
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:25,630
So is it working in that context?

35
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:30,259
Well, sort of a Dr. Evil
"working" kind of way.

36
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,350
There are lots of challenges.

37
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:34,277
Now I like MFA. MFA's great.

38
00:01:34,277 --> 00:01:37,240
Not saying MFA is bad, but
there are some challenges

39
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,089
that we need to go into
with our eyes wide open

40
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:42,730
and really understand what we're getting,

41
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:45,000
and not just gloss MFA as the solution,

42
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,523
say my job here is done.

43
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,740
We won't cover all of these,
but let's dive into a few.

44
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:53,470
And let's talk about, perhaps first,

45
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:55,130
the presumption of path.

46
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:57,490
And with this, I wanna
talk about a little bit

47
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:00,880
of a parable and the lock icon.

48
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,220
Now before you fanboys of
Harry Potter get too excited,

49
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,320
to my knowledge, there
is not a Wizards Bank.

50
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,139
You cannot actually convert your galleons

51
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:10,759
into muggles currency,

52
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:14,399
but the visitor to a website,
perhaps a banking website,

53
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,090
would be encouraged they
know who they're talking to

54
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:18,990
because of the lock icon.

55
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:22,610
And they can see the HTTPS, if
they're a little tech savvy.

56
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:25,430
They can see that it seems
to be the right domain name

57
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,330
if they've been taught against phishing.

58
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:29,940
And they have that confidence
the lock icon is there.

59
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:30,920
It's great.

60
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,239
And it's doing what we need it to do.

61
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:37,080
But (laughs) realistically,
the lock icon doesn't work.

62
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,720
It's there to indicate
authentication to the user

63
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,090
that they're talking to
who they think they are.

64
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,570
And from an engineering
perspective, it's perfect auth.

65
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:47,540
I mean, the technical bits work,

66
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:50,920
but it completely fails the grandma test.

67
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,660
And that's why people get phished.

68
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:57,299
In fact, Paul Kocher, who was on the team

69
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:01,380
that helped launch SSL v3
at Netscape back in the day,

70
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,109
he talked about how the lock icon

71
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:04,780
is hardly of much significance,

72
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:07,780
based on all the rest of the
factors that are in the system.

73
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:13,100
So does it keep the conversation
between Alice and Bob safe?

74
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,160
Maybe.

75
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,760
Does it tell you that
Alice knows who Bob is?

76
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,250
Not really.

77
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,890
And why? Why is that?

78
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:22,989
Well, continuing with the parable,

79
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:26,590
I do have a hobby, and those
are some of my treasures there

80
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,630
that I ride around on.

81
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:29,870
I do enjoy motorcycling.

82
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,580
And because of this hobby,

83
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,360
I was pursuing a motorcycle cover,

84
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,580
because, you know, for bikes,

85
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,370
a lot of bikes, needed a cover.

86
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:39,000
And I went out to Amazon and looked,

87
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,100
and I found a motorcycle cover.

88
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:44,829
And I saw the lock and I
had to laugh a little bit

89
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:47,610
because the description
was like, fantastic lock.

90
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,100
Okay.

91
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,160
Security folks, look at this.

92
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,350
There are three dials,
maximum of 1,000 combinations,

93
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:56,730
on average guessable within 500.

94
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,299
It looks like a cheapie lock.

95
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,300
There are probably weaknesses.

96
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,300
You could dial it in

97
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:05,300
and get some take up on the combination,

98
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:10,160
and in probably way fewer than
500 guesses, you busted this.

99
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,587
But I know what you were
thinking, wait a minute,

100
00:04:12,587 --> 00:04:14,928
a TSA code lock?

101
00:04:14,928 --> 00:04:16,279
(laughs) Now that's a joke,

102
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:20,190
because the TSA locks have
a problem, a key problem.

103
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:23,290
And that's because, several years back,

104
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:27,180
the Washington Post and other
sources showed the keys,

105
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,530
and they were kind enough
to cover the numbers,

106
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:31,210
as though the numbers mattered,

107
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:33,299
that you knew which was number seven,

108
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,510
and showed the bidding.

109
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:36,110
It wasn't long (laughs)

110
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:39,010
until there were 3D
printable projects available

111
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:41,200
and anybody can have a master key.

112
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,150
So the fact that you had this weak lock

113
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:49,070
that takes TSA keys that are
widely known and available.

114
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,980
Well, that makes it a really weak lock,

115
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:54,910
but let's not forget,
we're locking a tent,

116
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:58,550
and Amazon sells master
keys for tents as well.

117
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:01,120
As anybody with a Jeep can tell you,

118
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,520
you don't really need a lock for a tent

119
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,152
because a knife will get you in.

120
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:09,670
But wait a minute, we don't
actually have a tent, do we?

121
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:11,900
We have a motorcycle cover,

122
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,863
and motorcycle covers don't have floors.

123
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,419
So they only weigh, in
this case, 20 kilos.

124
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:24,500
Look, the attack vector is lift and throw.

125
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,320
No knife required.

126
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,400
Don't have to go in and
punch the zipper with a pen

127
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,539
or anything like that.

128
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:33,310
Dial the combination,
got your TSA key locks.

129
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,710
It's lift and throw.

130
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:39,239
And this is the problem
with an engineering approach

131
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,720
to a human system, to a complex system.

132
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,750
We tend to focus on the lock.

133
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,563
How many bits are there in the lock?

134
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,000
How many pins and tumblers?

135
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,260
What kind of security does it provide?

136
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,810
And we really need to
look at the system view,

137
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:58,930
looking at all the paths
in, all the weaknesses.

138
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:00,670
Are we putting a lock on a tent

139
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:02,170
when it's just lift and throw?

140
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,530
So this is the problem
with presumption of path,

141
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:08,520
because of an engineering approach.

142
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,330
In many cases, we may
have locked the front door

143
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:12,390
with a hardened MFA,

144
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:14,900
represented by the the
guards, guns, walls, locks.

145
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:15,870
Great.

146
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:18,790
But if the back door's
propped open by the smokers,

147
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,470
then you haven't gained much security

148
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:22,883
by having the guys with
the Uzis out front.

149
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,620
You really need to
understand the entire system.

150
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,180
So it's not just armoring the happy path,

151
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,470
you have to armor all the paths,

152
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:33,920
because bad guys don't
read your use cases.

153
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,640
Bad guys don't follow the rules

154
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,750
and they don't care whether

155
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:40,100
or not you've allocated
budgeting for it, right?

156
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,660
They really are looking at
all the different vectors in,

157
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:46,120
trying to find the easy paths
and the unprotected paths.

158
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,230
And in an enterprise, like as not,

159
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:49,470
you have a lot of paths.

160
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:51,170
I mean, think about it for a minute.

161
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:55,510
Voicemail, email, network
login, wifi, guest wifi.

162
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:58,500
The security guard who's
friendly at the front door.

163
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,360
The even more friendly help
desk that wants to be helpful.

164
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,790
Badge readers, PIN pads. The list goes on.

165
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,180
Lots of different vectors,

166
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,710
lots of different credentials,

167
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:09,599
lots of different strengths.

168
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,750
And probably very few of them

169
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,110
are actually using multi-factored auths.

170
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:16,370
So you need to do a walk about,
from a virtual perspective.

171
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:18,120
Walk around the organization and see

172
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,823
do you have a thin facade?

173
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:23,160
Or had you accounted
for all the vectors in?

174
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,850
And not all paths are electronic.

175
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:27,300
You have to look at the
human paths as well, too.

176
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:29,990
We also have to identify

177
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:32,160
that there are broken factors at play.

178
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,630
Now I'm not saying that
all of these are bad.

179
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:36,670
What I'm saying is that you can't say

180
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:38,490
that I had this factor.

181
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:41,140
It's good. It's secure. We're fine.

182
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,630
You have to really understand that

183
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,840
if you have some broke
or weakened factors,

184
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,450
you have to treat them
as broke or weakened

185
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:51,490
and understand how they apply
to your specific use case

186
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:52,870
and the abuse cases.

187
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,758
'Cause we know that
passwords are horrible.

188
00:07:54,758 --> 00:07:57,070
It's why we have MFA.

189
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,099
We know that PINs are bad.

190
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,500
They're even worse than passwords

191
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,660
because they're far less complex.

192
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:05,220
SMS has been compromised

193
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:09,110
and is decertified as a factor by NIST.

194
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:11,380
It's subject to caller
ID, as are phone calls,

195
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,820
readily spoofed.

196
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,450
Emails, notoriously easy to bypass,

197
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:18,150
and it's the top risk vector for phishing.

198
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:20,370
So do we really want email as a vector

199
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:23,300
for a trusted credential path

200
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,410
when it's so easily compromised?

201
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:27,653
Static tokens,

202
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,150
several VPN solutions have
relied on static tokens

203
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,829
and those get handed around

204
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:35,714
because you wanna get that contractor in,

205
00:08:35,714 --> 00:08:36,760
and before you know it,

206
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,189
you're handing out tokens left and right,

207
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:40,240
and taking away a factor.

208
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,750
Corporate email,

209
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,710
it has some real problems
if you have web mail,

210
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:48,190
because if you permit email
auth as one of your factors

211
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:50,720
for multi-factor authentication solution,

212
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,960
and you're asking for
user ID and password once,

213
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,000
and you're asking for it for web mail,

214
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,820
you don't have multi-factor auth.

215
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:01,650
You have saved factor twice
auth, and that's not MFA.

216
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:03,810
And of course, secret
questions and answers.

217
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:06,469
They've been decertified
by NIST as a factor.

218
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:10,033
And they're pretty horrible,
revealed by social engineering.

219
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,770
They're revealed by your HR department

220
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:13,930
when they wish somebody happy birthday,

221
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:16,189
or happy service anniversary.

222
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:18,680
Yeah, the questions and
answers are pretty terrible

223
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,079
and usually my brother
could answer all of mine.

224
00:09:22,733 --> 00:09:24,660
That's a known bad one.

225
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,750
So you need to look at all your factors

226
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:29,580
for the different MFA solutions you have

227
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,820
with your eyes wide open.

228
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,610
What are you actually employing?

229
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:34,510
And what are the weakest possible

230
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:37,670
situations in which those are deployed?

231
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:39,610
You need to understand that.

232
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:41,680
Let's talk about the human factor,

233
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,229
because something you have is a phone.

234
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:50,230
So if I can break the human
factor, I can violate the notion

235
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:53,939
that we have a factor
in something you have.

236
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,950
So let's talk about a
low-tech hacking attack.

237
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:59,390
I try to point out the low-tech hacks,

238
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,069
and this certainly is one.

239
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:03,720
So this is an attack

240
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,650
against the Azure MFA.

241
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:07,490
Now I like Microsoft.

242
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:11,480
Microsoft has done a tremendous
job over the last 16 years

243
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,840
of the security journey.

244
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,380
I'm not picking on Azure,

245
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:19,870
but this is a auth system that
they, and many others employ.

246
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,740
And you'll recognize this audio clip

247
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,423
certainly when I play it.

248
00:10:27,077 --> 00:10:27,910
- [Announcer] Welcome

249
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:30,390
to Microsoft's sign-in
verification system.

250
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:33,920
Please press the pound key
to finish your verification.

251
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,170
- You press pound (beep).

252
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:39,149
- [Announcer] Your sign-in
was successfully verified.

253
00:10:39,149 --> 00:10:40,610
Good bye.

254
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:43,120
- Okay, and we're all pretty
well familiar with that model.

255
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,880
And you have really two
things happening here.

256
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,730
You have a phone call to
a known enrolled phone

257
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:52,430
that you're saying is an
indication of something you have.

258
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:54,640
And there's a human
being able to hit pound

259
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,800
on the other end.

260
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,709
Okay, so first, step one,
we gather the password

261
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:01,310
of the target and we know that can be done

262
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:03,109
'cause passwords are horrible, right?

263
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:04,610
Phishing, all the rest.

264
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:07,300
So you gather the password of your target.

265
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,250
Then you create a super
annoying audio clip.

266
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:12,910
I have no talent in this regard.

267
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:15,130
I limited myself to what I could do

268
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:18,640
with a bone stock Mac Book
Pro, Creative Commons,

269
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:23,319
and freely available
unlicensed audio files.

270
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,370
A hacker would not tie their arm

271
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:26,450
behind their back like this.

272
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:28,630
And I gave myself no
more than half an hour,

273
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:31,450
and I created a super annoying audio clip.

274
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:33,793
Let us hear the super annoying audio clip.

275
00:11:35,197 --> 00:11:39,089
- [Announcer] Welcome to
Microsoft (electronic warbling)

276
00:11:39,089 --> 00:11:41,323
- [Announcer] Yes, Microsoft
is sending you on vacation.

277
00:11:41,323 --> 00:11:44,120
Congratulations, big winner.

278
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,078
All you have to do is press pound to-

279
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:47,161
- Super annoying.

280
00:11:47,161 --> 00:11:48,142
- To get your vacation
- Really annoying.

281
00:11:48,143 --> 00:11:49,470
- [Announcer] started right away.

282
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:53,623
Yes, seven days in the
sun and surf of Aruba.

283
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:56,930
- [Announcer] Please press the pound key

284
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:58,402
to finish your verification.

285
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:02,480
- Okay, and so the super
annoying audio clip,

286
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,720
you then use a spoofing war-dialer.

287
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,520
You fake out the caller ID
of the actual auth system,

288
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,840
which is usually pretty easy to get.

289
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:14,280
And then you launch a repeated
dialing attack at 3 AM,

290
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,260
like every five to seven minutes.

291
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:19,720
And you just wait until
your target waits one second

292
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,300
or two seconds to hit pound, pound.

293
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,500
Oh my gosh, please quit calling me.

294
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:29,540
And then when they are starting
to hit pound instantly,

295
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,380
you then sign on with the spoof credential

296
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:35,470
you gathered in step one,
the compromised credential,

297
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:38,900
and the real auth system
calls your target.

298
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,860
They immediately hit pound and you're in.

299
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,100
And you've bypassed the something you have

300
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,270
by breaking the human factor.

301
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:49,510
(laughs) I have some
friends who do pen testing,

302
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:52,500
and this doesn't always
work, but it does work.

303
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,690
Will they tell anybody the next day?

304
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:57,630
Don't know, but judgment
is really bad at 4 AM

305
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:00,720
when you play super annoying audio clips.

306
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,080
Let's talk about another
attack on the human factor

307
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,060
and that's smishing.

308
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:07,209
I didn't come up with the
term, but somebody thought,

309
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:11,060
hey, SMS and phishing
combined, it's smishing.

310
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,819
And so let's do a caller ID spoof.

311
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:16,290
Well, first of all, you
need to find out the number

312
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:17,880
to the big bank fraud center.

313
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,713
Pretty easy.

314
00:13:18,713 --> 00:13:20,469
You open an account with big bank,

315
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:22,550
and you sign up for multi-factor auth,

316
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:24,939
and you sign up for fraud notifications,

317
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:27,850
and you just start doing transactions

318
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,040
and seeing what shows up.

319
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,800
And you're very quickly
able, as the bad guy,

320
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,420
to gain all of the inbound phone numbers

321
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:37,229
that are used by big bank fraud center.

322
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:40,790
You then do a SMS using that.

323
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:45,069
And you tell somebody they have
a huge transaction, $1,700.

324
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:47,690
To approve it, say yes, otherwise say no.

325
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:50,710
Of course, your target says,
no, don't take my money.

326
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:53,110
I didn't authorize that transaction.

327
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:54,040
Then you come back with,

328
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,569
well, of course, we're
your bank, and we love you.

329
00:13:56,570 --> 00:14:00,390
And as we told you, all you
have to do is prove you are you,

330
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:05,390
and give us the PIN on your
big bank OTP application.

331
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:06,710
Which, of course, if you're the bad guy,

332
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:08,690
you would name by name

333
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:11,400
and tell them how they can provide that.

334
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,500
And they provide 617508,

335
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,040
and you log in as them.

336
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,400
And then the money
actually does disappear,

337
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,959
and maybe even more than $1,700.

338
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:26,640
You have completely bypassed
the something you have

339
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:30,150
through hacking the human
through a little bit of caller ID

340
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:31,770
because there's a weak factor.

341
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:33,810
Two weak factors, really, right?

342
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:36,569
The reliance on SMS and caller ID,

343
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:38,650
and then the factor of the human being

344
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:41,343
recognizing a smishing attack.

345
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,949
And then another attack
against the human factor

346
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:48,590
in the something you have for the phones

347
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:51,390
is, of course, just
getting rid of the phone,

348
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,223
take it out of the picture

349
00:14:52,223 --> 00:14:54,640
by copying it, stealing, et cetera.

350
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,010
If you haven't heard the
story of Brother Orange,

351
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:58,960
you have to search for this.

352
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,250
Fire up your web browser and
check out Brother Orange.

353
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:04,700
Hilarious story about a guy
who had his phone stolen

354
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:09,040
and it showed up in the hands
of Brother Orange weeks later.

355
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,150
Funny story.

356
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:13,319
But phones get stolen all the time.

357
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,830
They get lost.

358
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,150
You remember CelebGate

359
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:20,300
where some certain celebrities
chose very weak PINs

360
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:23,420
for the security of
their voicemail accounts,

361
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:27,209
or their cloud-hosted
photographic archives,

362
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:29,670
and people were downloading images.

363
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:33,520
That's a mobile account takeover
due to poor credentials.

364
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,670
The mobile carrier account takeover

365
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:37,530
via attacking the human being

366
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:41,560
at the carrier help
desk or the phone store.

367
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,469
Tell them a sob story, use
some social engineering

368
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:45,850
with some pretexting,

369
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:48,500
and then you can enroll
your phone as the old phone

370
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:52,350
with your new SIM, your new
EIN, and you become that person.

371
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:55,840
And now I become the
celebrity I want to be.

372
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,673
I'm not a celebrity

373
00:15:56,673 --> 00:15:58,070
'cause I don't look anything like Beyonce,

374
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:59,150
but you get what I'm saying.

375
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:01,020
You can become your target.

376
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:03,000
And then of course, compromised endpoints.

377
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,560
You convince people to click on things,

378
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,829
'cause people do like to click on things.

379
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:09,180
Humans get fooled, compromised endpoints.

380
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,520
And if you're relying on the security

381
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,920
of those endpoints as your factor,

382
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,293
well, then the human
factor breaks that down.

383
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:18,930
Another thing to be considered

384
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:23,300
when choosing mobile
phones as a credential

385
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,010
for the something you have,

386
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:29,689
is another gap with
independence of auth mechanisms.

387
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:32,190
Now mobile phones are great platforms

388
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:34,070
for a whole variety of solutions.

389
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:37,970
Work for commerce and
payments, social media,

390
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:41,220
authentication photos, et cetera.

391
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,900
It's ubiquitous.

392
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:43,790
Millennials are never

393
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:46,079
more than two meters
away from their phone.

394
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:49,110
They're out dancing on
the dance floor at 11 PM.

395
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:51,630
It's in their hand, it's
stuffed in their shirt.

396
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,930
They have their phone. Guaranteed.

397
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,430
They're not leaving it back
at the table or back home.

398
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:57,433
It's with them.

399
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,570
But it's a single platform

400
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:03,290
that has low-trust transactions
and high-trust transactions,

401
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:05,530
all on the same platform.

402
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:08,240
So consider if you have a requirement

403
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,310
for out of band authentication
for your multi-factor auth,

404
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:14,470
have you achieved that mandate

405
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:17,109
if you're using a mobile auth solution?

406
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:20,770
If you have a transaction
come in from a mobile browser,

407
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:23,280
should you still use
a mobile auth solution

408
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,379
for your out of band?

409
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:27,849
Because essentially those
are going to the same device,

410
00:17:27,849 --> 00:17:29,300
and you should ask yourself,

411
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,620
for your requirements, your system,

412
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,409
the security model
you're trying to achieve,

413
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:35,620
can you still call that out of band?

414
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:36,949
Not saying you can't.

415
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:39,760
I'm saying it's something to consider.

416
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,320
And finally, probably
the weakest issue we have

417
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,320
with multi-factor authentication

418
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,409
is account establishment and reset.

419
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:48,230
You see the thing is,
to establish an account,

420
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:51,365
to reset an account, you
have to have a credential.

421
00:17:51,365 --> 00:17:53,040
(laughs) It's part of the gig.

422
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,117
If you don't have a credential

423
00:17:54,117 --> 00:17:56,030
and you can't prove you are you

424
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:58,480
to reset the other credentials.

425
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,990
And a lot of MFA solutions
break down to free web mail.

426
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:06,220
At the end of the day, if
you can answer the web mail,

427
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:08,270
then I can do an account reset

428
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:11,780
and I can go out to the web
mail and I can answer the email.

429
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,300
You must be you.

430
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,629
And we've seen that emails
are readily compromised.

431
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:17,620
And once an email's compromised,

432
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:20,020
it's pretty easy for the bad guy to search

433
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,810
for all the credential resets

434
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:24,020
that have been received in that email.

435
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,750
So you know all the
relationships they have

436
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:31,750
that offer email as the
credential reset factor.

437
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,919
It's a great hit list.

438
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,600
Look, password reset is
the weakest link of all.

439
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,790
Mostly because we rely
on single-factor auth

440
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:42,560
to reset a multifactor auth credential.

441
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:45,260
And this is probably,
as we start to armor up,

442
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:47,290
we need to consider.

443
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:51,010
We have to armor up the
identity proofing process

444
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:52,210
and we need to really eliminate

445
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:54,360
single-factor credential reset.

446
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,919
If we are dealing with an MFA solution,

447
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:02,050
resetting an MFA credential
should require two factors.

448
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:03,107
And if we've lost a factor,

449
00:19:03,107 --> 00:19:05,410
'cause we lost a phone or forgotten a PIN

450
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,640
or whatever the case may be,

451
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,700
to re-establish that credential

452
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:14,350
and get the new password,
PIN, new phone listed,

453
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:16,810
that should required two factors.

454
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:17,770
And that's difficult.

455
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:20,000
To get there, you really
have to understand

456
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,163
all the questions human beings ask

457
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:28,163
to establish authentication verbally,

458
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:30,330
how identity is established,

459
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:32,470
and you have to understand
all channels and all methods.

460
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:35,430
And you really have to
understand the fallback steps.

461
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:37,340
If it's a question and answer,

462
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:41,320
and it's, you know, your
favorite sports team,

463
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:45,850
is the help desk allowed to
say it's a football team?

464
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:48,240
That's a defined hint. Is that allowed?

465
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,010
You've taken a lot of things
off the table at that point.

466
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:52,660
Do you call the manager?

467
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,660
Do you tell them to go
visit the security desk

468
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,470
at their facility?

469
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:58,650
What is the fallback solution

470
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:01,580
if they're having
trouble with the factors?

471
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,830
And are they even allowed to do it

472
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:04,312
for high-trust credentials?

473
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:09,340
One system that I've seen
technology firms use,

474
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,740
and I've seeing broader adoption now,

475
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,530
I think it's just genius,

476
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:14,300
is the video credential reset.

477
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:18,139
As the pandemic and work
from home has taught us,

478
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,960
pretty well everybody has the ability

479
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,370
to do video conferencing now,

480
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:24,459
and if they didn't have it a
year ago, they have it now.

481
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,340
Your help desk has it. They have it.

482
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:30,820
It's really easy to fire up
a WebEx, a Zoom, a FaceTime,

483
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,639
whatever you need to do

484
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,640
to be able to pull up the
photo in the employee system,

485
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,790
to have the person
requesting a credential reset

486
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:42,639
fire up their video channel.

487
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,790
You can see their face.

488
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:44,889
Does their face match?

489
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:46,780
Ask for a government photo ID.

490
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:49,690
Does the information match
against the system you have?

491
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:52,310
You could even ask them a
knowledge question at this point.

492
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:53,950
What's their manager's name?

493
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:57,360
Ask them a random question
to avoid a video replay,

494
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,429
like what is 11 times eight?

495
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:01,220
And they have to say 88.

496
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,930
Obviously, the next
time you don't ask them

497
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:05,434
what is 22 times four?

498
00:21:05,434 --> 00:21:08,100
But you now have, in a single system,

499
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,600
you've established life by livestream,

500
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,610
by response to a question.

501
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:16,320
You have something you
have, little questionable,

502
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,909
I mean, can you tell
really that the hologram

503
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:21,260
and et cetera for government ID?

504
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,900
Okay, that maybe is not quite as strong

505
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:25,610
as we'd like it to be if
it was offered in person,

506
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:27,689
but you have the picture on the ID

507
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:29,060
matching the person holding it,

508
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:30,889
matching the one in your system.

509
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:32,680
The information on the ID

510
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,240
matches the information on your system.

511
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,950
You can ask them a question.

512
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:38,210
This is really good.

513
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:40,860
The great news is you can do this today.

514
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:44,929
You have everything you
need to do this right now.

515
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:48,720
The only thing you need to
do is modify your scripts.

516
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,320
And that should be good news.

517
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,520
So I think this is a great way to armor up

518
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:56,850
the identity proofing process.

519
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:58,560
But it's really important as we do that

520
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,120
that we have to protect more credentials

521
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,879
than just passwords.

522
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,370
The example we provided earlier of the MFA

523
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:05,699
that calls your phone.

524
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:09,170
Well, then your mobile phone
number is a credential.

525
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:10,650
Your home address is a credential

526
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:12,253
if I'm mailing a PIN to you.

527
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:15,520
The challenge response questions,
oh please kill these now.

528
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,480
They've been decertified by NIST, but

529
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:21,110
the questions and answers,

530
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:23,598
the answers certainly are credentials,

531
00:22:23,598 --> 00:22:26,129
as much as a password is.

532
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:29,020
Home email address, if
you get to send them

533
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:33,139
an out of band email response
to reset a credential,

534
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:34,650
that certainly is a credential as well.

535
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:37,010
So any changes to any of these

536
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:39,540
should trigger more extensive
security processing.

537
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,899
You should treat these as security events,

538
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,750
and handle these the same way

539
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:48,270
you would an OTP reset, a password reset.

540
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:50,570
Any changes to these

541
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:52,010
should trigger the same
kind of processing,

542
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:54,070
but you have to know where they are.

543
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:55,700
You have to have knowledge and inventory

544
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,330
of all your credentials.

545
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:59,810
Now we usually know, oh,
I know where my LDAP is,

546
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:01,240
and Active Directory, I got that.

547
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:05,400
I know where my OTP solution is. Got it.

548
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:09,380
But do you really have knowledge
of all the rest of them?

549
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:12,620
Every place where the mobile phone is?

550
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:15,129
Do you have visibility
to the badging system

551
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:17,640
and the system that holds
the parking sticker,

552
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,650
because those are credentials.

553
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:21,760
You recognize that a car is allowed

554
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,180
to come in the front gate
and be on your premises.

555
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:26,963
And now where you are is
increasingly a credential.

556
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,419
And those are trusted credentials

557
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:31,090
that you have authorized.

558
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:34,689
It's a good idea to consider
which are trusted credentials

559
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:36,370
that come from your organization,

560
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:38,689
and which are federated
credentials that don't.

561
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:41,360
You have to rely on them,
but you have no idea

562
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,510
when somebody's license
plate number changes,

563
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:45,980
when their email or their
home address changes.

564
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:46,980
Those are federated.

565
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:49,370
So you know what they are at one point.

566
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:50,770
Do you have the processes necessary

567
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:52,320
to change those in the future

568
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,159
and to reestablish trust in those?

569
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,670
So there needs to be a validation process.

570
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:59,920
And I would state there should
be levels of trust in those,

571
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:03,430
that there's probably a much
different sort of trust level

572
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:07,460
you would associate with,
perhaps, a photo ID badge

573
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:10,073
with an integrated prox,

574
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:13,583
compared with a parking
sticker or a license plate.

575
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:16,290
You should have
sufficiency of credentials.

576
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:19,200
And this is where you should
consider step up auth.

577
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,527
And which of these are
low-security credentials,

578
00:24:21,527 --> 00:24:23,740
and which are high-security credentials.

579
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:27,180
And what does it take to
provide for identity proofing

580
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:29,420
for a high-security credential?

581
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:32,820
It should require more auth, right?

582
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,409
You also need to understand
the repositories,

583
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:37,470
where they're stored, and
dare I say, secure those.

584
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:39,900
Understand when they're compromised.

585
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,810
And you have to understand the reset

586
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:44,290
and establish processes.

587
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:46,080
You'll find, I believe, when you start

588
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,189
to peel the onion on all of these,

589
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:50,040
that some of the questions that are asked

590
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,730
in one context by human beings

591
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:54,210
are answered in other contexts.

592
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:56,610
So having visibility
to how that's happening

593
00:24:56,610 --> 00:25:00,263
across different frameworks
is pretty important.

594
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:04,700
And can you detect broad
spectrum password probes?

595
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:07,540
Of course, bad guys, stupid bad guys

596
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,670
try 10,000 passwords against credentials.

597
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:14,670
Smart ones, they go for summer
2021 against all your emails,

598
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,400
or against multiple interfaces.

599
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:21,270
They might try against your
wifi or your guest wifi.

600
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:23,900
They might go against your desktop,

601
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:28,240
against your voice
response unit or voicemail,

602
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,360
as well as going through the web.

603
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:33,260
So excessive failure attempts

604
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:35,570
against any of these interfaces
need to be correlated.

605
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:37,870
And you should understand
when a credential

606
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:40,159
is being attacked in one context,

607
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,790
your radar needs to go up

608
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:44,639
from when you see activity
in that in another context.

609
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,900
You need to do correlation in your SIEM

610
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,630
against all the different repositories

611
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,530
when you see excessive retry failures.

612
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,810
Another concept I'd like to talk about

613
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:54,970
is credential firewall.

614
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:57,980
Now I'm not selling you
anything. I'm a practitioner.

615
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:59,810
So don't think that I'm gonna to say

616
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:01,909
so buy my credential firewall thing.

617
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:02,770
I'm not.

618
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:05,000
We've heard a lot about zero trust.

619
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,020
We've heard a lot about network
segmentation over the years.

620
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:10,650
And a lot of us have
segmented our networks

621
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:12,950
into, perhaps, an untrusted zone,

622
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:15,240
a DMZ that has a higher level of trust

623
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,440
'cause we've gone through a firewall.

624
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:19,800
You've gone through an
authentication system.

625
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,830
So now you have canonical traffic

626
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:26,030
against a known protocol and
it's trustworthy, et cetera.

627
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:27,300
A lot of things you can say about it

628
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,270
as it passes through these systems

629
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:31,480
and climbs up the trust ladder.

630
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:34,980
You have perhaps a segmented
zone for workstations.

631
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,370
Now notice that that's pink

632
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:39,010
because people click
on stuff in that zone.

633
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:41,500
They open emails in that zone
and those people get phished.

634
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:45,170
So not quite as trustworthy as the rest,

635
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:48,540
but not as bad as the hotel kiosk.

636
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:52,120
And then, many times, a management zone,

637
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:56,340
so that a worker who
needs to administer a box

638
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,919
on your server zone would be able

639
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:01,060
to come through a jump host
in the management zone,

640
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,570
into the server zone.

641
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:05,370
And the management zone may
be where your backup solution,

642
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:08,129
your patch management solution, inventory,

643
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:13,130
where your sys log, centralized
log aggregation point is.

644
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:15,150
All those management
components can rely there

645
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:16,600
with a nice jump post.

646
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,980
And you have a model that allows you

647
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:20,020
to segment off your server zone.

648
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:22,290
Well, the real problem here is

649
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:24,250
what are you using to
get into the organization

650
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:26,620
in the first place from
this untrusted zone?

651
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:29,050
If you're asking for user ID and password,

652
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:31,580
this should be a really
familiar model to us

653
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:35,060
'cause if you're typing your password

654
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:38,860
for your network login
in an untrusted zone,

655
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:40,780
you're leaking keys.

656
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:44,210
And is that on a untrusted
box, untrusted network?

657
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:46,140
Is it that hotel kiosk?

658
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:49,820
Is it a jailbroken phone running malware?

659
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:52,620
What are you revealing
about your credentials?

660
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:53,500
And that's why I think we need

661
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,510
to really think about
a credential firewall

662
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:58,020
that matches our network firewall model.

663
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:01,050
We need to segment into
minimally trusted credentials

664
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:03,980
that allow you to get in and no more,

665
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:06,790
those that allow you to
operate within that zone.

666
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:08,330
Your driver's license inside it

667
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:11,230
that gives you your desktop access.

668
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:12,330
It gives you your email.

669
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:15,879
It gives your login to
the single sign on system

670
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:20,280
that's used for HR applications,
et cetera, internally.

671
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,350
But then when I go to the management zone,

672
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:23,770
perhaps I need different credentials,

673
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:25,350
particularly for the crown jewels.

674
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:26,260
And this is where I think

675
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:28,060
the credential firewall's important.

676
00:28:29,327 --> 00:28:32,060
That the credential
firewall should look at,

677
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:34,800
perhaps a different set of credentials.

678
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,320
That the credentials you use to get

679
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,629
into the management zone
and your trusted ops area

680
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:40,600
should probably be different
than your crown jewels.

681
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,877
And the example I like
to provide for my guys

682
00:28:42,877 --> 00:28:44,710
when I talk about this

683
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:47,110
is that you have to think about
it like a different company.

684
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:48,030
I usually name Coke.

685
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:50,500
I don't work for Coke,
but I do love Diet Coke.

686
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,060
And so I tell them, just
think of that as being Coke.

687
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:55,370
It's a different company, Staples, Apple.

688
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:58,060
Pick whoever you like, but it's not you.

689
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:59,990
And so there should be no implicit trust

690
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:02,730
between that zone and the other zones.

691
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:04,440
Now this is hard because this means

692
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,710
that the credentials
your backup solution uses

693
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:07,960
have to be different,

694
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:10,800
and your patch management
and your antivirus,

695
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,680
and all the rest, they
need to be different.

696
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:16,510
But that's how a lot of the
companies get compromised,

697
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:18,940
is that bad guys punk these credentials,

698
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:20,500
and use them to go everywhere.

699
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,710
So you need to consider

700
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:24,300
how are you gonna get
different credentials out here

701
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,399
for your crown jewels?

702
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:29,980
And that's where I think a
credential firewall is useful.

703
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:32,730
And a final way we need
to armor up, I think,

704
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:34,887
is you have to look at
your existing MFA's legacy.

705
00:29:34,887 --> 00:29:36,440
And I know this is painful

706
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,530
'cause you probably
spent a million dollars

707
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:40,899
and 12 or 18 months rolling it out,

708
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,340
and it took a lot of justification.

709
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:44,500
It was expensive and everything else.

710
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:47,070
But MFA solutions fail catastrophically,

711
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:49,060
because crypto fails catastrophically,

712
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:51,310
and most of them are
based on cryptography.

713
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:54,129
There might be some slow erosion,

714
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:58,203
but what we saw with
POODLE, Meltdown, Specter,

715
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:02,750
those trusted systems
happened very, very quickly.

716
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:05,740
Some of those chip-based, some
of those cryptography-based,

717
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:09,050
and now your MFA
solution's punked and owned

718
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:10,570
and no longer trustworthy.

719
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:11,700
What's your plan now?

720
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:16,370
Well, you can fail shut and
allow single-factor auth.

721
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:19,149
That's not really a continuity
plan for multifactor.

722
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,630
Or you can fail open and just
block access to the system,

723
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:23,580
which is not a career plan.

724
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:26,730
But if your MFA solution
goes down, what do you do?

725
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:28,500
And if it's not a matter
of just restarting it

726
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,870
'cause it's no longer
trustworthy, what do you do?

727
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:34,310
You have to have two
independent MFA solutions.

728
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:36,629
Not independent of same.

729
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:39,600
Because if that system's
no longer trustworthy,

730
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,250
both are broken.

731
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:42,870
So you have to have one in the wings.

732
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:43,850
I know this is hard

733
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:46,540
but you have to look at
your existing MFA's legacy.

734
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:47,850
So what can we take with us?

735
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:50,929
Well, next week, think about identifying

736
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:53,550
your critical credentials
in the repositories

737
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:56,409
and create a plan for getting
those mapped and controlled.

738
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:58,640
And figure out, over
the next three months,

739
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,880
where those are, find them.

740
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,670
Find the paths, find the
flows for a credential,

741
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:06,330
establish identity proofing,
and for credential reset,

742
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:09,179
and then try to normalize,
as best possible,

743
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:12,040
the identity verification
standards and scripts,

744
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,560
so one system's not
giving away credentials

745
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,639
to the other system.

746
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:19,160
That they both have equitable
and consistent means

747
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,110
of establishing identity.

748
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:22,310
And then within six months,

749
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:24,419
you need to consider about
getting velocity checks

750
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:26,350
across all those places you've found,

751
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:28,034
getting those into your SIEM.

752
00:31:28,035 --> 00:31:30,740
Either create a backup
MFA plan or solution

753
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:33,750
for what's gonna happen
when the existing one dies.

754
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:35,820
And then you have to take
your insecure credentials

755
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:36,870
and migrate them.

756
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:39,500
Please consider using NIST 800-53-3

757
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,000
as a credential standard.

758
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,400
It's awesome.

759
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,440
And I have already gotten a few questions.

760
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,900
I'm sure there are more,

761
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:49,010
so surely there are a few
questions you can throw at me.

762
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:49,917
And thank you.
