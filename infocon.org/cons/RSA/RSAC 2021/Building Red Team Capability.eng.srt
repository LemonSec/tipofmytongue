1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,040
- I like to talk about this as an analogy

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,450
and the analogy is as
security professionals

3
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:09,800
we're all gonna get punched in the face

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,410
because this is a fact.

5
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:13,150
An attackers going show
up and want what we have

6
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:15,680
and they're gonna punch us
in the face to get it, right?

7
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,811
The question is, do you want

8
00:00:17,811 --> 00:00:20,800
the first time you get punched in the face

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,410
to be the time that an
attacker steals your stuff,

10
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:26,970
or do you want a friendly
person to punch you in the face,

11
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:31,451
or attempt to, to see how
well you avoid, prevents,

12
00:00:31,451 --> 00:00:35,850
detect, or respond that punch?

13
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:38,011
- I don't want anyone
to punch me in the face.

14
00:00:38,011 --> 00:00:38,844
(laughing)

15
00:00:38,844 --> 00:00:39,800
Friendly or otherwise.

16
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,910
- That is the ideal, right,

17
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:42,760
is that no one ever
punches anyone in the face,

18
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,460
but it's not the world we live in.

19
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:47,129
- Right.

20
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:49,022
- So like, can you frame that for me?

21
00:00:49,932 --> 00:00:51,470
Like you said, getting
punched in the face,

22
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:54,030
an analogy that I love,
folks who have seen me

23
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,930
give slide talks on this topic before,

24
00:00:57,393 --> 00:00:59,530
but like, what would you offer?

25
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:01,544
What would you expect
to see with a red team

26
00:01:01,544 --> 00:01:03,169
that you're not gonna get
with say like a Pen test,

27
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:05,780
or something, other offensive testing

28
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:07,550
that folks might be accustomed to?

29
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:09,660
- Sure, and this gets into that sort of

30
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,649
religious definition topic a little bit,

31
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:14,440
but I will say, from my perspective,

32
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,440
what you're gonna get with from a red team

33
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,890
versus a pen test is
you're going to get sort of

34
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:21,915
like you said, a

35
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:24,340
an objective focused

36
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,770
attempt to gain access

37
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:31,670
to your systems with no
necessarily preconceived notions

38
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:34,410
of how or like what service
that's going to occur

39
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:36,310
through or how that's going to happen,

40
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,730
which would give you a much more true

41
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:41,680
to life view of what an attacker might do.

42
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,490
If they were starting from zero and saying

43
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:45,902
I want to break into a given company.

44
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:51,530
- Gotcha. So I guess mental
model for me, I have picking on

45
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:54,346
on you two individuals.

46
00:01:54,346 --> 00:01:56,810
Phillip, I kind of view you

47
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:00,045
as the guy, ho's been a
customer of a consumer of

48
00:02:00,045 --> 00:02:03,540
a red team, you know as
the security professional.

49
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,720
Rob, I guess I view you here

50
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,860
as a person who's been building

51
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:10,180
and performing and being red teams

52
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,810
- So I get to do the punching.

53
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:13,860
Phillip gets the, to get
the punch in the face.

54
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:14,693
Got it.

55
00:02:14,693 --> 00:02:15,740
- That's our analogy.

56
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:16,573
- Yep.

57
00:02:16,573 --> 00:02:19,245
- Yep. I kind of walked
towards that one there.

58
00:02:19,245 --> 00:02:20,078
- Makes sense.

59
00:02:20,078 --> 00:02:20,920
(laughing)

60
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,156
- The question Rob for you is

61
00:02:23,157 --> 00:02:25,725
as a red teamer, what
do you actually try to

62
00:02:25,725 --> 00:02:28,823
provide? What would you say you do here?

63
00:02:28,824 --> 00:02:30,983
- (laughing) That hurts.

64
00:02:34,267 --> 00:02:36,920
So the benefits of red team, I think

65
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,750
as Phillip said, is, is getting
that punch in the face and

66
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,600
and having that person
stay around and say, Hey

67
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,299
you should duck this way, right?

68
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:47,240
That's I think the great
part of that analogy is

69
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,570
is having, you know, if you,
if you get punched in the face

70
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:53,109
by a mugger or whatever,
a bad person, right?

71
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:55,840
They're gonna leave and
take your stuff, right?

72
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,050
Whereas a red team kind
of sticks around and says

73
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:01,110
you should duck this way,
your defensive opportunities

74
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,010
here's the vulnerabilities we saw.

75
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:09,003
And I think that that
analogy works really well.

76
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:14,820
The one other thing is you
get essentially proof points

77
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:18,260
and I, I know that's a
company name, but like you get

78
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:23,260
you get a way, a set of
experts, or individuals

79
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:28,630
in a company that says I
can prove X because there's,

80
00:03:29,256 --> 00:03:31,200
there's a lot of snake oil.

81
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,010
There's a lot of, you
know, different tools

82
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:36,549
out there and products
and stuff like that,

83
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:40,360
that say they can do X or, you know

84
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,280
patches that say they can do X

85
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,940
or individuals that say they can do X.

86
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:49,280
And the red team is like
outside of just the general

87
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,860
like we find vulnerabilities and

88
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,743
we help the blue team, right?

89
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:57,020
The red team operates
as a, as a checkpoint

90
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,220
as a way of saying, Hey,
and that's another company.

91
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:02,230
Oh my God, not sponsors.

92
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:04,465
Or at least for me. (laughing)

93
00:04:04,465 --> 00:04:08,136
And it's, it's a way for people or

94
00:04:08,136 --> 00:04:11,630
or management or C-level executives to say

95
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,260
is this really what's happening?

96
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,269
Or is this really what could happen?

97
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:17,470
Is this really, you know, X?

98
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:19,820
And I think that's the
benefit of the red team.

99
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:24,770
- But yeah, I think the,
obviously Randori, right,

100
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:26,229
like I'm a big fan of the whole practice

101
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:31,230
how you fight thing, but
maybe Rob, Phillip, either one

102
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:32,980
of you want to like, can

103
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,210
can another interview occur
or come up with, or I think

104
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:37,659
of like story, a thing that
would make this succinct.

105
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,820
Like red team is amazed,

106
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,673
because here's what happens
to me or what I did.

107
00:04:44,429 --> 00:04:47,099
- I mean, I would, I would
just really carry what

108
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,110
what Rob just said.

109
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:53,110
A red team cuts through all
the noise and the assumptions

110
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,970
and the, this is how I think it works.

111
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:58,390
And the, this is how it should work.

112
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,409
that I think a lot of
us get caught in, right?

113
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:03,490
I certainly have. I've certainly
gone through red teams,

114
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:06,630
where the end result
is I have a moment of,

115
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,828
Hey, that's not possible.

116
00:05:08,828 --> 00:05:13,450
Right? But it turns out
it is because the red team

117
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:16,110
done correctly, doesn't
care about what you think is

118
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:17,690
possible or what you think is impossible.

119
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:20,981
What you think is there, what
you don't think is there.

120
00:05:20,981 --> 00:05:24,280
So, and so in that sense, it's
a very, again, done right.

121
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,080
And done well, it's a very pure view

122
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,950
of what exists and what's possible.

123
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:30,723
- So kind

124
00:05:30,723 --> 00:05:31,556
- There's, sorry.

125
00:05:31,556 --> 00:05:34,390
- So there's, there's no, the other thing

126
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,310
about the red team is
there's no politics involved.

127
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:39,170
There's no, you know, dog
in the fight sort of thing.

128
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:42,800
And so like, as a red teamer, you know

129
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,160
I want the company to succeed obviously,

130
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,690
but I have no politics
when it comes to like

131
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:54,170
this app should be, you
know, or this app needs this

132
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:57,440
or that app needs this,
or however things like I,

133
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,300
the nice thing about
the red team is we're,

134
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,810
we're just telling you how it is.

135
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:05,620
Like, we have no incentive to, to lie or,

136
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:10,620
or modify the truth to make
it fit a narrative, right?

137
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,060
We're just going to tell

138
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,300
like the C-level executives are going to

139
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,060
take whatever they want out of it, right?

140
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,890
But we're there to say

141
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:20,203
this is ground truth,

142
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:22,893
to get it back to a military aspect.

143
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,830
- Yeah. I guess I've
always thought I liked that

144
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:29,490
that framing it's the
prepping the battle space

145
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,000
so that when that punch actually shows up

146
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,833
you kind of know what to do.

147
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:33,810
You know what's going to work.

148
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,620
Be able to kind of assess how
things are functioning as it

149
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,080
as it were. Assess the

150
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,080
and be able to assess
the security program.

151
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,210
I'm going to push us forward.

152
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:44,479
Cause I know that we will ramble

153
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,619
about any one of our
questions here forever.

154
00:06:46,619 --> 00:06:47,452
- (laughing)

155
00:06:47,452 --> 00:06:48,750
- I've seen us talk before.

156
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,000
Let's get one more slide forward here.

157
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,380
And I think the common
question that I get, right,

158
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:59,150
is how do I get a red team
and how do I build one?

159
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:00,570
And like, how do I hire one?

160
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:01,920
What do I do?

161
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,690
And it's been, I think,
increasingly popular

162
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:07,890
particularly recently getting
increased demand about that.

163
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:08,979
But it's not always clear to me

164
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:12,370
that folks who are asking
for, trying to build

165
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:15,163
or develop a red team
actually need a red team.

166
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:20,190
So I guess next place to
go is like, Hey, you got

167
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,760
all these folks in the audience
are here to listen to you

168
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:26,150
experts talk about building
and leveraging red teams

169
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:28,450
but does it always make
sense to even do that?

170
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:32,830
Rob, like when would you think that

171
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:35,130
the right time is for an
organization to engage

172
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:37,590
with or build a red team capability?

173
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:42,289
- Yes. So that is, that is
quite unique per company, right?

174
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:45,420
And someone in the, in the
chat actually made the comment:

175
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,371
hack the CTO, you'll get a red team.

176
00:07:47,371 --> 00:07:49,609
No, don't do that.

177
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:53,520
But it's honestly, it's, as
soon as you can afford it.

178
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,200
One of the, one of the great
things, like I was saying

179
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,870
about having a red team is they
are the ground truth, right?

180
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:01,540
And a lot of, a lot of, you know

181
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:04,710
executives or board members
kind of want that, right?

182
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:07,150
They want to know what
is actually happening

183
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:08,880
or what's reality.

184
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,110
Cause there's, like I said

185
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:13,280
there's so much, you know,
politics and, and, you know

186
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,370
gaming that goes on within
companies, for good reasons

187
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:18,550
a lot of times,

188
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:21,827
and the red team kind of
tells you where you're at.

189
00:08:21,827 --> 00:08:23,270
And the other thing for the

190
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,500
for the blue side of things, even

191
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,530
if you don't have a blue team,

192
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:29,482
which you should first, the

193
00:08:29,482 --> 00:08:32,820
the red team can operate
sort of like a pen test team

194
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:36,720
or sort of like an not official
audit, but audit team of

195
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,919
of other parts of it too.

196
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,630
So it's for my aspect,
you know, I'm a red teamer

197
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:44,380
so I'm a little bit slanted in that way.

198
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,410
But I think that as soon

199
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:47,560
as you can afford one,
you should have one.

200
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:51,250
- I would say just real quick.

201
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,083
I, I think a piece

202
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:53,310
of what you said there is really important

203
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:55,430
I wanna highlight, which is as soon

204
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:58,583
as you have a blue team that
can actually do something

205
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:01,363
with a red team, right? So for my,

206
00:09:01,363 --> 00:09:04,940
for my, like where does your
next security dollar go?

207
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:07,720
Which is a question I ask myself a lot,

208
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,940
my first security dollars go
to building the blue team.

209
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:15,170
And once I think I have what
is a good capability there,

210
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:16,689
then my next security dollars would go

211
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:19,150
to building a red team
that tests that blue team

212
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:21,900
and ensures that what we're
building is actually good

213
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,433
and can prevent the tech response.

214
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:30,970
- So if I've heard a lot about
kind of the purple teaming as

215
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:33,640
as a process or an exercise,
is that what you're

216
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,400
hinting here, where, you
know, as soon as you have

217
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,010
somebody who's trying to
defend their organization

218
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:41,170
you need somebody that
they're sparring with or

219
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:42,719
or learning from or enhancing with.

220
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,460
- I mean, I don't, I
don't know that I would go

221
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,880
if I'm talking about
building from zero, right?

222
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,760
What I'm saying is your

223
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,150
first dollars go to the blue team, right?

224
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:55,370
Not even necessarily to
a purple team concept,

225
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:57,050
they'd go, they go to

226
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:59,839
do I have the right tools
in place to detect a breach?

227
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,060
Is the architecture saying,
do I have the right people?

228
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,599
Do we have the right playbooks?

229
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,050
Like, do we know what to do?

230
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:06,075
Do we think we know?

231
00:10:06,076 --> 00:10:07,580
- Do we have the right logs?

232
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:10,680
- Yep. Do we think we know what to do

233
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,920
if an attacker comes at us?

234
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,240
And then I think when you're,
when you find yourself saying

235
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,240
I think if an attacker showed up

236
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,300
we would find them and we
could do something about them.

237
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,959
Then I think that's the point where

238
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,160
you start the conversation for.

239
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,283
Okay. Well, let's see.

240
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:28,720
Because I think doing
it before then, right?

241
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,460
You're going to say, Nope,
we're not ready for an attacker.

242
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,420
And the red team is going to come in

243
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,400
and they're going to say, yep

244
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,579
you're not ready for an
attacker, right? So what's the

245
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,674
- Can I redefine that a little bit?

246
00:10:36,674 --> 00:10:37,610
- Yeah.

247
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:41,410
- Are you saying that
you shouldn't spend money

248
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:43,910
on any red teaming until
you have a blue team?

249
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,079
Or are you saying that you shouldn't build

250
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,000
an internal red team until
you have a blue team?

251
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,700
- I would say, you
certainly shouldn't build

252
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,830
an internal red team until
you have the blue team.

253
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:57,970
I think any investment, even
in an external red team, until

254
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:00,500
until you were saying to
yourself, you know, what

255
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,100
if an attacker shows up, I
think we know what to do.

256
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,210
Any money you're spending
on that red team.

257
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:08,510
They're going to tell
you what you already know

258
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:10,057
which is Yep, an attacker showed up

259
00:11:10,057 --> 00:11:11,607
and you didn't know what to do.

260
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:17,490
- Okay. But do you think
those, those dollars are lost

261
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:20,500
at that point? You still get
what you need to build out.

262
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,180
You still get kind of how, you know

263
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,930
how you got punched in the face.

264
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:28,319
Like, I think one of the things we talked

265
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,710
about when we were prepping

266
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:33,100
for this is how hard you want
to get punched in the face,

267
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:33,982
right?

268
00:11:33,982 --> 00:11:34,814
- Yep.

269
00:11:34,815 --> 00:11:36,715
- Like you don't want to, you know

270
00:11:36,715 --> 00:11:38,140
go out and get the baddest
red team and say, go all

271
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:42,040
out and do all the things, when
you don't have a blue team,

272
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,300
right? I think that, like
we were saying, like you

273
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:48,020
were saying is you kind of
want those baby punches first.

274
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,240
- Yep. Yeah.

275
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,130
- Right.

276
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:52,050
- And I think that that's,
that starts when, like

277
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:54,250
when you're having that
first inkling of like, okay

278
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:58,210
I think we can handle
something, but until you can say

279
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:03,210
I think we can handle something,
then I'm not sure I would

280
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,680
I would instead spend that
red, that red team money

281
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,650
on getting the blue team to
a place that it says, okay

282
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:12,459
I think I can handle something.

283
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,937
And then the red team is that something.

284
00:12:14,937 --> 00:12:17,080
- Can I, can I also add
one more aspect of this?

285
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:21,640
Before you even build the
blue team, a good SIS admin,

286
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:26,080
a solid security minded
system administrator

287
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,770
is worth 10 blue teams, 10 red teams,

288
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:31,040
like I'm dead serious.

289
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,237
Like I would, I would hire,

290
00:12:33,237 --> 00:12:37,770
there's a guy that worked at
Uber that I used to work with.

291
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:41,130
I would hire him 10 times over,

292
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:42,848
just because he had a security mindset

293
00:12:42,848 --> 00:12:45,069
and he was a sis admin

294
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:48,230
before I'd hire, you know, 50 red teamers,

295
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:50,430
- 100% of that. Absolutely.

296
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:52,819
- Well, it's always, I
always find it amusing that

297
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,770
in all the years that I
did red team engagements

298
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:57,670
I don't ever recall myself
recommending somebody to

299
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:00,192
go buy some new piece
of technology, right?

300
00:13:00,192 --> 00:13:01,025
- Right.

301
00:13:01,025 --> 00:13:02,900
- It was almost always
like, get, get one really,

302
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:05,949
really good person and
empower them to work.

303
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:07,140
Let them go hog wild

304
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,650
until you feel like you're in good shape.

305
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:10,483
So there's a,

306
00:13:10,483 --> 00:13:11,829
there's a thread here that
I think is interesting

307
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:16,830
because we kind of teased at
this a second, which was the

308
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,450
how hard you want to get punched

309
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:20,610
at a level of sophistication, you know

310
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:23,810
who you have on board to
actually learn from, you know

311
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:25,829
whatever the adversary is.

312
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:28,920
Are, are you kind of indicating
here, Rob, Phillip, that

313
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,900
you know, if somebody's
just trying to get a handle

314
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,819
of what's out there and, you know

315
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:35,520
minimize attack surface or
get like kind of the footprint

316
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:38,130
under control before they're
worried about like, you know

317
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:41,420
getting O'Dea thrown at
them, like actually start

318
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,589
with what the team is ready to handle

319
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,768
or are we in a vein of like

320
00:13:45,768 --> 00:13:49,223
just start throwing Oday at
people and see what happens?

321
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:54,508
- I mean, I don't think that
latter approach is useful.

322
00:13:54,509 --> 00:13:55,342
- (laughing)

323
00:13:55,342 --> 00:13:56,930
- Because again, just
like I was saying, it

324
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:58,910
it yields obvious results.

325
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:00,780
You could have, you could
have written the report

326
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:03,970
before you conducted the red team, right?

327
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:07,760
- There is some aspect of it
too, you know, as someone said

328
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,470
in the chat too, like
there is the hammer, right?

329
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:13,280
If you're trying to prove
a point to upper management

330
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,829
or someone who just doesn't
get that you need, you know

331
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:18,760
security or like there
are companies still out

332
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:22,098
there that think security is
like bottom rung, you know

333
00:14:22,098 --> 00:14:24,250
concerns for a company, right?

334
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:27,700
So if you are trying to get security top

335
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:31,000
of mind for executives
or, or upper management

336
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,080
like do get the hard punch

337
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,060
in the face that you
can ring them back in.

338
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,329
I get that aspect.

339
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:39,800
I hope that it doesn't have
to happen anymore, though.

340
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,329
Right? That's like

341
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:44,120
there's so much news that
should have already forced

342
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,010
that down their throats.

343
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,010
- Yeah. I love it.

344
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:50,530
I think, I think about, I said
this in our prep session too.

345
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:52,530
Like I tend to less about security now

346
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:54,610
more about building resiliency, right?

347
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:56,030
And resiliency to me is a lot

348
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:58,130
about getting the institution lined

349
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:59,920
up and building the institutional patterns

350
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,803
as opposed to just the technology.

351
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:05,730
I'm definitely aware that
I've been used as a therapist

352
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:08,220
and used as a hammer in
a lot of occasions to

353
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,920
help businesses figure out
what matters to businesses.

354
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,630
So I appreciate that.

355
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:15,960
I'm going to push this forward here.

356
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,123
Let's go to the, let's
go to the next slide.

357
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:20,570
Let's go back one slide.

358
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,260
Number three, I think is where we are.

359
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,093
I love it.

360
00:15:24,093 --> 00:15:26,880
Okay. So we've talked a little
bit about what a red team is.

361
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,100
We talked about when you
might build a red team

362
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,570
and we're just starting to tease

363
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:32,810
out how you actually are improving

364
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:36,300
or using a red team capability
to improve an organization.

365
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,839
And so I always think if
you're going to spend money,

366
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,790
you're going to make an investment.

367
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:43,689
You should figure out how
you're going to measure

368
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:46,160
whether that investment is
actually giving you any sort

369
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,900
of result that you care about.

370
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,829
So in the context

371
00:15:49,829 --> 00:15:52,880
of building a red team and
leveraging the capability

372
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,725
how do we know whether
we're doing it, right?

373
00:15:55,725 --> 00:15:57,960
How do we know where to get what we want

374
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,473
out of the exercise?

375
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:03,088
So I'll go to Rob first.

376
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:05,760
Like what does success look like?

377
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,349
- Yeah. So I will say that success is

378
00:16:08,349 --> 00:16:10,750
is not number of findings.

379
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:13,580
And we've, we talked
about this before, too.

380
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:18,110
Like I find that a lot of
organizations define pen testing

381
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:20,430
and red teaming success
with the number of findings

382
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:22,469
because that's what they, you
know, what, that's the output

383
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:24,670
that's what you pay for
is the report, right?

384
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:26,930
But I don't think that
that is where it should be.

385
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:31,430
I think it should definitely
be in, in change over time.

386
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:33,310
And that's harder to put metrics on

387
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:34,719
until you start doing it.

388
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,120
You have to like create a
report, not of the findings, not

389
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,380
of the things that need to
change, but of the change itself.

390
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:45,320
So what I mean by that is a lot of

391
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,949
a lot of schools these days
have these rubrics, these

392
00:16:47,949 --> 00:16:51,229
these score cards where you
can tell how you're doing

393
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:53,050
and, and, but a point system.

394
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:55,079
And I created something
very similar to that.

395
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,040
There's a lot of companies
that do something similar

396
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,990
to that, but like you're never

397
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:01,240
going to know a good set of metrics when

398
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,150
with one point of data,
which is your first pen test.

399
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:08,887
What you need to define,
how success is going is

400
00:17:08,887 --> 00:17:12,490
multiple red team
assessments, multiple tests.

401
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:15,849
And I'm not looking at number of findings

402
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:18,969
cause that can ebb and
flow as zero days come

403
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:22,750
out or a new attack types
come out and stuff like that.

404
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:27,119
What you're looking for is,
you know, time to detection,

405
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,988
time to remediation.

406
00:17:28,989 --> 00:17:32,279
Those types of blue team side metrics

407
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:35,736
and cause the red team,
as Phillip was saying

408
00:17:35,736 --> 00:17:39,850
when we first started is an
augmentation of the red team

409
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,780
or the blue or the red team is
an augmentation of blue team.

410
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:47,340
And like the metrics
that we come out of it

411
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:50,899
that the things that we
deem as success, I think are

412
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:54,400
how we're increasing their
capabilities and how, and

413
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,460
and what that looks like.

414
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:58,890
- I think that's exactly right.

415
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:00,493
The way I think about this is;

416
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:03,170
how are red teams contributing to

417
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:05,360
the exercise of my blue teams.

418
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,159
How are red team's
forcing my blue teams to

419
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:14,160
to work through playbooks and
processes and thought patterns

420
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,430
that they may not have
to do day in and day out

421
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:21,460
but that they shouldn't
let atrophy over time?

422
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:25,470
So I think metrics arounds, you know, Hey

423
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:29,193
how frequently has this
playbook been exercised?

424
00:18:30,871 --> 00:18:33,490
How, what is the improvement over time

425
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:37,540
in time to detection, time
to response, et cetera?

426
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,373
Those are the

427
00:18:38,373 --> 00:18:42,130
those are the right metrics,
I think, to pursue here.

428
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:44,350
- So one of the, oh. Go ahead.

429
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:46,449
- Yeah, you're good. Go ahead, Rob.

430
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:51,290
- So one of the things I've
done in the past is created.

431
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:54,310
So let's say that we
have something as simple

432
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:55,913
as maybe cat's detection, right?

433
00:18:57,495 --> 00:19:00,479
So we have the red team do, just to

434
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,338
frame it a little bit, is let's

435
00:19:02,338 --> 00:19:06,830
we'll have the red team run,
Mamie cats and just standard.

436
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:09,000
mamie cats. Run it. Doesn't
work because, you know

437
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,410
EDR and defender and
all this stuff, stop it.

438
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:13,590
Cool. Check that off as

439
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:16,820
as sort of a good column as a plus one.

440
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:20,960
Then we have him running as
PowerShell running as, you know

441
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,660
injected first ancy bypass
all of these, you know

442
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:26,760
different techniques to
get around our defenses

443
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,360
and put pluses and minuses
and, and score those.

444
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,490
So like when you create
a score card for this

445
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:35,330
for red team success

446
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:40,260
what you're looking for is,
Hey, in general, how do we do

447
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,750
at detection and

448
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,892
on these different verticals, right?

449
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,629
Can, can we see C2?

450
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:48,950
What if we do C2 this way?

451
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:50,480
What if we see do C2 this way?

452
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,490
What if we do C2 that way?

453
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:56,640
How like out of the 13,
14, 50 different command

454
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,090
and control things we tried,
how many did we catch or stop?

455
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:04,330
And then hopefully that
number goes down, right?

456
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:07,710
And that way you can have
your red team sort of

457
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:10,340
doing purple teaming that
we already talked about

458
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:13,060
but like doing those types of tests

459
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:16,530
and what you do from a full red team,

460
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:19,629
an external like a black box red team is,

461
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:21,589
is identify inside of those

462
00:20:21,589 --> 00:20:25,300
what they saw versus what you have.

463
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,930
And that's where that
really comes down, right?

464
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:31,053
So if you have an external red team,

465
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:33,760
someone who doesn't work
at your company, right?

466
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,460
They have no idea what you have

467
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,980
and that's a really great way to start.

468
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:40,080
So you have your blue team
say, we have this, we have

469
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,370
you know, we have AB. We have
EDR. We have proxy detection.

470
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:47,840
We have SSL and you know, all
of these check boxes and say

471
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,500
we definitely have all
these, we should have this.

472
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,220
And then you have your red team put

473
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,730
in points, you know, a
scorecard, very similar

474
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:58,020
and say what they saw,
what they had to bypass.

475
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,536
And then you marry those
up at the end of the

476
00:21:00,536 --> 00:21:02,480
that external red team assessment

477
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,310
or that external
assessment and engagement.

478
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:07,909
And you say, how did we do?

479
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:11,226
And the better, you know,
the better those match up

480
00:21:11,226 --> 00:21:13,340
the better you're doing.

481
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,540
And, and hopefully that gets to, you know

482
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,982
equal footing where the
red team has to, you know

483
00:21:17,982 --> 00:21:22,780
hit every single protection
that you have to get through.

484
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:25,500
And so that zero mark, where they're

485
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,050
both exactly the same as
kind of where you're going

486
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:31,440
- Phil, are you also
leveraging like a scorecard

487
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,293
approach?

488
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:36,840
- Not explicitly, certainly.

489
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,673
Although, that's an interesting

490
00:21:37,673 --> 00:21:40,183
that's interesting idea
that we should think about.

491
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,910
- How do you guys think about like

492
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:46,170
so there's like two things
that I'm considering

493
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:48,610
and kind of like looking
at how to measure, right?

494
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:50,959
This notion one that like,
if you're going to measure

495
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,540
you're going to need to
measure over time, right?

496
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:57,629
So do you view like red
team as a thing that

497
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:59,460
or any offensive testing
as a thing that you just

498
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,504
need to be continually doing all the time?

499
00:22:02,504 --> 00:22:05,090
Is it a thing that you do, like, you know

500
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:07,010
snapshot annual get a number

501
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:08,970
or is this a thing that you're like just

502
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:10,840
continually engaging
against an organization?

503
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,379
How you view, like the benefit

504
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:16,083
in that or leveraging such
a benefit in that way?

505
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,399
- Yeah, for me, I would say

506
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,600
I think the ideal is the
continual red team, right?

507
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,943
That is the perfect golden instate.

508
00:22:25,943 --> 00:22:29,930
That is, there's always
someone watching, right?

509
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:31,630
There's always something looking

510
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:34,330
for that dev server to be
added to that production

511
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:36,860
sub-net it's facing the internets

512
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:38,360
whatever the silly mistake is

513
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,193
that's going to happen, right?

514
00:22:39,193 --> 00:22:41,230
Because those things happen all the time.

515
00:22:42,981 --> 00:22:44,310
And a great continual red team can

516
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:46,060
can help bring visibility, not just

517
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:51,050
to a point in time view of
the company, but continually

518
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:54,419
across the days and weeks,
and months, and years

519
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,130
the operational excellence of the company

520
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:58,520
which is I think super critical.

521
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,613
- Yeah. I'll just echo that.

522
00:23:00,613 --> 00:23:03,154
I think that having a
continual red team where

523
00:23:03,154 --> 00:23:06,530
like the optimal red team,
if I'm saying, you know

524
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:08,139
dream team optimal, you know,

525
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:10,920
day is where you have a red team

526
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,650
that it has zero restrictions

527
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:17,700
and no requirements from
the outside of the red team

528
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:21,580
where you say, all right,
red team, you're unleashed

529
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:25,562
inside this company, like as
an internal red team, right?

530
00:23:25,562 --> 00:23:28,340
You work here as a full-time employee.

531
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:31,350
You don't have any other
inputs from anyone.

532
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:33,929
I want you to, just to go after as much

533
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:37,890
as you can create reports as
you go, like to work with parts

534
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:40,880
of the company, but find
all of the systemic issues.

535
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,750
Like if you can get to a
red team that has, you know,

536
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:48,340
zero input from other parts
of the organization, other

537
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:51,000
than like, learning about new
technologies that are learning

538
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,940
about new things, where
you don't have, you know,

539
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:57,560
them getting pulled in
17 different directions,

540
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:01,260
where they just have the freedom
to kind of just, you know,

541
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:03,310
splat go everywhere.

542
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:07,100
That's my optimal red team
now, does that happen?

543
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:11,040
Oh, never. Like, but that would be

544
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:15,240
because what happens is,
when you have that scenario,

545
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,230
is that they start going after

546
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:22,080
like things that much
like an attacker would

547
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,110
as you gather that information,
as you get that information

548
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:26,850
they'll see the next thing.
They'll see the next thing.

549
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:28,820
Then you'll start seeing where, you know,

550
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,330
all of these different parts

551
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:33,010
of your company
systemically have issues or,

552
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:35,440
or parts of it that have issues.

553
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,440
If I can get access to this

554
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,650
and then I can get access to that.

555
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:40,920
And that's what real attackers do, right?

556
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,130
That's what apt actors do.

557
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:45,680
They'll be in your network
or, or trying to stay

558
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:48,840
in your network, learning
as much as it can.

559
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:51,610
And like, that's what an internal red team

560
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:55,723
that's what real attack
emulation to me is.

561
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:59,053
- Yeah. I think the

562
00:24:59,053 --> 00:25:01,530
the thing that sticks to
me here is when you're

563
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:04,210
trying to build that
institutional resiliency, right?

564
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:05,820
It's not just being able to say

565
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:08,419
like that I can find a
set of vulnerabilities

566
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:10,530
or measure findings in
an environment, right?

567
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:12,500
Like the institutional resiliency's built

568
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,944
I think over, you know, getting,

569
00:25:14,944 --> 00:25:17,740
building the muscle as it were, right?

570
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,270
Like kind of replaying the incidence

571
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:21,810
and figuring out how stuff works.

572
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:24,139
And I think that, that, you know

573
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:26,630
people tend to think a lot
about patching everything.

574
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:27,980
And I think, you know, Phillip

575
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:30,442
you said the, the, when
somebody deploys the

576
00:25:30,442 --> 00:25:33,133
dev server that shouldn't
have been deployed or right?

577
00:25:33,133 --> 00:25:35,380
If you can have an organization

578
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:37,797
or an adversary looking at
you all the time, you know,

579
00:25:37,797 --> 00:25:40,470
and you can respond to those incidents

580
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:42,770
as they're happening
and help you figure out

581
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:45,830
whether the program is actually
able to handle, you know

582
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:48,060
something that feels real
because it seems pretty real.

583
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:49,384
I think there's a real opportunity to

584
00:25:49,384 --> 00:25:51,760
to learn there and also
to spread that learning

585
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,540
around the organization, right?

586
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:55,070
You can demonstrate a real failure

587
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:56,110
in one part of the business

588
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:58,639
and then let the rest of
the business learn from that

589
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,250
or just feel the pressure of it, right?

590
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:02,824
You can actually affect some change.

591
00:26:02,824 --> 00:26:04,120
I'm going to push this forward.

592
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:07,179
Let's, let's jump to, to, you know

593
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,683
critical ingredients here.

594
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:15,030
So I guess Rob, you've
built, like, I don't

595
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:17,259
know, how many red teams?
A dozen, at this point?

596
00:26:17,259 --> 00:26:18,092
- A few.

597
00:26:18,092 --> 00:26:19,720
(laughing)

598
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,570
- Phillip, you've had a pretty interesting

599
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:25,129
set of experiences I would say.

600
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:28,200
You know, for those who
haven't Googled Philip, lots of

601
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,350
lots of good press coverage there.

602
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:34,631
What are the critical ingredients
like in order to, to build

603
00:26:34,632 --> 00:26:38,660
or put in place or red team
that's going to be successful?

604
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:42,400
Like, what are the skills?
like, who are you recruiting?

605
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,040
What are you setting
institutionally around,

606
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:48,840
around that apparatus to actually
leverage it in the space?

607
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,511
Rob, I guess I'll throw that,
throw that one to you first.

608
00:26:51,511 --> 00:26:53,200
- I feel I've been going
first the whole time.

609
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,810
Phillip, do you want
to go first this time?

610
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:55,750
Like this is

611
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:58,610
- All right. Phillip, you go first, man.

612
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:01,224
- Sure. I think there's a couple

613
00:27:01,224 --> 00:27:03,909
of things that are
really, really important.

614
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:08,910
One is, as I mentioned, I
think you have to have a foil

615
00:27:09,423 --> 00:27:12,030
for the red team. That
is the blue team, right?

616
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:14,730
You have to have something
for them to test against you.

617
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:16,710
You have to at least think

618
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:18,840
at some level you're
ready for some levels.

619
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,360
You're ready for some amount
of, of adversarial activity.

620
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,959
That's I think really important.

621
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,050
Two: I think is you have
to be willing to action

622
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:28,562
what the red team finds.

623
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,250
I think it's probably, you
know, not a red teamer myself,

624
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:36,920
but it would probably be the
most frustrating experience

625
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,720
in the world as a red teamer to come back

626
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,770
time after time and write
the same report, right?

627
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:42,470
At some point you just
give them the report and

628
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:43,958
you don't do the testing.

629
00:27:43,958 --> 00:27:45,760
And they can't tell the difference.

630
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,270
- I may have done in the past.

631
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:49,048
(laughing)

632
00:27:49,048 --> 00:27:53,699
- And then I think you have
to have buy-in if you, if you

633
00:27:53,699 --> 00:27:55,640
if you're going to run a real red team

634
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:59,060
you have to have buy-in and
appetite from the business for,

635
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:01,330
for things to break, right?

636
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:02,199
And you have to have that

637
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,300
that willingness and that engagement.

638
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:07,000
- Yep. So, go ahead.

639
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,880
- Rob, I'm gonna throw it to you.

640
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,760
And then I'm gonna just say
we're a little tight on time.

641
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,099
One more question I wanna
get to at the end. So.

642
00:28:15,099 --> 00:28:18,129
- Yeah, real quick, it requires a team.

643
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:19,980
I've seen companies try
and start a red team

644
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:22,540
with one person, with two people.

645
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,739
It's not how it works.

646
00:28:23,739 --> 00:28:27,110
It's like you have to be
willing to put the money

647
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:28,240
in to build that team out.

648
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,116
Now. Yes, you can have a
pen test, you know, you know

649
00:28:31,116 --> 00:28:33,500
crew with a few one or two people

650
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:36,097
but like it's not, there's
no collaboration there.

651
00:28:36,097 --> 00:28:38,610
And the skill set is so
broad that they're never

652
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:41,429
going to find the person
who knows windows, Linux,

653
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:44,030
physical security,
wireless security, and all

654
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:46,270
like all the things that
you'll need for your

655
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:47,389
any company that you have.

656
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:50,400
So you need a team. You
need to be willing to put

657
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,220
in the money for a team.

658
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:55,630
Of at least three, four, five, six, seven.

659
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:57,720
I've been on teams of 12.

660
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:01,510
And the other thing is no bravado.

661
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:06,510
One of the things that
make a bad red team is when

662
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:11,060
you have red teamers who have
the attitude of a red teamer

663
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:13,659
like that says that, you know,

664
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,800
I am all knowing, all powerful

665
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,500
and that is unfortunately very common.

666
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:21,440
And so you need emotional maturity

667
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,200
in your red teamers and
that's not easy to, you know

668
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,770
interview for and figure out.

669
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:29,860
So I would say that, that
the one aspect of it is

670
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:33,330
that it's really hard to, you
know, hire a junior red teamer

671
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:35,300
because they're most of the time

672
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,780
not going to have that emotional maturity

673
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:40,090
to hold the keys to the kingdom.

674
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:41,919
And that's what a red team can do, right?

675
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:45,270
They can hold the most important bits

676
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:48,400
of a company and be okay with deleting it

677
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,840
and letting it go or not
deleting it on the system

678
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:53,500
but like deleting their
copy of it or whatever, like

679
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,870
and getting rid of it and, and moving on.

680
00:29:56,870 --> 00:30:00,810
And that is not something easy to find.

681
00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:03,690
- So you need an institution
that's prepared to learn

682
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:07,718
and able to benefit with a
diversely skilled broad group

683
00:30:07,718 --> 00:30:10,678
of individuals able to
deliver a capability who

684
00:30:10,678 --> 00:30:15,678
have the emotional capacity
to, emotional maturity

685
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,130
to be able to conduct themselves

686
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:19,030
in a way that's commensurate

687
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:21,000
with the trust that they need to have

688
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,820
within the organization
helping affect change.

689
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:26,075
It's a tall order, I will say.

690
00:30:26,075 --> 00:30:27,345
(laughing)

691
00:30:27,345 --> 00:30:28,178
It's an approach.

692
00:30:28,178 --> 00:30:29,840
It is an approachable thing.

693
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,370
Hopefully there are some

694
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:34,409
some folks who can make
that more attainable

695
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:35,899
for folks.

696
00:30:35,899 --> 00:30:37,458
cough, cough Randori.

697
00:30:37,459 --> 00:30:39,288
(laughing)

698
00:30:39,288 --> 00:30:40,300
I got one more question

699
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,899
that I do want us to make time for it.

700
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,000
And it's maybe the most important

701
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,067
so I'm sorry for us running

702
00:30:44,067 --> 00:30:47,440
up to the top of the time,
but where do we start?

703
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,650
So you, presumably as listeners

704
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:52,520
on the call here are trying to interested

705
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,960
in building a capability
and want to know, like

706
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,723
what are the first steps to take.

707
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:59,710
Phillip, first step,

708
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:02,340
somebody's gonna try to
kick off a red team exercise

709
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:03,173
where do they go first?

710
00:31:03,173 --> 00:31:04,459
What do they do?

711
00:31:04,459 --> 00:31:05,292
- Yeah, yeah.

712
00:31:06,822 --> 00:31:07,949
So the very first you're

713
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:11,480
almost certainly not going
to, not only shouldn't

714
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,950
but probably can't build an
internal capability, right?

715
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:15,630
You're, you're working with an

716
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:19,233
with an outside red team
provider of some sort.

717
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:24,260
I think that you,

718
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,780
and I'm assuming by the way

719
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:28,696
in this answer that you
have already gone in

720
00:31:28,696 --> 00:31:31,404
and gotten the buy-in and all
that fun stuff, and you're

721
00:31:31,404 --> 00:31:34,090
you're ready to go find
the right partner and,

722
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:39,060
and get punched in the face at some level.

723
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:40,810
Then I think it's, it's
finding that person

724
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:43,240
and making sure they're a match
for you and what you need.

725
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,507
They're going to bring the right level of,

726
00:31:45,507 --> 00:31:46,460
of the right skill sets,

727
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:48,290
the right level of technical
diligence, that kind of thing.

728
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:51,558
There's a broad, there's a huge gradient

729
00:31:51,558 --> 00:31:55,016
of the skills of external red teams.

730
00:31:55,016 --> 00:31:57,450
And so making sure that
you bring in the skills

731
00:31:57,450 --> 00:32:00,290
and the kind of the kind
of a partner that you need

732
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:03,030
for the kind of evaluation you have, and

733
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:06,610
that you have the right way
to measure it over time.

734
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:09,490
Right? I think those are the very, very,

735
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:11,700
very quick starting points.

736
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:14,604
- Awesome. Rob, minute on the clock here

737
00:32:14,604 --> 00:32:16,254
how do you start at your company?

738
00:32:17,848 --> 00:32:19,360
- So honestly, you start

739
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,129
with at least one person
who's been there a while,

740
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:23,650
at least one person who's

741
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,890
outside from outside the company, and at

742
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:29,300
least one person who's a senior
person who's been around.

743
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:32,220
Right? You start with those
people, you put those together

744
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:34,620
because they'll have the
institutional mindset

745
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:37,689
they'll have the external,
I don't know anything yet

746
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:40,060
you know, open mind and you have a leader.

747
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,860
So those that's where I would start.

748
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,420
- Wow. Awesome.

749
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:47,707
It's been an amazing conversation.

750
00:32:47,707 --> 00:32:50,380
Gentle peoples, greatly appreciative

751
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:53,073
of everybody spending time here with us.

752
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:56,960
Phillip Martin. Thank you so much.

753
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,760
Rob Fuller, always a pleasure.

754
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,430
I always love chatting with you.

755
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:05,030
You guys, about all things offensive cyber

756
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:07,320
and I hope we get a chance to do it again.

757
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,649
And then to the crew here at RSA.

758
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:10,820
Thanks for putting this all together.

759
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:13,570
Greatly appreciative for the,
for the audience as well.

760
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:15,909
- Thanks everyone.

761
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:16,743
- Thanks.
