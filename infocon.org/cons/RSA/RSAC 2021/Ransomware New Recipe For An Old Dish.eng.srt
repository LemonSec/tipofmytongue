1
00:00:01,594 --> 00:00:03,263
- Hello, RSA 2021.

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:06,449
It does seem more than a year

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:10,090
since certainly the 2020 edition of RSA.

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:11,170
I'm Raj Samani.

5
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:15,510
I'm a Chief Scientist and Fellow at McAfee

6
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:19,170
and today I'm joined by John.

7
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:20,560
- Hi, my name is John Fokker,

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,169
principal engineer and head
of cyber investigations

9
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:24,440
at McAfee.

10
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:28,244
- So, today we're gonna be
talking about ransomware

11
00:00:28,244 --> 00:00:32,840
and I know for some there
may be an eye roll, I guess.

12
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,080
It's like, "Oh, well we've
heard about ransomware before."

13
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,183
But I guess John,

14
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,290
it's not like it was a
couple of years back.

15
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,570
And if you remember,

16
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:46,083
it was consumers being
hit for like 300 bucks.

17
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,973
We can't even call it the
same category anymore, can we?

18
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:53,783
- No, you're absolutely right.

19
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,489
And as the title explained,

20
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,503
it's a new recipe for an old dish.

21
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:02,450
It seemed a couple of years back, I think,

22
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:05,560
I recall we had a presentation
on ransomware as well,

23
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,220
where we said it was dead
and then it resurrected

24
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,630
and at that time we thought,

25
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:12,310
well it cannot be more refined

26
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:15,630
or more impactful than it is then

27
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:18,550
but well, here we are again

28
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:21,902
and it's actually gotten much worse.

29
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:24,650
- Yeah, I think for me the...

30
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:28,480
I think where it really changed was,

31
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:32,490
I think, it was 2016
we saw the SamSam crew.

32
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:35,666
Remember when they were
going off to hospitals.

33
00:01:35,666 --> 00:01:36,750
- Yeah.

34
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,780
I think it was 2016, actually.

35
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,630
Yeah, it was early 2016

36
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:42,699
'cause following SamSam,

37
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,290
you then had the kind of introduction

38
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:45,650
of the GandCrab crew,

39
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:47,900
and then all of a sudden
things started to change.

40
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,840
And then of course the Ryuk gang came in

41
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,450
and just amped it up.

42
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:55,830
So, it is a new recipe.

43
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:56,663
I don't know.

44
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,420
Maybe it's not an old dish

45
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:04,420
but, well, I guess we
can debate that later on.

46
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,960
So, actually I'm gonna let you kick off

47
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,859
and really kinda talk about

48
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:13,290
what is the ransomware recipe today.

49
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:15,940
- Yes, so in order to understand

50
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,770
what is actually happening today,

51
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,100
I think it's good to take everybody along

52
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,579
on something that happened in the past

53
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,690
and build it up from there

54
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:26,820
so we can see what actually
is tweaked in the ingredients.

55
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:30,269
So, when we look at
Ransomware-as-a-Service,

56
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:34,060
we discussed this similar
slide two years ago,

57
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:38,530
where normally you have
ransomware admins and developers.

58
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:41,770
So, those are individuals
that build the framework.

59
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:43,020
The names you see now,

60
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:46,120
the headline names with the
naming and shaming sides,

61
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,250
those are cyber criminals,
organized crime criminals,

62
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:52,820
that offer a complete
framework to suit extortion.

63
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,950
That's what it is, extortion.

64
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:56,083
And what we often see

65
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:58,520
with the Ransomware-as-a-Service
are affiliates,

66
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,820
are people that are partnering up.

67
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,299
And this is not something new.

68
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:06,080
We saw this in 2014 and
we'll show examples later on

69
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,160
and these are individuals

70
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,329
that are actually
spreading the ransomware.

71
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:12,460
They are making or
creating the infections.

72
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:15,470
They pay the sum to the developers,

73
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:18,040
either divide themselves in
or have to prove themselves.

74
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,730
There is some kind of exchange

75
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:22,609
in order to get a ransomware sample,

76
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:25,170
to get the build, as they call it.

77
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:28,070
And these folks go out and they infect.

78
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:29,370
And in the old days,

79
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:34,320
what we saw in 2014 and
now on a lesser degree,

80
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,000
you see a lot of exploit kits,

81
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,050
a lot of spam runs,

82
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:40,470
a lot of botnet traffic
and all those things.

83
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,900
And they created in the past,

84
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:46,030
don't mind you, already
millions of victims.

85
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:50,630
So, this was the recipe
that was valid then

86
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:53,000
but as a good chef,

87
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,850
you're always looking,

88
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:55,260
how can I tweak stuff?

89
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,390
How's the outcome different?

90
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:00,730
So, why and how did we turn up

91
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:04,369
to become such a big
problem that it is now.

92
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:06,110
But when we look at the outcome,

93
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:09,230
we had regular victims here
that could be individuals,

94
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:11,810
your personal pictures, consumers,

95
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:15,900
but that's surely changed over time

96
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:19,430
into more organizations,
complete companies.

97
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:21,550
When you see the headline
news are larger companies.

98
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:25,500
So, what did change in this
mix, in these three pillars?

99
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,710
While we can explain it
to you in the next slides,

100
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:29,060
but to hint a little bit,

101
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,310
we believe that there is a difference

102
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:33,220
in the type of affiliates.

103
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:37,000
No longer is it spam mail or exploit kits.

104
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,490
No, these are organized crime groups

105
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:42,520
that have skills in pen testing

106
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,380
and that is one of the
most things that we see.

107
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,740
So, I love a movie analogy

108
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:50,810
and I know Raj you're
a big fan of "Rocky."

109
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:52,660
Well, I'm a big fan of "Rambo."

110
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:55,100
So yeah, in the old days,

111
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,946
when we talked about
CTB-Locker and CryptoWall,

112
00:04:57,946 --> 00:04:59,220
we talked a lot about spray-n-pray.

113
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:02,923
So, I use Rambo with his M16 machine gun.

114
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,260
And nowadays it's a bit different.

115
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,289
They're more organized.

116
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:08,460
They're laser-focused,

117
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:11,460
they know exactly which target to focus on

118
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:14,710
and they compromise it
completely back to front.

119
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,370
And this is interesting

120
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:18,130
'cause the spray-n-pray

121
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:20,080
was targeting all your mom-and-pop shops,

122
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,210
the smaller entities,

123
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:24,390
your maybe family members,
you get that email

124
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:27,250
and now, they're trying
to stay under the radar

125
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:30,150
and they completely infect
complete organizations.

126
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:34,325
But mind you, these were not
the admins doing that work.

127
00:05:34,325 --> 00:05:35,490
These are the affiliates.

128
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:37,093
So, that is what changed.

129
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:41,960
And I don't know, Raj, do you
remember this advertisement?

130
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,793
It was--

131
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,580
- Yeah, I guess we've seen
this kind of sales model

132
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:48,871
coming back.

133
00:05:48,871 --> 00:05:50,609
I think this was 2014.

134
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:52,500
So, it's interesting to see how things

135
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,960
have fundamentally shifted
and changed, but yes.

136
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,870
Interesting how CTB-Locker and everything

137
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:01,990
kind of was the precursor to things.

138
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:05,816
- Yeah, and CTB-Locker was
one of the first ransomware.

139
00:06:05,816 --> 00:06:08,869
So, they were actually doing
an asset service framework.

140
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:11,620
They really designed it from the get-go

141
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:16,570
and I know it was before
the SamSam type of attacks,

142
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:17,560
the targeted attacks,

143
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,490
you said the big game phishing

144
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:21,130
but it was interesting to see.

145
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,550
This individual,

146
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,390
we believe that the (mumbles) Tapkin

147
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:26,349
is the one behind CTB-Locker,

148
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,870
the developer or the admin

149
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:29,970
is actively recruiting individuals

150
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:31,850
and asking for more.

151
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,690
Well, the emphasis is on

152
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:35,090
that people can spread,

153
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:36,099
they can spray,

154
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,340
they can have a partner,

155
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:39,053
they can create intersections.

156
00:06:40,844 --> 00:06:43,740
Nowhere in this advertisement

157
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:44,990
are they actually asking,

158
00:06:46,327 --> 00:06:48,607
"Okay, do you wanna focus on companies?

159
00:06:48,607 --> 00:06:52,153
"Do you wanna focus on
complete penetration,

160
00:06:53,324 --> 00:06:55,510
"Metasploit framework,"
and things like that.

161
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:58,300
It's purely based on spray-n-pray.

162
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,440
How different is it then

163
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:04,920
if we take this advertisement,
and this is Unknown

164
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,780
and we believe that this is the individual

165
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:09,650
that's affiliated with
(mumbles) REvil ransomware.

166
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:13,260
They're both job postings.

167
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:16,800
However, they're asking for
different type of individual.

168
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,240
So, in this case, there's less slots.

169
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,480
Slots are the places

170
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:23,299
where you can partner for.

171
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,970
So, he offers four partner's seats

172
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:28,180
and they're actually looking for people

173
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:32,120
who are confident with
nas, with tape backups,

174
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:37,010
with Metasploit Framework,
Koadic, (mumbles),

175
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:39,070
and have a really, really good knowledge

176
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:41,630
of the Active Directory and Hyper-V.

177
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:45,000
So, you see that there's
a big change going on

178
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,493
and they're focusing more on
the organizations or companies.

179
00:07:49,877 --> 00:07:51,140
- Let's just rewind for a second,

180
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,219
'cause that's a lot of information

181
00:07:54,193 --> 00:07:57,460
and you know a lot of people

182
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:00,623
who may not do this, I guess, routinely,

183
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:05,020
may well get confused with the
terminology that we're using

184
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:08,560
but effectively, when we
talk about affiliates,

185
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,190
when we talk about ransomware groups,

186
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:13,053
when we talk about
things like attribution,

187
00:08:14,224 --> 00:08:16,000
(sighs)

188
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,010
I'd argue that the
majority of the industry

189
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:20,210
fundamentally get it wrong, right?

190
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:22,159
So, for example,

191
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,880
we read stories that

192
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,840
in the United Kingdom, for example,

193
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,450
one of the largest
travel bureaus companies

194
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:35,659
that allow people to exchange money,

195
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:39,000
they were hit by actually
with Sodinokibi, right?

196
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,832
- Correct.

197
00:08:39,832 --> 00:08:44,047
- And all that we saw in the press was,

198
00:08:44,047 --> 00:08:45,503
"Sodinokibi hits company,

199
00:08:46,814 --> 00:08:48,757
or, "Ryuk hits company there."

200
00:08:50,145 --> 00:08:51,410
And I think fundamentally,

201
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:52,949
when we hear about,

202
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,330
whether it was NetWalker

203
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:59,330
or whatever the ransomware
variant of the time,

204
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:02,280
it fundamentally fails to understand

205
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,060
the business model behind
the way that they work.

206
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,010
So, in other words,

207
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,990
like historically we'd always say,

208
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:12,330
well, between the
perpetrator and the victim,

209
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:13,610
there was a one-to-one relationship.

210
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:16,557
In other words, the perpetrator

211
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:18,320
carries out an attack on victim.

212
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,070
But that model has changed fundamentally

213
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:23,170
and I think ransomware

214
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,100
and certainly the affiliate schemes

215
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,050
is a really good example of that

216
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:33,050
because it's not the person
that developed the ransomware.

217
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,469
Actually, they outsource
the attack to a third party

218
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:42,120
and that third party is the
one that came after you.

219
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,383
They're the ones that
selected to target you.

220
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:47,680
Later on we'll discuss the reason why,

221
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,630
but how they got employed

222
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:55,080
was dependent today upon their capability

223
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,580
or understanding of corporate networks.

224
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,930
So, in other words,

225
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:00,560
and I think this is the scary part,

226
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,839
where it's not a really,
really good developer

227
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,410
going out and figuring out
how to target companies.

228
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:07,540
Now what they're doing is

229
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,110
they're basically outsourcing it to people

230
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,890
that understand corporate networks

231
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:13,920
and then going out and compromising them.

232
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,439
So, I guess you could say

233
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,063
that it's professionalized
more than it's ever been.

234
00:10:23,575 --> 00:10:24,408
Would you agree with that?

235
00:10:24,408 --> 00:10:27,320
I guess that's kind of what
we're saying here, right?

236
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,970
- Totally, and from both sides.

237
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:33,190
We're talking about affiliates
now, but it's also branding.

238
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:35,050
It is like you said.

239
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:37,579
The headline news, the Ryuk or the REvil

240
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:42,210
or the GandCrab hits a large organization.

241
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:45,620
It instills fear in the
next victims that they make

242
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,990
and that is what drives

243
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:49,640
that framework behind the ransomware.

244
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,199
But in all honesty,

245
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,830
if you are a competent
affiliate or pen tester,

246
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:57,140
you would do it with BitLocker

247
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:00,860
or any type of encryption
method would be sufficed.

248
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,140
However, they team up with this framework

249
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:05,930
because it facilitates that whole process

250
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:08,579
on the backhand of the data exfiltration.

251
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:11,770
It is the extortion platform
where you can communicate

252
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:14,140
and it's that fear factor.

253
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:17,943
Very much though, it is a
recipe that's often copied.

254
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,910
What'd you see here are actually
the official job postings

255
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,319
of other ransomware families

256
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,630
you might have heard in the news.

257
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:27,620
We've done extensive research on LockBit,

258
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,730
REvil, NetWalker,

259
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,440
Phobos is there as well

260
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:35,040
and they more or less offer
the same type of description.

261
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,689
They tell you something
about their ransomware

262
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:41,350
and eventually how they set it up.

263
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:43,760
They show that they mean business,

264
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,740
that they're trustworthy on the forum

265
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:46,760
that they advertise,

266
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,350
that these are all forum discussions

267
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:50,420
and then they say, well, you can join us

268
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:53,229
and we're looking for people
with skillset X, Y, and Z

269
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:55,370
and these are the potential payouts.

270
00:11:55,370 --> 00:12:00,370
These are the modern job
postings for cyber criminals.

271
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:03,491
If you wanna be successful

272
00:12:03,491 --> 00:12:05,900
and cyber criminals
that are skilled enough

273
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,130
and they wanna make a lot of money,

274
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:09,090
they go after these job postings.

275
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:14,070
- Yeah, the other important part

276
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:19,070
is the affiliates is where
the value is, I guess.

277
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:22,709
In other words,

278
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:26,250
having a strong affiliate program

279
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:31,250
is what makes the ransomware successful.

280
00:12:32,805 --> 00:12:35,280
(sighs)

281
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,089
Okay, so let me call it out.

282
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,060
I will say

283
00:12:39,656 --> 00:12:43,109
if you look at the percentage wise,

284
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:47,600
it doesn't really matter how
good the ransomware is itself.

285
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,680
Of course, it does matter

286
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,829
to make sure that it can't be decrypted

287
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:53,010
if it's buggy and so forth,

288
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:55,720
but fundamentally,

289
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:00,720
the reason why REvil/Sodinokibi
has been so successful,

290
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:05,830
and I know we're gonna
get into this by the way,

291
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:09,520
but it's because they understand

292
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,252
how to recruit top quality affiliates.

293
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:20,010
That's the reason we're seeing
the growth in ransomware.

294
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:21,430
And, of course, the fact
that people are paying

295
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:23,579
but people are paying because
the affiliate is so good

296
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:25,840
and they're able to
compromise large enterprises

297
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:29,340
and make it so damn powerful

298
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,340
because you've gotta pay

299
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:32,370
because they've taken out
your entire environment.

300
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:34,410
So, that's why it happens.

301
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:36,900
And I think John, and I know
we're gonna get into this,

302
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,699
but if you look at
something like NetWalker,

303
00:13:39,699 --> 00:13:41,550
the NetWalker team,

304
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:44,010
it's like it clicked, right?

305
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:48,120
It was right about March of this year.

306
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,886
Not this year, last year.

307
00:13:49,886 --> 00:13:50,718
- 2020.

308
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:52,100
- All right, yeah in 2020.

309
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:52,933
(chuckles lightly)

310
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:53,766
- We all lost the year.

311
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:56,000
- Yeah, it kind of disappeared, right?

312
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,840
Like in March 2020,

313
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,217
where the network recruiters
kind of turned around and said,

314
00:13:59,217 --> 00:14:00,927
"Well, hey, look.

315
00:14:00,927 --> 00:14:01,977
"How can we make more money?

316
00:14:01,977 --> 00:14:04,660
"Well, let's have a look at
what everybody else is doing."

317
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:05,740
And, of course,

318
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:08,290
that's when they fundamentally
shifted and changed.

319
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:16,490
This is why we're seeing
such a growth in ransomware.

320
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:17,323
It was there before

321
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:21,290
but now it's critical scale, really.

322
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:23,413
- True, and that's a valid point.

323
00:14:25,174 --> 00:14:27,400
With all four of these advertisements,

324
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,040
the affiliates could be exchanged

325
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,906
and you would still have
a successful affiliate

326
00:14:30,907 --> 00:14:33,973
and they would still
target large organizations.

327
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:35,833
That being said,

328
00:14:37,188 --> 00:14:39,110
we do realize and we do identify

329
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:41,090
that there are certain
growth factors in play.

330
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:42,540
Like you mentioned with NetWalker,

331
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,520
they changed a little bit in their system,

332
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,380
opened it up to a little bit more people,

333
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,697
professionalized, automated certain things

334
00:14:48,697 --> 00:14:50,290
and that kind of paved the way.

335
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:51,459
They looked at REvil,

336
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:53,090
they looked at all the other ones

337
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:56,233
and it kind of paved the way
to the largest successes.

338
00:14:57,628 --> 00:14:59,130
Right, why don't we pivot?

339
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:00,630
We're talking a little
bit about the affiliates

340
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:03,730
but I think our viewers
would be interested in

341
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:04,960
okay, what takes place

342
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,040
and how does the targeting takes place?

343
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,120
How are these people,

344
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,800
how do these new chefs
find their new ingredients?

345
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,790
So, there's always been a healthy,

346
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:15,290
interesting corporate networks

347
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,860
but maybe we can talk a little bit about

348
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:24,599
what we see as quite common
used methods of entry

349
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,820
and we're probably gonna mention RDP.

350
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,570
(laughs softly)

351
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:31,403
- That was the first one

352
00:15:31,403 --> 00:15:32,781
I was gonna come up with that.

353
00:15:32,781 --> 00:15:34,780
(laughs loudly)

354
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,300
Well, actually I think interestingly,

355
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,790
if you look at recent analysis

356
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:40,959
from the likes of Coveware,

357
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,290
historically, RDP

358
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:46,650
was always the number one
most common entry vector

359
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:49,360
for corporate networks

360
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,363
related to ransomware attacks.

361
00:15:53,415 --> 00:15:55,430
I think that's just dipped now

362
00:15:55,430 --> 00:16:00,199
but effectively, RDP is
the open door to a network

363
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,930
and ironically, and I know we'll talk

364
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:04,530
about how they get RDP credits,

365
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:08,600
but fundamentally, every organization

366
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,383
and every person listening to this,

367
00:16:12,935 --> 00:16:14,160
go and scan your network,

368
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,870
and certainly from outside,

369
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:18,763
to determine whether there's
anything open with 3389.

370
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,350
If you don't do that,

371
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:23,780
then it really is just a matter of time.

372
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:27,314
- Correct, and I think one
thing that's on the list

373
00:16:27,314 --> 00:16:28,146
that we'll mention as well

374
00:16:28,147 --> 00:16:29,950
as we go into that a
little bit later as well

375
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:32,960
is Infostealers, commodity malware,

376
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:36,120
especially with a lot of
people working from home now

377
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,500
and not always being...

378
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,110
Well, we're all security professionals,

379
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:40,570
but we can we can understand

380
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:44,000
that not every company
has a level of security

381
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,850
and they're happy that
they have Office 365

382
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:48,910
and they can work in a cloud

383
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:52,110
but without multi-factor authentication.

384
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:54,910
And basically, the Infostealer
is a small malware.

385
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:57,199
It wasn't always considered very dangerous

386
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,390
but it is very effective
in stealing your passwords.

387
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:01,710
And we know that the ranks

388
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:04,609
where gangs are buying these logs on mass,

389
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:06,949
just to find those corporate credentials.

390
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:10,150
They're digging,
literally sifting for gold

391
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:10,983
through all the mud,

392
00:17:10,983 --> 00:17:12,609
just to find that one organization

393
00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:14,260
that they can breach in that way.

394
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,709
Well, another one is phishing, I guess.

395
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:22,145
The age old one that relates
with malware or not but--

396
00:17:22,145 --> 00:17:23,123
- It still works.

397
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,640
Actually, I remember within
the last sort of 12 months,

398
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,660
we've been dealing with phishing attacks,

399
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:35,970
which have been actually
leveraging and utilizing

400
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:37,890
kind of COVID themes

401
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,700
as a vehicle to get
inside corporate networks.

402
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,340
And, of course, in that
particular instance

403
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:44,639
they then drop ransomware
in the environment.

404
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,880
So, still there, still works.

405
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,363
People still click on links.

406
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:53,433
And so, we have to
anticipate for that as well.

407
00:17:55,547 --> 00:17:58,360
- Another one we saw
is a commodity malware.

408
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,107
I think a lot of the
security professionals

409
00:18:00,107 --> 00:18:01,490
saw the Emotet takedown,

410
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:04,570
which was a great success
by our law enforcement

411
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:07,260
and Emotet was a loader malware.

412
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:11,030
In fact, a lot of individuals
through phishing, actually,

413
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,320
leveraged a platform,

414
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,020
which they then sold access

415
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:17,070
to all these systems
through the cyber-criminals.

416
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,570
And we see something similar happening

417
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:20,427
with other families right now.

418
00:18:20,427 --> 00:18:25,389
And I think for us if we
look back at Q4 from 2020,

419
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:26,360
wasn't it, Raj?

420
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:31,250
There's a lot of these groups

421
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,390
are very proficient

422
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:35,420
in exploiting public-facing applications.

423
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:38,310
So, you might trust your VPN provider

424
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:41,450
and there will be an exploit
in that or a vulnerability

425
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:45,030
and it's the turnover
time for them to exploit.

426
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,860
This has been crazy.

427
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:50,120
It's been much faster than
we've seen in the past.

428
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:53,750
- Yeah, and I think we
actually have got a list

429
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,830
of public-facing applications.

430
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:57,210
Based on the last couple of weeks,

431
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:59,310
you'd probably wanna put exchange on there

432
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:03,129
with DearCry.

433
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:04,850
I can't speak English once.

434
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:07,370
DearCry and Black Kingdom,

435
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:09,018
but, of course,

436
00:19:09,019 --> 00:19:10,820
there are other variants

437
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:13,210
that are popping up just
leveraging this proxy log on issue.

438
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:16,620
And, of course, it shows you...

439
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,770
Well, actually, I think it reemphasizes

440
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:20,970
the need for strong cyber hygiene.

441
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:22,010
Above all else,

442
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:23,930
the best line of defense
is strong hygiene,

443
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:28,930
which is a lot of the fundamental
steps required, I think,

444
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,853
is the first line of defense.

445
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,663
- Yeah, totally.

446
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,480
But there's so much money

447
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:41,610
that exploits that are
normally quite costly

448
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,879
are pocket change for a
lot of these groups now.

449
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,100
So, they have the financial resources

450
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:51,392
and quite often more resources
than many organizations.

451
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:55,852
But still pivoting back
to our trusty, old RDP,

452
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:59,640
some of the stuff we saw.

453
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,340
We highlight a couple of these tools

454
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:03,199
that we saw in the wild.

455
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,220
We actually ran a honeypot network

456
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:08,450
and we saw the criminals
trying to break in

457
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:11,760
and they tried to pivot
within our honeypot network

458
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,710
and they downloaded another
tool called NL Brute

459
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:15,870
and they tried to use that

460
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:17,610
to brute force other systems

461
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:20,572
that we created in our
fictitious little network.

462
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:24,510
Another one, this is an underground tool

463
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:26,200
heavily advertised on the forums

464
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,970
and there's an individual
that's offering this

465
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:32,180
and it's a specialized
tools also for RDP cracking.

466
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,280
It's RDP Brute

467
00:20:34,554 --> 00:20:39,050
and the license is for only individuals.

468
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:41,730
So, it's for cyber criminals
that are vouching systems.

469
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:44,803
So, they really liked
this piece of software.

470
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,200
It does the job.

471
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,150
But yeah, if you're not skilled enough,

472
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:53,980
there's the Amazon of RDP Shops, I guess.

473
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,690
It's easy as one, two, three.

474
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:56,670
Was that your daughter

475
00:20:56,670 --> 00:21:00,980
that looked up a company within
minutes on this site, Raj?

476
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,380
- Yeah, she's done a couple.

477
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,470
It's remarkable, one, two, three.

478
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:09,500
Ironically, I think the
most common password

479
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:14,500
that we found being sold
on these underground forums

480
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:15,763
was NULL.

481
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:18,063
In other words,

482
00:21:18,063 --> 00:21:19,220
there's no password then.
- No password.

483
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,550
One could think that it's okay.

484
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:22,500
It's a VM that somebody spun up

485
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,260
and it's just for testing
and all these things,

486
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:26,460
but far too often,

487
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,760
we do our own scanning

488
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:32,640
or there's a system that
has a local admin account

489
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,620
with no password

490
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:36,669
and somebody just wants
to set up a database

491
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,680
to test out something new

492
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,490
and they do use a corporate credential

493
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:43,443
and then all harm is already done.

494
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:46,230
So it's--

495
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:51,230
- And look, we're not out
there shaming users or what.

496
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,250
That's not the objective here.

497
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:56,070
Here's the reality.

498
00:21:56,070 --> 00:22:00,520
RDP is one of the most common
entry vectors for ransomware

499
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,190
but actually it's used

500
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:05,360
by all sorts of kind
of bad guys out there.

501
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,580
- True.

502
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:09,790
- If you are using RDP,

503
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:12,120
or even if you're not using RDP,

504
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:15,642
continuously scan from the outside in,

505
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:20,660
scan your network routinely

506
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:25,600
and figure out what you have that's 3389,

507
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,273
but also, and we said here,

508
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:30,883
test the password.

509
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:33,169
You'd be surprised

510
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:37,760
how many IR incidents we deal with

511
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:42,230
and it was precipitated by a
password that's on this screen.

512
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:44,700
- Yep, totally.

513
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,810
And one piece of advice that I give

514
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:48,460
is multi-factor authentication

515
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,960
that is, I think, a very effective blocker

516
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,680
in stopping a lot of these
attacks in their tracks

517
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,123
when they do go try to get access.

518
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:01,320
But it's not always

519
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,453
that they have to scan themselves for RDP.

520
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:10,850
And that's probably
fueled with the outlook

521
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:15,300
on tremendous amounts of cash.

522
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:18,040
There's a real market for
initial access brokers,

523
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,720
as we might call it.

524
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,490
So, we collected some
stuff from the underground

525
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:24,930
and we see cyber criminals

526
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:29,750
offering complete companies for sale.

527
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:32,780
And funny enough, if you
read this advertisement

528
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:36,180
they are a bit cryptic
with the description.

529
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:38,380
So, they won't tell you
exactly what company it is

530
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:40,740
'cause they realize that law enforcement

531
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:44,440
and the security professionals, as we are,

532
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,950
are scanning these sources too,

533
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:51,010
but still this individual, NetNet,

534
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:53,840
is offering a company in consumer goods

535
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,080
with a revenue of $3 billion

536
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,340
and he has VPN accounts

537
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,639
and this is how we often see it.

538
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,920
This is the initial stage

539
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,720
that leads to that headline

540
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,610
that a large organization
got breached by ransomware.

541
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:14,490
- Actually, and I know we
kind of touched on the price

542
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:17,250
of ransomware demands

543
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:20,772
and kind of historically it
was a couple of hundred bucks.

544
00:24:20,772 --> 00:24:23,903
That was one, two weeks ago
that I think was $50 million.

545
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:29,860
And actually, it's posts like these

546
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:33,260
that really demonstrate why

547
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,810
they are able to demand so much.

548
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:39,320
Look, they can charge

549
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:42,480
or they can quote 7,500 bucks

550
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,740
but actually they make $3 billion.

551
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:48,980
And so, to the ransomware affiliate

552
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:51,920
that's going out and
conducting the attack,

553
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,207
for them they just do the numbers and go,

554
00:24:54,207 --> 00:24:55,857
"Well, if they make $3 billion,

555
00:24:55,857 --> 00:24:57,607
"I can charge them certainly
more than a few hundred."

556
00:24:57,607 --> 00:25:00,190
And I think that's part of the reason

557
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:02,830
why they've been slow.

558
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:04,590
The fact that they're going
off the corporate networks

559
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:07,159
and the fact that corporate
networks is so accessible

560
00:25:08,291 --> 00:25:09,480
and easy to get access to

561
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,623
and they make such a huge amount of money,

562
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:13,440
gives them confidence

563
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,933
that they can go in and
charge like 50 million bucks.

564
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:21,620
- True, and it's not
only from the face value

565
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:24,310
'cause a lot of these companies
that have been breached

566
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:27,370
they're not as well known, the majority.

567
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:28,719
But what we've noticed

568
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,220
is that a lot of these cyber criminals

569
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:33,690
are actually using business
intelligence tools,

570
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:36,786
legitimate business
intelligence tools like ZoomInfo

571
00:25:36,786 --> 00:25:37,680
and there's some others

572
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,930
in order to determine

573
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:41,460
what the net value of that company is.

574
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:45,610
The revenue, they know the
board, the senior executives,

575
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:46,443
all kinds of things.

576
00:25:46,443 --> 00:25:49,129
So, for instance, we
have ASML in this case.

577
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:51,480
So, they use business intelligence tools.

578
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,670
And this is scary to me

579
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:55,930
'cause from where I go,

580
00:25:55,930 --> 00:26:00,010
it's okay just to determine
the value of a company

581
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:02,210
but you don't only determine
the value of the company,

582
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:04,410
you know who to senior execs are.

583
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:07,770
And I am often shocked
by how much information

584
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:10,223
is actually available
through these meetings.

585
00:26:11,797 --> 00:26:14,820
It's quite easy to
determine the ransom demand

586
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:17,939
in combination with
being inside your network

587
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:20,870
and seeing the actual figures,

588
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:23,080
but also it's child's play

589
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,710
to contact the executives directly.

590
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:27,880
And if I recall well,

591
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:30,440
there was an interview with Unknown,

592
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,810
the individual behind the REvil ransomware

593
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:33,976
and he was saying the exact same thing.

594
00:26:33,977 --> 00:26:36,047
He was like, "Our next step is gonna be,

595
00:26:36,047 --> 00:26:37,017
"we're gonna ring up

596
00:26:37,017 --> 00:26:40,107
"the executive of this company or the CEO

597
00:26:40,107 --> 00:26:41,837
"and we're gonna tell
them some juicy details

598
00:26:41,837 --> 00:26:43,337
"and that he needs to pay up."

599
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:49,020
- Yeah, and actually I took a
call a couple of weeks back,

600
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,800
and John I think you probably remember,

601
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:54,590
from a CEO of an organization

602
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:57,410
making billions of dollars

603
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:59,890
and they got direct access to the CEO.

604
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:02,177
It was the CEO that called me and said,

605
00:27:02,177 --> 00:27:03,726
"I've got a ticking clock

606
00:27:03,727 --> 00:27:05,727
"and they said that they're
gonna publish everything

607
00:27:05,727 --> 00:27:08,317
"within 48 hours.

608
00:27:08,317 --> 00:27:09,597
"What do I do?"

609
00:27:09,597 --> 00:27:14,597
And so, I guess it kind of reemphasizes,

610
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:18,229
'cause we've had these
discussions in the past

611
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:19,870
is cyber on the board agenda?

612
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:22,659
And we're all sick of those surveys,

613
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:27,660
but it is without doubt at that level

614
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:33,100
because that's who the
bad guys are going after.

615
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:36,940
They're the ones that are being contacted

616
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,460
and it's the high,

617
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:41,850
it's the C-level executives
at these companies

618
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:44,189
that are having to kinda determine

619
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:48,550
what they do with not just
their data being encrypted

620
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:50,460
but also the publication

621
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:53,960
of business confidential information.

622
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:54,793
And I think that

623
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:58,610
that's causing a lot of conflict, I think,

624
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:00,463
within organizations today, really.

625
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:02,283
- Totally agree.

626
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:04,970
And I think the last one

627
00:28:05,931 --> 00:28:08,150
of the initial accesses that we have seen

628
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:10,410
and we've observed a sharp rise,

629
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:13,760
especially since last year is
the use of commodity malware.

630
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,440
So, we listed a couple of
the commodity malware here

631
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:19,400
and this is what we see in our databases.

632
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,360
A lot of advertisements saying,

633
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,479
well, we've thousands of logs

634
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:27,850
and we are open to selling our logs

635
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:31,310
and you can use them to allocate or find

636
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:32,960
the credentials that you need

637
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,690
in order to infect the company.

638
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:36,400
So, there's specific tools for this.

639
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,510
This is another example.

640
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:41,480
And here is a screenshot

641
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,890
of one of the tools

642
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:44,270
that somebody actually shared

643
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:46,800
and they show that

644
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,129
the amount of accounts that
they had from other countries,

645
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:52,050
the type of environment that
they were actually infecting

646
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:53,360
and also the password count

647
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,030
that they pulled it from the browser.

648
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:57,420
If they were FTP
credentials, VPN credentials,

649
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:59,810
RDP is child's play.

650
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:00,950
So, this is something that

651
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:03,940
especially, giving COVID,

652
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,670
people are working from home.

653
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:10,010
The IT security is less spread
out across all the devices

654
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:12,290
and they're quite a challenge
in playing catch up.

655
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:15,613
This is something that we've
been saying for the last year.

656
00:29:15,613 --> 00:29:17,800
It's something to keep an eye out for.

657
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,639
Don't underestimate that
commodity malware infection

658
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,840
that might be

659
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,592
but really take your precautions in this.

660
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,780
But I wanna pivot

661
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:31,960
because we have to be
mindful of the time as well.

662
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,380
Raj, a million-dollar business, isn't it?

663
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:36,780
I think you said a little bit about that,

664
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,960
about the ratios that we did

665
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,370
in the beginning of the talk.

666
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:47,370
- Yeah, I think GandCrab kind of...

667
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,298
I guess we're the first ones

668
00:29:50,298 --> 00:29:52,950
to really be a little
bit open about the money

669
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:53,950
that they were making.

670
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:55,543
I think they claim $2 billion.

671
00:29:57,930 --> 00:29:59,530
I don't know if I believe that

672
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:02,590
but the one thing that we do know is that

673
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:04,223
fundamentally people are paying.

674
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:08,169
And whereas in the past

675
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:09,810
I think we've been quite successful

676
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:12,129
with the #don't pay

677
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:16,160
and really emphasizing people not to pay,

678
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,590
large companies are paying

679
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:19,840
and paying huge sums of money

680
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,179
because they can no longer operate.

681
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:25,390
And I think there was at
least one large company

682
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:27,110
that actually confirmed that they paid

683
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:28,610
just a couple of weeks back as well.

684
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:30,780
And so, absolutely.

685
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:34,280
And actually, ironically even affiliates

686
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,610
are making huge sums of money

687
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:40,100
from actually being part of
these particular activities.

688
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,693
- Yeah, totally.

689
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:46,130
It's funny enough if you look
at conventional criminals,

690
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:49,600
they post with an expensive
watch or a nice car

691
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,480
and some cyber criminals do that as well

692
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:55,650
but often they will post a transaction ID.

693
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:57,203
That's what we're looking at right now.

694
00:30:57,203 --> 00:30:58,514
That's a Bitcoin transaction

695
00:30:58,515 --> 00:30:59,630
with yields, the earnings

696
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:01,280
that this individual made in one weekend.

697
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,399
So, obviously as a researcher,

698
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,730
we dove into this

699
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:06,890
and we mapped out the whole infrastructure

700
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:08,120
and we could actually confirm

701
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:10,729
that this individual based
on the transaction IDs

702
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:13,870
made about $300,000 in a weekend.

703
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:15,669
Well, that's not a bad paycheck

704
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:17,560
and that's quite worrisome.

705
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,010
And at the time we worked it out

706
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:20,950
that this individual by himself

707
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:24,900
already probably made around $4.5 million

708
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,600
and this was quite a while back

709
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,110
and this individual has not stopped.

710
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:30,129
So, it's still going on

711
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:32,660
and we could see that money
is going to Bitcoin mixers,

712
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:35,900
where they (mumbles) the
origin in order to launder it

713
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:37,680
so they can use it for other purposes.

714
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:41,350
But also we see it flowing
into underground drug markets.

715
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:43,469
So, yeah, like you said, don't pay

716
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:45,340
and something you need to realize is that

717
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:47,220
you're not only paying the criminal,

718
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:51,763
but you're fueling other forms
of crime indirectly as well.

719
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,920
- I'd recommend the Europol

720
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:59,410
Serious and Organized Crime
Threat Assessment report

721
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:00,890
from 2021.

722
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:04,160
And that report actually is insightful

723
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,990
'cause it actually talks about markets

724
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:10,900
that OCGs are actually operating in

725
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:13,630
and clearly one area of focus

726
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:16,560
by these organized criminal
gangs is cyber crime.

727
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:20,429
And so, I think the perception of

728
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:23,330
lone wolf working in
his mother's basement,

729
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:27,431
we have to put that to one side now.

730
00:32:27,431 --> 00:32:30,100
So, as far as I know we
are almost up against time

731
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:32,929
and as ever, we could probably
spend a couple of hours

732
00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:33,880
talking about this.

733
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,740
Maybe if we go through the trends,

734
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:42,080
but also what should
people actually be doing

735
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,839
and looking out for?

736
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:44,740
(mumbles)

737
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:45,710
- That's a good thing.

738
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:48,960
We spent about 35 minutes or 30 minutes

739
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,680
scaring the living
daylights out of people.

740
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:54,733
So, it's good if we give them some help.

741
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:57,469
One of the things that
I did wanna touch upon

742
00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:59,500
that we saw on the trend is the data leak.

743
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:02,060
So, it's no longer just
encrypting your data.

744
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:04,899
They're exfiltrating large
amounts of sensitive data

745
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:08,400
or personal identity or
PII and posting it online.

746
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,810
So, what you see here,

747
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:12,770
these are other sides of Ragnar Locker.

748
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:13,700
I think some crypt

749
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,960
and that's REvil

750
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,840
and they're posting it on a website

751
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,909
and individuals can...

752
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:22,010
It's naming and shame.

753
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:26,740
It's basically another technique
to emphasize the extortion,

754
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:28,923
to get more impact and leverage.

755
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:34,490
We're not publicly reporting
on each and every victim,

756
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:36,970
but as a security company,
we do take note of,

757
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:39,923
okay what's the type of
industry who are targeted?

758
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,330
We do see that a lot of companies

759
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:45,710
that are dependent on manufacturing.

760
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:48,280
So, basically the conveyor belt stops

761
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,460
or even companies that are...

762
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:52,100
So, we can say that

763
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:56,219
they're relying on the
availability of their services

764
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:58,160
versus law firms or finance,

765
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,890
where they dealing with
confidential information

766
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:04,630
or some very juicy targets
for these criminals.

767
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:06,890
And that's something
that we saw predominantly

768
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:11,610
from end of 2019, I
think, all over to 2020

769
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:13,460
and now it's like, if you don't do this

770
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:15,199
you're not a hip and happening

771
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:18,259
type of ransomware, apparently.

772
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:20,880
One of the new things that we also saw

773
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,770
was denial of service.

774
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:25,130
So, if you are a company that's targeted

775
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:29,110
and you have a website that
you rely on for income,

776
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:31,840
we do see cyber criminals
trying to go after that

777
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:36,010
just as an extra means of
enforcing their extortion

778
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:37,659
in conjunction with what we already said

779
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:39,139
about the CEO's

780
00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:43,732
being targeted through
business intelligence.

781
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:46,699
I think there's some stuff

782
00:34:46,699 --> 00:34:48,399
and there's some happy
stuff that we can say

783
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,520
that, yeah, it's a hard fight,

784
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:53,070
but we are continuously fighting back.

785
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:55,350
We're not only on the sidelines

786
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:58,319
looking and seeing what happens.

787
00:34:58,319 --> 00:35:02,050
So, I think this year's
the fifth year, isn't it?

788
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:03,373
For No More Ransom.

789
00:35:04,245 --> 00:35:05,830
- You're right.

790
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:10,799
- So, yeah, McAfee help create
a public-private portal.

791
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,040
It's a public-private
initiative at no cost.

792
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,940
It's the number one portal in the world

793
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:16,370
for free decryption tools

794
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:18,799
where the public sector and the
private sector come together

795
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,027
to help victims of ransomware

796
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:25,070
There's more than 4.2 million visitors,

797
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:28,113
and I'm pretty sure those stats
are gonna be more and more,

798
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:31,240
but in the last four years
when they were online,

799
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:35,470
they saved over $632 million

800
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:37,270
that did not fall in criminal hands.

801
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:41,970
Do they have a decryptor
for any type of version?

802
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:43,609
I don't think so,

803
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:45,800
but they do have a lot of decryptors

804
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,240
and if you can spare the time,

805
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:52,120
I would say, if you can allow
it for the third option,

806
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:55,500
for waiting until the
decryptor becomes available,

807
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:59,390
I would very, very much
advise that you do.

808
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:02,350
And then I think GandCrab was
a really, really big success.

809
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:03,620
That was a demonstration

810
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,589
that it was actually possible

811
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:09,400
to find the keys for one
of those new reversions.

812
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,333
Wasn't it, Raj?

813
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:14,680
- Yeah, there's over 100 plus variants

814
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:17,990
that there were decryptor for,

815
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:20,560
over 150 partners

816
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:24,750
and you don't have to
give your email address.

817
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:26,233
We don't track your IP.

818
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:29,990
You've got free decryptors,

819
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:30,823
you've got something

820
00:36:30,823 --> 00:36:32,290
that would tell you the form of ransomware

821
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:33,930
you've been hit by

822
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:37,149
or give you prevention advice.

823
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:38,600
It even gives you some way

824
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,779
that you can actually report
a crime to law enforcement.

825
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:42,613
- Correct.

826
00:36:42,613 --> 00:36:45,990
- And nobody's made a cent out of this

827
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:47,750
and actually more importantly,

828
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:50,163
the money hasn't gone to crime.

829
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:55,300
- Correct, it has proven
to be as successful

830
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:56,623
within its boundaries.

831
00:36:59,488 --> 00:37:00,950
Well, you try to hit it
where it hurts the most

832
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:02,770
and that's in their wallets.

833
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:06,190
- Exactly, I don't know
if we've got the time

834
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,603
to go through that video.

835
00:37:08,566 --> 00:37:09,399
(laughs)

836
00:37:09,399 --> 00:37:10,232
- We don't.

837
00:37:10,232 --> 00:37:11,065
- It's a shame,

838
00:37:11,065 --> 00:37:13,110
but look, here's what we'd say.

839
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:16,000
John and I will give our contact
details at the end of it.

840
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,600
We've actually got some
videos we can show you

841
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:24,850
about raids we've done against
criminal gangs and stuff.

842
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:26,970
So, there's a lot more

843
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:29,299
that we wish we had
more time to go through

844
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:33,680
but look, fundamentally,

845
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,339
if you're sitting and
watching this particular talk

846
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:39,180
thinking, well maybe I
need to do something,

847
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:41,480
please, start immediately.

848
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:45,593
The bad guys are super,
super active right now.

849
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:49,910
I love the first one;

850
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:51,359
back-up, back-up, back-up,

851
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,390
but we cannot stress

852
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:57,173
the importance of going
to preventative advice.

853
00:37:58,310 --> 00:37:59,210
- That's totally true.

854
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:01,280
These are some of the advices

855
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,113
and it's like

856
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:05,040
I don't wanna sound like a broken record

857
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,310
but it is back-ups,
multi-factor authentication.

858
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:10,480
So, robust identity management,

859
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,410
keeping your software, security software,

860
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:14,430
your AV software up to date,

861
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:16,549
making sure you not only have AV

862
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:20,133
but you detect other forms
of intrusion as well.

863
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,549
We have some first aid tips.

864
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:27,250
So, if you are infected,

865
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:29,370
disconnect from the internet.

866
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:31,359
If you can create a memory dump, do that.

867
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,920
That's maybe a little bit forensic.

868
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:35,630
Take photos, make copies
of the encrypted drive,

869
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:37,650
try to recover tools with PhotoRec.

870
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:38,712
There's certain tools

871
00:38:38,712 --> 00:38:40,660
'cause these viruses don't
encrypt the whole file.

872
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:41,589
It's only a small portion.

873
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:43,560
So, you can get stopped back.

874
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,660
If you can, do not reboot the computer

875
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:48,210
'cause that will erase any
keys that are in memory.

876
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:53,870
Check out No More Ransom
for a possible decryptor.

877
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:56,053
And yeah, there is no try.

878
00:38:57,018 --> 00:38:59,320
It's a very complicated situation

879
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,730
when you're in it

880
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:03,170
and even though we say do not pay,

881
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:04,027
if you do decide to pay,

882
00:39:04,027 --> 00:39:06,160
'cause that's a business decision,

883
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:09,830
you should also accept the
risk of losing everything,

884
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:12,130
'cause you're not dealing
with a professional world.

885
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:13,340
It seems professional,

886
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:15,520
but they're not professional
software developers.

887
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,840
There's no guarantee of the
software that they encrypted

888
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:18,850
that they're gonna give you.

889
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:21,819
So, it might actually make things worse.

890
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:23,940
And don't trust a word of a criminal.

891
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:26,160
So, if they say they'll delete your data,

892
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,279
well, don't believe them on their word

893
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,883
'cause once on the internet,
always on the internet.

894
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,580
- And really to kind of wrap up,

895
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,960
I know, John, we put our
contact details there.

896
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,930
So, feel free to connect
with John and myself.

897
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:42,460
We've only just scratched the surface

898
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:45,450
and we routinely publish a lot of

899
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:48,569
really deep technical content and analysis

900
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:51,610
but also guidance around
protecting yourself.

901
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:53,577
John, it's been a pleasure.

902
00:39:53,577 --> 00:39:55,170
RSA exits.
- Welcome.

903
00:39:55,170 --> 00:39:56,660
- Thanks very much.

904
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:57,609
- Thanks, everyone.
