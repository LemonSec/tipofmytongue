1
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:03,389
- Hey, hello, thanks for joining.

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:07,380
This session is on
resiliency, specifically,

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,240
building the business case for resiliency

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,090
and making sure that we get those outcomes

5
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:16,620
above and beyond making things available.

6
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,380
My name is Wolfgang Goerlich.

7
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:23,220
I am an advisory CISO for
Duo Security, part of Cisco,

8
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,933
but before that, I've
done a lot in continuity,

9
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,400
way back to when you had
to restore from tapes.

10
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,732
I've done a fair bit in incident response,

11
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,950
way back from when good
security was a firewall maybe

12
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:40,420
and an antivirus, and for many years,

13
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:42,310
I was doing consulting, right?

14
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:44,870
I was, hey, let's put
together a plan for you,

15
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:47,452
let's go ahead and run some tests,

16
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,520
and helped organizations
get ready for, for example,

17
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,800
pandemic planning, so
as you might imagine,

18
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,830
when 2020 rolled around, I
reached out and I was like,

19
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:00,178
hey, how's it going, right?

20
00:01:00,178 --> 00:01:02,391
Remember that plan we wrote.

21
00:01:02,392 --> 00:01:05,550
Remember that pandemic exercise we did.

22
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:08,289
Remember that time when
we set up a strategy

23
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:09,563
for working from home.

24
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:11,723
How did that go?

25
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:16,330
I really hoped, really
hoped, maybe naively,

26
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:18,050
I've been accused of being naive,

27
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:21,420
I really hoped that people
like, oh man, this saved us.

28
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,170
We're so ready, we're so prepared.

29
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:25,600
I really hoped that I'd hear, oh yeah,

30
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,237
we followed that document
and we're right up

31
00:01:30,237 --> 00:01:34,449
and operational, but even organizations

32
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:39,080
where I'd run literal
pandemic tabletop exercises

33
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:43,060
using the CDC toolkit
for zombie preparedness,

34
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,950
which, by the way, if you haven't seen it,

35
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:48,500
highly recommend it, even with
organizations that did that,

36
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:53,130
a lot of them didn't realize the outcomes

37
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:57,170
that we had hoped, and so in this talk,

38
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:59,150
I'm gonna share a couple
different organizations,

39
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:02,590
I'm gonna share a couple
different business cases

40
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,930
to highlight how to
make the business cases.

41
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:08,623
I'm gonna highlight where
people are going wrong,

42
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:14,130
especially in not getting
the outcomes we want,

43
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:17,410
but also, my team looked at hundreds

44
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:20,100
of business continuity plans,
disaster recovery plans,

45
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,440
incident response plans.

46
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,540
I want to boil down some of
those lessons learned for you

47
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,429
so after you make the business case,

48
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,130
you can avoid some common mistakes

49
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:31,570
and then talk about how to
drive downstream outcomes

50
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:34,113
from a good resiliency business case.

51
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:38,480
It is really important that
I give some context here.

52
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,310
I am gonna be talking about
recovery and continuity,

53
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:43,531
I'm gonna be talking
about incident response,

54
00:02:43,531 --> 00:02:45,210
I'm gonna be talking about
good problem management,

55
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:47,290
I'm gonna be talking
about this in the context

56
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:49,850
of making our technology more resilient.

57
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:51,227
Why?

58
00:02:51,227 --> 00:02:52,810
So that our business can operate,

59
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:55,410
so our organization can run key processes,

60
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:57,368
so we can execute on our strategy.

61
00:02:57,368 --> 00:03:01,940
What this talk is not is
organizational resilience,

62
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:05,560
supply chain resilience,
personal resilience.

63
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,070
Those are incredibly important topics

64
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:13,070
well worth discussing here at
RSA, but for scoping purposes,

65
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,950
we're gonna be focused in more

66
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:19,250
on the IT side as we go forward.

67
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,620
Another key thing to point
out is that the stories

68
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:25,323
you're about to hear are
based on true events.

69
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:29,810
These three case studies are
composites that are typical

70
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,950
of what are in the market today.

71
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:36,390
These are not representative
of any particular organization,

72
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:40,239
environment, friend, client,
someone in the audience.

73
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,080
I'm not talking about you,
but these are all things

74
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,990
that I've ran into,

75
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:47,793
wrought into three composite case studies.

76
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,920
With that, let's talk about the first one.

77
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,339
Let's talk about a financial
services organization.

78
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,754
This financial services organization

79
00:03:56,754 --> 00:03:58,290
is a money management firm.

80
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:00,470
It's trading on the open markets,

81
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:05,470
and when we first encounter
this organization,

82
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:08,290
we find a couple different things.

83
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:12,123
One, we find their continuity
plan is a call tree.

84
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:16,579
Needless to say, communication
plans are important.

85
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:20,230
However, having a communication plan

86
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:22,180
and a call tree in such a document

87
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,630
that's maintained separate of
anything else, always a risk.

88
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:26,816
Why?

89
00:04:26,816 --> 00:04:28,030
Because people come and
people go, people change,

90
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:31,330
the numbers change, and now
we're maintaining things

91
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:33,159
in multiple different places.

92
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,200
Also, again, if it's just a call tree,

93
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,490
we're probably in a bad spot.

94
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:40,080
One of the reasons it's just a call tree

95
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,550
is that there's an operations manager,

96
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:45,900
really gung ho, great heart, great spirit,

97
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,760
who has been named as
the business continuity

98
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,260
and disaster recovery manager.

99
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,849
Now, you may wonder if
that's the right level

100
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:56,370
for this type of resilience,
we'll get back to that,

101
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:58,830
and the third component
of where they're at

102
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:02,109
is that they're testing their exercise,

103
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:04,593
their attestation that their plan works,

104
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:07,710
is an annual fire drill.

105
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:09,943
Really important to do a fire drill.

106
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:13,719
It's great to empty out the building.

107
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,840
Probably does not speak to the ability

108
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,130
to keep technology
running in a major outage,

109
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:21,480
probably does not speak
to the ability to recover

110
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,930
to something like a pandemic, right?

111
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:27,563
There's a lot of scenarios
that are missing here,

112
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,380
and the triggering point,
the precipitating event,

113
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,670
is an audit finding.

114
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:36,050
Third party audit looks
at their plan, says,

115
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:40,593
you know what, this does
not meet SEC requirements,

116
00:05:40,593 --> 00:05:43,073
we need to address this.

117
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:47,368
So when we think about
building a business case,

118
00:05:47,368 --> 00:05:48,900
there's really four main components.

119
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:53,330
There's the strategic context,
and we discussed that.

120
00:05:53,331 --> 00:05:56,440
There's an audit finding
we need to think about,

121
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,582
high availability is important

122
00:05:58,582 --> 00:06:01,250
for a financial services firm,

123
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,210
from a money management perspective,

124
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:06,849
we can figure out what
happens when we're down,

125
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:08,110
especially if the market's moving,

126
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:10,120
especially if there's a high trading day,

127
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,250
and that gets into the second
part of the business case,

128
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,250
which is the financials.

129
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,930
How are we going to
justify any improvement?

130
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:22,810
In this case, audit is a pretty big lever.

131
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:26,870
However, you'll find that the
compliance business cases,

132
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:31,080
oftentimes, the quickest to fund

133
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,810
but the hardest to fully fund

134
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:35,340
because from an audit perspective,
compliance perspective,

135
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,510
we're not protecting revenue,
we're not generating revenue,

136
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:40,340
it's not an area where
people such as the CFO

137
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:43,119
are gonna be inclined to fund.

138
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,120
So, we've got a hot business
case, but a business case

139
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:51,650
that may be limited in terms of funding.

140
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:54,010
Some other ways that we
could justify some funding

141
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:58,530
is, hey, how much money is on the table?

142
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:00,630
How much money do we stand to lose

143
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:03,219
if we're down for a period of time?

144
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:06,040
And then, traditional
security math, right?

145
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,290
We got this much money, we're
spending that to protect it,

146
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:10,160
there's your business case.

147
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,110
The third component of a business
case is your stakeholders.

148
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:16,770
Here we got internal audit
and external audit, of course.

149
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,150
The CFO is gonna be involved, and the CIO

150
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:22,941
in terms of making sure
technology is up and operational.

151
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:26,050
The COO currently owns this.

152
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:28,810
From the perspective of
being an operations function,

153
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:31,400
we're gonna want to get the CISO involved,

154
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,070
and then finally, we got
the management approach.

155
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:36,370
What are they gonna do
in terms of addressing

156
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:38,033
and setting up this capability?

157
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:43,109
I would argue that we need
to move this under the CISO.

158
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:46,290
There's also a good
discussion that can be had

159
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:50,330
about what does this say
to have this capability

160
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:53,469
at an operational level and
a project manager level?

161
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:56,930
It probably says that
continuity recovery and response

162
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:58,850
is not thought of as an executive issue.

163
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:01,460
Definite thought of as
a board level issue.

164
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:04,549
It may point to some
friction between the business

165
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:05,720
and the technology stack.

166
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,820
We'll want to delve into that

167
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,170
as we put together the business case.

168
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:14,170
And it probably means that
the way they're managing risks

169
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:18,013
is divorced from the technology risks.

170
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,770
So those are our main ways

171
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,240
that we're gonna go at this business case.

172
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,150
We're gonna justify it in
terms of closing an audit gap,

173
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:28,200
we're gonna find some budget
in terms of avoiding downtime,

174
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,772
and we're gonna move forward.

175
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:36,150
Now, this particular
client of organization

176
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:38,610
has the CFOs like, look,
what we gotta do is make sure

177
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:40,809
that we can withstand an asteroid.

178
00:08:40,809 --> 00:08:42,719
If an asteroid slams into the ground,

179
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,970
I want to know that we
can keep on the market,

180
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:46,670
I want to know that we can resume.

181
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,160
In the asteroid scenario,
everything's flattened.

182
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,563
Great scenario to build for.

183
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,760
Does leave you with some
open questions, right?

184
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:02,150
Such as what happens if the
building is still available?

185
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:04,340
What happens if the
technology is still available?

186
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,122
What about all these different scenarios?

187
00:09:06,122 --> 00:09:06,954
Shall we just build for the asteroid

188
00:09:06,955 --> 00:09:08,900
or shall we also build
for little meteorites?

189
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,470
What happens about the zombies?

190
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:13,770
Have we considered the zombies?

191
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:17,280
In the next level, once we
got the business case in place

192
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,390
and we've got funding to move forward,

193
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:21,850
what we need to start thinking
about is how we're gonna take

194
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:24,960
all the potential disaster scenarios,

195
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,330
map them to a few high-level scenarios,

196
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:30,280
building outage for a period of time,

197
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:33,569
people working remote
for a period of time,

198
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:36,230
power, technology loss
for a period of time,

199
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:38,620
and then map those back
to what we're gonna do

200
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,940
to protect that technology stack.

201
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:45,130
With an eye towards the CFO,
with an eye towards making sure

202
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:46,330
that this is budget-friendly,

203
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:49,530
especially given this is a
compliance business case,

204
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:50,363
we're gonna make sure

205
00:09:50,363 --> 00:09:53,720
that we are really
prioritizing the IT assets

206
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,730
that are driving most of the
value to the business, right?

207
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:59,340
So, in this firm, this would be IT assets

208
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:03,660
for money management, for
trading, for reconciliation,

209
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,492
those sort of things.

210
00:10:04,493 --> 00:10:06,560
Prioritizing on those will allow us

211
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,939
to better align our recovery strategies

212
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,640
with what matters to the business.

213
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:15,090
Now let's talk a little
bit about other outcomes

214
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:18,953
besides just keeping the lights
on when the asteroid hits.

215
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,610
Throughout this talk, I'm
gonna reference several times

216
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:25,560
a report that Cyentia did with Cisco

217
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,979
called the Security Outcomes Study.

218
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:30,860
What they did was they looked
at close to 5,000 respondents

219
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:33,020
and asked them a very key question

220
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:35,329
that we always want to
know, what are you doing

221
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:37,400
and what outcomes are you getting?

222
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,100
What outcomes are you getting

223
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,800
and what tasks are you performing

224
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,670
'cause there's a lot of different
tasks that we can perform,

225
00:10:43,671 --> 00:10:45,140
including disaster
recovery and continuity,

226
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,543
as I just was discussing.

227
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:50,670
And then we figure out what
correlates by how much,

228
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:54,370
so what Cyentia found,
one of the many things,

229
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:58,760
is that organizations that had
good continuity and recovery

230
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,990
were much more likely
to gain the confidence

231
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:03,040
of the executive leadership.

232
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,530
My hypothesis there is it's
better to have that conversation

233
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:10,467
of, we're doing this with
this asset to protect trading

234
00:11:10,467 --> 00:11:14,550
than it is to say, oh
yeah, there's a server

235
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:19,250
that could go down, or at
AWS, we've got some issues

236
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,860
with some of our instances, right?

237
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:23,290
It's better to be talking
about what matters

238
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:25,709
to the organization, and I
believe that's one of the reasons

239
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,023
why we see this outcome.

240
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,850
Likewise, another outcome
that's oftentimes seen

241
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:33,390
is the ability to keep
up with the business.

242
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,730
Again, I believe that ties back

243
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:37,790
to understanding what any
piece of technology means

244
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:40,173
within context of the organization.

245
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:47,077
A light bulb moment went
off in this process,

246
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:52,100
so you got your business case,
we've set up our scenarios

247
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,610
and strategies, we're
implementing the technology,

248
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:57,180
and a light bulb moment went
off for me when I realized

249
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:00,650
that if we are prioritizing IT assets,

250
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:02,459
if we're doing a business impact analysis,

251
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,780
if we're doing those sorts of things,

252
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:07,040
that gives us great
insight and intelligence

253
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,490
that can flow down into our
seam, that can flow down

254
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:12,480
into our vulnerability management program,

255
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,790
that gives us some
really good ways to say,

256
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:18,160
hey, this particular asset
that just had an alert

257
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,730
probably doesn't matter
because it's not tied

258
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:23,070
to a key process, or red alert,

259
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:24,920
that should be thoroughly investigated.

260
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,650
Why, because that is on the
direct path towards trading,

261
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:32,000
which, again, is how this
organization makes money.

262
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,750
So, using BIA to drive
prioritization, using prioritization

263
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,033
to drive other risk management functions.

264
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:41,670
And not too surprising,

265
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:44,790
the Cyentia study also
found that organizations

266
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:48,209
who had very effective recovery
and continuity programs

267
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:51,100
were also much more likely to
identify and manage top risks.

268
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:54,590
Again, I would argue that's
because they've got the context

269
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:58,423
of how those risks matter and
play out in the organization.

270
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,140
So, that is kind of under
recovery and resilience.

271
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:05,360
Let's talk about the next business case,

272
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,660
which will get us more
into incident response.

273
00:13:09,257 --> 00:13:11,239
In this particular business
case, what we're looking at

274
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,273
is a software as a service organization.

275
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:18,459
Their starting point is,
hey, plan, what plan?

276
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:19,450
We don't need continuity

277
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:22,560
when we're distributed high environment

278
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,390
where everything is just failing over

279
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:26,210
and automatically spun up and spun down

280
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:27,433
and DevOps is awesome.

281
00:13:28,509 --> 00:13:30,600
DevOps is awesome, however,

282
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,570
we do still need to think
about resiliency in here.

283
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:38,330
The primary business driver
is customer acquisition,

284
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:40,010
getting new customers,
retaining customers.

285
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:44,000
As you might imagine, downtime
is directly correlated

286
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,320
with losing customers and losing deals.

287
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:51,960
So the CISO is very focused on uptime

288
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,530
and is very focused on
code-level security,

289
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:57,023
making sure that the
product is very secure.

290
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:00,900
It's a great place to be,
however, as you might imagine,

291
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,730
that's a little bit in the weeds,

292
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:06,990
considering all the other
impacts organization might face.

293
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:11,560
So for example, you can have a
completely pristine code base

294
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,790
and still have features and functionality

295
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:17,339
that allow an adversary
to misuse your product.

296
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:19,860
You can have a completely
pristine code base

297
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:23,200
and still not have enough
resiliency in the backend

298
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,980
so that's usually have an outage,

299
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,830
and that ends the precipitating event.

300
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:30,710
An outage occurs, and now
we have a conversation

301
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:32,303
about continuity and recovery.

302
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,680
When making this business case, again,

303
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,697
we're gonna think about
those four things, right?

304
00:14:35,697 --> 00:14:37,610
What's the strategic context?

305
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:41,250
Availability, uptime,
crucial for SaaS growth.

306
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:46,250
We may want to delve
into any unplanned work

307
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:50,510
or wasted effort that might be going on.

308
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:54,090
We may want delve into looking at this

309
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:56,680
not only as availability
issue, but also looking at this

310
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,400
as an incident response issue.

311
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,733
So responding to outages
and responding to attacks.

312
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,090
So, broadly, that's the context.

313
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:09,210
Financially, we're driving
this with customer retention.

314
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:11,860
One of my favorite ways
of making a business case,

315
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:16,860
by the way, because we're
able to speak to reliability,

316
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,550
we're able to speak to availability,

317
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:21,500
and we're able to tie that
down to incoming revenue

318
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:25,860
and customer retention,
which can provide us the pool

319
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,293
of money to invest in a recovery scenario.

320
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:32,110
Key stakeholders are the
product owners, the DevOps team,

321
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:34,666
and the CISO, and the management approach

322
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:38,630
is going to be viewing
this as a resiliency

323
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:40,680
within the DevOps function

324
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,370
and a governance within the CISO function.

325
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:48,370
So the CISO will own governance,
and will set availability

326
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,070
and set recovery times
and metrics and SLAs,

327
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:54,610
the DevOps team will run to them,

328
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:58,500
but will be predominantly
focused in on uptime

329
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,660
and good engineering, good SRE, right,

330
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,110
site reliability engineering.

331
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,070
A key point here is when
we think about peer support

332
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:13,020
and buy-in for security,
which organizations

333
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,630
that are more resilient
are more likely to have,

334
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:17,290
when we think about peer
support and buy-in for security,

335
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:19,140
what we need to be thinking about is,

336
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:23,300
what's in it for them, right?

337
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:26,430
And good business cases
like the business case

338
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:28,290
we're talking about here with the SaaS,

339
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:31,890
good business cases are
satisfying a business need

340
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:34,340
or a team need first, and by doing that,

341
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:37,040
they're providing security
as a secondary outcome.

342
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,709
I think it's really important
for me to say again,

343
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:40,920
just to emphasize, business cases

344
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,770
must satisfy the business need first,

345
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:45,870
and by satisfying that business need,

346
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:49,090
provide security as a secondary outcome.

347
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:53,510
Here, what we're looking at is
when anything is suspicious,

348
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:55,590
because it's broke or
because it potentially

349
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:58,460
is being attacked, go
ahead and address that

350
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:02,000
by running some scripts
and bringing things back up

351
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,220
in a quick way, which
gets to the second point,

352
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,910
which is how do we
minimize unplanned work?

353
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:11,240
How do we minimize wasted effort?

354
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,950
Well, we do that with automation,

355
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:14,819
we do that with automated scripts.

356
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:17,500
So, if the environment looks weird

357
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,980
and we're like, hey, that
shouldn't be happening,

358
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:23,290
why is that box running that service

359
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:25,639
and calling out to those IP addresses

360
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,030
that are on our known bad list?

361
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:29,660
Why are things coming in from Tor?

362
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:32,290
When things weird are
happening, right, take action.

363
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:33,540
How do we take action?

364
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:36,280
We run an Ansible script,
we reload an instance,

365
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,760
we push things out to a
known good environment,

366
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,820
we roll back and then roll forward

367
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,720
with whatever security controls

368
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,380
and new functionality we need to.

369
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:48,300
So, business cases that
satisfy that business need

370
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,700
through automation, those
business cases have an outcome

371
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,263
of minimizing wasted
work and wasting effort.

372
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,980
The light bulb moment for me

373
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,350
with this particular business case,

374
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:03,980
so you have the business
case of high availability,

375
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,920
you go ahead and map out your scenarios,

376
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,550
well, things could be broken,
things could be attacked,

377
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:11,379
there could be a disruption
in our down services,

378
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:13,220
or there could be disruption in the cloud,

379
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,530
you map those out and you come up

380
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:15,790
with some recovery scenarios.

381
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,870
We're gonna do this,
this, that, and the other.

382
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:20,120
We're gonna do those in
an automated fashion.

383
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:24,990
The insight that I had here
was that high availability,

384
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:26,910
specifically around the DevOps model,

385
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:30,070
high availability leads to high security.

386
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:33,490
So if you've had the opportunity

387
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:37,520
to see some, say, Sounil
Yu's DIE concepts,

388
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,150
that's exactly what I'm
talking about, right?

389
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:42,900
Distributed, immutable,
ephemeral infrastructure.

390
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,210
We've got a distributed environment,

391
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:48,280
we can lose multiple nodes
without having an impact.

392
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,090
If we got an ephemeral environment,

393
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:52,199
we can have multiple nodes compromised

394
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,720
and wipe those, reload those
without losing any data

395
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,070
and without missing a beat.

396
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:01,500
The key point here is that if we can erase

397
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,830
and rebuild the environment
faster than the adversary

398
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:07,100
can break in and stage tools
environment, we win, right?

399
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,719
Security wins, and that's
exactly what happened.

400
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,490
After they had this business case

401
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:13,840
and they implemented these scenarios,

402
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,760
there was a zero day exploit.

403
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,593
Not in the code, right?

404
00:19:16,593 --> 00:19:17,426
Our code's good.

405
00:19:17,426 --> 00:19:21,939
A zero day exploit in some
of the underlying systems.

406
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:24,300
That zero day exploit allowed
the adversaries to get in

407
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:27,000
and stage tools, so they got
in through the first layer,

408
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,440
started staging the tools.

409
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,200
Think about what an
adversary is gonna do next.

410
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,510
They're gonna try and
move laterally, right?

411
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:33,930
They're gonna scan, figure out
where else they can pivot to,

412
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:36,740
and as they scan and pivot,
that is being picked up, right?

413
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:38,970
It's being picked up on the network level.

414
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:40,960
That's weird, we don't usually see that.

415
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,300
It's being picked up on the host level.

416
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,120
That's weird, we don't usually see that.

417
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,620
It's being picked up on the API level,

418
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:47,870
especially if you've
got a good service pack

419
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:49,620
that enforces like a YAML file.

420
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:53,350
Oh, if you call, and
I'm expecting a dollar

421
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:56,270
and you're sending me a
whole bunch of strings,

422
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:57,730
probably something weird.

423
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:01,270
So it gets detected by the capability

424
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:03,850
the organization put in
place for resilience.

425
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:05,197
What happens?

426
00:20:05,197 --> 00:20:06,409
Automated response.

427
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:08,993
Kill that node, reload it
with an Ansible script.

428
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:11,460
Good.

429
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,410
Now it's still vulnerable.

430
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:16,000
We're not patching,
it's a zero day exploit,

431
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,200
so that instance is still vulnerable.

432
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,230
The adversaries are out.

433
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:23,060
Now they may notice they're
out and break back in.

434
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:26,610
Okay, but the minute they go
to scan or move forward again,

435
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:27,443
what happens?

436
00:20:27,443 --> 00:20:30,250
It's detected, they're
wiped, they're erased,

437
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:35,160
and it's that concept of
using high availability,

438
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,680
using resiliency to drive IR,
which is fascinating to me.

439
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,330
If that happens a few times,

440
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:42,230
obviously, we want to
get the IR team in place,

441
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:44,060
we want to do some investigation.

442
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:47,710
If it happens once or twice,
maybe it's simply a outage.

443
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:51,130
Let the SRE team use it and look at it,

444
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:54,950
but the underlying concept
here is high availability

445
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:59,020
and rapid response as a way
to mitigate incident response

446
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:01,490
and get ahead of things
and prevent the criminals

447
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:03,710
from moving forward into our environment.

448
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:07,550
Stopping them at the front
gate with a set of technology

449
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:10,169
that's predominantly
driving the business value

450
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:11,280
for the DevOps team,

451
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,223
and secondarily, providing
a security benefit.

452
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:22,730
So, with that, now that
we've looked at how IR

453
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:25,040
can tie into this resiliency case,

454
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:28,680
being automated using scripts,
let's talk a little bit

455
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,327
about the third business case,

456
00:21:30,327 --> 00:21:31,970
and this one's in manufacturing,

457
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:34,110
so here we got a manufacturer

458
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:36,273
and they've got a few things going on.

459
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:41,190
Bit of an out-of-date
business continuity planning,

460
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:43,260
a good continuity plan but not one

461
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,590
that's necessarily aligned with standards.

462
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:47,810
Someone clearly took their CSSP example

463
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:50,693
and went, I can write
this, okay, it's good.

464
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:53,970
There are some parts in
the disaster recovery level

465
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:57,460
that are very good, so
plant level recovery,

466
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:00,880
if an asteroid hits, or
more likely a hurricane,

467
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,220
they can recover and move
things over, no problem.

468
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:08,050
However, if it's something
in back office technology,

469
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:10,159
we're gonna have other issues.

470
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,210
And then within the
back office technology,

471
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:14,860
we find there's a significant
amount of applications,

472
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,030
a million and one apps.

473
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:18,550
Everyone's been provisioning applications.

474
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:21,250
We don't necessarily know
what all these services do

475
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,020
and don't necessarily
know what they all mean.

476
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:26,950
We also know on the horizon
that there's a budget coming up

477
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:29,870
for a network refresh, and
the precipitating event here

478
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:31,843
is a customer demand.

479
00:22:31,844 --> 00:22:33,490
One of their main customers
comes to them and says,

480
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:34,580
we want to see your plan

481
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:37,429
and we want you to get a certification

482
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:40,100
so that we can continue
to do business with you.

483
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:43,560
So, the strategic context here

484
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:46,149
is they need to meet this customer demand,

485
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:47,980
they need to address the customer need,

486
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:51,160
they need to achieve, let's
say, TSEC certification

487
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,610
so that they can accomplish this.

488
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:55,149
Financials, of course, are gonna be based

489
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:56,030
on customer revenue.

490
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:57,560
My favorite way, obviously,

491
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:00,760
to build a security business case

492
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:03,530
because when we're tied
directly to real revenue,

493
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:06,020
we're tied directly, especially
if it's a major customer

494
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:08,723
who's making up a significant
amount of the revenue,

495
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,260
you've got a lot more headroom

496
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:16,270
to build a good a recovery
strategy, and of course,

497
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:18,300
you've got a lot more momentum behind you

498
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,659
from the sales leadership and everything.

499
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:22,150
So, all right, the key stakeholders

500
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:26,470
will be sales leadership,
plant operations, and the CISO.

501
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:28,120
Management approach is gonna be

502
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,610
the continuity recovery
program under the CISO,

503
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:34,240
but the network program, the
technology implementation

504
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,373
under the CIO being overseen
by plant operations.

505
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:41,870
And some additional aspects
we need to consider,

506
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:43,439
obviously, they're in manufacturing,

507
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,330
so cost is always an issue.

508
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:47,360
We want this to be very cost-effective,

509
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,050
especially we can find
additional cost savings

510
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:52,780
out of implementing this,
and needless to say,

511
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:56,950
we want to make sure that
this level of technology

512
00:23:56,950 --> 00:24:00,580
addresses the fail-over
scenarios we're concerned with

513
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:02,622
and keeps things up and operational.

514
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:10,040
So, in this business
case, in moving forward

515
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,360
into the next step with implementation,

516
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:17,360
one of the key things is doing
a business impact analysis.

517
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:22,150
Now, a business case should have a focus

518
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:24,300
on the primary business need, right?

519
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,527
The customer, and then
by satisfying that need,

520
00:24:26,527 --> 00:24:28,760
as a secondary outcome,
increased security.

521
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,400
So satisfy the customer,

522
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,680
increase the security process environment.

523
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,040
However, we also need to think

524
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,690
about additional secondary outcomes

525
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:38,250
that the business case can have.

526
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:42,430
What additional ways can
move forward with this have

527
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:44,760
in terms of benefits for the
organization, and in this case,

528
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,870
what it was was the BIA, the
business impact analysis,

529
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:49,429
when we did the application inventory,

530
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:52,450
when we look at what
these services are doing,

531
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:54,760
what they mean in context
of a business process,

532
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:59,650
what they mean in context of
the business strategic intent,

533
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:03,910
when we look at those things,
we find a lot of redundancies,

534
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:05,620
we find a lot of opportunities
for consolidation,

535
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:08,389
we find a lot of opportunities
for cost reduction.

536
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:10,890
So not only are we
delivering this main benefit

537
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:11,723
of keeping things up,

538
00:25:11,723 --> 00:25:13,560
but we're also delivering a second benefit

539
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,780
of providing an inventory

540
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:19,230
that allows for a cost reduction
program to move forward.

541
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:20,280
Incredibly important.

542
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:25,159
As well as doing the original thing was,

543
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:28,410
was give us a standardized
plan that's easier to audit

544
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:29,783
and easier to defend.

545
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:37,180
We find that according to
the Cyentia study again,

546
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:40,102
that organizations that do have continuity

547
00:25:40,102 --> 00:25:42,120
and recovery programs,
strong resiliency programs,

548
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,260
are more likely to be
run cost-effectively.

549
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:47,010
I suspect again it's because
of that additional context,

550
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:49,520
and I suspect if you want
to achieve that outcome,

551
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,430
what you need to do

552
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:53,020
is when you're building
your business case,

553
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:56,650
make sure that, as a secondary outcome,

554
00:25:56,650 --> 00:26:00,683
it is providing insight into
where cost savings may exist.

555
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:07,860
Now this particular
organization follows this plan,

556
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:10,870
it has a business case, implements it

557
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:12,510
as part of a network refresh,

558
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:15,340
so we're not necessarily having to create

559
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,980
a new funding source.

560
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,790
As part of the network refresh,

561
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:20,700
implements some of the recovery strategy

562
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,680
that's identified in that plan.

563
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,860
So, when we're implementing it,

564
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:28,159
owned by the CIO and plant operations,

565
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:32,180
that budget funds the
technology stack refresh

566
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:34,200
and funds the recovery structure.

567
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,570
The way that they go about this

568
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:38,679
is effectively segmenting
off the key lines

569
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,810
for that key customer, adding
telemetry and monitoring

570
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:44,330
to those lines, making
sure if anything happens,

571
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:47,210
that it's detected, and
if anything's suspicious,

572
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:49,300
that that connection's shut down.

573
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:52,930
Very similar to the SaaS app,
but instead of going ahead

574
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:56,000
and shooting an instance in
the head and reloading it

575
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
and refreshing it, in this
case, what we're doing is,

576
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,190
when something's suspicious,

577
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:02,090
they're simply stopping
that network connection

578
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:04,403
and isolating that rogue IP address.

579
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:08,790
So that all gets done,
fast forward six months,

580
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:09,950
malware outbreak, right?

581
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:12,080
Malware outbreak, fast-moving worm,

582
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,230
they're infecting a whole bunch
of boxes, and as you know,

583
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:17,330
in manufacturing, it's very
common that we've got equipment

584
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:20,580
stretching back to the
late 90s, early aughts,

585
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:24,540
Windows XP boxes galore,
serial connections

586
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:26,096
and everything else, right?

587
00:27:26,096 --> 00:27:26,929
The good old days, the good old days.

588
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:29,360
So this malware is
moving from host to host

589
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,193
to host to host.

590
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:34,573
Every time it touches one
of these lines that are,

591
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,200
have recently been
redone, are instrumented

592
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,110
for our resiliency and also instrumented

593
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:43,290
with recovery strategies,

594
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:46,060
every time it touches one
of those lines, of course,

595
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:48,409
the line sees that traffic,
it's suspicious traffic,

596
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:49,640
we're not supposed to be scanning,

597
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:53,310
trying to connect to us
over these protocols,

598
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:56,070
and it would block that
backend IP address.

599
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:59,300
Great example, great example of resiliency

600
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,500
leading to better security.

601
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,897
Also, what I thought was very interesting

602
00:28:02,897 --> 00:28:04,939
and the light bulb moment for me was,

603
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:09,770
not only was that useful
in preventing the breach,

604
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:12,010
however, in the incident response,

605
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:15,379
the incident responders got
involved, looked at those logs,

606
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:18,670
looked at the traffic sources,
and used those secured lines

607
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:22,750
as, effectively, another
source of intel to figure out

608
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:25,490
where the infections were coming from.

609
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:28,610
Reconciling with our asset
inventory, tracing down the boxes

610
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:31,679
but using those lines as one more feed

611
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,280
to figure out what was going
on in their environment, right?

612
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:37,010
Using them as a detective control.

613
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:42,010
Really interesting way to view
a system in a business case

614
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:45,000
that started off with we
need to save this customer,

615
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,453
we need to do right by them.

616
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:52,540
So, not surprisingly, from
the Cyentia perspective,

617
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,960
they found that organizations

618
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,770
with good resilience are more likely

619
00:28:55,770 --> 00:29:00,000
to avoid major security
issues and incidents.

620
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,470
As part of this, also feeding
into problem management

621
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:06,120
with good intel and good insight.

622
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:11,960
All right, let's talk next
about where things go wrong.

623
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:16,230
My team read 176 business
continuity plans,

624
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:17,610
so you don't have to.

625
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:19,760
I almost feel like I
should feed them to a bot.

626
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,280
You know those, oh, we fed
a million plans to a bot

627
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,638
and it wrote our plan.

628
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:26,919
(sighs) Actually, now
that I think about it,

629
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:30,910
I think I read the plans
written by a bot. (chuckles)

630
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:33,790
Here's some of the ways that organizations

631
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:37,960
who have a good business
case and good intentions

632
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:42,960
fail to capture some of the
benefit of these business cases.

633
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:43,990
Top three failures.

634
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,700
One is the wrong person.

635
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,170
I talked about this a
little bit earlier, right?

636
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:50,390
Giving the BC role to
someone who's in operations,

637
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:53,100
but we want to make sure that
the person who's in charge

638
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:58,100
of this has the trust, the
ability, the budget, the acumen,

639
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,250
the staff to actually go
ahead and act on these plans

640
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:08,090
and drive them forward over a longer term.

641
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:11,080
Number two is the wrong technology,

642
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,580
recovery at the wrong level.

643
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:15,679
Oh, we got front end load
balancers, don't worry about it.

644
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:18,240
Okay, that's great for your front end,

645
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,620
but what happens about
that database server

646
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:24,592
that is a single instance
and not in a recovery zone?

647
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:30,930
Oh, (chuckles) right,
whatever your accepted

648
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:36,520
threat scenarios are, from
asteroids to pandemics

649
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:39,379
to cloud outages, whatever
those are, you need to make sure

650
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:42,750
that you've got a corresponding
technology strategy

651
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:46,840
that's going to address those,
and technology that supports

652
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:49,290
and enables that strategy.

653
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:50,123
So that's the second thing we think,

654
00:30:50,123 --> 00:30:51,110
and then the third thing is,

655
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:52,850
now that we've got this
great recovery strategy,

656
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:53,929
let's test it.

657
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:56,380
We see a lot of times that the
goals for testings are wrong.

658
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:58,440
People are testing
things that don't apply,

659
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,960
they're running a fire
test instead of testing

660
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,960
when the data center's out,

661
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,140
they're testing working from home

662
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:07,110
instead of testing what happens

663
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:11,142
when our cloud has an outage,
they are the wrong drills.

664
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:16,330
Several other ways things
could get mucked up, right?

665
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:18,129
People, oh, it's outsourced,
don't worry about it.

666
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:19,830
The cloud provider handles it all.

667
00:31:20,917 --> 00:31:23,760
Remember your part in this.

668
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:27,290
Non-standard language, oh
yeah, we've got RTO, RPO,

669
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:29,976
but they're not using the
terms the right way, yeesh.

670
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:33,960
That oftentimes goes part and
parcel with wrong approach.

671
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:38,900
Again, I'm not saying
things have to be ISO 22301

672
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:39,840
or the NIST standards.

673
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,959
They don't have to be,
however, as a starting point,

674
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,840
you have a greater degree of success

675
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:48,050
if you start with a
standard-compliant approach.

676
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:50,892
Oh, it's high availability,
don't worry about it.

677
00:31:50,892 --> 00:31:53,270
We got our servers in HA zones.

678
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:56,510
Okay, but does that cover
all your recovery scenarios,

679
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:59,430
and does that cover all
your threat scenarios?

680
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:01,810
Overly broad plans, well, did I mention

681
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:03,899
we got a cloud provider
that handles everything?

682
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,100
We're all good.

683
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:08,040
Or the opposite is overly specific plans.

684
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,909
I tend to think about
this as the black swan

685
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:12,710
versus the unnamed goose.

686
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:16,800
The black swan event occurs,
we dress for that, awesome,

687
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,790
but we also want to make
sure that whatever else comes

688
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:22,322
that's bird-shaped, we're prepared for.

689
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:26,540
And then finally, handle
these in isolation.

690
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:29,680
I'm gonna talk more about
that in just a moment.

691
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:33,070
When we think about
integrating these things

692
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:34,620
with other aspects of security,

693
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:37,949
there's several steps to do.

694
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:41,510
First part is knowing what
matters and what to do with it.

695
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:44,990
Critical outcome from
resiliency and continuity.

696
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:49,990
We can tie that, the risk
ranking prioritization,

697
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:53,830
asset inventory back to
our operation centers,

698
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:56,639
we can give that information
to our incident response team,

699
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,630
and we can give that
information to our GRC team.

700
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:01,250
A surprising outcome from this

701
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:04,320
was that the Cyentia and Cisco report

702
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,850
found that organizations
were having greater ease

703
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:09,709
at retaining top talent,

704
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:12,780
and I think that's because
we're not wasting time

705
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:16,790
investigating something that
we think is a critical asset,

706
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:19,520
only to realize it's some
un-patched printer somewhere.

707
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:22,810
We've all had those days
where we spent a ton of time

708
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:25,490
on something only to
realize it doesn't matter?

709
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:28,173
That's what we want to avoid.

710
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:33,040
There's some additional
integration points here.

711
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:36,730
Flowing down that asset
prioritization into our seam

712
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:40,503
for logging, monitoring,
detecting, alerting response,

713
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,770
flowing that into our
vulnerability management program

714
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:47,350
so we know which patches
are most impactful.

715
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:50,899
This piece of technology
is running our core process

716
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,763
versus this piece of
technology is, I don't know,

717
00:33:52,763 --> 00:33:54,740
running that service somewhere, right?

718
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:55,770
Having that visibility.

719
00:33:55,770 --> 00:34:00,770
Also, if we know that the
technology is critical,

720
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,640
we can then begin to say,
okay, what does that mean

721
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,690
for perhaps a malicious sysadmin?

722
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:08,550
What does that mean

723
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:13,073
for perhaps a compromised privileged user?

724
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:16,350
Probably doesn't mean anything very good.

725
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:18,520
A lot of the resiliency
that we talked about

726
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:22,489
is based on non-human entities, right?

727
00:34:22,489 --> 00:34:25,779
An asteroid or a pandemic or a malware,

728
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:28,820
but if it is a human entity,
the same ideas apply,

729
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:33,040
so flow that down to PIM
and PAM, as well as use this

730
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:37,460
to prioritize alerts
coming out of DLP, UEBA,

731
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:38,822
and other technologies.

732
00:34:39,909 --> 00:34:41,929
I would be remiss if I didn't point out

733
00:34:41,929 --> 00:34:43,879
that we don't want to separate resiliency

734
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:44,713
from the organization.

735
00:34:44,713 --> 00:34:48,500
I'm talking about resiliency
as an IT security function,

736
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,980
therefore, within the
domain of cybersecurity,

737
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:54,380
but resiliency affects
more than IT and infosec.

738
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:57,650
We want to start with the
business case for continuity,

739
00:34:57,650 --> 00:34:59,050
recovery, and response.

740
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:04,050
Start there but take care not
to separate and isolate it.

741
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:09,560
Now once you've got
those recovery strategies

742
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,940
that map back to your scenarios,

743
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:15,720
exercise the heck out of them
so that we know they work.

744
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:18,160
You can start with a story
and just talk through it,

745
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:21,080
you could do a tabletop,
you can do a tabletop

746
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:24,009
and tie it back to standards and tactics,

747
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:25,690
you can tie that into a framework

748
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:27,863
and do a full pull exercise,

749
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:30,750
and you can take this all the way up

750
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:34,090
to doing a full pull exercise
and automating that exercise

751
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:36,650
with a chaos monkey or
chaos engineering approach

752
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:38,910
and moving into continuous improvement.

753
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:41,069
We're not gonna move
everything to level five.

754
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:42,739
That would be ridiculous,

755
00:35:42,739 --> 00:35:45,640
but knowing that we have
these different points

756
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,020
can take any given scenario

757
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:49,560
and figure out how
important that scenario is

758
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:53,920
and the extent to which we
test it, and when we test it,

759
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,910
we want to make sure that it measures up

760
00:35:56,910 --> 00:36:01,910
compared to the metrics the
organization sets in place.

761
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:06,860
So build the business
case, set the metrics,

762
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,543
test those scenarios.

763
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:13,760
So wrapping up this talk,
let's talk about something

764
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,870
other than IT for a minute.

765
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:19,779
Let's talk about something
a little bit more old school

766
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:21,500
in terms of technology.

767
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,910
I'm gonna ask you to do me a favor.

768
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:24,710
The next time you're in a building

769
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:26,110
and you step in an elevator, look down,

770
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:27,880
just look down for a minute.

771
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:30,990
Check out to see who the
elevator manufacturer is.

772
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:32,799
I'm willing to bet it's Otis,

773
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,010
and if you don't know the
story of the Otis elevator,

774
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:37,369
you should definitely take a look at it.

775
00:36:37,369 --> 00:36:38,202
It's really fascinating.

776
00:36:38,202 --> 00:36:40,550
The namesake is Elisha Otis.

777
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:44,910
Elisha Otis in the 19th
century would set up platforms,

778
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:47,850
go to the top of them, had
crowds around him, cheering,

779
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:50,620
and then that platform would
be pulled up with a rope,

780
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:52,363
and when he's at the very top of it,

781
00:36:52,363 --> 00:36:54,930
they would swing a sword, a sword.

782
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:56,230
There's not enough swords in security.

783
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:59,610
They would swing a sword, cut
the rope, and he would fall,

784
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:02,690
on the crowd would gasp,
and at the very last minute,

785
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:04,340
he would be saved by an elevator.

786
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:08,570
Saved by a brake, right?

787
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:13,363
Otis elevator succeeded
by inventing the brake,

788
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,009
and they patented in 1913.

789
00:37:17,009 --> 00:37:19,370
It was that security control,
the brake of the elevator,

790
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:21,890
that allowed us to reach
for the sky, right?

791
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:23,569
Enabling the last great migration,

792
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:26,490
moving from country to city,
moving from the ground floor

793
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:28,970
to the sky level, all that was enabled

794
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:31,673
by resiliency, by a brake.

795
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:36,950
Today, we are in the midst
of the next big migration,

796
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:39,549
where people are not
necessarily moving from cities

797
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:40,950
but moving online.

798
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:42,899
We're in the midst of
the greatest migration

799
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:46,900
in our lifetime, where we are
seeing the first migration,

800
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:50,220
arguably, from largely
physical to virtual,

801
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:53,569
everything being online,
and because of that,

802
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:55,470
IT resiliency has never
been more important.

803
00:37:55,470 --> 00:38:00,379
Because of that, the brake,
the brake that we're building

804
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:03,453
is going to be what enables
the wonders that are to come.

805
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,940
What to do next with
information we talked today?

806
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:08,720
Well, know your drivers, right?

807
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:13,390
Know your strategy and the
environment that you fall into.

808
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:16,190
In the first three months,
do some gap assessment

809
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:19,540
and figure out what type of
improvements need to happen,

810
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:23,020
figure out where your
headwinds and tailwinds are,

811
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:26,560
and build that business case as discussed.

812
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,770
Now, when you build that business
case and you move forward,

813
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:30,990
don't just implement business continuity.

814
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:34,850
Please, as you close those
gaps, think about resiliency

815
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:37,890
in the broader context of security,

816
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:40,350
tying it in with security
initiatives like we talked today,

817
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:44,730
and make sure that you're
testing those things regularly

818
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:48,060
because if we don't test and
we don't verify our scenarios

819
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:52,060
and we don't get those outcomes,
that's when things happen,

820
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:55,220
and suddenly, those plans
that we've spent so much time

821
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:58,040
to put together don't
actually come together

822
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,683
and don't actually protect us.

823
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:03,060
Thank you so much for
joining this session.

824
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:06,259
I hope you have a great
RSA, and by all means,

825
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,693
reach out with any questions or comments.
