1
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:03,649
- Hi, my name is Jacob Ansari,

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:06,550
and I'm the CISO for Schellman & Company

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:09,243
independent audit and assess firm.

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,320
And so I wanna talk about
what security audits have been

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,090
like over the last year or so,

6
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:20,130
since our firm performs a
variety of different kinds of

7
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,960
audit and assessment types, and we've been

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,040
like everybody pretty
significantly impacted by COVID-19

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,630
and remote work and,
everything that's transpired

10
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:33,832
over the last year, or so.

11
00:00:33,832 --> 00:00:37,333
Where we've had to adapt
just like everybody else,

12
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:41,000
to meet our client's needs

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,950
because security audit
needs didn't go away.

14
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,030
And security audits,
and security assessments

15
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:48,600
continue to happen in 2020,

16
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,483
even because even despite what's going on.

17
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:59,670
And so in summary, we had to
sort of adapt how we did things

18
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:03,379
at least a little bit, and our
clients had to adapt as well,

19
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,513
and so I'll talk a little bit about that.

20
00:01:06,613 --> 00:01:08,050
Along the way, I think we learned,

21
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:09,230
we learned some interesting lessons,

22
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:10,840
some were very surprising and some were,

23
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,990
or maybe not so much.

24
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:14,210
And I'll talk about some of the lessons

25
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:15,630
that we've learned.

26
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:18,630
And then we'll talk about
what I think is maybe

27
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:22,270
going to persist after
we're all vaccinated and

28
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:25,589
protected against the current pandemic

29
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,870
because I don't think anybody believes

30
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:30,253
that we're going back to
what was it was like before.

31
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:36,580
So perhaps the first thing
that's worth pointing out

32
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:39,920
about security assessments
or security audits

33
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,930
over the last year is that

34
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:44,600
a lot of the governing bodies that

35
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,500
dictate the standards or
drive the standards that we

36
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:52,080
assess against, made
accommodations for remote work,

37
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,603
really without too much fuss.

38
00:01:55,574 --> 00:01:57,670
For example, the PCI SCC,

39
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:00,310
which governs the PCI standards,

40
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:02,730
published a number of pieces of guidance

41
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:04,490
over the last year,

42
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:07,100
allowing for remote assessment work

43
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:10,639
with the phrase,

44
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,320
essentially obtaining
the equivalent assurances

45
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,583
that you would gain from
an onsite assessment.

46
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:21,180
For our ISO practice, where
we do a lot of ISO 27001

47
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,703
and ISO 27701, and similar standards,

48
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:29,109
there were exceptions made for the sort of

49
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:33,300
very specific kind of
onsite time requirements

50
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:37,540
to allow for remote work
during the pandemic.

51
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,700
This did in fact require some

52
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:43,359
fairly specific exception documentation

53
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:48,450
that our teams had to complete
for all of our ISO projects.

54
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:51,730
And I believe we're still
working on this year.

55
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:56,239
And then the A2LA, a governing
body which governs our

56
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:00,740
FedRAMP practice, it may
varies specific allowances

57
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:03,990
for remote audit work in lieu of their

58
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:08,980
otherwise fairly specific
needs for onsite efforts.

59
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,959
By and large, the standards bodies were

60
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,550
very accommodating and very understanding

61
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:15,570
of the needs to allow for remote audit

62
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,190
where that was necessary.

63
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,690
But that said a number of things changed

64
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,620
about our audit practice

65
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:28,090
and there are some that
were really obvious, and

66
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:31,090
I'll move through those, and
some were a little more subtle.

67
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:36,120
Obviously, we didn't travel,
we didn't go on site.

68
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,040
And we had to figure
out how to do all of our

69
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,510
observations remotely over screen sharing,

70
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:43,880
or over a sort of asymmetric

71
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,630
kind of evidence capture methods

72
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:49,950
and all of our conversations,
our interviews,

73
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:53,070
and our discussions with our clients

74
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:56,203
moved to Zoom or similar
web conferencing software.

75
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,490
And perhaps unsurprisingly,

76
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:04,490
a number of procedures are more
difficult to test remotely.

77
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,240
Some things are, I
think are fairly obvious

78
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,470
like, physical security controls

79
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:11,460
and other cases involves,

80
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,920
like widely distributed
sorts of environments.

81
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,820
Think of a retail location with a number

82
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:19,219
of stores or a retail entity
with a number of stores

83
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:22,100
over a large geography.

84
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,100
If you're doing a PCI DSS assessment

85
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,300
for this kind of entity,

86
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,880
you probably have to look at the

87
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,120
point of interaction.

88
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,630
The card reader device at the

89
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,860
register and

90
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,970
getting access to those devices

91
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:40,560
or getting somebody to
show you the configurations

92
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,490
of those devices over

93
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,583
a remote connection was challenging.

94
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,040
And then there were a
few standards I'd say

95
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,760
particularly under the
PCI umbrella that dealt

96
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,980
with some cryptographic
operations that really

97
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:55,070
didn't allow for this.

98
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:58,510
This mostly involved specific kind

99
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:00,969
of cryptographic key operations,

100
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:05,020
usually under like the PCI
PIN or the PCI P2PE standard.

101
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:07,570
I'll talk about this a
little bit in a few moments.

102
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,600
Other things that

103
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,900
were maybe not so surprising were that

104
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,630
the remote work issues

105
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:19,880
that appear in other lines of work

106
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,190
that affect everybody, affected our teams

107
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,990
and our clients as well.

108
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,760
Zoom fatigue is a very real thing,

109
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,300
I think we're all sort of tired of it,

110
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,593
and it affects security
assessments, and audit work,

111
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,983
not any less than anybody else.

112
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:39,070
And managing projects

113
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,740
across different time zones with

114
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:43,823
clients and colleagues,

115
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:48,280
it gets tiresome and troublesome

116
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,750
and that's true of a lot
of different kinds of work,

117
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,453
and it's not, again, any less true here.

118
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:58,250
I'd say some organizations
that have a very global reach

119
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:02,980
and, or have outsourced
functions that are relevant

120
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,580
to the audit that occur

121
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:09,580
in time zones that are
significantly different

122
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:13,359
from the time zones were,
or our team members reside.

123
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,120
Those got challenging

124
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,620
to schedule things that made

125
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:19,023
that could work.

126
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,280
Again, that's a thing that a lot

127
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,969
of different kinds of organizations
have had to experience.

128
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,580
One thing that surprised us was

129
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:32,539
a few very occasional
bright spots in remote,

130
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,930
in all remote kind of audit work.

131
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:35,780
A few of our clients

132
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,729
took to this sort of surprisingly

133
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:41,700
I spoke to one of our managers
in our FedRAMP practice

134
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,930
in putting this presentation together

135
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:47,570
and described a few of his
clients that really leaned

136
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:48,430
into this and said,

137
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:51,710
we're going to clear the deck
of all of our distractions

138
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:53,440
and we're gonna stack all

139
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,540
of the meetings together
and we're gonna just

140
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,050
power through this thing and get it done.

141
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:59,090
And so they were doing like, two,

142
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:02,539
like long full days of Zoom meetings

143
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:04,840
and accomplishing as much as they would

144
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,890
in four days of onsite time.

145
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:08,800
And so for a few of these clients

146
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,240
they were super efficient

147
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,490
and got through a lot
of things very quickly,

148
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,690
but I need you to stress that, that is a

149
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,680
relative rarity versus
the total number of audits

150
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,513
that we did.

151
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:31,210
So a few changes were more subtle

152
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:34,063
and not as expected or as clear cut.

153
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:37,359
Most of our assessment work,

154
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,460
most of our audit work

155
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:43,580
saw a fairly substantial
drop in inefficiency

156
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,690
and very much so in
excessive of whatever savings

157
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:50,969
we realize on travel costs or whatever

158
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:54,030
savings our clients
realized on travel costs.

159
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:56,900
I mean, certainly we all
admitted many fewer tons

160
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,900
of greenhouse gases in 2020,

161
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,493
and that's important.

162
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,900
But the

163
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:08,900
idea that assessment work
would be sort of net cheaper

164
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,409
because we weren't buying airline tickets

165
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:14,220
or staying in hotels or things like that,

166
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,723
simply didn't pan out.

167
00:08:16,642 --> 00:08:18,310
And some of these efficiency penalties

168
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:20,260
or some of these efficiency reductions,

169
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,440
really apply to kind of both parties

170
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,950
in a security assessment.

171
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:27,330
So this isn't me throwing
shade at our clients

172
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:31,430
or anything like that
because it's very easy

173
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:33,340
for either party or for both

174
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:36,960
to not prepare adequately for
any sort of scheduled event

175
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,429
in the audit for, I suppose a variety

176
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:42,599
of psychological and logistical factors.

177
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,060
If somebody is coming
to your office space to

178
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:49,719
do a security assessment, there are,

179
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,659
you at least wanna put
somewhere of the minimum effort

180
00:08:52,659 --> 00:08:54,313
into being ready for this.

181
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:58,540
Whereas, if you're just
showing up for a Zoom meeting

182
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:02,000
it's very easy to not
really have anything ready

183
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,320
and not be ready to
discuss it and not have

184
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,920
a sort of any substance and
just respond to all of the

185
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,890
inquiries with kind of the
I'll get back to you's,

186
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:12,020
or let me make a note of that,

187
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,430
or let me chase that down with my team

188
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:17,829
and that sort of snowballs very quickly.

189
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:21,310
So too many of those
kind of kill the schedule

190
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:25,160
and push the project out
and very badly effects

191
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,110
sort of the overall timeline of things.

192
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:31,810
Some technical evidence
is more sort of laborious

193
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:34,390
to review typically
where it involves a mix

194
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:36,100
of sort of the technology and the process

195
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:39,830
like, observing what a client does

196
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,800
with reviewing their audit log data

197
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,502
and how they respond to it,

198
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,930
and then some discussions

199
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:49,949
are sometimes more
difficult to have remotely.

200
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:51,580
If you're trying to get an entire,

201
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:54,100
like software development
team to talk about their

202
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,670
software security practices,

203
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:59,670
if everybody's dialing in from
wherever they happen to be,

204
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:01,790
and that's spread across
a couple of times zones

205
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:06,300
or the like, that can
be really challenging

206
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:09,050
or at least more so than
getting everybody together

207
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:10,589
in the conference room

208
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:13,973
to talk through it in kind
of an in-person setting.

209
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,330
That said, one of the
things we found was that

210
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:22,600
assessing physical security
controls went surprisingly well.

211
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,980
I mean, it definitely was

212
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:26,260
more challenging in some ways than

213
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,600
being able to go on site,
but it wound up being

214
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,660
I think, far less challenging

215
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:33,069
than we were all sort of expecting.

216
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:36,150
And to the credit of
a lot of organizations

217
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:40,350
our clients third-party
co-location facilities were sort

218
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:43,290
of delightfully co-operative
for the most part.

219
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:46,959
And we're very happy to do
sort of the remote video kind

220
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,510
of observation, where they
would join the Zoom meeting

221
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:52,850
from their mobile device and
walk through the facility

222
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:56,630
and pan the camera on their phone

223
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:59,790
to the things that we
needed to see and show us

224
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:00,622
what we needed.

225
00:11:00,623 --> 00:11:04,090
And that worked, I'd say surprisingly well

226
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:07,010
once you got past that kind of
Blair Witch project sensation

227
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:10,160
of the shaky cam showing
you the data center.

228
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,589
and there were a few
variations on this theme

229
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:17,590
in some places, the co-location
facility didn't really

230
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,520
have cell signal or wifi
because it was under a mountain

231
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:25,830
and what our clients did or
what their, the colo did was

232
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,910
pre-record that, the data center personnel

233
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:31,650
of the facilities,
personnel would walk through

234
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,910
and record what they were doing

235
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,060
and what they were showing us,

236
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,699
and they would sort of
submit that recording to us.

237
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:40,680
And then we just sort of
gave them the disclaimer

238
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,300
that we may ask them to go back

239
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,510
and get specific things
that weren't visible

240
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:45,490
in their initial recording,

241
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:47,250
like, Hey, go back to this point at

242
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:50,660
two minutes and 37 seconds where you were

243
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:54,219
and then pan left, 30 degrees
and show us what's there.

244
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,470
And by and large,

245
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:58,570
it really didn't even have to come to that

246
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:01,130
and this worked very well.

247
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:04,300
There was, I would say a
small minority of facilities

248
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,563
who would not play ball,

249
00:12:07,524 --> 00:12:10,130
who insisted on their sort of

250
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:13,439
no video recording inside
the data center policies

251
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,440
and wouldn't make assumptions

252
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,350
even for these circumstances.

253
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:18,793
And in these cases,

254
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,360
there were times where we
couldn't test the requirements.

255
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,980
We could not evaluate the
physical security controls.

256
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,300
And then we had to
disclose that in the report

257
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:32,280
and in some cases that sort
of not tested or not assessed

258
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:36,160
quality ended up as a disclosure,

259
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,370
and then some cases that
affected sort of the compliance

260
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:42,090
status of things because some standards

261
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:43,753
essentially regard that as such.

262
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:47,949
So that did happen and that did have some

263
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:50,170
trouble, but it was very much a minority

264
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:51,500
of facilities that we had to contend

265
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,700
with over the last year.

266
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,500
There were a few cases
where the remote audit work

267
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,410
kind of, didn't work at all.

268
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:02,189
Again, these are those kind
of long tail PCI standards

269
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:04,710
like, PIN or 3S, or
point to point encryption

270
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:09,270
and typically pertain to
facilities with secure

271
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:11,560
cryptographic keying operations.

272
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,380
In some cases, the
requirements in those standards

273
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:18,630
themselves disallow remote
video or disallow video

274
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:21,550
that could observe the keying material

275
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:24,400
or the credentials to get access to

276
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,270
the secure cryptographic devices.

277
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:29,810
And so the act of performing
kind of the remote

278
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:33,839
assessment work violated
the requirements that

279
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,680
were to be assessed.

280
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,540
So you got stuck in this
kind of catch 22 there.

281
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,810
And in those cases we had to actually go

282
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:43,119
to the facilities and we
had to make some fairly

283
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,830
careful plans to try to minimize the risk

284
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:47,463
to the folks involved.

285
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:53,380
Advantageously, most of these situations

286
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:56,520
could be rendered down to even less

287
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,130
than sort of a full day on
site, typically just a handful

288
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:03,610
of hours to go observe the
relevant operations in that sort

289
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:06,490
of secure key injection space.

290
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:08,490
And you know what I say here in the slide,

291
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:09,840
sounds kind of barbaric, right?

292
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,900
Some of the young healthy people

293
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,740
but really what that means,
is we sent the people

294
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:14,573
who

295
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:18,040
did not have themselves

296
00:14:19,467 --> 00:14:21,860
a number of additional risk factors

297
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:25,560
and whose sort of immediate families or

298
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,160
people that they lived with
or came into contact with

299
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,620
regularly, did not have those
additional risk factors.

300
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,740
So we weren't putting anybody

301
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:34,960
in a position where they were worried

302
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:38,650
about potentially contracting
the virus and then coming home

303
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:41,660
and passing that to
somebody who was vulnerable.

304
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:44,530
And this was a relatively
rare set of occurrences,

305
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:47,223
so this wasn't a
particularly common thing.

306
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,790
Several of our team
members and our clients

307
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:59,070
talked a lot about the lack
of in-person interactions

308
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:01,120
everyone is sort of feeling that

309
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,370
and that's, I think not surprising,

310
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:05,160
everyone, everywhere is feeling that lack

311
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,469
of in-person interactions, right?

312
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:09,330
We miss good coffee bars,
we miss good noodle joints,

313
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:12,610
we miss being able to go someplace else

314
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:16,510
and have a change of scenery,
and have a change of pace.

315
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:19,530
And that's a real factor.

316
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:20,949
And then a combination

317
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:24,500
of other factors make some
of this more tiring than

318
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,830
maybe it's been under other circumstances.

319
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:30,680
The idea of project stack,
where one project sort of spills

320
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,410
into the time allocated for another

321
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:34,469
and then those two spill
into the time allocated

322
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:36,780
for a third is.

323
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,079
I mean, it's always been a real thing

324
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,300
that's always required
very specific sort of

325
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:43,790
management to mitigate,
but it's even easier

326
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:47,300
and sort of more palpable than before.

327
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,370
And of course, everybody's dealing

328
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:51,080
with a variety of outside pressures.

329
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,840
Folks have gotten sick themselves.

330
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,010
Folks have lost, loved ones.

331
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:56,650
Folks have had a number of other

332
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:00,569
hard things in their
life that have occurred

333
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:03,357
over the last year and that matters.

334
00:16:03,357 --> 00:16:05,240
And the resulting

335
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,140
sort of burnout is a very real potential

336
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,240
thing that can happen.

337
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:14,030
There's sort of one hand
where these factors are

338
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:17,660
very real, and it's almost
not even on the other hand.

339
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:20,800
But the other set of facts that

340
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,660
we have to sort of consider is that for

341
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:28,140
whatever reason, this has
not necessarily caused a

342
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:31,069
noticeable effect in business agreements.

343
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:34,923
Clients renewed with
us, new clients came in,

344
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:38,790
a few tried to negotiate, reduced fees

345
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,199
given some financial hardships.

346
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:44,500
And that was, I think, understandable but

347
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,900
the idea that we're gonna
lose a ton of business

348
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:51,240
because our clients are cutting back or

349
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:54,360
the like, really didn't materialize.

350
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,550
And it really didn't
seem to be the case where

351
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:00,660
clients or prospective
clients all decided,

352
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:03,939
Oh, well it's all over Zoom,
so everybody's the same

353
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:06,050
so let's go pick the cheapest auditor, but

354
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:07,250
that just didn't happen.

355
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:12,063
Okay, so I wanna talk a little bit about

356
00:17:12,063 --> 00:17:14,829
kind of evidence gathering process

357
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:17,260
because this changed

358
00:17:19,047 --> 00:17:22,180
a reasonably good bit
as a result of events

359
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,163
of the last year,

360
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:26,710
but in some ways, it's just kind of been

361
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:29,473
the reckoning that's been
coming for a long time.

362
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,620
In a lot of ways we've been gathering

363
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,489
sort of technical evidence
for security assessments,

364
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:39,900
remotely for a long time.

365
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:43,220
If a system is co-located
and access remotely

366
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,710
or lives in a public cloud,

367
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:47,720
and you're accessing it through the

368
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,700
cloud providers console

369
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:52,380
then that evidence gathering is remote.

370
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,710
And it has been for a long time.

371
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:55,640
And it requires, I think

372
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,390
the appropriate level of suspicion.

373
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,920
And to that end, I think about evidence or

374
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:06,360
kind of named the properties
that you wanna think about

375
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,699
evidence gathering is as
authenticity and currency,

376
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,540
and completeness.

377
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,923
I'll talk about sort of what
I mean, in each of these.

378
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,440
So when we think about

379
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,933
authenticity,

380
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:23,230
I mean, it's not just, is the
client sort of lying to us,

381
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:25,980
is this the real firewall
rules or are these Photoshop.

382
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,380
I suppose that's a problem,
but that's actually not

383
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:34,620
the thing that manifests
itself the most often

384
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,770
but it's the idea that

385
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:39,080
you have to question whether or not,

386
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:42,610
what they're giving you
addresses the audit requirement.

387
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:46,560
Does this address the
thing that we need to

388
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,520
consider as part of this requirement or

389
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,920
part of this section of the
standard, or what have you.

390
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:55,480
And that's always been here, but it

391
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,980
became sort of more
pronounced over the last year.

392
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,030
And then there's sort
of the age old question

393
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:04,060
of can an outside party possessed of

394
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,330
sort of the relevant skills and knowledge

395
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:09,639
kind of follow the evidence to arrive

396
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,070
at the same conclusion as the auditor.

397
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:16,120
And so the trouble tends to manifest

398
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,699
over the sort of back and forth

399
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,220
that occurs when there's
disagreement about the sufficiency

400
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:24,790
of audit evidence and it
leads to some kind of decay

401
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:26,970
and the quality of what you get or the

402
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:28,963
authenticity or the traceability.

403
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:33,659
The client gives some
server configurations

404
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:34,570
or some patch lists

405
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:36,490
and then the auditor says, well, this is

406
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:38,650
missing things, or it's insufficient

407
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:40,800
or you're missing certain patches.

408
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,567
And then the client responds with sort of,

409
00:19:42,567 --> 00:19:44,610
Oh, okay, well here's the little, like

410
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:46,409
incremental piece that
shows you what you need.

411
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:48,010
And the auditor says,
well, that's part of it

412
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:49,500
but not the whole thing.

413
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,350
This sort of back and forth of that

414
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,210
I mean, there's often a
frustrating for a variety

415
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:57,210
of parties and very
often boils down to the

416
00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:00,071
just tell me what you want,
and I'll get it to you.

417
00:20:00,071 --> 00:20:04,010
And that often is sort of
a very narrow kind of thing

418
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,940
that then when you go back and look at it,

419
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,630
weeks or months later or
somebody else comes along

420
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:10,463
to look at it and says,

421
00:20:10,463 --> 00:20:12,220
how did you arrive at this conclusion?

422
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:17,530
You sometimes have kind of
lost the forest from the trees

423
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:22,530
and you can't necessarily draw
all of the same conclusions

424
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:25,090
at least not without a lot
of very specific contexts

425
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,889
that maybe nobody remembers anymore.

426
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:32,730
And so really, the idea
of authenticity here

427
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:37,730
is to say, how do we
receive evidence from you?

428
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:41,310
Our client, to validate
this particular requirement

429
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:44,490
or exempt to demonstrate this
particular part of compliance

430
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,680
that has both the substance
of this is authentic.

431
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,923
This is showing us what we need,

432
00:20:52,923 --> 00:20:56,880
this is a thing that
demonstrates the requirement

433
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,020
and it possesses the appearance thereof.

434
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:01,213
So that nobody can come and say, well,

435
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:05,420
maybe your conclusions
are correct, but it's also

436
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:07,550
possible to have drawn
some other conclusions,

437
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:09,923
like, it puts everybody above suspicion.

438
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:15,570
The next sort of thing that

439
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:18,040
I think about for the sufficiency

440
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,520
of evidence is the idea of currency.

441
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,930
Is this current?

442
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:25,160
Is this recycled from last year?

443
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,180
Are these screen prints that you took

444
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:30,720
of the server configurations
and paste it into the word doc

445
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,070
and provided to me, are,
are they last years?

446
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:39,970
Can you tell, or maybe
they're not last years,

447
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:43,083
maybe they're just from
a couple of months ago,

448
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:46,379
maybe this is what you gave the folks when

449
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:49,740
they were doing the SOC-2
audit a few months ago

450
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:52,570
and now we're doing a
FedRAMP or a PCI DSS audit,

451
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:55,040
and you're giving us the same thing.

452
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,899
And it's not even that those were

453
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,600
sort of insufficiently authentic.

454
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,439
That really was, what this, the state of

455
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,930
those systems were at the time.

456
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:07,940
But now this is some months later

457
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,940
or this is some period of time later

458
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:13,630
and maybe the underlying
circumstances has changed.

459
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:15,340
Maybe this set of screen captures

460
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:17,419
that you've provided is no longer

461
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:20,150
representative of the current state.

462
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:23,380
And certain kinds of
evidence sort of ages out

463
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,963
more quickly than others.

464
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,150
Server configurations or firewall rules,

465
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:32,360
or log data or things like that,

466
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,490
I think have a

467
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:36,193
pretty short half-life
and decay pretty quickly.

468
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:39,670
Obviously, things like
policy documents tend to

469
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:40,703
have a longer life span

470
00:22:40,703 --> 00:22:44,990
and really even like the
physical evidence showing

471
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:48,610
physical security of data centers

472
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:50,760
has potentially a longer life span

473
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,560
or it's less likely to sort of decay

474
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,450
into an unrepresentative state

475
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,733
as quickly as other things.

476
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:03,430
So part of what we look for here are

477
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:05,443
kind of the adequate timestamps.

478
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,000
If it's a screen capture
of a server configuration

479
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,670
or something like that, is there,

480
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:13,670
can we see the clock in the SIS tray?

481
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:15,950
Or in the corner

482
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:18,760
to say, okay, this was
when this was produced.

483
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,470
It's very clearly not last year's

484
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:22,010
or last month or whatever.

485
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:23,370
It's a usefully current

486
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:27,770
piece of evidence demonstrating
what we're looking for

487
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:30,790
or if it's a document,
is there a revision date

488
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:34,080
or was this thing last sort
of cracked open and revised

489
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,483
by somebody or approved
by management and in 2018?

490
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,750
And sometimes this works well,

491
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,750
sometimes this is more troublesome, like

492
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:47,950
certain views of audit log evidence, or

493
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:49,370
maybe patches or something like that.

494
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:52,689
Maybe they don't always
lend themselves well to

495
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:57,610
time stamping or an adequate
sort of dating ability.

496
00:23:57,610 --> 00:24:00,040
And so maybe you need to
undertake some additional

497
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,090
procedures to be able to say

498
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:04,750
this is how we validate
the currency of this is,

499
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,460
that we make sure that
this is the real thing

500
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:10,503
and not something that's
stale or problematic.

501
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:15,950
And then the last piece
I want to talk about is

502
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:17,683
sort of completeness.

503
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:22,580
I think fairly straightforward,
the idea of does the show

504
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:23,820
everything that we need.

505
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:26,700
Does the show the list of

506
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:30,490
patches applied to some
of the system types

507
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:32,550
in the scope of the audit or

508
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:34,800
does it show all of the system types

509
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,260
in the scope of the audit?

510
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,820
It's very easy, I mean, again,

511
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:40,520
if you're suffering from Zoom fatigue

512
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,710
and project stack and

513
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,540
other aspects of your
life are kind of on fire,

514
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:46,373
it's very easy to say,

515
00:24:46,373 --> 00:24:49,220
okay, well, here's the kind
of list of windows patches

516
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:53,010
applied to these servers, but
then neglect the handful of

517
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:56,379
Linux systems or network
devices, or other appliances

518
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:59,930
in the environment that
also need a list of patches

519
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:01,730
that's going to be a distinct thing.

520
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:05,260
And then does it show
the appropriate context?

521
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:06,683
Does it show,

522
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:11,530
again like the complete list
of potential system types,

523
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:12,910
or does it show

524
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:16,930
kind of all of the typology
pieces in the environment,

525
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:21,930
or does it show all of the
applications that are in scope,

526
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:29,570
or is it sort of selective,
maybe inadvertently selective

527
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:31,510
in such a way that gives the appearance

528
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:34,683
of completeness without
actually the substance of it.

529
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:40,630
All right, so when we think
about how do we do this

530
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:42,350
in practice,

531
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:45,149
really the core thing that makes

532
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,790
these kinds of audits
and assessments work is,

533
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:50,389
really, really careful planning.

534
00:25:52,739 --> 00:25:56,090
Some of these are just good courtesy kind

535
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:57,399
of logistics things.

536
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,790
Figure out when your time zones overlap

537
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:04,110
or when they are sort of the least at odds

538
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:06,270
and plan your meetings accordingly.

539
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:09,760
So maybe don't plan an ADM Eastern time

540
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,190
meeting when half the team is

541
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:14,360
on the West Coast of the United States

542
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:17,389
or if you've got folks

543
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,720
in Asia Pac, and you've
got folks in Europe,

544
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:25,820
then everybody's gonna
have to be inconvenienced

545
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,230
at least some of the time.

546
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:29,860
And so let's figure out
how to maybe alternate that

547
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:33,120
so that it's not always
one team or the other

548
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,402
that's having calls at midnight.

549
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:39,449
And then it's also worth kind of

550
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:43,379
figuring out your strategy for scheduling,

551
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:45,780
some of these things and you can either

552
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:48,360
try to sort of spread out your meetings

553
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,280
to avoid that sort of back-to-back

554
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,630
jumped from one Zoom meeting to the next

555
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:57,530
where everybody feels sort
of harried and exhausted

556
00:26:57,530 --> 00:27:00,340
and ill prepared for the
thing that they're doing

557
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:03,860
or do what worked for my colleague

558
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,570
and our federal services practice with

559
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:07,409
a couple of his clients and go

560
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:09,670
for broke and just put it
all in into a couple of days

561
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:14,190
condense it all together and powered out.

562
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:16,470
Obviously, this ladder
strategy requires buy-in

563
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:19,070
from sort of everybody that's
gonna be involved in it.

564
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:21,620
And if you're the security
assessor and you know

565
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:23,590
your client can't reasonably handle that,

566
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:25,639
they can't clear out
all their distractions,

567
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,770
they can't focus just on this.

568
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:29,290
Don't suggest it

569
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:31,500
because you know how it's gonna go.

570
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,629
The other sort of logistical thing

571
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:39,773
is to say, is to keep
track of your evidence age.

572
00:27:41,058 --> 00:27:45,620
As you gather things, as you
collect stuff from clients

573
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:47,030
and review it and

574
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:52,293
disposition it to meet
the requirements or not,

575
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,730
consider how long it is good for.

576
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:59,520
If a client gives you a firewall
rule set on the front side

577
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,670
of the assessment and you
look at it and you say,

578
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:03,430
well this looks pretty good,

579
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:04,670
but then the assessment drags

580
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:05,880
out for several months

581
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,560
has that essentially
aged out for the purposes

582
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:12,440
of the assurances that
you need, consider that

583
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,420
and maybe you need to give
yourself sort of a flag

584
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:17,880
or a reminder to say,
Hey, we're, we're getting

585
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:21,390
to the end of the useful life
of this thing that you gave us

586
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:23,270
at the beginning of the audit.

587
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:25,320
Maybe we need to revisit this,
or maybe we need to figure

588
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:28,169
out how to pick up the pace a little bit,

589
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:30,750
so we don't have that sort
of rocket fuel problem

590
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:34,503
of evidence aging out and
needing to be recollected.

591
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,580
Say, when you're potentially looking

592
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:42,490
at some technical evidence
pieces, particularly

593
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:46,660
as you scale it over,
potentially a large sample

594
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:49,550
of systems, do a pilot first.

595
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:52,440
If you've got a set of server
configurations that you want

596
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,810
from a clients, Linux server environment,

597
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:57,090
we want these config files,

598
00:28:57,090 --> 00:28:59,620
we want the output of these commands.

599
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:02,233
And when we wanted
across these 40 servers,

600
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:05,620
do it on one or two, first

601
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:09,620
and make sure that what
you get back from them

602
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:12,080
is sufficient is what you want it to be.

603
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,189
'Cause if you say, I'll go
run this on all 40 servers

604
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:16,050
and they do, when they gather it all

605
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:17,850
and they put it into zip
files and they hand it back

606
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:19,250
to you and you look at it and you're like,

607
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:21,300
that's close but you miss these things.

608
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:22,280
They're not going to be really happy

609
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,200
about having to go redo all of that.

610
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,950
So pilot your, sort of evidence gathering

611
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:28,763
strategies accordingly.

612
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:34,450
All right, so as we think
about kind of the new normal,

613
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:39,163
most audit types will
revert to onsite work.

614
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:44,669
Most will go back to this,
probably by the end of this year

615
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:45,920
or the beginning of next.

616
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,390
And the different
standards bodies will have

617
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:49,790
their requirements to do so.

618
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:56,070
What's likely to happen
though, is that the amount

619
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:58,860
of time you spend onsite
is likely to go down,

620
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:01,510
more organizations are saying,

621
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:03,970
Hey, remote work is here to stay.

622
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:08,060
More teams are distributed,
or how can we condense this

623
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:09,530
to be more efficient?

624
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:11,580
So you should start planning on that,

625
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:14,010
both if you're a security auditor,

626
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:16,860
and if you're the recipient
of a security auditor,

627
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,399
security assessment say,

628
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:22,340
how do I accommodate sort
of all parties here to

629
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:26,440
focus on what's most essential?

630
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,670
What needs to be on site?

631
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:30,370
That might be physical security controls,

632
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:34,360
that might be the
evidence where the context

633
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,540
matters the most or where is the easiest,

634
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:40,360
to sort of misinterpret or
just the kinds of discussions

635
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,129
we're getting the whole
team physically present

636
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:43,280
as the most productive.

637
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:46,890
And then figure out,

638
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:50,250
how you're gonna make the
best use of remote work?

639
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:53,120
There are an increasing
number of distributed teams

640
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,840
that are not coming back to the office.

641
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,429
And so figuring out how to
work together with them to say,

642
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:03,140
Hey, how do we review
this security process when

643
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,970
it's spread out amongst five or six people

644
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:08,850
that live in five or six
different geographies,

645
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:12,320
you're going to need to come
together with that at anyhow.

646
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,510
And as more organizations make use

647
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:15,843
of more cloud services,

648
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:22,113
the reality of remote assessment
becomes more prominent.

649
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,900
So as we've looked at this
year, what we found is that,

650
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:32,263
most of our clients don't
even want onsite work in 2021.

651
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,060
Some because they've moved
to more remote workforce

652
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:42,070
or some become, because they
are still contending with

653
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:44,629
the sort of health risks and

654
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:47,140
the timetable for immunization

655
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:50,190
and the assurances that they've
given their own employees

656
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:53,333
about continuing to be
able to work remotely.

657
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:57,899
And there are a number of
other incentives to consider,

658
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:01,110
obviously, more remote
work means less air travel

659
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:02,872
which means fewer greenhouse gases.

660
00:32:04,276 --> 00:32:06,780
And I think that's generally a good thing.

661
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:09,620
And there's also the idea of
how could we be more resilient

662
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:13,010
against potential future
pandemics or similar

663
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,322
adverse effects.

664
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:21,830
And so, I mean, I think
there gonna be some changes

665
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:25,620
that arise as a result of
this to audit practice.

666
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:28,060
There's a new version of
PCI DSS that's scheduled

667
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:29,860
for release at the end of this year.

668
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:33,570
One of its major aspects is

669
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:35,419
what's called the customized approach

670
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:39,810
which allows clients to
define their own controls

671
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:41,139
to meet the objective.

672
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:45,060
They can define a thing to
achieve an objective rather

673
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,810
than meet a very prescriptive control

674
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:48,810
and then the assessor
determines the test procedure.

675
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:51,100
So there's a lot of flexibility

676
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:55,469
in this approach and
a lot of potential for

677
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:59,103
remote assessment
procedures here as a result.

678
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:02,990
I mean, audit practice,
I think has changed

679
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:04,810
for a lot of organizations
in the sense that

680
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:06,730
they've already adjusted their methods and

681
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:08,420
are unlikely to sort of return.

682
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,850
I mean, everybody wants
to maybe go someplace else

683
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:13,870
but you don't have to look
back too far to remember living

684
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:14,979
out of a suitcase

685
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:17,973
and not being super thrilled
about that all the time.

686
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:22,310
And again, the changes in technology,

687
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:25,100
more cloud-based services, more software

688
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:30,100
as a service lends itself to
this kind of remote practice,

689
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:35,190
both for assessors and
auditors and for our clients.

690
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:41,020
So as you think about
upcoming security audits

691
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,890
preparation begins now.

692
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:46,300
Planning is even more important.

693
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:48,950
So when we wanna start thinking about

694
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:51,850
when do these activities occur?

695
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:54,310
And who does what, and when do they do it?

696
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:55,440
And how do you track that?

697
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:59,350
And how do you hold all
parties accountable?

698
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:02,639
To say, Hey, this was the
schedule, we need to stick to it

699
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,760
or this is the schedule
and you didn't stick to it

700
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,310
and here's now what shakes out.

701
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:09,719
As well as just being able to adjust for

702
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:11,009
inevitable disruptions.

703
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:12,780
I think one of the
things we've all learned

704
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,520
in the last year is to sort of

705
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:18,840
be patient with one another
as you're contending with

706
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:21,493
things that happen in life.

707
00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:27,259
And so having some capacity,
both to hold people to account

708
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:29,900
and to sort of cut some slack when it's,

709
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,690
Hey there was this
personal matter that arose,

710
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:35,623
and it really threw me off
for a week, like that matters.

711
00:34:37,989 --> 00:34:39,473
When you think about this,

712
00:34:40,929 --> 00:34:44,040
obviously, step one is
to show up prepared.

713
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:48,973
Both parties, be prepared
for upcoming audit work.

714
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:53,429
Saying, we're going to
identify what we need on site,

715
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:56,909
isn't gonna work, saying we're going to

716
00:34:56,909 --> 00:34:59,759
respond to the audit needs as it arises

717
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,700
is not gonna work, you need to be able to

718
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:04,009
make a real plan for what needs to happen

719
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:05,083
and then stick to it.

720
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:10,470
Honestly, better planning
gives you more flexibility,

721
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:12,129
more ability to adjust, not less.

722
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:14,570
I think Charles Agal said, that

723
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:18,970
in planning for the unknown, I find

724
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:21,669
the plans practically
useless but the preparation

725
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:26,050
indispensable and that I think
has proven itself very true

726
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:26,950
over the last year

727
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,930
and then make sort of the best use

728
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:37,243
of kind of your time in
between security audits.

729
00:35:39,143 --> 00:35:42,750
Most security standards
kind of require ongoing

730
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:44,130
compliance activities.

731
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:46,140
That's through SOC where you need a

732
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:50,772
functional review period
leading up to your SOC audit.

733
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,310
If you're undergoing an ISO 27001 audit,

734
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:56,410
your information security
management system

735
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:58,683
needs kind of ongoing
maintenance and review,

736
00:35:59,566 --> 00:36:01,799
PCI DSS is very much leaning into the sort

737
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,720
of business as usual set of activities,

738
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,390
the ongoing acts of maintaining compliance

739
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:09,799
and what it means is that

740
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:13,510
you need a regular schedule of security

741
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:16,320
and compliance related activities to

742
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:20,940
occur on their are set intervals

743
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:24,160
and not just try to scrape
it all together the week

744
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,299
before your auditor shows up.

745
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:29,440
Trying to do that is not gonna get you

746
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,520
into the desired state
for your compliance.

747
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:36,233
That kind of personal
heroics isn't gonna work.

748
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:40,900
So if you get a security audit

749
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:43,053
or you get maybe multiple security audits,

750
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:46,910
my piece of advice to you is

751
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:49,980
start talking to your
auditor now about planning.

752
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:52,820
Maybe even sooner than you normally would

753
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:54,970
but start talking about the plans

754
00:36:54,970 --> 00:36:56,700
for when that's going to occur?

755
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,303
What needs to happen?

756
00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:01,419
How you're going to be ready for that?

757
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,480
How you're going to adjust?

758
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:06,410
Identify the things that
you really need to work on

759
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:11,310
to be ready and then execute
on that with your team

760
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:15,000
over the next couple of
months, and then figure out

761
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,240
how your team can sort
of best support your

762
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,060
audit requirements and
that may be figuring

763
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:23,290
out how to accommodate
your different time zones,

764
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:25,770
and that may be figuring
out your remote meeting

765
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:29,940
needs and usage, and then
maybe working with your

766
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:32,540
auditor to figure out how
you're going to exchange data

767
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:34,540
or even how you're going to exchange data,

768
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:36,363
relevant to the audit internally.

769
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,760
And if you are a security auditor,

770
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,540
my advice is to contact your clients.

771
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:45,200
Start planning, start looking
at the things that are coming

772
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,730
up in the next six months
and making the plans to

773
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:54,100
get them sort of a clear
project schedule and

774
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:57,080
how to execute on that in
a way that sticks to it

775
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,549
and gets everybody sort
of the desired results

776
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:01,150
in the timeframe that they want.

777
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:04,560
And then also think
strongly about what's gonna

778
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,210
keep your team from burning out.

779
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:11,340
How you're gonna sort of
minimize their Zoom fatigue

780
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:14,240
or their project stack,
or their concurrence,

781
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,979
or just cut them some slack when they've

782
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:19,890
had a lot of really
challenging assessment work

783
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:22,200
and they're sort of taxed by that.

784
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,710
But those are the things that

785
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:25,920
you definitely want to start preparing for

786
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:29,253
in order to make this year set
of remote audits a success.

787
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:33,100
So I'll conclude by

788
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:35,580
saying these things are
very much here to stay

789
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,360
and it's best to be ready for them

790
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,420
with some careful planning.

791
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:42,220
And thank you very much, I
greatly appreciate your time.
