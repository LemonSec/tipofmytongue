2
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:15,030
- Please welcome CEO
and co-founder of Satori

3
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:18,330
Eldad

4
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:19,610
Chai.

5
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:23,580
- The modern data infrastructure
has left security behind.

6
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:27,122
Today data is exploding
into multiple clouds, lakes,

7
00:00:27,122 --> 00:00:28,810
and warehouses,

8
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:31,689
data science and analytics
are being integrated

9
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:33,770
into almost every domain.

10
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:37,380
but managing data and its
usage is still done manually

11
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,530
through Ad Hoc Configurations,

12
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:43,500
our IT and database admins
quickly become a bottleneck

13
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,188
while we're struggling to
answer simple questions

14
00:00:46,188 --> 00:00:50,290
like who acts as what, are we
protecting our sensitive data

15
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:52,890
and where would we put our controls

16
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,240
Satori created the first
data SecOps platform

17
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,130
to streamline access to data

18
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:01,710
by solving the hardest security
and privacy challenges.

19
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:05,220
Imagine you can move away
from cumbersome permissions

20
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,970
into just in time
self-service access workflow.

21
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:12,050
A solution that keeps track
of other sensitive data

22
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:14,789
and monitors data flows in real-time,

23
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:17,320
a solution that can
enforce granular policies

24
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,759
without writing code or changing
your data infrastructure.

25
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,500
That is the authority.

26
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,490
So how does the work, it acts
as a transparent data proxy

27
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:29,229
between your data users
and your data stores,

28
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:32,630
we analyze all queries and
results that's in real time

29
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:36,039
and provide full data
flow visibility university

30
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,010
across all your data stores.

31
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:39,843
At any point in time, our workflow

32
00:01:39,843 --> 00:01:43,280
and policy engine can take
control over data flow

33
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,540
to enforce a policy to
mask or even initiate

34
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,270
an off-band authorization workflow.

35
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:51,520
Satori integrates into your environment

36
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,009
in minutes by simply
changing the data store URL,

37
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:56,930
and since it is transparent

38
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:59,810
it doesn't require to
change how people work today

39
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:02,490
or train people to use a new product.

40
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:05,050
So how does this change the paradigm

41
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:07,300
for data access and bricks to trade-off

42
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,639
between productivity and security.

43
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:12,220
Imagine that your head of
data analytics is working

44
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:15,350
on a new machine learning
model for your product

45
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:17,790
instead of waiting weeks
for security reviews

46
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:20,429
and configuration changes through Satori

47
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:23,310
she can independently request
the access, get approval

48
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,883
from a beta owner and
start working immediately.

49
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:29,310
Even if the data set
includes sensitive data

50
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,610
that is okay because we make sure

51
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:34,410
that your customer data is anonymized

52
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:36,010
your security and compliance team

53
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:38,380
get full data flow visibility

54
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,570
for monitoring the reporting,

55
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:42,549
but even your head of data of Satori,

56
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:45,200
because we solve critical
operational challenges

57
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,863
such as controlling costs.

58
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:50,940
The Satori team spent the
last 15 years creating

59
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,190
and scanning marketing
cybersecurity solutions

60
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:56,800
from zero to hundreds
of millions of revenue,

61
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,280
we're honored to have some
of the world's top investors,

62
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,530
advisors, and leaders
supporting our vision

63
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:05,940
to provide the first data SecOps solution

64
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,293
to enable secure data democratization.

65
00:03:08,293 --> 00:03:10,106
Thank you.
