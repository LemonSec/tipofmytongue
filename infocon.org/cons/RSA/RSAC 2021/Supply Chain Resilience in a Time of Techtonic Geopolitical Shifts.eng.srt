1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:02,890
- My name is Andrea Little Limbago

2
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:04,970
and I'll be discussing
Supply Chain Resilience

3
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:07,850
in a Time of Tectonic Geopolitical Shifts.

4
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:08,790
Now, throughout this discussion

5
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:10,899
feel free to add some
questions in the chat

6
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:14,483
and we can address them
throughout the entire session.

7
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,260
Now there's been
significant transformations

8
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:19,590
already underway,
especially along the lines

9
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,380
of geopolitical shifts
and emerging technologies

10
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,380
but really over the last
year these emerging trends

11
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:27,733
have accelerated thanks
to the COVID-19 pandemic.

12
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,850
In addition to the unprecedented

13
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:35,110
and devastating human
scale from the pandemic.

14
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:37,400
We've also seen significant disruptions

15
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,050
to the economies across
the globe and specifically

16
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:43,858
as it pertains to supply chains
with regard to global trade.

17
00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:47,310
And as you see in these charts,
global trade is plummeted

18
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:49,580
in the first and second
quarter of last year.

19
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:53,089
And with that came a
reckoning to supply chains

20
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:56,500
really exposing a whole
range for fragility that had

21
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,840
for the most part
remained under the surface

22
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,470
thanks to the just-in-time production

23
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:05,069
and really a hyper-focus on efficiencies.

24
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:06,649
So what was exposed during that time

25
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,830
through these major
global trade disruptions

26
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:12,310
was the complexity of
global supply chains.

27
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:14,710
And this includes really
the cost optimization

28
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:18,119
and specialization that
led to such complexity

29
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,690
that there were so many
different suppliers, thousands,

30
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:23,190
tens of thousands of
suppliers and supply chains

31
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:24,399
that it made it very hard to know

32
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,630
where these interconnections were

33
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:27,320
and where these interdependencies were.

34
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,619
And so disruption
somewhere across the globe

35
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:32,683
manifests itself know very locally.

36
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:38,190
It also led to very opaque
supply chains where companies

37
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:41,360
both private sector and
the government were unclear

38
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,900
of exactly what the scope of
the supply chain looks like.

39
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,940
That visibility is extremely hard

40
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,012
given such a complex supply chain system.

41
00:01:50,059 --> 00:01:53,250
It also exposed the
concentration risk that we saw

42
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,410
and specifically with
the emergence of China

43
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:57,729
over the last few decades
as a center of last resort

44
00:01:57,730 --> 00:01:59,700
and as a supplier to the world.

45
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,310
When China went into quarantine,

46
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:03,820
it led to enormous concentration risk

47
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,779
and disruptions that
rippled throughout the globe

48
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,289
due to the hyper dependencies
and specialization

49
00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:10,683
of aspects within the country.

50
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,700
And finally, it also
exposed the insecurity

51
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,350
of our supply chains.

52
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:17,720
Most recently we've
experienced this with the range

53
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,870
of SolarWinds and Microsoft
Exchange supply chain attacks

54
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,380
but those are indicative
of a growing trend

55
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,850
of supply chain attacks
and really where you see

56
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:28,340
supply chains being a mode of entry

57
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,420
to abroad attack surface.

58
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:33,780
And so throughout the COVID-19 pandemic

59
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:37,080
we saw all this decades worth
of trends coming together

60
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,830
and really exposing this fragility.

61
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,560
But unfortunately that's not all,

62
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,305
there even a larger range of
disruptions as well underway

63
00:02:46,305 --> 00:02:49,410
throughout the last few
years and really becoming

64
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:52,850
part of a hyper-focus looking
ahead, as far as a range

65
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:55,900
of disruptions that are
occurring in the cyber domain.

66
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,570
And so I already addressed the SolarWinds

67
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:59,609
supply chain attack, but
that wasn't the only one,

68
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:02,100
Vietnam was targeted and
we've seen many other examples

69
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,523
of this across the globe.

70
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,079
We've also seen a range
of internet shutdowns

71
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,170
and blackouts occurring across the globe.

72
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:10,559
We're seeing that with the Myanmar coup

73
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,270
going on as the military

74
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:13,690
is using that to control information

75
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:15,329
but we've seen it really across the globe

76
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:19,540
from Russia, to India, to
Congo in light of elections

77
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,313
and to quell protest domestically.

78
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,860
We're also seeing a rise
of internet sovereignty.

79
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,990
And so when you hear the
notion of the splintering

80
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:29,270
or the balkanization of the internet

81
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:32,560
what this refers to is
really a localization

82
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,780
of information controlled
by the governments.

83
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,710
You think about the
China's Great Firewall.

84
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:38,840
Many other countries are
increasingly starting to look

85
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,680
at that as a model to follow and Cambodia

86
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,180
is one of more recent ones
to try and pursue that.

87
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,370
We're also seeing legislation
come along the lines

88
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,340
for government mandated access to data.

89
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,880
And so this was where there are

90
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,019
some local data storage
requirements that the on top

91
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:56,820
of that enable and require
government access to data.

92
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,400
And so this for supply chains
that are in these countries

93
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,673
their IP and their PII
is at a special risk.

94
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,260
And then we're also seeing data access

95
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,829
through government surveillance.

96
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,610
And so for companies that are focusing

97
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:10,140
and really high surveillance,

98
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,059
countries while their
data may be exposed data

99
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,010
they didn't even know that
they had, that could be used

100
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:16,142
against them or be used for exploitation.

101
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,140
And all this comes together
with a whole range of risk

102
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:23,580
and really a transformation
that is underway.

103
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,650
But unfortunately for the most part,

104
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:27,340
a lot of the discourse that we're hearing

105
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:31,229
points to paradigms and
frameworks from previous eras.

106
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:34,370
And that's why I really like
this quote that focuses on

107
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:36,570
how all of our leaders
as well as scientists

108
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:38,500
are envisioning this return to normal

109
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,830
over the next course of the year or two.

110
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:41,979
And it's really reflecting a collective

111
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,830
felt failure of imagination.

112
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:46,770
And so what I hope to do
throughout this entire talk

113
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:49,722
lead to overcoming this
collective failure imaginations

114
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:52,469
because the cybersecurity
community will be front and center

115
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:54,390
in determining how resilient

116
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:56,390
our supply chains will be going forward.

117
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,450
Talking about these transformations,

118
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:04,070
again, as opposed to looking back,

119
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,320
we really need to be looking ahead because

120
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,710
that future isn't five
10 years down the road,

121
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:09,090
I think very often we still imagine

122
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:10,119
all these emerging technologies

123
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,460
as some sort of futuristic
impact but it's happening now.

124
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,890
We're already seeing the chip shortages,

125
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:17,520
we're seeing battles over
artificial intelligence

126
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,280
and regulations, along those
lines and just a whole range

127
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,609
of the cyber risks that I talked about

128
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:24,380
that that future world
order is already here.

129
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,420
And we need to be
preparing our supply chains

130
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:29,610
to be resilient against
these major transformations

131
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:31,510
that are already underway,

132
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:34,020
largely driven by a shifting geopolitics

133
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,883
in the emerging technology
and digital revolution.

134
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:41,670
And so when thinking about these shifts

135
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:43,470
and thinking about how to
build supply chain resilience

136
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:46,020
across the globe there
really are two different

137
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,859
techno ideologies that are driving it.

138
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:50,100
And each one of these poses
different opportunities

139
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,160
and different challenges
when thinking about

140
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,940
how to restructure and
how to build greater

141
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:57,440
and more resilient supply
chains across the globe.

142
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,540
On the one hand there's
digital authoritarianism,

143
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:05,350
this is also referred
to as techno dictators,

144
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:07,980
but it's when governments
use digital information

145
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:10,110
and digital information technologies

146
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:12,620
for complete information
control within their borders,

147
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,470
these could be any of those
examples I talked about

148
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:17,060
as far as using internet
blackouts, using censorship,

149
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,107
government mandated policy, surveillance

150
00:06:19,107 --> 00:06:20,707
and then the whole range of APTs

151
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:26,003
in leveraging offensive
cyber for information access.

152
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:30,020
But importantly, when we talk
about these techno dictators,

153
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,240
extends well beyond China and Russia,

154
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,840
I think very often we
think that China and Russia

155
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,669
are the usual suspects
and they absolutely are,

156
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:37,780
and they are leading the
way but what they're doing

157
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:40,580
is providing that playbook
for others to copy.

158
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,969
And so we've seen the
copycats starting to emerge

159
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:45,550
and amongst state and non-state actors

160
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,020
and really what the
overarching ideology is

161
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,140
is this complete quest
for information control

162
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,570
and whether it's controlling it

163
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:52,860
through hoarding of information,

164
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,770
through stealing information,
but also manipulation

165
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:57,120
and abuse of that
information and data as well.

166
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:03,090
On the other end, we
have digital democracies

167
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,700
and unlike digital authoritarianism

168
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,590
which has basically had a
playbook that's been evolving

169
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:08,109
for the last few decades.

170
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:11,970
The digital democracy playbook
really is still very nascent.

171
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:13,370
On the one hand that might be surprising

172
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:15,410
because the internet was
built upon the notions

173
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:17,956
and aspirations of a free,
open, secure internet

174
00:07:17,956 --> 00:07:20,170
and free flow of information.

175
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:23,040
But unfortunately those
aspirations weren't supported

176
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,650
by any range of policies or laws or norms.

177
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:28,409
It basically was internet anarchy

178
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:30,730
as far as how the information would emerge

179
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:32,020
and to fill that vacuum

180
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:34,830
the digital authoritarian model came in.

181
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,770
Well, fortunately we are
finally starting to see

182
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:39,150
some democracies come forward

183
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:40,450
and start creating some playbooks.

184
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:43,270
And so when thinking about looking ahead

185
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,590
and how we can actually ensure

186
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,909
these aspirational visions
come to your reality,

187
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:49,220
more policies and laws and
norms are starting to emerge

188
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,520
with really a focus on
security and privacy

189
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,849
and the free flow of
information as a universal right

190
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:56,010
as opposed to the authoritarian view

191
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:58,593
for complete control over information.

192
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,230
Now, how did these competing
ideologies actually

193
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:05,260
impact supply chains?

194
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:08,890
They very much so impact both
on the range of data risks,

195
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:11,099
but when thinking about how supply chains

196
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,170
are getting transformed right now

197
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:14,570
and how companies and
governments are thinking about

198
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:16,860
where their suppliers
are, who to partner with

199
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,140
and how to really transform,
rebuild resilience

200
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,669
these ideologies should
become front center

201
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:22,060
when thinking about where

202
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:24,810
and the locations of your supply chain

203
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:27,310
and there are couple of different facets

204
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:29,390
to take into account when doing that.

205
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:32,850
One is global wars or
the global trade wars,

206
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:35,140
another is regulatory
shifts and then finally,

207
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,689
there's also interstate hostilities.

208
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:38,909
And so I'll walk through
each of these very briefly

209
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:41,760
although each one could honestly
be its own presentation.

210
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,380
So when thinking about
the global trade war,

211
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:47,150
very often in our security community

212
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:49,020
we think about the weaponization of cyber

213
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,620
whether you love or hate that phrase,

214
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,840
it's something that has been
around for a little while

215
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:56,520
and really talks about
how the cyberspace domain

216
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,793
has become an area of global conflict.

217
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:01,420
And so that's been going
on for quite some time

218
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:05,500
as I think we all have
come to RSA for years now

219
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,890
and heard a lot of these
different kinds of attacks.

220
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:10,510
What's relatively new and
hasn't been around for,

221
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:13,040
has actually been a bit of
a gap for several decades

222
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,780
is a weaponization of trade.

223
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:17,010
And so this is where industrial
policy comes into play.

224
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:19,780
And it's where trade
policies are used as a weapon

225
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:22,620
of the government to basically to pursue

226
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,123
and to push forth their
objectives and incentives.

227
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:29,640
And where we'll focus on for
today is this data access

228
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,819
for us through that hardware and software

229
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,210
that comes along with that trade.

230
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:34,350
And so if you think about
some of the tech giants

231
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:37,240
across the globe and various
kinds of surveillance companies

232
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,600
and the various emerging technologies

233
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,610
some of those can come along

234
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:42,360
with various kinds of data access risk

235
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,960
as far as embedded back
doors or vulnerabilities.

236
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,090
And they're becoming part of the,

237
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:48,170
both the weaponization of cyber

238
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:50,520
but also part of the trade
conflict that we're seeing

239
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,319
especially between the US and China.

240
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:57,710
And so in light of this
growing use of regulations

241
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:01,450
and widely the growing
conflict that we're seeing that

242
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:03,940
of tech and trade wars
between the US and China,

243
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:06,910
but it's not just those, we're
seeing Australia and China

244
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:10,880
in conflict with tariffs over
wine, Taiwan with pineapples,

245
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,812
we're starting to see

246
00:10:11,812 --> 00:10:13,840
there's no shortage of examples right now,

247
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,700
as far as the growing
range of trade disputes

248
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,960
that are popping up,
especially a lot of those

249
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,870
that focus on the technology side.

250
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:22,450
And so given that we're already starting

251
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:25,790
to see some private sector
and public sector entities

252
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:28,839
already shifting their
locations away from China

253
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,190
and away from areas toward what they feel

254
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:33,453
are more resilient locations.

255
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,680
And so currently what we're seeing is

256
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,640
you'll have roughly a quarter
of companies are planning

257
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,620
on relocating their supply chains

258
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,137
and for a lot of these
numbers and statistics,

259
00:10:41,137 --> 00:10:43,910
over the course of the COVID pandemic,

260
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,969
they've grown in percentages

261
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:46,990
as far as those who are thinking

262
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:48,220
about moving their supply chains

263
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:50,940
and transforming them across the globe.

264
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,680
We're seeing three quarters are enhancing

265
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,776
the scope of existing reshoring.

266
00:10:54,776 --> 00:10:56,599
And so this is an important
point because again

267
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,390
reshoring was already underway
thanks to the US and China

268
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:00,790
trade war and the growing tariffs

269
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:03,323
but it's really has
escalated over the last year.

270
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,760
And we're seeing at least
half the companies are looking

271
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,470
at providing alternative suppliers.

272
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:10,770
And so a diversity of
suppliers and backups suppliers

273
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:13,430
is another way to gain
resilience going forward

274
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:17,079
but it's not just companies
are having these plans.

275
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,360
Governments are also
stepping in to incentivize

276
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,960
various kinds of movements away from areas

277
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,793
where they feel they have

278
00:11:22,793 --> 00:11:24,860
too much geographic concentration risk.

279
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:27,000
Japan for instance, has
allocated over 4 billion

280
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,420
in the last year or so to facilitate

281
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:32,260
its own domestic champions
through shore away from China.

282
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,340
And they're not alone there.

283
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,850
This is we're seeing
something similar popping up

284
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:37,350
not quite at that scale, but
more and more governments

285
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:39,910
are starting to look at how
they can incentivize reshoring

286
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,510
because it is a significant cost

287
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,400
and all this discussion about transforming

288
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,010
and moving across the globe is driven by

289
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:48,997
the range of tariffs and
technology, as we've talked about

290
00:11:48,997 --> 00:11:50,160
and really trying to get away

291
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,040
from this exposed concentration risks

292
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,963
that we saw occur over the last year.

293
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,220
Now thinking about
reshoring and moving away

294
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:00,040
from one higher risk area
to a lower risk area.

295
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,640
Sounds great, the problem
is it's really expensive.

296
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,310
Some estimate it could be
up to a trillion dollars

297
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:07,900
to shift the supply
chain hubs out of China

298
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:10,310
and likely could cost much more than that.

299
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:12,040
Other issues of sunk costs.

300
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,270
So over the last few decades

301
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,960
companies have invested
in an awful lot of money

302
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,600
and physical infrastructure
that's located there.

303
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,250
It's very hard to replicate elsewhere.

304
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,730
And then finally, we're also seeing

305
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:23,650
labor force requirements that,

306
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:25,260
again, when looking back
that hyper specialization

307
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,439
I was talking about, the
labor force requirements

308
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,640
are very hard to find elsewhere.

309
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,970
And also you need to
think about where to move,

310
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:33,750
could there possibly be
some similar cyber risk

311
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,250
in different areas,
thanks to this whole range

312
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,490
of different kinds of government mandated

313
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:40,290
data access requirements

314
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:42,783
and other kinds of risks
that I mentioned earlier.

315
00:12:45,271 --> 00:12:47,400
And so with that as the backdrop,

316
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,490
we're seeing these global trade wars,

317
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:49,910
we're seeing the heightened
geopolitical tensions

318
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:52,290
between the US and China
and some authoritarians

319
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:53,457
and the democracy is across the globe.

320
00:12:53,457 --> 00:12:57,430
And we are seeing it's a
techno-ideological battle going on.

321
00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:00,790
And so it's coming along with
that really significant shifts

322
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,579
in the regulatory landscape.

323
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:05,750
And very often we hear that policy is way

324
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:09,640
behind technology innovation
and it generally has been true.

325
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,910
What we've seen over the last year or two,

326
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:14,300
especially in the United
States is really a dynamic

327
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,719
regulatory landscape
backed by export controls

328
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,063
and really using industrial
policy in ways we haven't seen.

329
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:23,693
I'd say unprecedented ways.

330
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,100
And as you can see on the slide,

331
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,427
it's a whole of government
approach as well.

332
00:13:28,427 --> 00:13:30,530
And so I'll walk through a couple examples

333
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:32,130
just to highlight just how hard it is

334
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:34,953
to stay on top of this
dynamic regulatory landscape.

335
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:37,590
And so I'll start with
Department of Defense

336
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:41,070
which you may not think
about as a key component

337
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,620
of industrial policy, but
the Department of Defense

338
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,453
has been leading the way,

339
00:13:44,453 --> 00:13:46,799
the 2019 National
Defense Authorization Act

340
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:49,390
has section 889 which prohibits

341
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:52,170
five different Chinese
companies and their affiliates

342
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:53,349
from being within the supply chain

343
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:55,250
of the federal contractors.

344
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:58,240
And so it's Huawei and
ZTE are the two of them

345
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,030
but HikVision, Hytera and
Dahua are three others

346
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:03,270
that may not be the ones
that are commonly known

347
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:06,890
but are linked to a
national security concern.

348
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:08,660
And so they cannot be
part of the supply chains

349
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:11,780
for those who work and
support the government.

350
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:14,660
And interestingly, the SEC
just recently also named

351
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:17,500
those exact same five companies
as national security threats

352
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,300
as introducing a whole range of

353
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,540
additional kind of regulations

354
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,589
pose on dealing with those five companies.

355
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:25,030
And so we're starting to
see some reinforcement

356
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,860
from different departments
across the government

357
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:29,283
focused on similar companies.

358
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,510
What we're also seeing from
the Department of Defense,

359
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:38,510
section 1237 of the 1999
NDAA, and so for 20 years

360
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:42,090
there's been this requirement
that the Pentagon list

361
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:45,850
companies that are Chinese
linked and linked to the PLA

362
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:48,340
they're operating in the United States.

363
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:50,310
Didn't make a move on
that really for 20 years

364
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:53,479
and then since the last June, June of 2020

365
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,060
roughly there've been over 40 companies

366
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:59,780
that have been linked to the
PLA and while 1237 doesn't have

367
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:04,100
its own compliance requirements,
there's an executive order

368
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,740
this past November that came
out that did include investment

369
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,020
prohibitions to those companies.

370
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:11,110
And then most recently
those are then enacted

371
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,180
through treasury, which has
initiated a non-specialty

372
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,359
designated communist Chinese
military company list.

373
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,450
And that's where you see those
companies start to emerge.

374
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:20,290
And so again, joined the
cross department coordination

375
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:23,390
towards the national security
aspect of these techno

376
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:24,990
and trade wars that are ongoing.

377
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,610
And then one more aspect of treasury

378
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:28,770
are the financial penalties.

379
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:31,807
So that's where it gets into
how it's very hard to stay

380
00:15:31,807 --> 00:15:34,690
in compliance with a lot of
the different aspects going on.

381
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:36,870
And if you don't, it's very
costly for you and within your,

382
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,320
and across your supply chain.

383
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,900
Now, the department that
arguably has been the most active

384
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:43,920
has been Department of Commerce.

385
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,490
And within that, there's a
Bureau of Industry and Security

386
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:49,420
that has an Entity List
that basically includes

387
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,250
prohibitions on the export or re-export

388
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,930
or in country transfer of products

389
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:54,380
that are on that Entity List.

390
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:58,590
Now, prior to 2019 there
really weren't many

391
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,030
Chinese companies that are listed on it,

392
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:02,262
ZTE was, and then it was delisted,

393
00:16:02,263 --> 00:16:06,980
but what we've seen it as
over 350 companies were added,

394
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:10,522
2019, 2020, we've seen
some more already in 2021.

395
00:16:10,522 --> 00:16:11,860
And so I just would like to highlight that

396
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:15,004
because they're really the
significant number of companies

397
00:16:15,004 --> 00:16:18,020
that can not be within your supply chain

398
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,810
or have a whole range of different kinds

399
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:22,272
of export restrictions
associated with them.

400
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:26,910
And so what we saw in 2019 in May was 68

401
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:30,100
largely focused on Huawei
and we continue to see

402
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,520
throughout the year
additional Huawei affiliates

403
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:35,860
added onto it but it
wasn't just for Huawei,

404
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,260
we saw Chinese companies

405
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,340
added for their human rights violations,

406
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:42,123
some added for ties to
weapons of mass destruction.

407
00:16:43,412 --> 00:16:44,820
In December of 2020,

408
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,330
we saw over 100 different companies added.

409
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:49,430
And those were for the
range of national security

410
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:52,270
tech surveillance concerns,
the human rights concerns

411
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:55,020
and then also building islands
in the South China seas.

412
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,530
And then what we also saw
were even additional ones

413
00:16:58,530 --> 00:16:59,589
associated with this,

414
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:01,680
a new list called the
Military End User List.

415
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,750
And so concerns over these
technologies being used

416
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,310
by foreign governments
in their militaries.

417
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:08,179
And it was even interesting on top of this

418
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,619
is that it wasn't just China,

419
00:17:09,619 --> 00:17:11,879
they added a whole bunch
of Russian companies

420
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,050
as well at the same time.

421
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:16,810
And so that might be a harbinger of

422
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:18,300
what we're gonna be seeing
more and more this year

423
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,740
is additional companies
outside of just China

424
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:21,660
being added to the list

425
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,010
and in January, we already saw a few.

426
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:25,540
And since then, we've also
already seen some targeting

427
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:28,593
Saudi Arabia, Myanmar and
Russia and China as well.

428
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:32,923
So that's a lot to stay on
top of across the globe.

429
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:38,120
Now to drive home just how
it's not just the United States

430
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:41,120
that's working in this
area, what we're also seeing

431
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,530
are these democracies across the globe

432
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:45,500
getting into the game of leveraging export

433
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,550
and other kinds of
prohibitions and restrictions

434
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:49,822
to control what technologies are being

435
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:51,960
within their sovereign bounds.

436
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,500
And so across Europe,
we're seeing a patchwork

437
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:58,530
of different laws as it
applies to 5G and Huawei.

438
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:00,620
Australia was one of
the first to ban Huawei

439
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,580
and that's back in 2018.

440
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,899
And India has taken a
different route as far

441
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,990
as banning hundreds of
different apps linked to China.

442
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:09,830
And part of that really started was

443
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:13,179
during the conflict between
China and India over last year,

444
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:16,750
that led to the banning of the apps

445
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,630
and increasingly hostilities between them.

446
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:21,460
And so that's a good example
of what we'll talk about next

447
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:23,080
as far as the rising instability

448
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,629
that we're seeing across the globe.

449
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:27,610
Now also, I think it's important to note

450
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:29,300
how some of these are
starting to get coordinates

451
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,990
and these prohibitions
restrictions are getting

452
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:34,030
coordinated across
companies and countries.

453
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:37,627
And so most recently
what we saw was the EU

454
00:18:37,627 --> 00:18:41,770
for the first time since
1989 issued sanctions

455
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:44,960
against China for the
human rights violations.

456
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,740
And they did that in
coordination with the US

457
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,530
and the UK and Canada.

458
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:51,030
And so that's, it's
showing how democracies

459
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:54,433
are starting to come together
to look at the various

460
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:57,020
or coordinate and organizing
the prohibitions restrictions

461
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:58,920
as a more united front,

462
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:03,230
China quickly introduced their
own sanctions against the EU.

463
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:05,750
And that also is part of
how the EU has responded

464
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:08,200
to the growing prohibitions
restrictions against it.

465
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,720
And so they've introduced their
own unreliable Entity List,

466
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,270
they've sanctioned three
US defense companies,

467
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:16,639
that was in response to
an arms sale to Taiwan.

468
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,850
And as the administration shift,

469
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:21,240
they sanctioned 28 US former
administration officials.

470
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,400
So there's plenty of the tit-for-tat

471
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,653
going back and forth on that angle.

472
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:28,149
And then again, as if
that wasn't your dynamic

473
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:30,213
in a fast paced and moving,

474
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,560
making very hard to stay on
top of these shifting dynamic

475
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,820
and export control requirements,

476
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:39,070
there's a whole range of
additional data privacy

477
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:42,120
and protection requirements
aimed at helping companies

478
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,540
better secure their data.

479
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:45,730
And democracy is what we're seeing is this

480
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:48,580
emerging through privacy and
data protection regulations

481
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,870
and the general data protection
regulation from the EU

482
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:52,570
is arguing the most prominent one.

483
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:55,000
We've got others in
California, Brazil and Japan

484
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
following suit and many
across the United States

485
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,870
at the state level starting to pursue

486
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:02,135
those kinds of data protection policies.

487
00:20:02,135 --> 00:20:04,733
We're also seeing security
policies pop up as well.

488
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:08,620
Cybersecurity maturity model
certification is one of them

489
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:10,219
to incentivize greater security

490
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:13,517
but also for those in supply
chains to see the look that

491
00:20:13,517 --> 00:20:15,610
and to assure that
their suppliers are also

492
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:17,610
maintaining a certain level of security.

493
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:21,240
Now while we see that
happening on democracies,

494
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,310
authoritarians are
taking a different angle

495
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:25,550
although using some of the
very similar terminology

496
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:27,629
under the auspices of
ensuring data protection,

497
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:29,870
ensuring data rights, what we're seeing

498
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:32,379
are new cybersecurity
and data protection laws

499
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:35,920
but they're actually aimed at enabling

500
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,210
the government to access the data

501
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:38,570
and have greater surveillance over it.

502
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,500
And the National Security Law on Hong Kong

503
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,650
is one good example.

504
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:44,090
And some of these others
I've already talked about

505
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:47,610
as far as the creating their
own internet attack in Cambodia

506
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:49,879
to Ecuador's new larger
surveillance system

507
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,460
and to Kazakhstan's digital certificate

508
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:56,100
on and off again require on
all computers within Kazakhstan

509
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,139
and it basically enables
man-in-the-middle attack

510
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,293
for access to data.

511
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:01,280
And then on top of all of that,

512
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,889
there's the range of internet disruptions

513
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:04,860
that are going on,
again under the auspices

514
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,919
of maintaining national security.

515
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,300
And so it's really different takes

516
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,740
on data protection and data security.

517
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:14,387
And it's really important to
see how those are diffusing

518
00:21:14,387 --> 00:21:16,120
'cause the reality is that the
digital authoritarian model

519
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,370
is spreading much faster
than those data protection

520
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:21,723
and security and privacy
requirements in the democracies.

521
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:27,480
So now I also wanna get into this notion

522
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,030
of major power competition,

523
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:30,780
for those of you in the
international security community

524
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:33,070
perhaps you hear a lot
about this move towards

525
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:36,030
major power competition, the
pivot to Asia has been going on

526
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:39,230
for several years now, and
while that's very important

527
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:40,510
and it's been something we've talked about

528
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:45,090
for the better course of this presentation

529
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:46,899
we can't have a hyper focus on China

530
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,080
and ignore some of the other instability,

531
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,470
especially when it comes
to supply chain resilience.

532
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:53,970
And so looking at how the
asymmetric nature of cyber

533
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:58,460
which means that minimal
resources and smaller states

534
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,360
can now have an outsized impact

535
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,409
thanks to the emerging
technologies in cybersecurity.

536
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:04,870
And we see that compared to the past

537
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:06,909
where power used to be measured on

538
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:08,560
things like military
spending and personnel

539
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,639
and iron and steel and
those things still matter

540
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,990
but the whole nature of warfare and global

541
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:17,540
and geopolitical power is really shifted

542
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,290
thanks to the asymmetric nature

543
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:21,200
of both emerging technologies in cyber.

544
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,040
And so I'd have to
provide a couple examples

545
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,690
to highlight how that's the case.

546
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,610
So first we won't spend a ton
of time on the usual suspects

547
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:29,050
and we hear about China
and then we normally hear

548
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:31,680
about Russia, Iran and North
Korea and that's great.

549
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,710
And absolutely they're
the ones that we're seeing

550
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:36,610
some of the bigger attacks
that are having global impact.

551
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:39,610
And what's important to
highlight in that is that

552
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:42,429
in general they are smaller,
they aren't the major powers

553
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:43,660
that we see in the globe

554
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,730
but they're having a very big impact

555
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:49,047
when it comes to various
range of cyber attacks

556
00:22:49,047 --> 00:22:51,480
and new found campaigns

557
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,613
and different kinds of
APTs linked to them.

558
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:55,940
What we're also seeing though

559
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:58,750
that doesn't get quite as much notice

560
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:01,070
and really is something that
we're seeing more and more

561
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:05,950
is how smaller states both
state and non-state are learning

562
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:09,290
from the other, from China,
Russia, Iran, North Korea

563
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:11,450
and implementing their own strategies.

564
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:13,210
And gonna be thinking about that

565
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:14,700
over 100 different countries now

566
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,220
have offensive cyber capabilities

567
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:18,050
and it's no wonder that
we're starting to see

568
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:19,870
a rise of the use of those capabilities

569
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:23,419
especially when it comes to
various kinds of conflicts

570
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,670
that are starting to
pop up around the globe.

571
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:30,199
When thinking about purely
more in the cyber domain

572
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,920
Vietnam has an APT associated with it.

573
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,740
So it's having an outside the
global impact of that way.

574
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:37,350
Lebanon had DarkCaracol linked to it

575
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:39,540
as far as the global
Android malware campaign.

576
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,460
And so we're seeing some
of the smaller countries

577
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,440
starting to pop up and
having a larger impact

578
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,353
or having linked to entities that do.

579
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,330
What we're also seeing, is
the emergence of hotspots

580
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:51,223
and really focused on
geographic conflicts.

581
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:56,080
Land was one of the biggest
causes of war historically,

582
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,429
and that's coming back again and we see it

583
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:00,670
in a couple different
areas that I'll highlight.

584
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:02,637
The first is Western Sahara and Morocco

585
00:24:02,637 --> 00:24:05,720
where the use of drones
has been identified

586
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,560
and playing a component.

587
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:10,580
And what sensibility also
matters though to supply chains

588
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,840
is it also blocked when the
biggest trading routes in,

589
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,550
at West Africa.

590
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:15,950
And so for each of these,
we're seeing sort of

591
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:17,571
the intersection of how
political instability

592
00:24:17,571 --> 00:24:22,070
comes and intersects with
the supply chain resilience.

593
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:23,590
And these are considerations
that we're starting to see

594
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:26,110
due to this degree of interdependencies,

595
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:28,459
a similar story in Armenian and Azerbaijan

596
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:31,680
where drones again, played
a role, interestingly,

597
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,520
as well as from the footage

598
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,160
being shown through social media.

599
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,560
And so you see get an emerging technology,

600
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,919
cyber coming into play,

601
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:41,110
but it also led to some really
concerns over insecurity

602
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:43,889
of the global energy market
due to some pipelines

603
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:45,823
that run through that area.

604
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:49,550
And then finally in the
Tigray region in Ethiopia,

605
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:52,780
again, we see some
drones starting to appear

606
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:55,280
and we also see supply chains,
especially in manufacturing

607
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,030
disruptive due to that instability.

608
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:59,909
And finally, we're gonna
see a lot more specifically

609
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:02,520
some of the cyber and emerging
technologies coming together

610
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:06,520
within an area is, in Myanmar
or Burma where we're seeing

611
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:09,090
the military coup, the leaders of the coup

612
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:11,590
the flying drones and as well as

613
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:13,800
phone a computer cracking software

614
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:17,450
to basically surveil the population.

615
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:19,980
And it also has had really
significant disruptions

616
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:23,180
especially to ports and to
large shipping containers

617
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:25,853
that depended on going through that area.

618
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:30,470
And so all of this altogether
leads to a range of risks

619
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:32,240
across the globe that
are really threatening

620
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,200
supply chain security and resilience.

621
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,840
And so when we think about
what this new normal is

622
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,169
we can't think that the
new normal is as it was

623
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:39,170
for the previous few decades.

624
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:42,550
We really need to prepare
for what is coming next.

625
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:45,169
And so I'd like to spend
the next 10 minutes or so

626
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:47,490
talking about how to build
the supply chain resilience

627
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:49,890
amongst these enormous
shifts that are underway.

628
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,600
Now, the first discussion
is, I really like this quote

629
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,610
because again the perimeter is dead

630
00:25:56,610 --> 00:25:59,449
is something that we hear
over and over and over again.

631
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:01,070
But oftentimes we think about that

632
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:02,570
just in the context of cloud security.

633
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:03,960
We don't really think
about it in the context

634
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,420
of thinking about our partners

635
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:07,470
as part of our network ecosystem

636
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:11,120
that we need to make sure
remain safe and secure.

637
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,080
And so this is a really good op-ed

638
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:16,350
that was from last year
that talks about how,

639
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:18,820
even greatest investments
in your own security

640
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:19,653
can easily undermine depending if

641
00:26:19,653 --> 00:26:21,340
one of your suppliers has weak incentives

642
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,723
for their own security.

643
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,389
Another rule of thumb to think about is

644
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:29,932
where you stand depends
on where your data sits.

645
00:26:29,932 --> 00:26:31,620
International relations,
we like to talk about

646
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:32,810
where you stand depends on where you sit.

647
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:36,409
So as far as your perspective on things,

648
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:38,000
same goes for where your data is.

649
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,680
If your data is in any of these locations,

650
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,660
that might be increasingly
the risk due to data storage

651
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:44,130
and data government
access laws or an areas

652
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:47,610
where the government has
growing cyber capabilities,

653
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:48,860
your data might be much more at risk.

654
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:51,010
And so as companies start thinking about

655
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:53,720
transforming their supply
chains they really need to think

656
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,130
about where their data
is and the security of it

657
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:58,463
really does depend on where
it is across the globe.

658
00:27:02,425 --> 00:27:03,629
And also, this is something
I've mentioned before

659
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:05,600
and I'm just gonna keep
on mentioning is that

660
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,189
as we prepare for this new
normal, which we'll keep hearing

661
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:10,490
over and over again, we
must avoid the tendency

662
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:13,440
to prepare for yesterday's
risks and disruptions.

663
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,590
Again we can learn from them,
there's a of lessons in there,

664
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:18,040
but we really need to overcome

665
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,399
this failure of collective imagination

666
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,020
and really focus on what
we can be doing better,

667
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,129
what we can be doing to prepare

668
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:26,170
for this whole range of
risks that are out there,

669
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:27,930
it's unprecedented in the scope,

670
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:29,860
assuming that everything's
going the same trajectory

671
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:32,830
as it was in 2019 is just,

672
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:34,780
as it's not the reality that
we're entering into right now.

673
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:36,139
And we really need to prepare

674
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:38,340
for these transformations
that are underway.

675
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:42,110
And so what to expect
in this new world order?

676
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:44,212
So there'll be challenges to be sure.

677
00:27:44,212 --> 00:27:49,212
I've talked a lot about them
and it's not too sugar coat it,

678
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:53,360
but they're in, or to weed
into so much of the flood

679
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,080
but there really are big
transformations underway

680
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:58,580
and it's gonna be important but not easy

681
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:00,030
to prepare for those transformations

682
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:01,340
and to be better prepared

683
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:04,080
to help build supply chain
resilience in that regard.

684
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,530
And so when we're thinking
about decoupling and reshoring

685
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:08,270
so that's moving away from areas

686
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,030
where you may have geographic
concentration risks.

687
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:12,600
It is expensive, and it's
gonna cost a lot of money

688
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,610
but we can keep in mind is

689
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:15,169
it doesn't have to be all or nothing.

690
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:17,290
And that's a really important component

691
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:19,649
that I think it often gets overlooked.

692
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:23,250
You can focus on what your
core competencies are,

693
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:27,630
what your most important IPs
that you need to protect,

694
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:29,210
what your most important resources are

695
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:30,960
and make sure those are
protected and in areas

696
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,180
that are much more resilient than others.

697
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:35,280
And you can still maintain
various other kinds

698
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,820
of trade flows in areas
that may be higher risk

699
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:41,470
but may not matter quite as
much to your bottom line.

700
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:43,963
Even knowing where your data is,

701
00:28:43,963 --> 00:28:46,350
and again, another problem.

702
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:48,449
It's easier said than done because

703
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:50,621
given the free flow of
information going across it,

704
00:28:50,621 --> 00:28:53,410
you really to think about
where you're storing your data,

705
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:54,330
who you're sharing it with

706
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:57,000
and think about your own
data sharing strategy

707
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,400
that both can, is shaped
to create greater security,

708
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,850
but also ensure that it's not going

709
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:04,253
beyond where it's necessary.

710
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,320
And keeping up with the regulations,

711
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,169
another thing that's
increasingly hard to do

712
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:11,450
as I showed when you got 350 companies

713
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:13,260
that are added to a list, the Entity List

714
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:16,183
over the last two years,
it's very hard to know,

715
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,950
to stay on top of that
and even on top of that,

716
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:21,800
it's even hard to know how many of those

717
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,629
are even within your
extended supply chain.

718
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:25,300
You may not have them in
your initial supply chain

719
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,930
but they may be their second, third,

720
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:28,410
fourth tier and so forth.

721
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:31,360
So gaining that visibility is
it you yet another challenge.

722
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,100
And finally mental
models are hard to shift

723
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,750
and this might seem like
you sort of the easiest one,

724
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:39,660
but again we hear time and time again that

725
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:40,720
we're just gonna return to normal,

726
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,850
that things going to be similar
to how they were before.

727
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:44,590
And this it's really not the reality.

728
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:47,290
And while 2020 was an inflection point,

729
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:49,850
a lot of these trends
were already well underway

730
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:50,760
it just accelerated them

731
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,570
and so we really need to
shift our mental model

732
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:54,129
and think about what this new world order

733
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:56,280
is gonna look like and
prepare accordingly.

734
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:00,070
Fortunately, there are also opportunities

735
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:03,179
and this is where I think I
would focus a lot of the effort.

736
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:05,160
It's important to maintain
security and awareness

737
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,110
of some of the challenges
really think about

738
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:09,179
how can we turn, make
these transformations

739
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:11,970
into something that's much
more so an opportunity.

740
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:13,860
One is a focus on trustworthy networks

741
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:16,340
both at the firm and
the nation-state level.

742
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:18,760
And by that thinking, that
can mean the whole gamut

743
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:21,370
from who you're partnering
with but also looking at

744
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:22,706
where your companies are as

745
00:30:22,707 --> 00:30:25,070
and then as well as thinking about,

746
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:26,129
how you can build trust

747
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:28,190
through various kinds of
technological innovation

748
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:29,970
and building trust through partnerships.

749
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:32,543
As you think about who's
within your supply chain,

750
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,310
I think resiliency is gonna
become a competitive advantage

751
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:39,230
as we undergo these transformations.

752
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:40,640
Those who wants to have
their head in the sand

753
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,800
and pretend that nothing has changed

754
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,830
and everything is just
the same as it was before

755
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:47,000
are gonna be in for surprise
over the next few years.

756
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,770
Those who are making
those preparations now

757
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:50,129
for the whole range of disruptions.

758
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:51,490
I think that's gonna pay
off for them down the road.

759
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:52,770
They'll be much better prepared

760
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:53,889
and it'll be something that they can take

761
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:56,363
as a competitive advantage
over their competitors.

762
00:30:57,559 --> 00:31:00,170
Again, I think we're stronger
when working together.

763
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:01,790
And starts with our collective security

764
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:03,100
and that's normally
something that you think

765
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,139
about in warfare, but also
something they can think

766
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:06,550
about in building up your
supply chain ecosystem,

767
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:08,659
how to strengthen that collective security

768
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:10,980
and finally leveraging
technology to help overcome you.

769
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:12,810
I talked about how opaque
and complex they are.

770
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:14,480
Technology can help
overcome those blind spots

771
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,840
and help you see exactly where
you are across the globe,

772
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,720
where your suppliers are
and some of the risks

773
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,270
and opportunities that
might emerge in those areas.

774
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:24,600
And so what can you do next?

775
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,050
So one, like I was just talking about

776
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:27,990
do you have that visibility?

777
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:28,823
Do you know the who and the what

778
00:31:28,823 --> 00:31:30,870
of your immediate supply chain network.

779
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:32,479
Once you know that beyond your first tier,

780
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,220
see if you can do that
beyond your second tier,

781
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,754
third tier and so forth.

782
00:31:35,754 --> 00:31:38,020
And if you don't know, who's
in your supply chain network

783
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,500
stop and have that be
your number one priority

784
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,650
and really start to figure out
what visibility you can gain

785
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:43,840
across your entire supply chain.

786
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,010
And then as well leverage technology

787
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:46,390
and leverage your partners
for information sharing,

788
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:47,833
to help get that visibility.

789
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:51,460
I would rethink how you
think about cyber risk.

790
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:52,830
Do you know where your data is?

791
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:54,330
Do you know where those insecure links are

792
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:55,659
that we talked about earlier?

793
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:56,870
And that means both in the physical world

794
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:58,639
and in a digital world,

795
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,170
and even to take it even a step further

796
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:04,120
to add to the complexity,
do you understand where

797
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:07,399
those risks are across the
globe at the firm level?

798
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,760
Do you know where you are
as far as your industry?

799
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,040
What some of the tech trends
are within your industry?

800
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,350
And then at the country
level, what are some

801
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:13,639
of the different kinds
of country level risks

802
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,530
that are out there?

803
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:16,700
And how do they vary and
how should those inform

804
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:19,380
how you transform your
supply chain going forward?

805
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:20,900
And so it's really important
to think about that both

806
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:23,130
for your immediate headquarters, but also

807
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:25,733
your expanded footprint and
your expanded supply chain.

808
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:29,260
And finally, I get,
again, don't look back,

809
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,710
really learn from the past,

810
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:32,000
but prepare for these transformations.

811
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,830
They are underway, that future is here

812
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:36,610
for quite some time while
we talked about borders

813
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:38,560
not necessarily existing on the internet,

814
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,580
they do and they're
coming front and center.

815
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:41,980
Geopolitics is coming into play.

816
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:43,657
We're seeing the
splintering of the internet

817
00:32:43,657 --> 00:32:45,090
but we're also seeing the splintering

818
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:47,110
in the balkanization of trade as well.

819
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:49,490
And so when we're seeing
those trends coming together

820
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:50,800
borders are mattering more than ever

821
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,149
and those can help you and inform you

822
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:53,610
on where you should be transforming

823
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:55,860
your own supply chain
for greater resilience.

824
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:59,780
And while most of this
has really focused on

825
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:01,010
looking at the various range of cyber

826
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:03,940
and technological risks
that are starting to emerge.

827
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,776
I didn't even address some
of the other supply chain

828
00:33:05,776 --> 00:33:07,530
disruptions that we've seen

829
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:09,879
and continue to see
increasingly, climate change

830
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,140
and the natural disasters,
the impact of the pandemic,

831
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:14,860
obviously in future pandemics
and then environmental social

832
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:15,990
and governance risks, which gets back

833
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:17,160
into some of the compliance concerns

834
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,570
where we are seeing
increasingly governments

835
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:21,303
are enacting various kinds of laws

836
00:33:21,304 --> 00:33:25,770
to help and promote various
kinds of ESG compliance.

837
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:28,060
And so it's a range of transformations

838
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:30,639
that are already underway.

839
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,310
And so, wanted to leave us with

840
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:34,200
is you have to take the thought of

841
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,250
whether we can either be shaped
by all these transformations

842
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:38,770
or help shape them.

843
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:40,720
And for me, I'm working
in international relations

844
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,850
and a strong proponent of democracy

845
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:44,560
and a free and open internet.

846
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,290
I hope we, as a community
can come together

847
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:48,500
and avoid that collective
failure of imagination

848
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,020
and help lead the way in re-imagining

849
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:52,460
how supply chain ways
can be more resilient

850
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:54,560
and be on par with some
great transformations,

851
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:57,470
great innovation, great
collaboration within the community

852
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:59,750
for all of us to help ensure
supply chain resilience

853
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:03,590
into the future, help
preserve the freedoms

854
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:05,500
and the innovation that help provide

855
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:08,860
the foundation to our way of life,

856
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:09,693
but use those in a way

857
00:34:09,693 --> 00:34:10,989
that also can support the bottom line.

858
00:34:10,989 --> 00:34:13,500
And so all this, they don't
have to be mutually exclusive.

859
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,889
And so that's where we can
go either shape the future

860
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:16,723
or be shaped by that.

861
00:34:16,723 --> 00:34:20,050
And so with that, I'd love
to open it up to questions

862
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:22,553
and look forward to hearing
from you, thank you.
