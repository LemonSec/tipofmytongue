1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:04,132
- Hi, I'm Adam Meyers and I'll be talking

2
00:00:04,132 --> 00:00:06,632
about "Ransomware Threat Landscape" today.

3
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:10,730
I've been at CrowdStrike
for almost 10 years now.

4
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:13,260
I helped launch the company way back when,

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:16,350
and prior to that, I spent
about 10 years working

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,640
in the defense industrial base

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,573
with a variety of civilian.
intelligence community,

8
00:00:20,573 --> 00:00:24,830
and military customers across
the U.S. Federal Government.

9
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:28,040
I spent a number of years
supporting the U.S. Department

10
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:31,060
of State and got to really kind of focus

11
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:34,600
on tracking threat
actors in that capacity.

12
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,500
And I run a team of

13
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,140
about 150 threat intel professionals

14
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,100
here at CrowdStrike who focus on tracking

15
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,561
various threat actors across the world.

16
00:00:42,561 --> 00:00:45,190
And in this presentation
we're gonna be talking a lot

17
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:46,180
about these threat actors

18
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:48,930
and how the ransomware
threat landscape has changed

19
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:50,133
over the last year.

20
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:54,095
When we first started
CrowdStrike back in 2011,

21
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:56,920
a lot of the companies
that were out there,

22
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,670
a lot of the predominant thinking was

23
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:01,540
that you needed to focus on malware.

24
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:04,319
You needed to focus on those
threats that were existing

25
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,639
all over the world, and
that were most prevalent

26
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:11,700
in the various environments
that were being monitored.

27
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,540
And as we were launching the company,

28
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,412
we had this kind of realization

29
00:01:15,412 --> 00:01:18,330
that it's not really about the malware,

30
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:19,490
it's about the threat actor,

31
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:22,500
because they're trying
to accomplish some goal.

32
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,490
And back in 2010, the name of the game

33
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:26,800
and security was really to focus

34
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,500
on the most prevalent
threats and to really go

35
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,040
after the things that are gonna be found

36
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,280
in the most environments using
signature-based detection.

37
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,540
We realized that those smaller incidents,

38
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,160
the ones that weren't very prevalent,

39
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:43,000
the unique aspects of these
attacks were the things

40
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,370
that really made them interesting

41
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:48,180
and were the most expensive
for potential customers,

42
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,710
most expensive for
organizations that are trying

43
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,899
to conduct business and to operate.

44
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,980
And by focusing on those events

45
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,800
and those types of threat actors

46
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,800
then we could better protect
businesses and enterprise.

47
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,417
And when we launched, we had this saying,

48
00:02:02,417 --> 00:02:04,100
"That you don't have a malware problem,

49
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,070
you have an adversary problem."

50
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:10,419
And today we track over 154
adversaries across the world

51
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:13,619
who are engaged in a variety
of different activities.

52
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,480
And our belief is that by understanding

53
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,959
who these threat actors are,

54
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,960
how they operate, and what thereafter,

55
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,260
you're gonna be in a better position

56
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,329
to defend your enterprise,

57
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:24,030
defend your environment from them.

58
00:02:24,992 --> 00:02:28,760
So we look at threat
actor motivation as a way

59
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:32,489
to kind of characterize or
categorize the various threats.

60
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:34,640
Ultimately we'd love to be
able to get to the point

61
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,920
where we understand exactly
who's behind this activity,

62
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,073
what military unit or
geo location they're in,

63
00:02:42,074 --> 00:02:45,640
or what their name is, but
that's not always possible.

64
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:50,040
And so for us, we begin all
analysis and investigation

65
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,170
by looking at the motive, what
is the threat actor after?

66
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:54,470
What is their behavior?

67
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:57,752
And by categorizing them using that model,

68
00:02:57,752 --> 00:02:59,600
then we're in a understanding

69
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,350
of kind of what we're dealing with.

70
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,970
So the first categorization
that we look at is nation state.

71
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:08,200
This is associated with a government

72
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,410
who's conducting
offensive cyber operations

73
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:12,329
for one reason or another.

74
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:14,550
Generally this would involve espionage,

75
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:18,877
it could be sabotage, a
disruptive or destructive attack.

76
00:03:18,877 --> 00:03:21,592
And in some cases we're
increasingly seeing them engage

77
00:03:21,592 --> 00:03:24,970
in even eCrime or
financially motivated attack,

78
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:26,700
North Korea, Iran.

79
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,600
Those that have been dealing
with increasing sanctions

80
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,680
and financial difficulties as
a result of what's going on

81
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,850
have turned to eCrime to
generate additional revenue,

82
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:40,180
either authorized in
the case of North Korea,

83
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,763
or unauthorized in the
case of other countries.

84
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,230
The second category
that we track is eCrime.

85
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:49,670
This is financially motivated activity.

86
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:53,040
Years ago this was almost
entirely tracked under things

87
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,566
like banking Trojans that were
trying to steal credentials,

88
00:03:55,566 --> 00:03:59,893
get access to information and
monetize that in some way.

89
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:02,450
Increasingly over the
last two or three years,

90
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,310
this has almost exclusively been driven

91
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,420
by ransomware activity.

92
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,530
And we're seeing even some

93
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:08,810
of those traditional threat actors

94
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:12,990
who were engaged in bank
fraud and account takeovers

95
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:15,130
are actually moving into ransomware

96
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:18,190
because it has become
so much more profitable.

97
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:21,810
And in addition to that
over the last 18 months

98
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:24,270
or so we've seen that more
of these threat actors

99
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:26,233
are engaging in further extortion

100
00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:29,160
by stealing information and
threatening to disclose it

101
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,920
if their demands are not
met or they're not paid.

102
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,403
And so they're looking to
increase the cost to the victim.

103
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:39,070
And the final category that
we look at is something

104
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,260
that we call hacktivism.

105
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,560
This is a kind of catch all

106
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,450
for all activity that doesn't fit

107
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,979
into eCrime or nation state.

108
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:49,520
This is activism, nationalism,
terrorism, hacktivism,

109
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,810
generally related to things
that are politically motivated

110
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:55,272
or it could be anything
ranging from anti-capitalism

111
00:04:55,272 --> 00:04:59,900
to things here in the U.S. for example,

112
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,736
defunding the police, et cetera.

113
00:05:01,736 --> 00:05:05,380
Even animal rights and animal
testing have been factors

114
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,640
that have been used by hacktivists actors

115
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,330
to conduct distributed
malware service attacks

116
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:13,760
or disruptive attacks
like website defacement

117
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:17,263
in order to bring attention to
a particular political issue.

118
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:21,600
Once we are looking at
something and we kind of fit it

119
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,500
into one of these buckets or categories,

120
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,041
then we have the ability to
start talking a little bit more

121
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:28,185
about who the threat actor is

122
00:05:28,185 --> 00:05:30,510
and what they're interested in.

123
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:34,539
At CrowdStrike we track threat
actors' encrypting model.

124
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:37,590
We have two names that
will typically be assigned

125
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:38,859
to a threat factor.

126
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,420
So in the case of all criminal actors,

127
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,900
it's something spider.

128
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,609
If you're familiar with TrackBot

129
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:46,664
that would be Wizard Spider or Dridex

130
00:05:46,664 --> 00:05:49,909
and Bitpaymer are all
tracked under Index Spider,

131
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:52,960
who as a result of the U.S.
Department of Justice indictment

132
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,010
we have a lot of visibility

133
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:56,830
into the actual individuals behind that.

134
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,760
There's an individual
named Maksim Yakubets

135
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,010
who has been famously photographed driving

136
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:04,420
fancy cars around Moscow.

137
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,870
And he's associated with this group

138
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:08,040
which is also known as Evil Corp.

139
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,923
So all of these different
criminal actors are engaged

140
00:06:10,923 --> 00:06:15,260
in some form of financially
motivated activity.

141
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,710
Chinese threat actors
we track under Panda.

142
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,702
This is associated with
the attorneys nation state

143
00:06:20,702 --> 00:06:22,360
with a nexus to China,

144
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,680
whether that be a military organization,

145
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,970
intelligence organization, or a contract

146
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,970
or working at the behest of the country.

147
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:32,872
Iran we track as Kitten.

148
00:06:32,872 --> 00:06:36,069
North Korea we track as Chollima.

149
00:06:36,069 --> 00:06:38,313
Russia we track as Bear.

150
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:43,470
India, Pakistan is Tiger
and Leopard respectively.

151
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,070
Activist, hacktivist, nationalists,

152
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:47,270
and terrorist groups we track as Jackal.

153
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,969
And there's been some newer entrance

154
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:52,050
on the offensive cyber operations side

155
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:54,060
from a nation state perspective.

156
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:57,228
Vietnam who we've tracked for
some time now has been engaged

157
00:06:57,228 --> 00:07:01,452
in increasing activity that is
of interest to organizations

158
00:07:01,452 --> 00:07:04,240
who are in automotive healthcare.

159
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,040
And also South Korea
has observed conducting

160
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,083
intrusions as well.

161
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,130
All of these threats that you see here,

162
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:15,600
there's 154 so that we actively track.

163
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,380
And then we also have what
we call activity clusters.

164
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:22,590
So we don't necessarily
know enough to attribute it

165
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:25,659
to a specific nation state
or a particular adversary,

166
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:28,010
but we'll track it as an activity cluster,

167
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:30,520
which is kind of like a
temporary holding space

168
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,000
as we're trying to sort
out all of the details

169
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,810
of is this nation state, and if so,

170
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:36,793
which nation is it?

171
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,099
Now 154 threat actors might seem

172
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,410
like a pretty instrumentable
thing to be tracking,

173
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:45,150
to be worried about to
protect your enterprise.

174
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:47,150
But the good news is that not all

175
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:49,239
of those threat actors
are necessarily coming

176
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,670
after your organization, your enterprise.

177
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:53,600
If you understand what
geographic locations

178
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,700
you are concerned about,

179
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,969
what business verticals
you're concerned about,

180
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:59,240
then you can look at the
activity that's tracked

181
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,892
by these threat actors and
understand their capabilities,

182
00:08:01,892 --> 00:08:05,240
what they can do, and their intentions,

183
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,760
what they want to do.

184
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,710
And so, as we populate this chart,

185
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:11,210
looking at generally kind
of threat actor activity

186
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:13,640
against the West, particularly
the United States,

187
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,020
you can see that there's
pretty good sampling

188
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,620
of different capabilities and intentions.

189
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:22,910
Where these things change
and move depends on

190
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,630
what business vertical
or geolocation you're

191
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,022
specifically looking at.

192
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:29,340
In general from a Western
perspective the three

193
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:32,329
most prevalent threats that
we see are North Korea,

194
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:33,743
China and Russia.

195
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,782
Iran used to for example be much lower

196
00:08:38,782 --> 00:08:40,309
in terms of intentions,

197
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:41,929
their capabilities haven't changed much,

198
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:44,169
they've always been pretty
much in the same spot.

199
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:47,439
But because of the joint
comprehensive plan of action

200
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,520
the nuclear deal, they were lower in terms

201
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,250
of their intentions of targeting the West.

202
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:54,780
They were more focused on
regional targeting of things

203
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:57,720
like Saudi Arabia and
the United Arab Emirates.

204
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:02,100
But as a result of escalating
tensions, we had the breakup

205
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,860
of the joint comprehensive plan of action.

206
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:07,560
We have the Tanker Wars
in the summer of 2019

207
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,770
in the Strait of Hormuz.

208
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:11,670
And we have this increase of tension

209
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:13,140
between the two countries.

210
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:16,030
Iran's intentions to target the West go up

211
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:18,270
and really culminates in January of 2020

212
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:21,050
with the killing of
General Qassem Soleimani.

213
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:24,050
And as the threat landscape changes,

214
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:27,063
we see Iran moving up and up
and up in terms of intentions.

215
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,819
And so you always have to be
reevaluating these threats

216
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,630
and understanding how they're changing

217
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:35,890
and how you're changing
and what that will do

218
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:37,133
in terms of the threat.

219
00:09:38,481 --> 00:09:41,439
Now, it's interesting
to note that almost all

220
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,324
of these threat actors in the
course of 2020 used COVID-19

221
00:09:44,324 --> 00:09:46,729
in their thermology in their attacks.

222
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:48,320
They used it for their gores.

223
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,360
They used it for file names,

224
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,120
and they even targeted
data related to COVID-19.

225
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,060
So, as we are coming out of the grips

226
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:58,329
of this global pandemic, you can see

227
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:01,627
that this has really
created a lot of activity

228
00:10:01,627 --> 00:10:04,479
and a lot of opportunity
for these threat actors

229
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,530
to increase the success
of their targeting,

230
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:09,063
which is some of the things
we're gonna look at here.

231
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:14,140
So in 2020 ransomware operations
for most organizations

232
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:16,963
became the most disruptive
threat that we were tracking.

233
00:10:18,246 --> 00:10:20,170
And it's important to understand

234
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:23,630
that ransomware is part
of a broader ecosystem.

235
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:25,680
There's this global ecosystem,

236
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,453
an underground economy if you will,

237
00:10:27,453 --> 00:10:30,380
that is kind of feeding off of each other.

238
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,616
And there's different pieces
of this underground economy

239
00:10:32,616 --> 00:10:35,580
that will focus on different areas

240
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,240
or specialize in different things,

241
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:41,023
all meant to generate
revenue for the operators.

242
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,100
So if you look at the breakdown

243
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,470
we have service oriented aspects

244
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:46,850
of this underground economy.

245
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:48,000
You have access brokers.

246
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,720
Access brokers are a tremendous utility

247
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,215
for ransomware actors who want
to find interesting targets

248
00:10:55,215 --> 00:10:57,100
and start off with access.

249
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,840
So an access broker will
use vulnerabilities,

250
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,956
they'll hack in, and then
they'll sell that access

251
00:11:01,956 --> 00:11:03,640
to the highest bidder.

252
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,340
And ransomware actors will
use this to figure out

253
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:10,050
or identify organizations that
they're most interested in

254
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:12,810
and then buy access and
start their operation.

255
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:15,520
We also have lots of different elements

256
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,569
of the underground economy.

257
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:19,760
There's things like DDoS
tools that are sold,

258
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,930
ransomware-as-a-service,

259
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,799
so you can actually buy the malware.

260
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:26,480
And now we're packing services,
website injection kits,

261
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,020
spam networks, all of these
different services help

262
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:33,220
kind of threat actors
continue their operations.

263
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,530
And in terms of distribution,

264
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:36,569
how do you get your ransomware?

265
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:37,800
How do you get your malware out there?

266
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,229
There's a whole set of actors
that focus on distribution.

267
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:42,870
They do social networks spam.

268
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,460
They do email spam.

269
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,730
They're building exploit
kits and operating them.

270
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:49,850
They're selling installs
to the highest bidder.

271
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:52,540
And then finally, there's
the monetization side.

272
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:55,480
So you have money mules that are helping

273
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:59,170
to move money around
for the threat actors.

274
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:02,219
You have ransom payment
extortion services.

275
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,770
You've got money laundering.

276
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:06,040
There's lots of ways that
threat actors can leverage

277
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,250
different things to
monetize what they're doing.

278
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,830
And all of these things
need services, distribution,

279
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:14,010
and monetization make up
the underground economy

280
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:14,843
which we spent a lot of time thinking

281
00:12:14,843 --> 00:12:16,723
about here at CrowdStrike.

282
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:23,270
So, as we think about what
ransomware actors are using

283
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:25,319
for initial access, there's
really a couple of things

284
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,153
that they focus on.

285
00:12:26,153 --> 00:12:28,540
The first is banking Trojans.

286
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,770
A lot of the threat actors
that we're tracking today

287
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:34,130
that are prevalent in the
ransomware space have pivoted.

288
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:35,908
They've moved from conducting bank fraud

289
00:12:35,908 --> 00:12:39,080
into now conducting ransomware attacks.

290
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,920
Dridex is a good example as is ChickBot.

291
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,809
Two very well known banking
Trojans that were engaged

292
00:12:45,809 --> 00:12:49,280
in a lot of account credential theft,

293
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:52,510
injecting into browsers
to steal credentials

294
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:54,800
for banking and credit cards and such.

295
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,819
And they realized that there
was a lot more money to be made

296
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,802
on the ransomware several years ago.

297
00:12:59,802 --> 00:13:03,440
And so they've pivoted and
they use their banking Trojans,

298
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,330
which are widely distributed
in many environments today,

299
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:08,740
and use that as the initial foothold.

300
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,341
And once they have that initial foothold,

301
00:13:10,341 --> 00:13:13,810
they can escalate
privilege, move laterally,

302
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:16,760
and deploy ransomware, steal files,

303
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,510
and conduct an attack
where they can get paid

304
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:22,753
tens of millions of dollars,
just for one intrusion.

305
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:26,670
The other thing that we
have is distribution actors.

306
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:29,074
So we have Mallard
Spider and Mummy Spider.

307
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:32,101
Mummy Spider are famous and
are tied to the Emotet botnet,

308
00:13:32,101 --> 00:13:34,420
which is used for spam.

309
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:37,270
And so what they actually
do is they distribute

310
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:41,010
their malware, and once they
have their malware planted

311
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:43,407
on the system through spam,
then they'll sell access

312
00:13:43,407 --> 00:13:45,230
to these other eCrime actors

313
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:46,670
who wanna conduct ransomware attacks.

314
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:50,050
So they'll buy access from
Mummy Spider, they're on.

315
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:53,709
They can deploy their tools
and carry out their operation.

316
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:55,326
Access brokers which I mentioned earlier.

317
00:13:55,326 --> 00:13:58,670
Mallard Spider is one, but
there's a lot of info stealers

318
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,630
that are used to steal
information that could be used

319
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:01,930
by these threat actors.

320
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:03,689
And also they'll sell access.

321
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:06,880
If they find a remotely
exploitable service

322
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,810
and they break in, or they get in

323
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:10,055
through some other campaign,

324
00:14:10,055 --> 00:14:12,939
they'll actually sell
that access in a forum.

325
00:14:12,939 --> 00:14:15,969
And when the criminal actor
is browsing the forum,

326
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:17,180
they find a target of interest,

327
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:19,757
they buy the access and
they're off and running.

328
00:14:19,757 --> 00:14:23,689
And the last piece here is that
exploitable remote services

329
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:25,490
have been very prevalent this year.

330
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,700
We've seen a tremendous amount of exploits

331
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:31,520
for various VPN appliances and software.

332
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:35,439
We've seen a lot of misuse of RDP

333
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,200
which potentially was deployed as a result

334
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,950
of organizations trying to
rapidly adopt a digital strategy

335
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:43,680
in the wake of COVID.

336
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,880
And recently we've seen

337
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,830
the Microsoft exchange vulnerabilities,

338
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:50,480
which have been of great use

339
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,683
for a lot of these remote
exploitation attacks.

340
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:01,640
So once these threat actors get in,

341
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,370
whether it be through an access broker,

342
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:07,200
a bank Trojan, or some other service,

343
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,550
they're typically living off the land.

344
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:11,530
By living off the land
they're using things

345
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:13,370
like RDP to hop between hosts.

346
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:16,240
They're using CobaltStrike
or Windows utilities

347
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,550
that are present on the system,

348
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:20,349
or systems internals tools
that might be present

349
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:24,120
or at least look like legitimate
administrator activity.

350
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,940
And then they'll do
exfiltration using things

351
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:29,783
like Mega and Rclone
in order to steal files

352
00:15:29,783 --> 00:15:33,550
that they'll then further
leak on a dedicated weak site

353
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:36,453
in order to monetize that data as well.

354
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,010
And so a lot of the
tools that they're using

355
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:43,380
aren't necessarily going
to trigger a lot of alerts

356
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,840
in your environment or things

357
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,740
that people might look too closely at.

358
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:51,280
If you take a look at
how COVID-19 affected

359
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:55,260
the eCrime ecosystem, you
could take a sense here

360
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,740
that there has been a
pretty massive spike.

361
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,840
So January, February
is we're first learning

362
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,600
about this novel coronavirus.

363
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,200
There's not too much activity though.

364
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,010
It starts to go up in February,

365
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:07,709
but by March we see a 100-fold
increase in the number

366
00:16:07,709 --> 00:16:11,241
of files that had COVID-19
or coronavirus in it,

367
00:16:11,241 --> 00:16:14,660
or emails or links that we were tracking.

368
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:18,709
So threat actors really in
the course of the last year

369
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:22,371
have utilized COVID-19
coronavirus to their advantage

370
00:16:22,371 --> 00:16:26,060
to supercharge their
attacks and to get victims

371
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,910
to click on files and to click on links

372
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:29,853
in order to enable their activity.

373
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:37,055
So the most active data leak sites,

374
00:16:37,056 --> 00:16:42,056
as we're tracking these criminal
actors and their activity,

375
00:16:42,509 --> 00:16:46,200
they are creating these
dedicated leak sites

376
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:50,260
and they'll put little pieces of 10, 15%

377
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,020
of the stolen information on this website

378
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,780
to demonstrate almost
like a proof of life.

379
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:56,220
That yes, we've compromised this victim.

380
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:59,640
We have this data and
we're gonna leak more of it

381
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,720
if we don't get paid.

382
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,140
And we see this time and time again.

383
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:05,318
And the most prevalent,

384
00:17:05,318 --> 00:17:06,930
the three most prevalent threat actors

385
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:08,880
that are engaged in this, Twisted Spider,

386
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,427
which is known for maze
or Egregor ransomware.

387
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,170
Wizard Spider, which has been using Conti.

388
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:18,640
So they have different tools that they use

389
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,530
in different scenarios.

390
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:22,230
Wizard Spider uses Ryuk very heavily

391
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:24,060
for ransomware attacks,

392
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:27,359
but we have never seen Ryuk get
used for a data leak attack.

393
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,850
We've only seen it for
pure ransomware attacks.

394
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:31,139
When there's a data leak attack,

395
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:34,000
typically they're using
something like Conti.

396
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,820
And then Pinchy Spider with REvil,

397
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,270
which was previously associated

398
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:41,030
with the GandCrab ransomware-as-a-service.

399
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:44,780
And so another interesting
point to understand here is

400
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:47,000
that some of these threat
actors, Twisted Spider,

401
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,297
Pinchy Spider use more
ransomware-as-a-service,

402
00:17:50,297 --> 00:17:51,895
but with ransomware-as-a-service,

403
00:17:51,895 --> 00:17:54,503
they're effectively
building the ransomware

404
00:17:54,503 --> 00:17:57,389
and they'll build the platform.

405
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:59,640
So you take the ransomware, you deploy it

406
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,880
into the victim environment.

407
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,260
And when they pay through the platform,

408
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,126
the victim pays through the platform.

409
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:09,940
The operator of that service
takes some percentage,

410
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,400
it's a revenue share model.

411
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,870
And so they'll take some
percentage of that payment

412
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:18,360
as payment for what they're
providing in terms of service.

413
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,969
So that is one model by which

414
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:21,440
these ransomware actors operate.

415
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,900
The second model is that they're running

416
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,530
the operation entirely themselves.

417
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:28,290
So they'll buy access,
they'll deploy their tools,

418
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:30,100
they'll conduct a ransom negotiation

419
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,862
and then they take all
100% of the profits.

420
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,389
The most targeted sectors
over the last year

421
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:41,020
that we've observed are really
industrials in engineering,

422
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:44,340
manufacturing and technology,
and probably state

423
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,030
and local government and
healthcare would come

424
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:48,197
just on the heels of that.

425
00:18:48,198 --> 00:18:52,454
This is an interesting set of targets.

426
00:18:52,454 --> 00:18:55,453
One of the reasons that we
believe that this is occurring is

427
00:18:55,453 --> 00:18:58,290
that ransomware actors
look for organizations

428
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:00,090
that have to be up and running,

429
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:02,850
what I would call an
operational imperative.

430
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:05,449
And if they need to be up and running,

431
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:07,951
at some point there's gonna
be a discussion about,

432
00:19:07,951 --> 00:19:11,660
is it cheaper or is it more beneficial

433
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,630
to just pay the ransom amount

434
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:16,210
then to try to restore from backup

435
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:18,660
or try to figure out
some way around paying.

436
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,800
And organizations like
industrials and engineering,

437
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,889
manufacturing, technology companies,

438
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:24,610
there's downtime associated with this.

439
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:26,510
And for every minute of downtime,

440
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:28,480
there's an associated loss.

441
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,320
And what the ransomware actor,
the threat actor is hoping is

442
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,730
that they can hit that sweet
spot where there's more money

443
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:38,130
being lost than they're asking for,

444
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:40,713
and so organizations are
going to just pay them.

445
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:47,090
As we look at the threat
actors that were able

446
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:50,820
to really kind of use COVID-19 as a driver

447
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:51,890
for what they're doing,

448
00:19:51,891 --> 00:19:53,480
there's three that come to mind,

449
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,396
Traveling Spider, which is
known for their Nemty malware

450
00:19:56,396 --> 00:19:59,810
and they were using email subjects

451
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:02,240
to get organizations
to open up attachments,

452
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,200
click on links such as,
general meeting for coronavirus

453
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,890
or impersonating healthcare organizations

454
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:11,685
when they're targeting different
organizations or entities

455
00:20:11,685 --> 00:20:14,210
in order to get their tools deployed

456
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:16,150
so they can conduct a ransom attack.

457
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:17,700
And they heavily targeted government

458
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:20,440
and healthcare sectors over the last year.

459
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:24,180
Circus Spider is the second
one and they've compromised

460
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:27,378
at least one U.S. local
public health district site.

461
00:20:27,378 --> 00:20:31,210
They also reported, "We
had compromised a number

462
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:34,540
of hospitals in Europe
with COVID themed emails,"

463
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:37,460
and they're known for
their Netwalker malware

464
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:39,420
which goes by many different names.

465
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:42,796
And then thirdly is Graceful Spider.

466
00:20:42,796 --> 00:20:45,688
And they're best known
for their GetAndGo Loader,

467
00:20:45,688 --> 00:20:48,430
which is a macro document

468
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:50,860
and they were using COVID-19 words

469
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,226
to get organizations to
open up the attachment,

470
00:20:54,226 --> 00:20:58,660
enable the Macro and let things get going.

471
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:00,430
And they typically were using spam

472
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:02,970
to distribute these documents and focusing

473
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:05,770
on the pharmaceutical
sector over the last year.

474
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:08,080
And they're one of the ones
that were most prevalent

475
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,811
in the leak space, where they're
using their Clop leaks site

476
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:15,807
in order to generate fear

477
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:19,400
and get these organizations to pay.

478
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,390
And they claimed that they
were not targeting healthcare,

479
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:24,863
but they continue to target healthcare.

480
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:29,030
So when we think about ransomware

481
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:31,090
and why this is such a prevalent threat,

482
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:34,740
it kind of begs the question
of, how did we get here?

483
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:37,326
And so as a brief history of ransomware

484
00:21:37,326 --> 00:21:39,000
I think we can roll back.

485
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,390
Now, ransomware has been around

486
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:42,800
for a lot longer than this time period.

487
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,720
In fact, I think the first
piece that I can find

488
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,140
of ransomware leads back to the late 80s.

489
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:51,128
But if we wanna talk about
the modern era of ransomware,

490
00:21:51,128 --> 00:21:54,431
it really goes back to
CryptoWall, CryptoLocker,

491
00:21:54,431 --> 00:21:56,240
2014 timeframe.

492
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,970
In fact, you can see here one
of the earlier ransoms demands

493
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:01,480
that we looked at,

494
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,810
and in this case they're looking for $500.

495
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:06,770
And if you didn't pay in
a certain period of time

496
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:08,030
they would double the amount of money.

497
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:11,250
If you wanted to pay them,
it would go up to a 1,000,

498
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:12,900
and they asked you to pay them

499
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,310
in cryptocurrency and so forth.

500
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:16,950
And this targeted individuals.

501
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:18,880
So this would get onto your computer

502
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,340
and mom and dad's computer,
whoever's computer it might be,

503
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,860
and it would lock the system up.

504
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,110
It would encrypt the files.

505
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:28,790
And in order to unlock the
system, decrypt your files,

506
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:29,980
you had to pay them.

507
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:32,410
And I think that they
realized pretty quickly

508
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:35,440
that this was very expensive
for them to operate,

509
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,060
dealing with individuals,
getting them to understand

510
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,087
how to use cryptocurrency

511
00:22:39,087 --> 00:22:42,870
and how to use tour to get
onto the payment portals was

512
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:45,610
absolutely an expensive proposition

513
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:47,320
and they had to do it
in multiple languages.

514
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:50,409
They were effectively running
an international help desk

515
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,483
in order to do this.

516
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,850
By 2016 we were kind of calling
it the year of ransomware

517
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:58,290
in terms of individuals.

518
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:02,950
And I was even asked to testify
before the Senate judiciary

519
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:05,440
as it pertains to ransomware

520
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,127
and why we were seeing this ransomware

521
00:23:07,127 --> 00:23:08,800
and what could be done about it.

522
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,810
And there was something
that was in the testimony

523
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:13,807
that I wanna call out,
which was that we said,

524
00:23:13,807 --> 00:23:16,170
"The threat actors have likely taken note

525
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:18,430
that victims such as
hospitals have paid ransoms

526
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:19,945
in the tens of thousands of dollars

527
00:23:19,945 --> 00:23:22,169
in order to recover their data,

528
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:24,250
prompting them to look for victims

529
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:26,930
who provide critical services to target."

530
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:29,520
As I said before, they're
looking for critical services.

531
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,920
They're looking for things

532
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,147
that have an operating imperative.

533
00:23:33,147 --> 00:23:37,310
And at least one actor
at that time we call that

534
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:40,929
had begun conducting
targeted ransomware attacks,

535
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:44,080
which is what we today
call big game hunting

536
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,330
or enterprise ransomware.

537
00:23:46,527 --> 00:23:49,024
After this testimony about a year later,

538
00:23:49,024 --> 00:23:54,024
the NHS in the UK gets hit by ransomware,

539
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:58,096
and this is massively disruptive.

540
00:23:58,096 --> 00:24:03,096
And this was something that
locked up their systems,

541
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:07,320
was a huge attention getter the fact

542
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,750
that there was a national
health service that was hit

543
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,780
by this ransom activity.

544
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:16,010
And this brought a lot of attention

545
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:19,780
to the NHS and to ransomware as a threat.

546
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:22,950
And just two months later
they get hit a second time.

547
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:26,800
So the initial ransom attack that hit them

548
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,570
was the WannaCry attack,

549
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:31,010
which was associated with North Korea.

550
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:34,770
Two months later the
same victim is attacked

551
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:39,002
by Indirect Spider using
Dridex and BitPaymer.

552
00:24:39,002 --> 00:24:40,899
BitPaymer is a custom locker used

553
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,780
by the Indirect Spider
actor, which has been used

554
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,020
for many years now.

555
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:47,340
2017 was one of the first instances

556
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:50,409
of that being used and
really brought attention

557
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:52,130
to the fact that ransomware had gone

558
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:56,003
from targeting individuals
to targeting enterprises.

559
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,540
As we look at the
ransomware payment in 2019,

560
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,780
you can see that it started off,

561
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,840
going from tens of thousands

562
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,370
to hundreds of thousands of dollars.

563
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:11,030
And by 2019, we start to routinely
see millions and millions

564
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:12,637
of dollars in ransom demands.

565
00:25:12,637 --> 00:25:16,383
The million dollars for
Maze, 2.3 for DoppelPaymer,

566
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:19,740
Ryuk asking for 12.5.

567
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,890
And this is consistent now,

568
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:24,900
in fact, we see tens
of millions of dollars

569
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:29,480
in ransom demands, 30, 40,
50, $60 million not uncommon

570
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:33,520
in ransom demands anymore,
and organizations are paying.

571
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,420
And as a result, these threat
actors are further emboldened

572
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:38,083
and they're conducting
more and more intrusions

573
00:25:38,083 --> 00:25:40,203
in order to generate more revenue.

574
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:44,590
In fact, in September of 2020

575
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:48,580
we observed one ransom
demand for $1.4 billion,

576
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:52,040
which was certainly the
highest ransom demand

577
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:55,200
we've ever seen, and since we
haven't really seen anything

578
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,990
that high, but it gives you a sense

579
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:59,580
of the fact that these
threat actors really think

580
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:02,560
that they can get away with
charging millions of millions

581
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,510
of dollars day in and day out
in order to generate revenue.

582
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:09,840
So where's this going?

583
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,870
What do we think is next on the agenda

584
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:13,110
with these ransom actors?

585
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:15,120
Well, one of the things
that we've observed

586
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,610
and we've walked a little bit about is

587
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:18,669
that we've seen this
threat actors diversifying

588
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:19,503
what they're targeting.

589
00:26:19,503 --> 00:26:22,669
They're not just targeting
workstations or servers anymore,

590
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:25,390
they're aware of the fact
that a lot of organizations

591
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:30,220
are using encrypted desks or using ESXi

592
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:34,730
or virtual machines in order
to optimize their data centers.

593
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:38,530
And so these threat
actors have begun looking

594
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:43,530
at the virtual machine environments
that they're landing in

595
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:46,961
and figuring out ways to shut
down those virtual machines

596
00:26:46,961 --> 00:26:49,440
and then encrypt the virtual desk

597
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,090
so that you need to decrypt it in order

598
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:54,870
to recover even your infrastructure.

599
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:56,439
Sprite Spider is one of the actors

600
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:59,310
that has been most
associated with this so far,

601
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:01,480
but this is something that's
going to continue to evolve

602
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,980
and we expect them to continue
targeting Linux as well.

603
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:06,580
We've seen more and more
spread actors targeting Linux,

604
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:08,159
looking at container environments

605
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,790
and understanding how to target workloads.

606
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:13,870
Beyond just the actual
computer they're looking at,

607
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:16,314
what is the computer running
and how can they disrupt

608
00:27:16,315 --> 00:27:19,350
and most maximize the
pain that they're causing

609
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:21,449
in order to generate higher ransom demand?

610
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:27,070
So there's five things that
we tell customers to do

611
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:30,201
in order to mitigate
advanced ransomware attacks.

612
00:27:30,201 --> 00:27:33,070
The first one is easier said than done.

613
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:34,159
And we've been talking about this

614
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,620
for the last 20 years in security,

615
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,889
which is secure the enterprise.

616
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:40,380
By this I mean using things like principle

617
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:42,240
of least privilege,
making sure that you have

618
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,850
vulnerability management in place,

619
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:48,656
that you're patching in
predictable and informed ways,

620
00:27:48,656 --> 00:27:52,710
that you have all of these security layers

621
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:55,640
and defense and depth
inside of your enterprise

622
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,120
that will make it a harder target.

623
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:01,649
And for this again many organizations

624
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:02,990
are still struggling to get there.

625
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:05,030
So this is probably the number one thing

626
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:08,149
that organizations can do,
and it's not really something

627
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:09,503
that's gonna cost them a lot of money,

628
00:28:09,503 --> 00:28:12,570
it's just the lot of time
and effort to get there.

629
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:15,010
The second thing that we
tell organizations is,

630
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:17,920
prepare to prevent, and
CrowdStrike's been talking

631
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,660
about something that we call
the 1-10-60 rule, which is,

632
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:25,170
you have about a minute to
identify a threat or an activity

633
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:28,628
in your enterprise, about 10
minutes to investigate it,

634
00:28:28,628 --> 00:28:30,909
and about an hour to remediate it.

635
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:33,100
And if you fit into that cadence,

636
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:35,290
if you're able to kind of meet that goal,

637
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:36,830
then you're gonna be in a better position

638
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:37,929
to stop these threat actors

639
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:40,880
from moving across the enterprise
and escalating privilege

640
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,930
and deploying ransomware
against the environment.

641
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:46,562
And while that sounds like
some pretty crazy numbers,

642
00:28:46,562 --> 00:28:51,562
with things like EDR and threat hunting,

643
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:53,720
this is something that
they can strive for.

644
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,667
That threat hunters can
kind of get into a cadence.

645
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:58,280
And when they see something
come up in the EDR,

646
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,800
be able to investigate it

647
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:03,090
and remediate very quickly
will enable them to do so.

648
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:05,520
And organizations that
don't have the budget

649
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:09,940
or the staffing to do this,
because threat hunters are good,

650
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:11,610
threat hunters are hard to find,

651
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:14,139
and they're expensive to keep on board

652
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:16,399
and trained and engaged.

653
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:18,870
Well, there's lots of threat managed

654
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:20,610
hunting services out there.

655
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:24,679
CrowdStrike OverWatch does
this all day every day

656
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:27,920
and is really on top of
these types of threats.

657
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:30,510
And even you can have something

658
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:32,290
like our Falcon Complete service,

659
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:35,600
where the threat hunters are authorized

660
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,199
to remediate the activity as well.

661
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,420
And they do this all through one platform.

662
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:43,180
You can hit that 1-10-60 number.

663
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:47,670
The third thing is NextGen
Protection, NextGen antivirus.

664
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:50,890
Legacy antivirus solutions
are not cutting it anymore.

665
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:53,150
Signature-based detection is something

666
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:55,230
that is extremely fragile.

667
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:56,740
You have to understand the threat

668
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:58,920
in order to have a signature for it

669
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:02,070
and then to use that signature
to detect or prevent it.

670
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:04,600
With NextGen antivirus technology
what we're talking about

671
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,040
is using machine learning.

672
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:10,399
Machine learning is
classifying threads or files

673
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,450
before they've ever encountered them.

674
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:15,427
So they're looking at various
features within that file

675
00:30:15,427 --> 00:30:19,179
and using that to classify
it as good or bad.

676
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:23,304
And that allows you to do
prevention and detection

677
00:30:23,304 --> 00:30:26,620
without ever having
seen this threat before.

678
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:29,229
And that's, that next
generation technology is

679
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:31,260
absolutely table stakes at this point

680
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,940
in order to successfully
protect an environment

681
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,140
from these types of threats.

682
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:39,384
Every ransomware intrusion's
going to use some unique build

683
00:30:39,384 --> 00:30:43,360
that can be identified,
but it's a unique build

684
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:47,043
and they're purposefully
creating their intrusions

685
00:30:47,044 --> 00:30:51,710
and their tools to go around
signature-based detection.

686
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:54,208
So NextGen anti-virus absolutely critical,

687
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:56,440
and the four things to drill.

688
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,600
Now, this sounds a little bit odd maybe,

689
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:02,770
but what we tell customers to
do is to go through exercises,

690
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:05,156
tabletop exercises, in order to understand

691
00:31:05,156 --> 00:31:08,690
if something happens,
who are we gonna call?

692
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:11,290
Which, who's got the responsibility?

693
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:13,500
If you've got the best
backup solution in the world

694
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,860
but you've never tested it,

695
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:16,579
then you're gonna have a hard time

696
00:31:16,579 --> 00:31:19,129
when you need to deploy it under fire.

697
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:23,640
And so by running these drills
quarterly in virtual rooms

698
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:26,770
or eventually as we get back
into offices doing it inside

699
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:29,170
of a boardroom are a really good way

700
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:31,310
to get everybody to understand
what they need to do,

701
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:34,100
what their position is, and
to build that muscle memory

702
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,830
for what to do in a specific incident

703
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:37,687
or when something happens.

704
00:31:37,688 --> 00:31:40,070
And finally know your adversary.

705
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:42,659
There's 25 different ransomware actors

706
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:44,060
that we're tracking today.

707
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:46,429
And if you understand their
tactics, their techniques

708
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:48,310
and their procedures,
what tools they're using

709
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:50,070
and how they operate, then you're gonna be

710
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:52,540
in a much better position
to defend your environment

711
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:54,899
from this threat actors by understanding

712
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,380
what business verticals they're targeting,

713
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:58,310
what geographic regions they're targeting,

714
00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:01,480
and what you need to look
for in order to stop them

715
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:04,290
before they're able to
encrypt files, steal data,

716
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:05,690
and leak it on the internet.

717
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:08,240
Thank you for your time today.
