1
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:02,550
- Hello everyone.

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:04,779
And welcome to What Are Faster Payments

3
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:08,910
and Why Should a Security
Practitioner Care.

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:10,180
We're off to a good start.

5
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:11,230
My name is Peter Tapling.

6
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:14,130
I'm with PTAP Advisory,
providing advice and counsel

7
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:19,130
to providers and consumers of
payment security information.

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,119
With me today to help us
with this presentation

9
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,070
are Sandra Peaston from Cifas

10
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:30,490
and Reed Luhtanen from the
US Faster Payments Council.

11
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:31,950
What we're going to try to do today

12
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:33,430
is give you a quick introduction

13
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:36,060
to what faster payments are,

14
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:40,400
talk about how that changes
fraud and risk approaches,

15
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,330
and then finally the UK has been doing

16
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:45,000
faster payments since 2007

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,080
and so we get to hear from Sandra,

18
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,129
to hear what they've
been doing over in the UK

19
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:50,730
to see if there might be something

20
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:52,772
that we can apply here in the US.

21
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,800
Sandra, why don't you go
ahead and introduce yourself

22
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,839
and then Reed you can introduce yourself,

23
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,910
then can kick things
off in a minute. Sandra.

24
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:04,550
- Thanks. Yeah, I'm the
Director of Research

25
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:06,030
and Development at Cifas,

26
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:11,030
which is an organization that
helps organizations in the UK

27
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,860
prevent fraud primarily
by sharing information

28
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,400
between themselves and give
them a mechanism to do that

29
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,780
but also looking at some of
those larger, broader issues

30
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:24,780
and helping share intelligence,
best practice learning,

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,720
communicating with other parties to try

32
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,960
and help prevent fraud.

33
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,550
So, yeah, happy to be sharing
some of the fraud issues

34
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:33,840
that we've seen in the UK

35
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,290
on the back of the
introduction of fast payments.

36
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,110
- Excellent. Thank you, Sandra.

37
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:42,000
And with that, Reed I'm
going to turn it over to you

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,980
to help the audience understand
what a faster payment is.

39
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,447
- Great. Thank you so much, Peter.

40
00:01:48,447 --> 00:01:50,640
And hello, as Peter
said, I'm Reed Luhtanen,

41
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,640
Executive Director of the
US Faster Payments Council.

42
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,520
The FPC is an industry-led
membership organization

43
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,869
whose mission is to facilitate
a world-class payment system

44
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,630
where Americans can safely
and securely pay anyone,

45
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,270
anywhere at any time

46
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:06,690
and with near immediate
funds availability.

47
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:08,910
I'm responsible for managing
the daily operations

48
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:12,690
of the organization and executing
on the FPC strategic plan

49
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:15,480
while ensuring inclusive
and transparent dialogue

50
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,320
with all the FPC stakeholders.

51
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,140
Our members include businesses end-users,

52
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,630
consumer organizations,
financial institutions,

53
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:26,350
payment network operators,
technology providers and others.

54
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:27,950
Prior to joining FPC a year ago,

55
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:29,440
I spent 15 years at Walmart

56
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,579
departing a Senior
Director of Global Treasury

57
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,810
where I was responsible for
the company's payments related

58
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:37,360
public policy and public
relations initiatives,

59
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,700
network processor, relationships

60
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,160
and establishing Walmart's
payments acceptance strategies.

61
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,150
Really excited to be here.

62
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,450
Next slide, please, Peter.

63
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,550
With technological
advances coming opportunity

64
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:50,530
to improve the experience of
individuals and businesses

65
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:52,830
allowing them to better
manage their money.

66
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:55,420
The future of the payment
system lies in faster payments

67
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:58,070
which can yield real economic
benefits to individuals

68
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:00,570
and businesses or reducing risks

69
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:03,580
and providing innovation opportunities

70
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:06,490
to providers of payment services.

71
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:08,740
Faster payments enable
individuals and businesses

72
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:11,540
to send and receive payments
at any time of the day

73
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:12,600
at any day of the year

74
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,019
and to complete those
payments within seconds.

75
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:15,953
Next slide please.

76
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,090
So we have a faster payments council

77
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:22,500
and I just told you some of the
benefits of faster payments,

78
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,410
but what is a faster payment?

79
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:26,130
The Bank of International
Settlements weighed in

80
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:27,400
on that question globally

81
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,790
and defined a fast payment as a payment

82
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:31,910
in which the transmission
of the payment message

83
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:34,600
and the availability of
final funds to the payee

84
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,690
occur in real-time or near real-time

85
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:40,810
or is near to a 24-hour and
seven-day basis as possible.

86
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:42,350
For me, the easiest way to think about it

87
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:43,820
is to think about it as payments

88
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,470
that move like a text message.

89
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,300
You send a text and the
person you sent it to

90
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,950
receives it within a few seconds.

91
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,130
That brings me to another important point.

92
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:54,123
We're highly accustomed
to debit style systems

93
00:03:54,123 --> 00:03:56,730
wherein the payer presents
a payment credentials

94
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:59,179
such as a check or
debit card to the payee,

95
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,700
and then the payee sends a
message to the payer's bank

96
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,262
to debit the payer's account.

97
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:06,300
Fast payment systems around the world

98
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:09,100
have nearly all adopted
the credit push model

99
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,570
whereby the sender of the funds

100
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:12,640
pushes the funds to the recipient.

101
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,829
This of course is the way many

102
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:16,570
of the popular P2P payment
applications work today

103
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:19,779
and experience most of us
I'm sure are familiar with.

104
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:22,460
And in fact, the two
faster payments services

105
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,409
or instant payment
services that are planned

106
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:27,430
for the United States, RTP
from The Clearing House

107
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,357
which is already in market

108
00:04:28,357 --> 00:04:30,520
and FedNow from the Federal Reserve

109
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,080
which is planned for a 2023 release,

110
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,310
both are credit push systems.

111
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,313
Next slide please.

112
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,950
So I spent some time talking
about the global view

113
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:42,240
on faster payments but I
wanted to shift the dive

114
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,620
into the US view.

115
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,270
Many countries around the world
have had government mandates

116
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,780
that require the implementation

117
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,330
of fast or instant payment services.

118
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:53,840
The United States is taking
a private sector approach,

119
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,349
meaning that there are a
number of different solutions

120
00:04:56,350 --> 00:05:00,080
in the marketplace with varying
capabilities and offerings.

121
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,849
As I mentioned, the
faster payments council

122
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:04,430
is designed to be inclusive
of all stakeholders.

123
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:06,810
So we include a much broader
set of payment systems

124
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:08,373
underneath the faster umbrella.

125
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,960
In some cases we're
talking about speeding up

126
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,587
existing payments, such as ACH.

127
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:15,980
So instead of settlement
lagging behind by a day or more,

128
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:19,380
settlement happens on the
same day as the transaction.

129
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,010
In other cases, we're looking at systems

130
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:23,030
where perhaps settlement
isn't in real-time

131
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,880
but there is real-time messaging,

132
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,600
letting the parties know
that the transaction

133
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,170
has been approved.

134
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:29,790
And then there are
payments around the world

135
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:31,890
known as fast payments
which in the United States,

136
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:33,330
we're calling instant payments,

137
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:35,669
real-time payment movement
from one account to the other

138
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,620
with good funds availability instantly.

139
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:40,820
It's also worth noting
that this is not purely

140
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,610
a discussion about speed.

141
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:44,270
Many of these new networks which leverage

142
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:47,710
the state of the art ISO
20022 message specification

143
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:49,479
enable a much richer exchange of data

144
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,490
between the sender and the receiver.

145
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:53,700
In some cases, the modern
architecture of the system

146
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,710
even enables the sender of the payment

147
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:58,739
to attach files such as invoices
or bills to the payment.

148
00:05:58,740 --> 00:05:59,643
Next slide please.

149
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:02,630
So what is out there in the marketplace

150
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,850
in terms of faster payment systems?

151
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:07,990
I suspect most are familiar
with NACHA and Same Day ACH

152
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:10,200
so I won't explain that here today.

153
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,020
But there's a ton of
diversity on this list

154
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,630
and they're all considered
to be faster payment systems.

155
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:15,670
Taking them from the top,

156
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:17,670
we have RTP from The Clearing House.

157
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:20,410
The RTP network is a
real-time payments platform

158
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:24,260
that all federally insured
US depository institutions

159
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,950
are eligible to use for
payments innovation.

160
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,930
With mobile technology
and digital commerce

161
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:32,660
driving the need for safer
and faster payments in the US,

162
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,060
financial institutions of all sizes

163
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,620
are taking advantage of the
RTP network's capabilities

164
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,890
to create or enhance digital services

165
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:41,568
for their corporate and retail customers.

166
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:45,177
RTP leverages the ISO
20022 message specification

167
00:06:45,177 --> 00:06:49,053
with immediate 24/7/365
settlement transactions.

168
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,669
Next we have Zelle from Early Warning.

169
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:53,310
Zelle is also a push payment system,

170
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:56,100
which uses a variety of proprietary NACHA

171
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,220
and debit card message specifications

172
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:01,340
and settles many transactions
on the same day they occur.

173
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:04,520
Zelle is experiencing
tremendous growth right now.

174
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,690
Then there are debit
card based push payments

175
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:08,980
from Visa, MasterCard, and Shazam

176
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:12,430
which all leveraged the
ISO 8583 specification

177
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:14,770
and settle either the
same day or the next day.

178
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:16,620
In terms of reach, Visa
reports the ability

179
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,780
to reach 99% of DDAs in the United States

180
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,510
and reach more than 200 countries

181
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:24,620
including 130 countries
enabled for real-time payouts

182
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,960
and 75 countries enabled for real-time

183
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,573
cross border payouts.

184
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:30,679
And finally ExcheQ,

185
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,240
which is a joint venture of
North American Banking Company,

186
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,870
The Design Center and
the United Bankers' Bank.

187
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:37,510
Currently ExcheQ has eight partner banks

188
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:39,170
and is experiencing strong growth.

189
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:41,100
North American Banking Company alone,

190
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,840
which is a $750 million
financial institution

191
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,479
has risen to be the 26th
largest ACH originator

192
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,750
due to its participation in ExcheQ.

193
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:49,773
Next slide please.

194
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,039
And make no mistake, the
faster payments are here.

195
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,460
This is no longer something

196
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,659
we should be talking
about in the abstract.

197
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,930
Well yes, there is a major new service

198
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:01,510
coming to the market in a few years.

199
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:03,969
There's a real opportunity
to get involved today

200
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:05,790
and to shape the course of faster payments

201
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:07,780
to improve existing processes

202
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,799
and to potentially even
develop new processes

203
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,760
and even new lines of business.

204
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,870
The Zelle network which is
operated by Early Warning

205
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:16,830
has nearly a thousand financial
institutions under contract

206
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,140
and they reached nearly 7,000

207
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,650
through their standalone application.

208
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:22,400
The Clearing House has
built out connections

209
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,090
to financial institutions
representing more than 70%

210
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:27,000
of the DDAs in the United States,

211
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,430
and they're adding 20 to
25 more FIs every month.

212
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:32,409
RTP is processing millions of transactions

213
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:34,559
with billions of dollars each month.

214
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,609
And MasterCard has seen
double digit growth

215
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:38,570
in person to person push payments.

216
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:39,470
Next slide please.

217
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:41,789
Now before I wrap up,

218
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:43,799
I wanna take a few minutes to zoom out.

219
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,150
Generally speaking there has been

220
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,939
a massive shift to digital.

221
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,240
This is a trend that
obviously already existed

222
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,747
but the pandemic has sped
up progress traumatically.

223
00:08:51,747 --> 00:08:55,050
And in many cases, that
volume is not shifting back.

224
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:58,050
Consumers are buying groceries
online in record numbers

225
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:59,410
and many of them will continue to do that

226
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:01,930
after the pandemic concerns have subsided.

227
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:04,390
Grocery industry reported a 30% increase

228
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:06,860
in online grocery shopping last year.

229
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,410
And a lot of restaurants
have added delivery

230
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:09,530
during the pandemic.

231
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:11,150
When dining rooms were forced to close

232
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:13,420
across the country in March of last year,

233
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,670
many restaurants were
thrust into innovation mode

234
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:17,060
to generate revenue.

235
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:21,900
42% added delivery as a result,
according to Rewards Network

236
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:25,180
and 31% said they plan
to continue to invest

237
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,180
in the service,

238
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:28,310
suggesting they think
that demand for delivery

239
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:31,550
and other omni-channel
experiences will stick around.

240
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:36,550
One anecdote, DoorDash
sales were up 110% last May.

241
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:39,900
Not surprisingly, this trend
is flowing through to payments.

242
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,860
Not only do that these
digital channels of commerce

243
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,220
require digital payments,

244
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:45,230
consumers are also increasingly interested

245
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:48,690
in touchless payments for
in-person experiences.

246
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:51,250
A Pfizer survey revealed
that touchless payments

247
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,650
are growing in popularity
in the United States.

248
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:56,199
37% of respondents said
contactless payments

249
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:00,037
are the fastest way to
pay, up from 28% in 2019.

250
00:10:00,037 --> 00:10:03,763
And 19% said contactless is
the most preferred payment.

251
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:07,370
Not surprisingly,
touchless was also deemed

252
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:10,500
by a large number of
respondents to be the safest

253
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,300
to prevent the spread of COVID-19

254
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:15,790
with 66% of respondents selecting
either contactless cards

255
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:17,240
or touchless mobile payments.

256
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,560
Additionally, back
offices are now operating

257
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,439
out of people's homes,

258
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,290
meaning that B2B payments
need to be done digitally.

259
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,339
Printing out checks is
becoming a thing of the past

260
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:28,960
not only because of the
necessity of these times

261
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,230
but because the payment systems

262
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,810
that are now available actually provide

263
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:34,030
a better experience, faster delivery

264
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:36,079
and more certainty for both the sender

265
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,930
and the recipient than checks.

266
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:41,500
Obviously, all these
changes and developments

267
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,650
raise security and safety implications

268
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:45,520
and so to talk through that a bit,

269
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,170
I'm gonna turn it back
over to Peter Tapling.

270
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:49,569
- Thank you Reed.

271
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:51,410
So now that we have an understanding

272
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:55,350
of basic understanding of
what faster payments means,

273
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:57,180
let's talk about fraud.

274
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:00,069
And fraud and risk managers
who work in payments

275
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:01,477
may have heard the phrase,

276
00:11:01,477 --> 00:11:04,550
"faster payments equals faster fraud"

277
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:06,599
but is that really true?

278
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,210
If we go back through history here,

279
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,040
I've listed a series of headlines

280
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,400
that have occurred over time.

281
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,290
And if you go through those headlines,

282
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:18,020
those headlines have occurred in a variety

283
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:21,569
of different timeframes against a variety

284
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:24,800
of different services
that have come to market.

285
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,040
Reality is, bad guys
really like new services

286
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,170
because with every new service,

287
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:34,510
we the fraud managers and
the users of the service

288
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:37,569
are learning how it works
and that bit of confusion

289
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:40,080
at the very beginning of the
introduction of a service

290
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,193
leaves an opening for bad guys.

291
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:47,980
So let's dig a little bit deeper
into some of those stories.

292
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:50,310
At one point I was the
Chief Revenue Officer

293
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:53,530
for Early Warning, which
brought Zelle to market

294
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:55,880
and I've chosen this particular article

295
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,660
from the New York times that talked about

296
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:02,930
at the time fraud that was
occurring against Zelle.

297
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,280
But let's look at the fraud stories

298
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,000
that were highlighted in that article.

299
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
In one story, the user of
Zelle had sent the payment

300
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:16,829
to a telephone number that was at one time

301
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:20,860
owned by the recipient of the
payment, but is no longer.

302
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:24,850
So is that really fraud?
Sounds like user error.

303
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:27,120
The second one is the user claims

304
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,310
that they never signed up for the service

305
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:33,209
but that money was moved
using the Zelle capability.

306
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:36,760
The third is that the user sent money

307
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:41,150
to a party that then never
responded to them again.

308
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:44,110
And then the last one was
a user who've responded,

309
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:47,100
admits to responding to both phishing

310
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,210
and smishing attacks as the fraudster

311
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:53,000
was trying to move money via this service.

312
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,480
If you look at the third one,

313
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,600
sending funds to a
contact who gets ghosted,

314
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,030
we've all used cash to exchange things

315
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:03,480
like to pay for things such as

316
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,840
perhaps scalping a
ticket outside of a venue

317
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,410
for a sporting event.

318
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:10,930
And we know that when we use the cash,

319
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:13,209
that we're responsible.

320
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:16,670
And so somehow, taking
that cash transaction

321
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,310
and moving it to a service,

322
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:19,849
makes the user feel as though

323
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:22,893
the provider of the
service is responsible.

324
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:28,880
Real-time payments do present new risk.

325
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,610
Most payments Reed talked
earlier about the ACH network

326
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:36,500
and the ACH network taking
perhaps two or three days,

327
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,940
that two or three days gives risk managers

328
00:13:40,552 --> 00:13:44,310
the opportunity to implement
policies and procedures

329
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:48,020
that apply mitigation capabilities.

330
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:50,949
In real-time payments, the moment the user

331
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:53,570
hits the button that says send money,

332
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:55,280
the money's going out the door.

333
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:58,380
So whatever fraud and risk mitigation

334
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:01,120
that you might want to undertake

335
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,170
has to happen before you decide

336
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:06,402
that you're going to accept that request.

337
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,069
The money does indeed
move more quickly, right?

338
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:12,143
That's what bad guys like.

339
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,829
The money moves at the
time of the instruction.

340
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:18,350
So at the moment that
the user hits the button

341
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:21,120
and says go, the money is going to move

342
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,543
and in most cases it's going
to be cleared and settled.

343
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,990
Availability of these networks is 24 by 7.

344
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:33,810
In the payment space, we're
very used to payment networks

345
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:38,810
that operate on a business
day type of calendar.

346
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:43,330
Visa and MasterCard
clearly available 24 by 7,

347
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:46,340
But those networks themselves have fraud

348
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:48,140
and risk mitigation built into them.

349
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,570
The importance of credit
push can't be understated.

350
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:55,110
The idea of a credit push transaction

351
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:57,430
is that the holder of the account

352
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,992
is giving the instruction
to move the money,

353
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:03,490
contrast that with a debit transaction

354
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:07,210
wherein a debit transaction,
somebody who is owed money

355
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:09,810
is reaching into somebody else's account

356
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:11,313
to pull the money out.

357
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:15,230
And finally, the ability to recover funds.

358
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:17,860
If you find fraud after the fact,

359
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:21,550
the ability to recover
funds is greatly reduced

360
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:22,699
in a real-time payment,

361
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,740
in a true real-time payments scenario.

362
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:27,030
I've introduced a topic, a concept here

363
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:29,400
of real-time gross settlement

364
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,300
and that's the settlement of a payment

365
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:35,150
between two banks which
is determined to be final.

366
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,980
And in that final settlement

367
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:40,680
there is no operating rule
or anything like that.

368
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,693
That gives you the
opportunity to get funds back.

369
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:47,400
So let's tie this together a little bit.

370
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,199
It turns out that bad guys are going back

371
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,680
to the old playbook.

372
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,939
One of the big fraud vectors

373
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:56,700
that nefarious actors are using these days

374
00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:00,253
is something called business
email compromise or BEC.

375
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,460
In business email compromise,

376
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:07,200
a nefarious actor picks up
the phone, calls a business,

377
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,120
pretends to be a supplier to that business

378
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:13,747
and tells the accountant at the payor,

379
00:16:13,747 --> 00:16:15,380
"Hey, we've changed your account.

380
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,830
Please send your money here."

381
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,530
Now you're all sitting in this session

382
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:22,579
so you're probably largely
fraud and risk professionals

383
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,527
and you're thinking to yourself,

384
00:16:23,527 --> 00:16:25,680
"My gosh, who would do that?"

385
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:30,680
Well, it turns out that in
2019, we lost $26 billion.

386
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:35,093
Businesses lost $26 billion
to that form of fraud.

387
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:39,420
Synthetic identity has been
around in the US landscape

388
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,969
for quite a while

389
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:44,670
but recently nefarious
actors have figured out

390
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,719
that rather than taking over an account,

391
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,180
the next fraud, plain
old account takeover,

392
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:52,560
it's much easier if I could
just get an account created

393
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,680
for an identity that
doesn't actually exist,

394
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,329
that nobody can track down.

395
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:59,610
And so synthetic identity and the advent

396
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:02,290
of synthetic identity has really taken off

397
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:03,593
in the last five years.

398
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:07,810
And it's never a good idea
to blame the customer.

399
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:11,329
But as an industry, we
do have a responsibility

400
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:15,082
to educate the customer on
how these payments behave.

401
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:20,150
Zero liability for card
transactions was introduced

402
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:22,849
around the advent of e-commerce

403
00:17:22,849 --> 00:17:27,270
and certainly it changed
the way we do commerce.

404
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:29,830
And it's been very good for both consumers

405
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:31,610
and for businesses.

406
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:35,590
Faster payments has no
zero liability concept.

407
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:37,320
The idea of faster payments is that

408
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,290
when an end-user hits the button,

409
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:42,379
they are taking personal
full responsibility

410
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,660
for that payment.

411
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:48,170
That's a drastic change in
how we're going to communicate

412
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:51,030
with consumers about
challenges that they may see

413
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:52,093
in these payments.

414
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,360
The behaviors of the networks
actually help a little bit

415
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,229
relative to fraud and risk management.

416
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:04,450
The first thing is with a few
exceptions around the world,

417
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:08,420
faster payments schemes are
generally domestic only.

418
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:13,360
So for instance, Reed
mentioned Same Day ACH and RTP

419
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,959
and the announced FedNow network,

420
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:19,320
those are all going to
be US dollar transactions

421
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,300
that operate only within the US.

422
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,293
I should throw Zelle
into that bucket as well.

423
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:28,890
For those transactions
that are credit push.

424
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:32,640
The credit push concept
means that in theory

425
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,460
the account holder is the
party who's interacting

426
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,810
with the institution and instituting

427
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:41,350
and initiating the payment
that gives the party,

428
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:44,510
that gives the fraud and risk
managers at the institution

429
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:46,910
the greatest amount of
control over deciding

430
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:51,010
are we going to accept this
payment instruction or not?

431
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:52,950
And finally, for the time being

432
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:56,920
dollar amounts are limited
on the ACH network.

433
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:01,763
The Same Day ACH, I believe
today has a $250,000 limitation.

434
00:19:03,501 --> 00:19:06,840
Same day and RTP are
both announced $250,000

435
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,090
and they're currently at 100,000.

436
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:11,879
But NACHA has announced
that for Same Day ACH,

437
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,750
they've instituted a plan
that over three or four years,

438
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,240
they intend to remove the limit.

439
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,890
So you have a period of
time where dollar limits

440
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:19,890
will help you a bit.

441
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,920
On the topic of customer education,

442
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:28,770
on the left-hand side,
you'll see a panel image

443
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:33,590
of an actual Zelle transaction
within a bank mobile app.

444
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:36,129
And one of the things
that we're trying to do

445
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:40,290
with consumers is really give
them much greater education

446
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:42,540
about how these payments
are going to behave.

447
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,610
The two things that are
circled here in this panel,

448
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:51,060
one is something referred to
as highlighting payee name.

449
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,879
If you think about the way Zelle works,

450
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,700
it works with an email address
and a telephone number.

451
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:58,960
So if I wanted to send Reed money,

452
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,400
and I typed in what I thought
was Reed's telephone number

453
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,850
and that little "registered
with Zelle as" came up and said,

454
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:07,560
it's registered as Kelly,

455
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,169
well, then I know as a consumer,

456
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:11,070
as the person initiating the payment,

457
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:13,200
I may have mistyped that telephone number.

458
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,800
It gives me an opportunity to go back.

459
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,470
And then the circle at the bottom

460
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:22,150
tries to give the consumer
that positive notice

461
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:24,260
that when you hit the
button, the money's going,

462
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:26,620
you are responsible for this payment.

463
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:28,592
There is no zero liability.

464
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:33,000
So with that as kind of an
overview of some of the fraud

465
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,750
and risk considerations with
regard to faster payments,

466
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:40,410
let's hear from Sandra about how the UK,

467
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:44,590
who instituted faster
payments in 2007, 2008,

468
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:48,250
has learned over time and begun
to deal with this problem.

469
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,480
Sandra.

470
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,940
- Thanks.

471
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,860
Yes. So first thing we're gonna do

472
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,389
is look at actually who in the UK

473
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:57,570
is using the faster payments network

474
00:20:57,570 --> 00:21:00,750
and we've got 34 directly
connected participants

475
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:03,340
which probably to you may
not sound like a huge amount,

476
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:05,040
but in reality, that is covering all

477
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,530
of the high street
banks, challenger banks,

478
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:08,850
well increasingly some of those

479
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:11,629
emerging payment organizations as well.

480
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:14,880
So the reality is we are
talking about the vast majority

481
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,410
almost all of the UK market there.

482
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:19,310
Next slide please.

483
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:24,899
And as been said, it was brought in 2008

484
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,150
it's overseen by Pay.UK

485
00:21:28,782 --> 00:21:31,899
and in 2020, 2.1 trillion pounds

486
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:34,700
were moved through faster payments.

487
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,480
And actually before I start talking about

488
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,520
some of the fraud issues
associated with faster payments

489
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,139
which is typically those types of fraud

490
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:44,540
would have been more greatly enabled

491
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:47,178
by using faster payments
rather than anything

492
00:21:47,179 --> 00:21:50,490
the system itself, it is
really worth making the point

493
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:52,510
actually the vast majority of the money

494
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:56,040
that she's moved for faster
payments is perfectly legitimate

495
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,960
and legal use of the system.

496
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,600
However, not all of it is.

497
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,179
It is also worth highlighting
that faster payments

498
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,953
is not sort of evolved in a bubble.

499
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:08,800
The growth of online banking as well

500
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,500
and the adoption is quite key to this.

501
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:15,290
So we are now up to
80% of people in the UK

502
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:16,893
have gotten online bank account.

503
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:20,120
So not only has the speed with which money

504
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:23,320
is able to move increase
but so is the ability

505
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,129
of the consumer to easily, quickly

506
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:27,283
and conveniently initiate those payments.

507
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:29,990
However, at the same time

508
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:33,910
as obviously the adoption of
online banking has increased,

509
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:35,480
so has the level of security

510
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,970
around those online bank account.

511
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:39,500
Clearly online bank accounts,

512
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:42,790
they represent an attack
vector for the fraudster.

513
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:46,350
They were gonna be taking over
those accounts anonymously,

514
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:49,780
remotely, in order to
move money out of them.

515
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:52,660
So unsurprisingly, to counteract that

516
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:54,520
the security around those accounts

517
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:57,980
has also increased making it
more difficult for fraudsters

518
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:00,220
to get at that source of funds directly.

519
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,953
So what have they been doing?

520
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:03,949
Next slide Peter.

521
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:09,659
They have been doing the
scam, the con, the grift

522
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,120
call it what you like.

523
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,050
However, we have gone
for the slightly more

524
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:16,399
professional sounding
Authorized Push Payment fraud.

525
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,180
If you can't get into an account
to steal the money directly

526
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:23,430
then why not just get the
account holder to give it to you?

527
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:25,840
And that's pretty much where the direction

528
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,723
of travel has been going in the UK.

529
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,060
This is not a new phenomenon,
and that's easy for me to say

530
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:37,060
phenomenon, investment scams,
boiler rooms, 419 scams.

531
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:40,130
These are examples of this type of fraud

532
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:43,113
which predate the technology
that we're talking about.

533
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,550
However, with these types of scams,

534
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:47,070
they also brought with them the perception

535
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:48,980
that those people that fell for them

536
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:51,600
were either greedy or highly gullible.

537
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,953
So the owners was very
much on the individuals

538
00:23:53,953 --> 00:23:55,960
not fall prey to these scams

539
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,030
as opposed to actually
looking for the mechanisms

540
00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:00,379
through which the payment was made

541
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:01,660
and looking at whether or not

542
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,580
the fault lies there, if you will.

543
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:06,500
And it's this perception which
has been changing recently

544
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:09,730
with more technologically advanced ways

545
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:10,780
that the money moves.

546
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,320
So these which frauds that can communicate

547
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,169
with their victim and
instill a sense of urgency

548
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:19,790
and that's quite key,
coupled with the speed

549
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:22,260
at which the victim is
able to make the payment

550
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,310
and the fact that pretty much the moment

551
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:27,070
someone hits the button
to pay that money is gone.

552
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:30,450
It means that we have a lot
more victims of APP fraud

553
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:33,290
and the perception of
those victims has changed.

554
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:35,180
And the frauds this will be using anything

555
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:38,140
as a hook for their APP scams.

556
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:40,640
Every year around tax return times

557
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,270
we get the scams going out
by text message reportings

558
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:44,617
come from HMRC saying,

559
00:24:44,617 --> 00:24:47,667
"you owe money, pay now
to avoid prosecution,"

560
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:51,800
With the COVID situation,
there has been a lot of scams

561
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,700
which have come on the back of that.

562
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,607
Things like you need to
pay upfront for a vaccine.

563
00:24:57,607 --> 00:24:58,917
"You need to pay now."

564
00:24:58,917 --> 00:25:00,409
"You've been caught breaking lockdown

565
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:02,810
and you need to pay a
fine, you need to pay now,

566
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:04,587
or you'll be prosecuted."

567
00:25:04,587 --> 00:25:07,510
"Quick, here as an
opportunity to invest in PPE.

568
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:09,450
Invest now, before it's gone."

569
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:11,410
And the key here that in many cases,

570
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:14,610
it's trying to remove
the individual's chance

571
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:17,090
to actually think about
what they're doing.

572
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:19,831
And all of these factors
have very much changed

573
00:25:19,832 --> 00:25:23,290
how these scams are seen and
it's increased the amount

574
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:25,170
of public discourse on the subject.

575
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:26,870
And it's also increased the pressure

576
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:28,209
on those PSPS to do more

577
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:31,660
to prevent those payments
being made in the first place

578
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:33,970
but also actually look
at who should be here.

579
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:36,520
Should these victims be reimbursed

580
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,780
when they have lost money?

581
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:39,580
Typically the bank has looked at it,

582
00:25:40,534 --> 00:25:42,087
as from a position of saying,

583
00:25:42,087 --> 00:25:44,500
"You were the account holder.

584
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,730
You chose to make this payment.

585
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:48,970
We, the bank have done nothing wrong."

586
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:51,123
Therefore it's on you.

587
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:57,010
And actually prior to about 2016 or so,

588
00:25:57,010 --> 00:25:59,470
that was the pervading sense.

589
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:01,420
Since then, there's
been increasing pressure

590
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:04,810
for banks to change that stand.

591
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:06,080
And actually what we've got then

592
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,889
is banks actually started
counting the number

593
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:11,330
of APP fraud that were occurring,

594
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:13,409
partly because of this pressure

595
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:17,530
and very how much they've
then been leaned on

596
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:20,312
to prevent these games
happening and reimbursed.

597
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:24,700
So, yeah, we now have an
industry which is actually

598
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:25,860
currently reporting these scams

599
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:29,082
because they're feeling much more liable.

600
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:35,070
But it's not just the APP scams
that have come about largely

601
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:37,800
on the back of money moving
through accounts faster.

602
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,311
We also have the associated problem

603
00:26:40,311 --> 00:26:44,620
which is around the laundering
of money from your network.

604
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:45,520
Next slide please.

605
00:26:46,667 --> 00:26:49,280
- [Peter] And I should point out HMRC,

606
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,879
her Majesty's Revenue and Customs,

607
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,123
the rough equivalent of the US IRS.

608
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:56,023
- Yeah.

609
00:26:58,162 --> 00:27:00,896
We have now got the Money Mule Problem.

610
00:27:00,896 --> 00:27:03,669
So criminals have realized
that they can use networks

611
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:05,017
with bank accounts (indistinct).

612
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:10,040
And we have seen a fair
amount of identity fraud

613
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,409
for obtaining bank accounts

614
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:15,090
where there is little other functionality

615
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:18,040
apart from to be able to move
money through those accounts.

616
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:22,740
However, again, as security
around bank accounts increased

617
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:25,813
those security around the
application for those accounts,

618
00:27:25,813 --> 00:27:28,500
it's not actually that easy in the UK

619
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,260
to successfully impersonate someone.

620
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:33,440
It does happen a lot, but
it's not actually that easy.

621
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,710
What frauds have actually found

622
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:36,710
is it's far easier to recruit people

623
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:38,780
to act as mules for them.

624
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:42,320
These are often young
people, quite often naive

625
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,570
to what they're doing or
at least claim to be naive

626
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:45,770
to what they're doing.

627
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:48,070
They don't realize they're
committing a crime.

628
00:27:50,732 --> 00:27:52,310
So if I talk through what we've got here,

629
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:55,070
if we've got victim APP fraud

630
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:58,590
they then pay their money
into destination accounts.

631
00:27:58,590 --> 00:27:59,993
Those destination accounts, there's money

632
00:27:59,993 --> 00:28:03,310
as they move through those
to another layer of accounts.

633
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:05,810
It's moved and split and moved on again.

634
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:07,899
And then it's moved and
split and moved on again

635
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:10,530
until eventually it leaves the network,

636
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:12,550
be that at something like a cash going

637
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:16,050
or an overseas transfer or
somewhere we've lost sight of it.

638
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:17,620
Now that's not good.

639
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:19,409
And because it's moving so fast,

640
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:21,760
you have very little in
the way of an opportunity

641
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,440
to actually intercept and prevent that.

642
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,760
But in the off chance that you do manage

643
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,260
to freeze an account

644
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,660
which has got some money in it

645
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:32,320
which you could return to the victim...

646
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,570
Next click, if you would.

647
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:36,720
You then need to ask yourself

648
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,600
given the money that's in that
account, whose money is that?

649
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,669
How do you actually then
manage to get that back

650
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:44,040
to the person who actually
lost it in the first place?

651
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,720
So the repatriation of funds
is also another headache

652
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,890
that comes on the back of money

653
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:49,933
moving through these networks.

654
00:28:49,933 --> 00:28:51,510
So what are we doing about it?

655
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:52,600
That's the next question.

656
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,923
Next slide, if you would.

657
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:57,340
First off, we want to stop
people falling for scams

658
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:58,490
in the first place.

659
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:00,430
So we've got the Take Five Campaign.

660
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:02,500
And again, the point of
the Take Five Campaign

661
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,890
is take five minutes to
think about what you're doing

662
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:07,460
before you make a payment
in the first place.

663
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:09,150
So it's trying to slow people down

664
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:10,620
and encourage them to think.

665
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,639
We've also got consumer education to try

666
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,440
and prevent people becoming money mules

667
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:17,690
to prevent people laundering money,

668
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:20,510
even if they weren't entirely
sure what they were doing

669
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:22,330
we need to tell them
what they would be doing

670
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:24,060
and stop them doing it.

671
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:28,129
We've also got what we call
Contingent Reimbursement Model

672
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:29,490
which is a voluntary agreement

673
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:32,640
between a number of the
major banks in the UK

674
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:37,231
around who is responsible
when APP frauds happen,

675
00:29:37,231 --> 00:29:41,129
how does consumer get their money back

676
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:42,663
and what circumstances?

677
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:46,659
So there is, as I've been saying

678
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:49,300
that there's been greater
emphasis on returning money

679
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:52,520
to the consumer and this model is a way

680
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:55,223
of actually trying to make that happen.

681
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,310
It's relatively new.

682
00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:02,129
It's not hugely consistent
in the way it's applied.

683
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:05,160
There is work to be done,
but it makes it clear

684
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,300
what the obligations on the sending bank,

685
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,129
the receiving bank, the consumer,

686
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:11,720
what are their obligations
in order to ensure

687
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:14,590
that the money gets back
to the right person.

688
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:17,330
We have Confirmation of
Payee that is basically

689
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:19,770
around making sure that
people know whose account

690
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:21,129
they're paying money into.

691
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:24,210
So when someone sets up a new
payee on their online banking

692
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:27,270
it comes back and has a look at the name

693
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:29,420
that you think you're sending it to,

694
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:30,820
checks with the receiving bank.

695
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:33,330
Neither says, yes, that is
the name on the account.

696
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:35,560
No, it's not, or it's quite close.

697
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,429
You might want to have another look.

698
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:40,500
So that's the trying to
stop people making payments

699
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:44,350
into an account with a
different name on it.

700
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:47,219
We've got Configurable Bank
Accounts coming in as well.

701
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,110
These are for people who
feel they're probably

702
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:52,189
more vulnerable than others
to falling for scams.

703
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:53,580
And it gives them the opportunity

704
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:55,649
to build a lag into payment.

705
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:58,160
So it's actually putting friction back

706
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,890
in the payment journey
for people who want it

707
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:03,390
to help prevent them
falling victim to fraud.

708
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:05,740
It's giving them that time back.

709
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:10,740
And we also have industry-wide
solutions to help track

710
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,520
some of the money through
those mule accounts.

711
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:16,010
So we can start seeing
where money is moving

712
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:16,920
between those accounts,

713
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,520
to be able to plot the
journeys of those money,

714
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,020
to be able to then take action

715
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:22,970
against the accounts involved,

716
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:25,720
but actually where possible
see if some of that money

717
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,360
can be repatriated.

718
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,774
And that is a super swift run-through

719
00:31:29,775 --> 00:31:32,175
of the issues in the UK
and some of the things

720
00:31:32,175 --> 00:31:34,635
that we've been looking to do about it.

721
00:31:34,635 --> 00:31:35,907
- Thank you, Sandra.

722
00:31:35,907 --> 00:31:38,100
So how do we put all this to work?

723
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,209
And before we wrap up,

724
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:42,070
I do want to encourage
everyone to take your questions

725
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:44,210
and put them into the chat.

726
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:48,280
Sandra, Reed and I will all
be around to answer questions

727
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,480
during the live portion.

728
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:56,340
Much of this presentation
may have felt you,

729
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,810
may have lead you feeling as though

730
00:31:57,810 --> 00:32:00,639
we're presenting strictly
to financial institutions

731
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,780
and that couldn't be
farther from the truth.

732
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:04,389
Certainly, financial institutions

733
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:05,870
are at the center of payments.

734
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:08,500
And if you're from a
financial institution,

735
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,760
you've probably already
heard much of this,

736
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,860
but if you're in a
hospital or a manufacturer

737
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:14,639
or an e-commerce company,

738
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,160
faster payments are coming to you as well.

739
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,470
And so the earlier that you can understand

740
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:21,300
what faster payments are

741
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:23,963
and make accommodations
the better off you'll be.

742
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,659
You will need to make changes

743
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:29,600
to your fraud and risk
management policies.

744
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,949
The biggest thing that
faster payments does

745
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,980
is it changes the timing

746
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:35,610
and so the timing of your fraud

747
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:39,142
and risk mitigation capabilities
needs to change as well.

748
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,620
Some things are old.

749
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:44,489
Account takeover is an old attack,

750
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:47,897
but you have to reup your
efforts to try and figure out,

751
00:32:47,897 --> 00:32:50,860
"Are these accounts that
I'm dealing with at risk?"

752
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:52,990
And again, this isn't just
the financial accounts.

753
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:54,620
It could be e-commerce accounts,

754
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:56,233
hospital accounts, et cetera.

755
00:32:57,490 --> 00:33:00,520
Sandra talked about APP fraud.

756
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,440
Identity is critical.

757
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,600
Everybody who initiates
one of these payments

758
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,740
is going to be identified by your system.

759
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:08,807
And so that's your
opportunity to figure out,

760
00:33:08,807 --> 00:33:11,860
"Is this something that
I want to make happen?"

761
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:14,629
Cause you're going to have
to educate your customers.

762
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:18,573
You may need to put some
friction back into the process.

763
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:23,219
Finally, this idea of Configurable
Accounts is interesting

764
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:25,370
and use brand monitoring to make sure

765
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:30,300
that bad guys are not
somehow sending text messages

766
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:33,853
or have websites that
are trying to be you.

767
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:37,533
Reed, what other resources are available?

768
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:39,743
- Yeah, absolutely.

769
00:33:39,743 --> 00:33:41,070
There's a ton of information out there.

770
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:44,030
The center for payments
has a lot of information.

771
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:46,110
NACHA has compiled a listing of resources

772
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:47,850
related to fraud threats.

773
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:50,409
Even the FBI has outlined
some of the most common scams,

774
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:52,090
but if you go to the next slide,

775
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:55,370
I'm obviously biased here
but my personal opinion

776
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:57,360
is that the best place
to come for resources

777
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,100
would be the
fasterpaymentscouncil.org website.

778
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:03,580
Our knowledge center has
tons of information available

779
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:05,530
including a major piece
of Thought Leadership

780
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:07,560
on faster payments and fraud trends.

781
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:10,520
And then of course, I'd be
remiss if I didn't mention

782
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:14,440
Cifas as well and a lot of
great information on their site.

783
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:17,210
Fraud and risk blog and details on trends

784
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:19,239
and reporting on issues
such as insider fraud.

785
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:22,199
So lots of information out
there for those who are looking.

786
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:23,719
- Thank you, Reed.

787
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:25,602
And thank you, Sandra.

788
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:28,750
Hopefully we've met our objective.

789
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:32,280
Our objective was to introduce
what faster payments are

790
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,760
particularly in the United States.

791
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,710
Talk about some of the differences

792
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:38,889
relative to fraud and risk management

793
00:34:38,889 --> 00:34:41,190
as these faster payments become more

794
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:43,550
prevalent in the marketplace.

795
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:45,810
And then finally take
advantage of the experience

796
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:48,710
that in another market
where faster payments

797
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:50,380
have been around for many years

798
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,580
and Sandra shared that with us.

799
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:54,239
So on behalf of the audience,

800
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:56,850
Sandra, Reed, thank you very much.

801
00:34:56,850 --> 00:34:59,230
And we hope that you're
