1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:03,519
- Welcome and thank you
for joining us today

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,740
for this session regarding control value.

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:10,660
I, I think this will
hopefully open your eyes

4
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:11,860
to some new things.

5
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:14,734
But, let's dive in and see if that's true.

6
00:00:14,734 --> 00:00:15,648
(mouse clicking)

7
00:00:15,648 --> 00:00:18,340
So I like to start these
kinds of presentations

8
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:20,759
with questions just to
plant seeds in your mind.

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,160
And the first question is
fairly straightforward,

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,270
one would think.

11
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:27,580
What's the most valuable
control in your cybersecurity

12
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:28,412
program?

13
00:00:28,413 --> 00:00:29,246
(mouse clicking)

14
00:00:29,246 --> 00:00:32,245
And then what's the
least valuable control?

15
00:00:32,246 --> 00:00:34,402
And then here's an interesting question.

16
00:00:34,402 --> 00:00:35,250
(mouse clicking)

17
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,110
Would your answers be the
same as someone else's

18
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:38,710
in your organization?

19
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:42,920
Now my experience in asking
these questions is that

20
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,850
while some people will put forth an answer

21
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:50,620
to the first question, you
know sometimes with confidence,

22
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:54,790
very often they're hesitant to
answer the second one at all.

23
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:56,519
And then this third question,

24
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,870
would their answer be the same?

25
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:01,550
Well obviously, that's very
unlikely in my experience.

26
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:03,459
I haven't, I haven't seen any,

27
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:06,490
seen any evidence of that yet.

28
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:07,323
Okay.

29
00:01:07,323 --> 00:01:08,919
(mouse clicking)

30
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,450
But the question is, why are
these so difficult to answer?

31
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:15,260
You would think as a
professional who spends

32
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:18,410
an incredible amount of time on controls,

33
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:20,410
that we would be able to
answer these questions

34
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:23,484
with some confidence, but we aren't.

35
00:01:23,484 --> 00:01:27,039
You know I have not encountered
a soul or a single person

36
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,710
where I pose these
questions, where they could

37
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:31,770
not only with confidence answer them

38
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:34,310
but also explain their
answers in ways that really

39
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:35,143
stood out.

40
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:37,160
Okay?

41
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,440
But there's a reason for that.

42
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,495
And that's what this is about today.

43
00:01:40,495 --> 00:01:41,940
(mouse clicking)

44
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,867
So if we look at this diagram here

45
00:01:43,867 --> 00:01:46,850
and the vertical axis is how
much risk an organization has

46
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:49,756
and the horizontal axis is how
much money they're spending

47
00:01:49,756 --> 00:01:52,196
on trying to manage their risk.

48
00:01:52,196 --> 00:01:53,029
(mouse clicking)

49
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:56,220
Let's say they're spending that
amount, that amount of money

50
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,300
and they're getting that much reduction.

51
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,800
That doesn't look bad I
guess, you know relative,

52
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,470
you know on that curve.

53
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:06,410
What if for the same amount
of money they could drive down

54
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:07,859
risk to there?

55
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:09,280
(mouse clicking)

56
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,210
Well, I think it's, it should
be pretty clear that you know,

57
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:15,983
we would rather drive down
more risk for the same cost.

58
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:21,900
And, that begs the question,
what's driving that difference?

59
00:02:22,671 --> 00:02:23,504
(mouse clicking)

60
00:02:23,504 --> 00:02:25,090
And the difference is really this.

61
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:28,100
We need to understand what levers to pull

62
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,210
from control perspective and in what order

63
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:31,973
because order sometimes matters,

64
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:36,600
to achieve the organization's
risk management objectives.

65
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:41,260
And, and knowing which levers to pull

66
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:44,630
and what we're getting
for that, those actions,

67
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:48,380
those decisions is really where
we struggle as a profession

68
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:50,570
at least to be consistent.

69
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,260
(mouse clicking)

70
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,954
But again, there's a reason for that.

71
00:02:53,955 --> 00:02:55,540
(mouse clicking)

72
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,970
First we have to define
what we mean by value.

73
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:01,470
And in the definition I found to work and,

74
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:05,310
and stand up under, under
close scrutiny is this.

75
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,540
You know the value of
any control boils down to

76
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:12,179
how much risk it reduces,
either directly or indirectly.

77
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,860
And we'll get into that more in a minute.

78
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,270
But, here's essentially
the definition of value

79
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:19,840
that I found to work really effectively.

80
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,010
(mouse clicking)

81
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:25,540
And if that's true, then we
can ask ourselves back to those

82
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,570
initial questions.

83
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:30,566
We can ask ourselves, well
if we understand value to be

84
00:03:30,566 --> 00:03:33,180
how much risk is reduced then
we should be able to look

85
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,507
at a control like this from ISO and say,

86
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:39,236
"All right, here's how
much less risk we have."

87
00:03:39,236 --> 00:03:41,079
(mouse clicking)

88
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:45,210
But again, I haven't found anybody who's

89
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:48,640
been able to do that in
a way that stands out.

90
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,744
And there's more to this.

91
00:03:50,745 --> 00:03:51,650
(mouse clicking)

92
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:54,300
So let's use that analogy
to drive the point home.

93
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:59,230
So if you're a physician,
we're looking at medicine

94
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:01,079
as a professional practice.

95
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,720
Which is more important?

96
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,480
Is it anatomy or physiology?

97
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,369
Well, neither.

98
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:08,203
You need both.

99
00:04:08,203 --> 00:04:10,530
You need to know the parts
of the system, the bones,

100
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:13,080
the muscles, blood vessels,
the different organs

101
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:13,960
and whatnot.

102
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:17,579
But you also need to know,
how those components work

103
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:21,159
both individually and as a system, okay?

104
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,430
And that's what's been missing
for us as a, as a profession.

105
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:29,360
So we have, you know if we
look at, again to extend this,

106
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,010
this, this medical analogy.

107
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:33,736
We can look at the spleen and we can say,

108
00:04:33,737 --> 00:04:37,140
"All right, we know roughly
where it should sit in the,

109
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:39,440
in the body and what it should look like,

110
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,700
you know sort of the
characteristics of it."

111
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:45,690
And we can infer even
role at service because

112
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:47,719
hey, maybe we've seen over the years that

113
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,770
people with a dysfunctional
or missing spleen

114
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:53,419
are more prone to infection, right?

115
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,690
So we say, "Well, it must have
a role in the immune system."

116
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:58,513
But that doesn't mean
we know how it works.

117
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:04,170
If we look at physiology,
we can understand that it

118
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:07,160
filters blood via two things
called white pulp and red pulp.

119
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,560
I'm not gonna get into the details there.

120
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,300
But that's how it's doing this,

121
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,990
how it's supporting the immune system.

122
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:15,260
(mouse clicking)

123
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:18,909
But it's also dependent on
arteries and veins and nerves

124
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:23,026
and et cetera that make
up the rest of the system.

125
00:05:23,026 --> 00:05:25,290
And there are parts of
the system too that are

126
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:28,740
highly dependent upon this
performing its function well,

127
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:29,573
right?

128
00:05:29,573 --> 00:05:31,849
Anything that is susceptible to infection

129
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:34,090
which is pretty much everything,

130
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:35,991
depends on the spleen to some degree.

131
00:05:35,991 --> 00:05:36,949
(mouse clicking)

132
00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:41,110
The good news is, if it's
dysfunctional or missing

133
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:43,770
in some fashion, there are
other parts of the system

134
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:46,202
that can to some degree make up for it.

135
00:05:46,202 --> 00:05:47,035
(mouse clicking)

136
00:05:47,035 --> 00:05:50,510
And my point here is that,
it is part of the system.

137
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:53,740
We, even if we understand
how it works independently,

138
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:58,320
you know just within its
own boundaries so to speak,

139
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,849
that's still not enough
to practice medicine.

140
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:03,283
But we have to understand
the bigger picture,

141
00:06:03,283 --> 00:06:05,991
the systemic effects both
upstream and downstream

142
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:10,518
from this, from this component
or this anatomical part.

143
00:06:10,518 --> 00:06:11,500
(mouse clicking)

144
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,643
Now if we look at
cybersecurity again back to

145
00:06:13,643 --> 00:06:17,619
sort of this awareness training element.

146
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:20,700
We can say anatomically
we know sort of the,

147
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:24,490
the things that are often
times contained within it.

148
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:26,669
You know maybe how often it's given.

149
00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:27,590
(mouse clicking)

150
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:32,582
And we can infer or, or, or,

151
00:06:33,881 --> 00:06:37,116
I suspect what you know,
what its benefits are.

152
00:06:37,116 --> 00:06:38,763
The purpose if you will.

153
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:42,943
But if we wanna look at it
from a physiology perspective,

154
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,780
(mouse clicking)

155
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:46,010
then we need to understand
that it's communicating

156
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:50,106
expectations and approved
methods, to personnel.

157
00:06:50,106 --> 00:06:51,120
(mouse clicking)

158
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,240
But it's dependent upon,
things upstream from it.

159
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,790
It depends upon, hey, the
policies that it's communicating.

160
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:59,310
Have they been defined?

161
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:01,070
Are they the right policies?

162
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:04,219
Risk appetite that drives maybe how often

163
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,040
where this training takes place.

164
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:10,700
What the expectations are
in terms of pass-fail rate.

165
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,400
We have to also

166
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,929
or there's dependency
on the risk measurement.

167
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:16,790
Again to know how much this matters.

168
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:18,000
Which drives?

169
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,900
How often it should take place.

170
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,630
What you deem acceptable.

171
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:23,190
Pass-fail rate and those sorts of things.

172
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:26,130
So, there are all these
things upstream from it

173
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:29,659
that this is dependent
upon to really serve

174
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:30,868
its purpose well.

175
00:07:30,868 --> 00:07:32,630
(mouse clicking)

176
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:35,020
But then there are the
things downstream from it

177
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:37,450
that depend upon it to be working well.

178
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:40,050
And that is things like
authentication because

179
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:42,170
after all, what's the
easiest way to get a password

180
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,760
if you have to fish for it?

181
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,593
Okay.

182
00:07:44,593 --> 00:07:48,270
Or to get into, compromise the endpoint,

183
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,490
phishing, these sorts of things.

184
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:51,760
So, there are all these other components

185
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,130
in the risk landscape
that are dependent upon

186
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:55,588
this working well.

187
00:07:55,588 --> 00:07:57,450
(mouse clicking)

188
00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:01,474
The good news however,
is that in some cases,

189
00:08:01,475 --> 00:08:04,660
deficiency and awareness
training may be partially

190
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:07,470
compensated for by other controls.

191
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:09,403
Again, the bottom line here is that,

192
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,680
this thing works as
part of a larger system.

193
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,030
And if we wanted to understand
how much of this matters,

194
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:18,539
we have to understand how well the,

195
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,340
rest of the system is working.

196
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,859
The things upstream that
this is dependent upon

197
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,730
and the things that are
compensating controls perhaps

198
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:28,459
that would make up for a weakness here.

199
00:08:28,459 --> 00:08:30,370
(mouse clicking)

200
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:35,370
And again, from my perspective,
my argument is that

201
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,760
as a profession we have,
these controls frameworks.

202
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,760
The ISO and the CSF 800-53
and PCI DSS and the CIS Top 20

203
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,640
and HIGHTRUST.

204
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,740
These control frameworks are anatomic.

205
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,460
Incredibly important, incredibly useful

206
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:58,650
but their anatomy, they
don't get into physiology

207
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:00,263
in any meaningful way.

208
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:04,310
And as a result, we the
practitioner have to,

209
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:07,709
essentially through our
intuition and experience

210
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:10,400
fill in the gaps for physiology.

211
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,579
And the more I've gotten
into this whole notion

212
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,990
of control's physiology
and really dug into it

213
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:16,380
to try and understand it.

214
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:19,110
The more I've realized
that in almost 40 years,

215
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:21,923
40 years of practice in this profession,

216
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,700
I was missing a whole lot.

217
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:29,290
I, my, my understanding of
the system, the physiology

218
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:33,740
was really incomplete and inconsistent.

219
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:38,740
And, and you know, I'm not
gonna make the claim that

220
00:09:39,001 --> 00:09:40,610
I'm the best practitioner in the world.

221
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:41,920
I'm sure I'm not.

222
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,920
But, I can confidently say
that because our profession

223
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:49,543
hasn't focused on this
dimension of our problem,

224
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,450
you know the vast majority
of people in our profession,

225
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:58,720
the vast majority, likewise
have an incomplete and,

226
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,720
and very often incorrect
interpretation or understanding

227
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:07,040
of this notion of physiology.

228
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,251
And it's just never been formally defined.

229
00:10:09,251 --> 00:10:11,060
(mouse clicking)

230
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:13,199
Which is what I'm here
to try to begin to fix.

231
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,600
So I've been for years now, working on,

232
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,040
trying to understand controls

233
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,800
from an analytic performance perspective.

234
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,859
And I've come up with
what I'm referring to as

235
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:27,003
the FAIR Control's Analytics
Model, the FAIR-CAM.

236
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:30,437
And that's what I'm
introducing here today.

237
00:10:30,437 --> 00:10:31,270
(clearing throat)

238
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:32,795
(mouse clicking)

239
00:10:32,795 --> 00:10:37,079
And the objectives really are
to enable reliable measurement

240
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,180
of control value and efficacy.

241
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,199
So that we can be making better decisions

242
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,373
and better use of our resources,
our limited resources.

243
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,450
Be able to validate control efficacy

244
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:50,010
because we might believe one thing,

245
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:53,100
but hey, how about
validating it empirically?

246
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:56,190
And again, that's one of the
criteria I set for myself

247
00:10:56,190 --> 00:11:00,000
in developing this, is you
know the elements in this

248
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,594
have to support empirical validation.

249
00:11:03,594 --> 00:11:06,030
(mouse clicking)

250
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:11,030
It has to account for both
the individual functions

251
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:15,110
of a control as well as
the systemic functions

252
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,297
of the control landscape.

253
00:11:16,297 --> 00:11:17,600
(mouse clicking)

254
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,600
And all of this then helps us
to better use the telemetry

255
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,760
that we have.

256
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:27,150
But it also, has pointed out to me that

257
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:31,120
much of the telemetry we have
isn't the telemetry we need.

258
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,660
So this can help us to
identify opportunities

259
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,100
from a security telemetry perspective.

260
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:41,100
And, and certainly far better
apply the telemetry we have.

261
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,810
Now I know there are
technologies today that, that,

262
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:49,109
you know are doing risk
measurement automatically,

263
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:52,010
you know by taking telemetry data.

264
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:55,760
And I, and I promise you,
I absolutely guarantee you

265
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,060
they haven't got it right.

266
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:01,150
And unless they've developed this as well

267
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:03,319
and simply haven't, haven't shared it.

268
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,670
That's always a possibility but again,

269
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:09,319
from everything I've seen,
I have no expectation

270
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,085
that that's the case.

271
00:12:11,085 --> 00:12:12,940
(mouse clicking)

272
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,957
Now I need (mumbles)
speaking of expectations.

273
00:12:14,957 --> 00:12:16,970
And I wanna set some expectations now

274
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:20,490
because I continually get
hammered by people telling me

275
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,670
how we need to make it simpler.

276
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:22,979
We need to make it simpler.

277
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:23,813
And I get that.

278
00:12:23,813 --> 00:12:26,003
You know I like things simple too.

279
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:30,750
But we have to remember,
modern medicine isn't complex

280
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,920
because the doctors got
all nerdy, all right?

281
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,449
It's complex because human
pathology and physiology

282
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:39,263
is inherently complex.

283
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:43,709
And if we want to manage our problem space

284
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:45,580
which is also really complex.

285
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,190
If we wanna manage it effectively,

286
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:50,470
if we wanna have our own
form of effective medicine,

287
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,310
then we have to understand it deeply.

288
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:55,209
We have to understand these
complexities and the subtleties

289
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:58,570
and nuances that, you know exist in a,

290
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,530
in a system like this.

291
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:05,209
And, there's simply isn't
any easy button for security.

292
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:09,020
As much as we might wish
otherwise, there just isn't one.

293
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:12,252
And that isn't to say that, that we can't,

294
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:15,920
once we understand things deeply

295
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,022
we understand the complexity
and the nuances and subtleties.

296
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,709
From there, we can simplify.

297
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:23,570
We can make informed choices

298
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:26,757
towards simplification
without losing efficacy.

299
00:13:26,757 --> 00:13:30,560
We can develop our version
of field medicine if we will,

300
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,392
all right?

301
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:35,370
The medics in medicine, field medics,

302
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:37,780
they're practicing simpler diagnostics

303
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:41,470
and simpler treatments but
those simplicities are based on

304
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:43,580
a deeper understanding, right?

305
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,810
If, if you don't have
that deeper understanding,

306
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:49,319
what you will end up with is
blood, bloodletting you know,

307
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,153
and shamanism.

308
00:13:50,153 --> 00:13:54,020
And, and that's just not
where we need to be as a,

309
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:54,853
as a profession.

310
00:13:54,853 --> 00:13:58,300
So, we need to understand
it deeply and from there,

311
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,810
find ways to simplify it.

312
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:02,959
And I've already in developing
this and working with it

313
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,813
begun to see opportunities there.

314
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:08,930
But again, don't be put off
by the fact that this is more

315
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:10,943
complex than what we're used to.

316
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:13,752
Our problem spaces are
just simply complex.

317
00:14:13,752 --> 00:14:16,120
(mouse clicking)

318
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,313
And I love this quote from Einstein.

319
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,819
Oddly enough, he didn't exactly say this.

320
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:28,820
His sentence was ironically
enough way more complicated

321
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:29,653
than this.

322
00:14:29,653 --> 00:14:32,140
This is a boiled down
version of his sentence

323
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:36,380
but I'll leave that to you to
look up if you're interested.

324
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,697
But the premise is absolutely true.

325
00:14:38,697 --> 00:14:39,900
(mouse clicking)

326
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,840
So let's clarify a couple
of terms before we even go

327
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,673
any further.

328
00:14:43,673 --> 00:14:47,960
So, threats and asset
combined create risk for us.

329
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,870
(mouse clicking)

330
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:52,270
So we put controls in place
to manage the frequency

331
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,630
and magnitude of loss.

332
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:55,553
And that's, that's what controls are.

333
00:14:55,553 --> 00:14:58,060
They are anything that
directly or indirectly

334
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:00,199
affect the frequency or magnitude of loss.

335
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,260
And that's a fairly broad brush

336
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,540
but there's a reason for that.

337
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:06,439
And again, we won't be able to get into,

338
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,400
some of the reasons for
that broad brush here today

339
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,689
simply because of time constraints.

340
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:15,700
But, you know this, this
definition is what it is

341
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:19,690
for what I believe to
be very good reasons.

342
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:21,840
These are examples of the
kinds of things we're used to

343
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,060
in our profession, right?

344
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:25,941
These are the things we live
and breathe day in and day out.

345
00:15:25,942 --> 00:15:27,170
(mouse clicking)

346
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:30,910
Control functions are how
controls affect the frequency

347
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,500
or magnitude of loss.

348
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,450
And here's some examples.

349
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:35,283
Now, wait a minute.

350
00:15:35,283 --> 00:15:36,327
Some of you are going to be saying,

351
00:15:36,327 --> 00:15:39,810
"Hey, we've been using
these terms forever.

352
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:42,007
So we are doing physiology."

353
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,155
Let's look that a little more closely.

354
00:15:45,155 --> 00:15:48,329
(mouse clicking)

355
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:51,330
So let's look at the control
functions as designed

356
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:53,033
or defined by NIST CSF, right?

357
00:15:53,033 --> 00:15:56,250
They have the identify, prevent,
detect, respond, recover,

358
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,083
okay?

359
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:58,079
(mouse clicking)

360
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,319
Well some problems related to this are

361
00:16:00,319 --> 00:16:05,050
they don't differentiate
between those or within them.

362
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:06,719
They don't differentiate functions that

363
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,040
directly versus indirectly affect risk.

364
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,434
And if you don't understand
those interactions

365
00:16:12,434 --> 00:16:15,230
and the difference between
direct and indirect

366
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:18,430
effect on risk, you're not,
you're not going to be able

367
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:19,589
to measure control value.

368
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:23,040
You're not going to understand
the problem clearly enough

369
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,509
or deeply enough to
make good measurements.

370
00:16:26,509 --> 00:16:28,370
(mouse clicking)

371
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:30,560
Doesn't account for
dependencies between controls

372
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,729
as upstate, upstream and
downstream effects, et cetera.

373
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:34,690
(mouse clicking)

374
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:36,157
And it's not nearly granular enough.

375
00:16:36,157 --> 00:16:40,080
As you'll see it as we go
along here in the session,

376
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,650
we'll see some much greater granularity.

377
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:48,050
And, and again there's,
it's not Jack being nerdy,

378
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:51,560
that granularity is there
because it had to be to capture

379
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,839
really important
subtleties and nuances or,

380
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,120
or difference in units of measurement

381
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,270
to account for how controls affect risk.

382
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:00,370
(mouse clicking)

383
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:04,127
Now, some of you who are
familiar with 800-53 might say,

384
00:17:04,127 --> 00:17:08,196
"Hey, well those controls
talk about related controls."

385
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,010
Yes they do.

386
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:14,079
But they don't say anything
about what that relationship is.

387
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,869
How they're related to one another.

388
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:17,319
Are they similar?

389
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:19,569
Are they dependent on one
another in one direction,

390
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:21,030
in both directions?

391
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:22,109
Again, it doesn't go there.

392
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:24,262
It doesn't get into the physiology.

393
00:17:24,262 --> 00:17:25,193
(mouse clicking)

394
00:17:25,193 --> 00:17:29,860
And then threat kill chains
are interesting because

395
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:33,979
it's scratching the
surface of this notion of,

396
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:37,240
of effects, right?

397
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:41,350
The effects that control has
on, on a loss in that scenario.

398
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:43,966
But it's very tightly
focused on that scenario

399
00:17:43,967 --> 00:17:46,740
and it really doesn't talk
about upstream and downstream

400
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,140
effects and dependencies again.

401
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:51,960
So it's, it's nibbling at
the edges, but it's, it's,

402
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:55,961
a long, long way from
getting to the core of it.

403
00:17:55,961 --> 00:17:57,730
(mouse clicking)

404
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:02,730
So in FAIR-CAM, we have
a loss event model,

405
00:18:03,443 --> 00:18:06,080
a loss event control model of the,

406
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,960
for the controls that directly affect

407
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,070
the frequency or magnitude of loss.

408
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:12,189
And for those of you who've,

409
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:14,790
who've read the book I
co-authored with Jack Freund

410
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:19,010
a few years ago, in Chapter
11 there's, about controls.

411
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:22,180
And, and you'll see that
some of this looks familiar

412
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,620
to what's in that chapter.

413
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:27,649
But, unfortunately that
chapter was written in

414
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:32,320
very early stages of my
work, my research around

415
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,370
control's analytics.

416
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:35,943
And even though it's
directionally correct,

417
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,879
it's profoundly incomplete.

418
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,160
And there are a number of
things I got wrong in there.

419
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:47,160
So, FAIR-CAM is in part a
correction to that chapter,

420
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,690
much more completely
flashed out and tested

421
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:55,690
and it stands up and is actually useful.

422
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:59,504
So, so we have our loss and then controls,

423
00:18:59,504 --> 00:19:01,296
those that directly affect the frequency

424
00:19:01,297 --> 00:19:02,500
and magnitude of loss.

425
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,580
And we'll see more of that in a second.

426
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:08,210
And then we have decision
controls and variance controls.

427
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:11,646
And decision controls,
and you'll see here that,

428
00:19:11,646 --> 00:19:16,200
from the arrows in the diagram
that decision controls affect

429
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,990
decisions about loss event
controls or variance controls

430
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:21,080
or even other decision controls.

431
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,090
And variance controls
affect the reliability

432
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:25,409
of loss event controls
and decision controls

433
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:28,320
and even other variance controls.

434
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,275
So we have this you know,

435
00:19:30,276 --> 00:19:31,470
(mouse clicking)

436
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:36,430
complex interacted system
or interconnected system of,

437
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:38,350
of control elements.

438
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:43,350
And, and the intent here
is just to illustrate

439
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:47,312
some of these relationships
at a high level.

440
00:19:47,313 --> 00:19:50,260
(mouse clicking)

441
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:53,210
So if we look at loss event
controls ontology, and

442
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:57,280
and I need to point out and I
will point out again and again

443
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,190
as we go through these,
this is a partial ontology.

444
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:05,130
The, the, the RSA conference
program committee encouraged me

445
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:09,240
to simplify my slides and then,
pair back as much as I could

446
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,460
without sort of losing the essence.

447
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:15,980
So the ontologies I'm sharing
today are just partial.

448
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,163
They're not complete.

449
00:20:17,163 --> 00:20:20,710
That'll come later.

450
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:25,240
So anyway, here again you
see prevention, detection

451
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,073
and response.

452
00:20:26,073 --> 00:20:29,070
Not rocket science, not new,
until you look below that.

453
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:33,120
And the model begins to be parsed out into

454
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,590
more granularity so that
we can make distinctions,

455
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:37,610
really important distinctions between

456
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:38,990
how different controls work.

457
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:41,520
And very often these distinctions also

458
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,750
mean that they're different
units of measurement.

459
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:46,160
So we see here under
prevention we have avoidance,

460
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,398
deterrence and resistance.

461
00:20:47,398 --> 00:20:48,231
(mouse clicking)

462
00:20:48,231 --> 00:20:50,851
Under detection we have
visibility and monitoring.

463
00:20:50,851 --> 00:20:51,684
(mouse clicking)

464
00:20:51,684 --> 00:20:55,460
And under response we have
resilience and loss reduction.

465
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,558
So let's look at this in context,

466
00:20:57,558 --> 00:20:59,629
in the context of the loss event scenario.

467
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:03,490
So in a, in a loss event we
have this chain of things

468
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:04,430
that happen.

469
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:09,430
Some threat actor affects
assets resulting in losses

470
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,110
that have primary or
secondary effects, okay?

471
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:16,350
And from a control perspective
we can prevent these

472
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:19,389
from occurring to some
degree or we can mitigate

473
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:20,750
their effects.

474
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:23,765
So if we apply that loss
event control ontology,

475
00:21:23,765 --> 00:21:24,598
(mouse clicking)

476
00:21:24,598 --> 00:21:29,149
we can see that avoidance
control reduces contact frequency

477
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:30,480
with threat agents.

478
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,130
And if you're familiar with FAIR,

479
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:34,500
this will be old news to you.

480
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,273
If you're not familiar with FAIR,

481
00:21:36,273 --> 00:21:38,129
this may not be as clear to you.

482
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,610
But the bottom line is here.

483
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:42,790
Avoidance controls help
us to reduce the frequency

484
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:45,450
or probability of contact
with threat agents.

485
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:48,450
Deterrence controls reduce
the probability of action

486
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:52,140
on their part if they do come
into contact with an asset.

487
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:55,040
And then resistant controls
help us to resist their actions

488
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,770
if and in fact they try to act in a,

489
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:01,037
illicit or malicious fashion.

490
00:22:01,037 --> 00:22:01,870
(mouse clicking)

491
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:04,790
And detection controls allow
us to have timely response

492
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,450
to all of this.

493
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,940
Having, we need to have
visibility into this

494
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:11,570
and we need to be monitoring
those logs, et cetera.

495
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:12,960
Somebody has to be looking at them

496
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,940
or they aren't really
serving their purpose.

497
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:21,120
And response controls which
reduce the loss magnitude.

498
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,969
There's resilience if it's an
outage event or loss of data,

499
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:25,410
those sorts of things.

500
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:27,710
That allows us to get
back in, back in action

501
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:29,590
sooner rather than later.

502
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:32,199
And loss reduction allows
us to recover some losses

503
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,380
in some cases.

504
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:35,730
And again, especially
the loss magnitude side

505
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:38,820
of what you're seeing here is incomplete,

506
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:41,780
but you know this would become
even more of an eye chart

507
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,101
if it was fully fleshed out.

508
00:22:43,101 --> 00:22:46,140
(mouse clicking)

509
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,997
So the various management controls has a,

510
00:22:47,997 --> 00:22:49,727
has similar ontology.

511
00:22:49,727 --> 00:22:52,420
And I did not parse this
out into deeper layers

512
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,960
of abstraction here.

513
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:58,440
Again, simply to, to simplify the slides.

514
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,220
And then because we just
don't have enough time

515
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,910
to go through all that but,

516
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:03,844
but they go to deeper
levels of abstraction

517
00:23:03,844 --> 00:23:07,840
but you can see sort of
which controls begin to fit

518
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,470
in which part of the ontology.

519
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:10,303
(mouse clicking)

520
00:23:10,303 --> 00:23:12,890
And you may find that
some controls actually

521
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:16,850
exist in more than one
element in the ontology

522
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:19,590
or even across multiple ontologies.

523
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:22,860
And, and that's simply
because some technologies

524
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:25,100
and some processes that we put in place

525
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:28,600
do serve more than one
risk management function

526
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,070
or fulfill more than one
risk management function

527
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:32,639
which is a good thing.

528
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:37,591
But understanding you know
the, which functions it serves

529
00:23:37,591 --> 00:23:41,139
and how well it serves those functions.

530
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,630
You know, if we don't understand that

531
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:44,830
in that broader application of a control

532
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:49,260
and fulfillment of its of its purpose,

533
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,680
then we can't measure its value.

534
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:54,690
So again, we have to understand
that these deeper levels

535
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:55,958
of abstraction.

536
00:23:55,958 --> 00:23:57,330
(mouse clicking)

537
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:59,300
And the same thing for
decision support controls.

538
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:03,419
And this is actually,
you won't see it here

539
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:07,047
but this is actually the most
complex part of the model.

540
00:24:07,047 --> 00:24:11,370
And it goes to several layers,
a deeper abstraction here

541
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:12,693
than, than this.

542
00:24:12,693 --> 00:24:17,693
And, and it's, it's, it's the
part of the model that I think

543
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,833
most people will be,

544
00:24:21,272 --> 00:24:26,272
we'll find we've ignored or
misunderstood as a profession.

545
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,360
And, you know things like risk appetite.

546
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:33,310
How do they affect risk and policies

547
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:36,283
and the risk measurement for that matter?

548
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:41,400
Being able to identify when
decisions are misaligned

549
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,840
with objectives and so on.

550
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,159
And then how do we correct all that?

551
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:49,480
So, again I apologize for (clears throat)

552
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:53,230
not really having time to
go into deeper detail here.

553
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:55,990
But what I'm trying to do is
really just open your eyes

554
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:58,690
to the fact that this is in my opinion,

555
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:03,690
a pretty significant gap in
our, in our knowledge base and,

556
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:07,020
and how we operate as a profession.

557
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,407
And we need to close that.

558
00:25:08,407 --> 00:25:10,820
And so this is a heads
up, in this presentation.

559
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:15,820
This 40 minutes is, is meant
to open, open people's eyes

560
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:19,290
to the fact that we've been
missing control physiology

561
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:20,510
and we need to close that gap

562
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:22,817
and that's what FAIR-CAM is all about.

563
00:25:22,817 --> 00:25:24,060
(mouse clicking)

564
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:28,058
So, coming back to this notion
of value of the control,

565
00:25:28,058 --> 00:25:30,317
let's take anti-phishing training.

566
00:25:30,317 --> 00:25:31,150
(mouse clicking)

567
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:34,160
Well the purpose, it reduces
probability of people

568
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,420
clicking on stuff they
shouldn't click on, right?

569
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:38,830
(mouse clicking)

570
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:41,030
The functional domain
back to the you know,

571
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:43,620
the loss event control,
variance management controls

572
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:45,550
and decision support controls.

573
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:47,940
Which of those does this fit into?

574
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:51,580
Most people and in fact
me, in the beginning

575
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:54,117
I would have said, "Well,
this is a loss event control

576
00:25:54,117 --> 00:25:55,570
and it's resistive."

577
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:57,159
No. (laughs)

578
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,880
The personnel who are
looking at the email,

579
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,390
they're the resistive control.

580
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:02,940
This is a variance management.

581
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:06,590
This is making that control better, okay?

582
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:09,720
So reducing the probability
of failure of that control,

583
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,400
that human control.

584
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,360
(mouse clicking)

585
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,736
And it does it by communicating
policies and expectations

586
00:26:16,737 --> 00:26:19,680
and the indicators of phishing
and all that good stuff,

587
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,513
right?

588
00:26:20,513 --> 00:26:23,350
That's how it actually operates.

589
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:24,300
(mouse clicking)

590
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:26,669
But it depends upon these
other parts of the system,

591
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:28,420
risk appetite policies, et cetera.

592
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,550
Things I've talked about before.

593
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:30,530
Threat intelligence.

594
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:33,420
What do phishing attacks look like, right?

595
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:35,820
Those have to be in place
and working for this

596
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,248
to function effectively.

597
00:26:37,248 --> 00:26:38,760
(mouse clicking)

598
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,519
And if this isn't functioning effectively,

599
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:43,450
then there are things downstream
from a control perspective

600
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:45,132
that suffer from that, right?

601
00:26:45,132 --> 00:26:50,010
Authentication, system security
and those sorts of things.

602
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:53,030
But fortunately again,
if this is deficient

603
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:56,460
there may be other controls in
place that help to compensate

604
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,230
for that to some degree.

605
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:00,272
And, and again if we wanna understand,

606
00:27:00,272 --> 00:27:05,272
if we wanna be able to
understand and put a number to

607
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:10,530
a real number, a real number. (laughs)

608
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:13,010
That add value to anti-phishing training,

609
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:15,210
we have to understand the system.

610
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:17,730
We have to understand
the physiology around it.

611
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:22,730
Otherwise, whatever we put
forth should not be considered

612
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,030
reliable, all right?

613
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:26,676
We have to understand the rest of this.

614
00:27:26,676 --> 00:27:28,139
(mouse clicking)

615
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:31,703
So here we see sort of,
application of this in that,

616
00:27:31,703 --> 00:27:34,180
in that diagram I showed earlier.

617
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:36,820
So the personnel's ability
to recognize phishing,

618
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:39,460
that's the loss event control, okay?

619
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,430
The human control in this case.

620
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:43,140
And in order to understand the value,

621
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:48,140
first thing we have to do
is, is, is be explicit about

622
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:51,080
what the context is for determining value.

623
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,990
And it's, has to do with
the loss events scenarios

624
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:55,450
where that control is relevant.

625
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:58,190
And maybe that's ransomware
or maybe it's a data breach

626
00:27:58,190 --> 00:27:59,427
or both, right?

627
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:02,352
But we have to have that
context in order to,

628
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:05,010
to measure value.

629
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:08,540
But again as I've said,
we also have to understand

630
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:10,050
the other controls that are in place,

631
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:13,210
that are also relevant to
those scenarios, right?

632
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:17,260
Because they share the
load so to speak, right?

633
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:20,543
It isn't just anti-phishing
training that's keeping us from,

634
00:28:20,543 --> 00:28:23,520
from falling, you know
victim to the bad guys.

635
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,370
It's these other things as well.

636
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:28,040
And those things are
dependent on these things

637
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,375
and those things.

638
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:32,010
And if we have a
deficiency maybe down here,

639
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:33,433
in this part of the system,

640
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:38,540
then that can affect the
efficacy of controls elsewhere.

641
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:43,540
Okay so, if we want to
understand and measure and manage

642
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:47,090
this part of the risk
and the controls part

643
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:50,070
of the risk landscape, we
have to understand physiology.

644
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:50,903
We have to.

645
00:28:51,835 --> 00:28:53,390
(mouse clicking)

646
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:55,223
So, wrapping this up then.

647
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:58,820
(mouse clicking)

648
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:03,120
You know, we as a profession
have been focusing on anatomy

649
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,695
and really leaving
physiology to the intuition

650
00:29:05,695 --> 00:29:08,220
and experience of professionals.

651
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,340
And you know there are,

652
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:12,230
I've encountered people in
the profession who've been in,

653
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:15,220
in this business for a long, long time.

654
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:19,240
And have developed a really
good intuitive sense of,

655
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:23,090
of sort of the systemic workings, okay?

656
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:27,139
But, this problem space
is way more complex than,

657
00:29:27,139 --> 00:29:31,290
than I understood it to be
before I got into you know,

658
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:34,810
really trying to dig into
this dimension of it.

659
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:39,419
And so unless you know, unless
there are people out there

660
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:43,590
who just, their intuition is
that much better than mine,

661
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:46,439
which certainly impossible,
but there aren't gonna be

662
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,340
that many of them.

663
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:50,470
At least that I've run across.

664
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:53,840
And, and even then they
may know it intuitively

665
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,610
but they can't draw it out
and explain it consistently

666
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:57,610
or clearly.

667
00:29:57,610 --> 00:30:00,139
They can't share that
understanding with others.

668
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:02,050
And most of the people in our profession

669
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,990
haven't been around long enough yet

670
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:06,330
to develop those instincts
and those intuitions

671
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:08,050
and that understanding.

672
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:10,850
So as a result again,

673
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:15,850
without formally documenting
and, and researching

674
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:22,430
and proving out this control's
physiology dimension,

675
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:28,330
the odds of getting it wrong
are really, really high.

676
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:31,737
And I see all kinds of evidence
of that right and left,

677
00:30:31,738 --> 00:30:34,740
as I've looked at control's physiology

678
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,520
and then look at breach scenario you know,

679
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,740
the breaches that have occurred.

680
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:40,373
And I can begin to look at, sort of, as,

681
00:30:40,373 --> 00:30:43,380
as I see a description of the
things that weren't in row

682
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,920
or that weren't in place or
that weren't working well

683
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,260
within an organization.

684
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:50,530
I'm going, "Okay. You
know, there's a connection,

685
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:52,230
there's connection,
there's connection," right?

686
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:55,327
We have to understand
anatomy and physiology.

687
00:30:55,327 --> 00:30:57,360
(mouse clicking)

688
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:02,360
And again as I've said, we've
just been focusing on anatomy.

689
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:06,156
And FAIR-CAM is trying to fill that gap.

690
00:31:06,156 --> 00:31:08,052
(mouse clicking)

691
00:31:08,052 --> 00:31:11,959
And imagine, you know if you will,

692
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,630
how empowering it would
be to know which controls

693
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:18,320
really deserve and warrant
additional investment.

694
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:22,980
And which ones we can
deprioritize or retire altogether

695
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:25,950
so that we are, you know we're able to be

696
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:29,780
far more cost-effective
in how we do what we do.

697
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:32,853
You know, that's when
we begin in my view to,

698
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:38,770
to really prove out the value
that we have as a profession

699
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:43,372
to our organizations.

700
00:31:43,372 --> 00:31:45,020
(mouse clicking)

701
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,950
So more to come on this.

702
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:48,802
A white paper,

703
00:31:48,802 --> 00:31:53,802
God willing we'll publish a
white paper in mid-October

704
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:57,490
that we'll have the complete ontologies.

705
00:31:57,490 --> 00:32:00,660
It'll go into great and glory
detail about control efficacy,

706
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,363
how it's defined and measured.

707
00:32:02,363 --> 00:32:03,810
(mouse clicking)

708
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:07,471
It'll go into detail about
the many really interesting

709
00:32:07,471 --> 00:32:11,030
nuances and factors that
affect control efficacy.

710
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:13,923
Again, many of which we do not deal with,

711
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:18,170
explicitly or very effectively
as a profession today.

712
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:19,070
(mouse clicking)

713
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:22,899
It talks, it'll show that
defense-in-depth can be measured

714
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,783
in four or five different ways,

715
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:27,450
distinctly different ways,

716
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:29,690
all of which are valid
and important to you.

717
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:32,640
And if we wanted to
leverage defense-in-depth,

718
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,854
we need to know these things.

719
00:32:33,854 --> 00:32:35,190
(mouse clicking)

720
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:38,280
It also has to account
for human behavior because

721
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:41,310
as long as humans are involved,

722
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:44,790
human behavior affects control efficacy.

723
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:47,740
So again, the model of
this paper will describe

724
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:51,153
how this model, how this
framework accounts for that.

725
00:32:51,153 --> 00:32:52,220
(mouse clicking)

726
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:56,690
And then of course, it'll
also get into mapping of,

727
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:59,950
of the different control
frameworks that we have today

728
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:04,469
to FAIR-CAM and more on that later.

729
00:33:04,469 --> 00:33:06,100
(mouse clicking)

730
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:08,030
Oh by the way, just FYI,

731
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:11,420
general membership in FAIR
Institute is currently free.

732
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:12,456
So I'm just saying.

733
00:33:12,456 --> 00:33:14,240
(mouse clicking)

734
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,630
So beginning of this week,
please, please please,

735
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:20,490
recognize that value of
any control boils down

736
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:23,751
how much it affects risk,
directly or indirectly, okay?

737
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:27,350
If a control doesn't affect
risk, then why are we doing it?

738
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:30,832
Why are we spending any money,
time or effort on it, okay?

739
00:33:30,833 --> 00:33:32,630
(mouse clicking)

740
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:36,240
Begin to think about controls
as this highly interconnected

741
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,856
system of parts.

742
00:33:37,856 --> 00:33:39,210
(mouse clicking)

743
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:42,340
Because if we don't have
this systemic view then,

744
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:44,530
we're really missing the picture.

745
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:46,889
And then become a finite
member of the FAIR Institute,

746
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:47,723
please.

747
00:33:47,723 --> 00:33:48,950
(mouse clicking)

748
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:50,483
Within the next three months,

749
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:54,380
start beginning, you know look
at the controls that you have

750
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:58,610
in place where you work
and begin thinking about,

751
00:33:58,610 --> 00:33:59,763
you know are they?

752
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,560
What do they dependent upon?

753
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,950
And what depends upon them?

754
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:07,170
Begin to build in your
own mind an understanding

755
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:11,230
of these dependencies, both
upstream and downstream.

756
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:14,830
And, keep in mind that many
controls serve more than

757
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:18,033
one physiological, physiological function.

758
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:22,949
For example, anti-malware
technologies tend to serve,

759
00:34:22,949 --> 00:34:26,120
they're like a little Swiss
Army knife of control functions.

760
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:29,230
You know everything from
resistance to detection and

761
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:33,760
to the well, resistance
visibility monitoring containment

762
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:38,350
from loss event controls.

763
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:40,469
And then from variance management controls

764
00:34:40,469 --> 00:34:43,580
they provide visibility and correct the,

765
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:46,620
identify, they support
identification and correction.

766
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:49,810
So again, you know as you're
thinking about controls,

767
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:52,960
don't be surprised if you're
looking at it as a technology

768
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,857
or, or, or control
function and you're saying,

769
00:34:55,857 --> 00:34:57,540
"But that serves more than one purpose."

770
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:59,422
Well, that's a good thing, okay?

771
00:34:59,422 --> 00:35:00,440
(mouse clicking)

772
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:04,456
And then, I know some of you are likely to

773
00:35:04,456 --> 00:35:07,775
go charging out and try to begin mapping,

774
00:35:07,775 --> 00:35:11,643
you know whatever control
framework you're using today

775
00:35:11,643 --> 00:35:13,690
to what I've shared.

776
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:15,670
And, I just wanna give you a heads up.

777
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:17,900
It's gonna be really
challenging and frustrating

778
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:18,970
and painful.

779
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:22,080
Because the control
frameworks that we have today

780
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:27,080
were never defined for, you
know to account for this

781
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:30,540
physiological dimension.

782
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:34,387
And so very, very often
many of those controls,

783
00:35:34,387 --> 00:35:36,650
the control descriptions in those,

784
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:40,670
are merging different
control's functions together.

785
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:44,600
And so mapping is really
messy and difficult and,

786
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,793
and frustrating.

787
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:51,299
Now I, I have almost completed
mapping the CIS Top 20

788
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:56,070
which is really 171 controls to FAIR-CAM.

789
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:59,420
And about 85% of them mapped cleanly,

790
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:02,570
relatively cleanly and easily too for CAM.

791
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:04,773
The other 15%, you know,

792
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,327
can't really be mapped.

793
00:36:08,327 --> 00:36:11,210
Simply because it's merging
too many things together

794
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:14,250
and, and that control description can map

795
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:17,140
to a bunch of different
things in FAIR-CAM.

796
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:20,029
And that's problematic from
a measurement perspective.

797
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:22,289
So, just heads up.

798
00:36:22,289 --> 00:36:23,470
(mouse clicking)

799
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:25,609
When you're looking at deficient controls,

800
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:27,750
whether it's an audit finding
or something, think about

801
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:31,930
again whether it's affecting
risk directly or indirectly.

802
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:34,379
Is it affecting reliability of controls

803
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:36,100
or decisions regarding controls?

804
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,049
These sorts of things.

805
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:40,043
And think about upstream
and downstream dependencies.

806
00:36:40,043 --> 00:36:40,900
(mouse clicking)

807
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:44,680
And then in six months,
we'd like to thank you,

808
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:47,109
go on and download and read the paper

809
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:51,430
and hopefully you'll find
that enlightening and that it

810
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:54,111
answers many of the questions
that you might have right now.

811
00:36:54,112 --> 00:36:55,060
(mouse clicking)

812
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:59,610
And begin talking about this
to your colleagues and such,

813
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:03,840
and, and just raising this
idea that there's this whole

814
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,100
other dimension to controls
that we need to start

815
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,736
paying attention to.

816
00:37:07,736 --> 00:37:09,330
(mouse clicking)

817
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:13,240
So that is, that is what
I have to share today.

818
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:16,049
I hope you found it
interesting and helpful

819
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:18,863
and I look forward to answering questions.

820
00:37:18,863 --> 00:37:19,696
Thank you.
