00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:14,030
- Please welcome Chief
Executive Officer of DEDUCE

3
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:15,719
Ari Jacoby

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,560
- Every hour over 50,000 consumers

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,700
suffer account takeover fraud.

6
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,890
It's a great time to be a
fraudster user credentials

7
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:25,810
and botnets are dirt cheap.

8
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:27,709
So account take over fraud will triple

9
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:31,343
in three years to a
projected $30 billion a year.

10
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:35,690
With proper credentials,
fraudsters impersonate

11
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:39,410
real users causing companies,
monetary losses, fines

12
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:41,599
and reputational damage.

13
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,320
Like, unless you're Google,
you don't have enough user

14
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,970
data to make an account log in decision.

15
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:49,363
You've got data poverty.

16
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,809
To beat a fraud network.

17
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:55,763
You need a bigger
authenticated user network.

18
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,250
Today, DEDUCE operates

19
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,560
the largest real time identity network

20
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,900
in the industry with over 150,000 sites

21
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:08,243
and 1 billion authenticated
user events a day.

22
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,960
On top of this collective
identity intelligence

23
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,610
we've democratized
suspicious logging, alerting.

24
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,370
Popularized by the internet
giants that asks for example;

25
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,680
was that you logging in from Brazil?

26
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,203
Um, No.

27
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,140
This innovative product uses
our identity network data

28
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:27,810
and learns from every interaction

29
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:31,460
whether it was or wasn't
the real user logging in.

30
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:34,580
Our patented technology
is deployed in four hours

31
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:37,560
gets smarter and smarter
and levels the playing field

32
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,383
for companies that need
to protect user accounts.

33
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:44,479
In just six months, with 35 customers

34
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,340
we're already securing the login

35
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,870
for 95 million people and stopping

36
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:51,860
two fraudsters for every 1000 logins.

37
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,023
That's real ROI.

38
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:57,350
By December we'll scale, the
secure 400 million accounts.

39
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:59,922
Eliminating 10 million frauds a year.

40
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:06,009
And we won't stop until we
break this cycle of data poverty

41
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:08,680
and share signals with every cyber company

42
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,203
that needs real time impaired credentials.

43
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,570
For illustration, last
week, Sally bought sneakers

44
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:18,209
on green shoes.com today she gets alerted

45
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:19,110
by another app.

46
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:21,640
Asking if she's logging in from China.

47
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,899
She presses 'No'. And
DEDUCE immediately shares

48
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,650
that privacy compliant data
with many cyber companies

49
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,670
one of which protects green shoes.

50
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:32,299
Everyone wins.

51
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:37,300
Sally, green shoes and the
allied cyber security industry.

52
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,850
And this traction is possible

53
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:44,680
because of our experienced
leadership team.

54
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,500
We built identity companies
together for 16 years

55
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,110
with two prior exits to public companies.

56
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,770
This is our third identity networks.

57
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:54,360
So we have an unfair advantage.

58
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,190
Let's unite as an industry
to make identity intelligence

59
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,790
a shared data currency.

60
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,750
There's a giant opportunity
to eliminate account

61
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:05,460
takeover fraud, and DEDUCE
enables every company to

62
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,980
contribute to our collective protection.

63
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,154
Thank you.

64
00:03:09,154 --> 00:03:11,737
