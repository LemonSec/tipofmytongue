00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:12,780
- [Announcer] Please welcome Co-founder

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,823
and VP of Product at Wiz,

5
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:18,263
Yinon Costica.

6
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:20,740
- Thank you very much.

7
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,080
Before I founded Wiz with my Co-founders,

8
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,139
we ran cloud security at Microsoft.

9
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,540
This is where we were responsible

10
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:28,780
for the cloud security products that we,

11
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:30,330
that Microsoft sells externally,

12
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,680
so customers can protect
themselves in the cloud,

13
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,680
but also the internal security

14
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,803
that Microsoft builds internally.

15
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:40,940
With the most important
thing that we've learned

16
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:44,460
is that cloud security
is rarely the result

17
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,260
of one single vulnerability,
one single misconfiguration.

18
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,910
It is actually the result
of multiple problems

19
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:56,870
that are all combined
together and are interrelated,

20
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:00,470
and this is what attackers
are actually exploiting.

21
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:02,930
The problem is that cloud
security tools today provide you

22
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:05,943
with a very narrow view
of the risk of your cloud.

23
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,640
It provides you a list of vulnerabilities,

24
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,030
a misconfiguration whereas the reality is

25
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,360
that you have a virtual machine
that is externally exposed

26
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,940
that has an exploitable
vulnerability on it.

27
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:21,120
And then, it has a secret that
allows for a lateral movement

28
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:25,660
into another bucket that
contains sensitive customer data.

29
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,399
The problem is that security tools today,

30
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,850
scan only for some of these things,

31
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:31,640
some of the other things they don't,

32
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,000
but the real problem is
that none of them is looking

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,490
at all of these things together.

34
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:39,030
So, security teams need
to manually correlate

35
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:41,240
and analyzing Tracy's attack vectors

36
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,509
in order to pinpoint to
the risk in their cloud.

37
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:46,880
And this is what Wiz does.

38
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,570
Wiz can automatically do
all of these analysis.

39
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:52,309
It connects to your cloud environment

40
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:54,260
and it analyzes the inventory

41
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:57,530
and performs a full vulnerability
assessment of your cloud

42
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:00,240
and analyze identities,
the secrets, the exposure,

43
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,960
and check the configuration

44
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,070
of any resource that
you have in the cloud,

45
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:07,669
whether it's a PaaS, a
serverless, a VM container

46
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:11,930
whether it translate AWS, Azure,
GCP, Kubernetes, OpenShift,

47
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:14,490
we scan all of them but
here is the breakthrough,

48
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:16,850
Wiz analyzes all of these together

49
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:20,950
in order to show you what are
the critical attack vectors

50
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:24,720
in your cloud environment
using a graph-based analysis.

51
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,870
And the way we do it is really unique.

52
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:31,100
We combine all of this information
using API-only approach

53
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:34,150
that allows you to analyze
the cloud configuration

54
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:36,320
and also the workloads themselves.

55
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,970
So we are without any agent were able

56
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:42,720
to achieve full coverage and
analyze your entire environment

57
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,830
in five minutes to deploy,

58
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:47,330
unlike agents where you
need to really pull teeth

59
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:48,930
in order to actually deploy it

60
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:50,650
on a fraction of your environment.

61
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:53,790
We have broader context so we
have all of the information.

62
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:57,593
So again, fewer, more meaningful alerts.

63
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,330
We are just a year, a
little bit over a year old

64
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:03,960
and we've been selling
the product for six months

65
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,990
and the response has been incredible.

66
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:08,033
One in 10th Fortune 100,

67
00:03:08,033 --> 00:03:11,109
500 companies is using the product today

68
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:13,820
and they tell us, this is
a cloud security product,

69
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,070
they've been waiting for.

70
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:19,009
We are here to make cloud
secure for any organization.

71
00:03:19,009 --> 00:03:21,933
Thank you.
