1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:02,430
- Really excited to be here today

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:06,590
and talk about what's going on
with this gig economy thing.

3
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:08,900
I hadn't heard about it a while back

4
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,360
and it really got me excited.

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,959
So this is James Christiansen.

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,660
I run our global strategy
team at Netskope.

7
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,820
Prior to that, I'd been a
practicing CSO for over 30 years.

8
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,330
I was the first CISO for General Motors.

9
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:23,950
I was the first CISO for Visa

10
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:26,300
and rolled out their security program.

11
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,980
And then experienced as
their chief security officer.

12
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,460
In all these roles I've always
had to battle the insider,

13
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:36,100
and the gig economy and the gig worker

14
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,270
is a new version of this insider

15
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:39,973
and presents a new insider threat.

16
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:45,620
Today we're gonna talk about
what is this gig economy

17
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,559
and who is this gig worker?

18
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,060
We're gonna talk about the
importance of risk management

19
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:51,430
in this gig economy.

20
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:54,880
Risk management's always
important, especially in this case.

21
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,840
We're gonna talk about how
do we create a gig worker

22
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,640
protection strategy.

23
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,720
And then what are the right tactics

24
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,363
to support that strategy?

25
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:09,119
So let me first introduce
what is the gig economy?

26
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,640
This gig economy is this trend of workers

27
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,560
becoming independent contractors
who freelance their skills.

28
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,090
You think about Uber and Lyft.

29
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:21,910
And when I first took an Uber or Lyft,

30
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:24,110
they were one or the other drivers.

31
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:26,010
And they're independent drivers.

32
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:28,150
If you notice lately,
when you get in an Uber

33
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:31,040
or Lyft driver, they're
driving for both companies.

34
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,060
So they are working
for direct competitors.

35
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,380
Well, that doesn't limit itself

36
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:36,729
just to that industry sector.

37
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:39,240
We're seeing that in the
business sector as well

38
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,110
with a number of new jobs.

39
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:44,770
So these organizations that
we're moving faster than ever.

40
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:47,289
So when you think about this gig worker,

41
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:48,780
the workers continue to evolve

42
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,930
and organizations are
hiring from anywhere.

43
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:55,130
They need these remote
skills and this freelancer

44
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:57,283
or a gig worker is filling that gap.

45
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:01,700
So as you think about
the changing work culture

46
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,150
and when I first started in business,

47
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,810
you were loyal to the company.

48
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:06,990
You know, we had at GM,

49
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,660
we had people that had
never had another job.

50
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,020
They'd worked for GM their entire life.

51
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:14,840
Well, we've seen that a road
to where it doesn't exist.

52
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,030
And even in our policies, we talk about,

53
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:20,780
we do this for a contract and
we do this for an employee.

54
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,400
Well, today there's really no difference.

55
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,640
There's 18 months to two
years for an employee

56
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,679
or 18 months to two
years for a contractor.

57
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,480
So we had to start thinking differently

58
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,179
even with the way we manage contractors.

59
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:35,200
So freelancer, when you think about it

60
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,420
we're gonna think about
a most often we talk.

61
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,980
We're gonna think of
them like contractors.

62
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:43,769
But here's the real gotcha
here, and the real scary part.

63
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:47,080
That gig worker, that
freelancer, maybe that person

64
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,770
sat next to you, when we
were back in the office.

65
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,760
Doing a gig in the middle of the day,

66
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,950
maybe even after this presentation,

67
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:57,780
I'm doing a gig for maybe a
startup, a competitive startup.

68
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:01,300
So think about the gig
worker or this freelancer

69
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:04,900
as anyone on your organization
could fill this role.

70
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,050
So that makes it even
a little extra scary.

71
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,400
So as we look at these numbers,

72
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,750
I mean this is what was shocking for me.

73
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,860
We've got over 50% of the global workers,

74
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,930
working in this gig economy.

75
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:21,930
May be because they lost their
jobs during the COVID-19.

76
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:25,390
We've got over a third of our US workers

77
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:27,700
participating in this gig economy,

78
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,920
either through their primary
jobs or secondary jobs.

79
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,130
And 90% of those surveyed,

80
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:38,060
said yes they would absolutely
do a freelance type job,

81
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:40,180
as an independent contract worker.

82
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:45,180
90% of our workers will say,
yeah, sure I would do a gig.

83
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:47,350
And then this workforce is growing

84
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:50,010
at three times the normal workforce.

85
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:52,387
So this is a new threat and
it's a threat we need to look at

86
00:03:52,387 --> 00:03:55,090
and a threat we need
to put our our strategy

87
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:56,343
and our tactics together.

88
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,810
So as we think about this gig economy,

89
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:02,280
I wanna give you a kind of an example,

90
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,210
and this one was crazy.

91
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,150
We'll call this gentleman, Bob.

92
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:09,952
And Bob had this deal going,

93
00:04:09,952 --> 00:04:11,750
I don't know what to call it a scam,

94
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,270
but he was actually, he
outsourced his own job.

95
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:16,700
He was an application programmer,

96
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:19,950
took and outsourced his programming role,

97
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,990
to an organization in China.

98
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:24,380
The company had put two
factor authentication.

99
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,680
So he mailed them his key fob.

100
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,090
So they're actually logging
in every day doing his coding.

101
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:32,390
He actually had this going
with multiple companies

102
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:34,060
where he was doing this.

103
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:37,140
He's making over $100,000 a year.

104
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:39,570
In fact many hundred
thousands of dollars a year

105
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:40,860
because he was doing multiples.

106
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,200
And only paying like $50,000 out.

107
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,300
This seems like a really good scam, right?

108
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:48,390
Here's the kicker.

109
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:51,159
When they talked to the
company after discovering it,

110
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,040
they said his job was above par.

111
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,070
His work was actually better.

112
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,840
It was clean and well-written

113
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,929
and submitted in a timely fashion.

114
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,730
And that's kinda crazy
when you think what Bob

115
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:02,760
spent his average day-to-day.

116
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,920
Now what Bob spend his average day,

117
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,800
he'd log in at nine o'clock,
he would surf Reddit

118
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,120
for a couple hours.

119
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,800
He'd watch cat videos till about 11:30,

120
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,330
take lunch at one, come back go on eBay,

121
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:19,909
do some purchasing on eBay until two-ish

122
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:21,710
and do his Facebook updates.

123
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:23,280
And then around that five o'clock,

124
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,530
he'd email his update
to his management team.

125
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:26,940
And that would be it.

126
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:30,030
So this is a example of a gig worker.

127
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:32,580
It's funny as heck when
you think about it,

128
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,443
but here's the thing.

129
00:05:33,443 --> 00:05:35,460
They were right part of that workforce.

130
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,870
And that's the malicious insider.

131
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,900
We've gotta figure out what
our tactics are gonna be.

132
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,460
How are we gonna detect them?

133
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,770
How are we gonna prevent it?

134
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:44,620
And how are we gonna recover from it?

135
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:48,490
So let's step back for a second.

136
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:50,020
What's driving all this?

137
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:53,880
And this is digitalization,
is a huge driver here.

138
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,450
Companies just want more, more and more,

139
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:59,577
are moving fast and the
organizations I talk to

140
00:05:59,577 --> 00:06:02,863
and work with, it's all hyper-speed now.

141
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:05,580
So what does that mean?

142
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:08,080
That means your attack
surface is changing.

143
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,592
That means we have to
think differently about it.

144
00:06:11,429 --> 00:06:14,039
And we have this new insider threat.

145
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,030
If it wasn't bad enough already,

146
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:20,469
I've had to manage against
insiders for my entire career.

147
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:23,420
In fact, the biggest
breaches I ever worked

148
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,700
were due to an insider.

149
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,580
They had an insider as part of it.

150
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,530
And in fact, when it's totally an insider,

151
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:31,650
and doesn't involve regulated data,

152
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:34,070
often those aren't even reported.

153
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:37,560
Because the loss of public
scrutiny would be worse

154
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,720
than just actually
getting rid of the person.

155
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,300
So the insider threats
always been tremendous.

156
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,493
And this is a new one.

157
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:47,450
So as we start thinking
about protecting gout,

158
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:50,360
it requires a mature security program.

159
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,930
So the tactics I'm gonna talk about today,

160
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:54,450
aren't gonna be basic tactics.

161
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:55,900
They're actually more advanced.

162
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,599
So to get to the point
where you can actually

163
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,290
protect against this gig worker,

164
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:03,863
you're gonna have to get
your program fairly mature.

165
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,440
We're gonna talk about strategy first.

166
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,670
And any strategy without tactics

167
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,730
is the slowest route to victory.

168
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:14,980
And tactics without a strategy,

169
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:17,393
it's a noise before
defeat, that was Sun Tzu.

170
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:21,060
And think about that, how much
sense that makes to us today

171
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:21,893
and what we do.

172
00:07:23,747 --> 00:07:25,480
So what does our strategy look like?

173
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,860
You know, we've got a grand strategy

174
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:29,530
around the gig economy protection.

175
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:31,440
We're gonna look at risk analysis.

176
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,170
We're gonna look at how do
we reduce our attack surface

177
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:36,890
and understand the best practice controls.

178
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:39,590
And of course like most
it's gonna involve people,

179
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:42,073
process and technology to get there.

180
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:48,420
Let's talk about how is
gig economy different?

181
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:50,870
Now what makes this gig economy different?

182
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:54,210
Well, gig economy workers are typically

183
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:55,630
a very short-term workers.

184
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:57,860
They're coming in and they're going out.

185
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:00,210
And they're doing specialty
kind of activities.

186
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:03,860
Contract workers are typically required.

187
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:06,810
As you think about a normal
contract you would write,

188
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:08,350
you would say, you have
to have an encrypted.

189
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:11,760
Often you will provide the laptop to them

190
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,200
and it will come with anti-virus

191
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,450
or document repository, et cetera.

192
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,640
Whilst gig workers come in,

193
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:21,229
there are most often gonna
be using their own laptops.

194
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:22,950
Most often there aren't gonna be using

195
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,650
their own collaboration tools.

196
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:26,020
They're gonna take your data

197
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,000
and perhaps put it in their store.

198
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,500
And these are the things
we got to think about

199
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,520
and how we're gonna protect again.

200
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,260
Here's the thing, in a gig
worker and a contract worker

201
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,510
of course, we're always
gonna do a background check.

202
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,939
Often, these are such short

203
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:42,799
that background checks are
often overlooked and not done.

204
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:46,040
And that can be actually a
key to a lot of the activities

205
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,439
they're gonna be working on.

206
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:52,160
They'll often work on
their own personal machines

207
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,819
that may or may not have
the right security controls

208
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,390
in place.

209
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:58,330
And they may conduct research

210
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:01,298
or compile sensitive information,

211
00:09:01,298 --> 00:09:02,600
that part of that gig worker.

212
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,370
I'm gonna talk more
about sample workers here

213
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:08,330
and think about Bob and
all the application code

214
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:10,010
he actually was outsourcing.

215
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:11,280
And that could have been very sensitive,

216
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:15,150
about code that could then
end up at a competitor site.

217
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:18,140
Or provide back doors in, we don't know.

218
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,699
So the key question you're
gonna be asking yourself,

219
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,950
okay we've got this gig worker,

220
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:24,450
did they share that
information with anyone?

221
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:26,460
Do they have it contained?

222
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:29,770
And is that information
deleted when they're done?

223
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:30,829
Or is it retained?

224
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:32,950
These are the things we often work with

225
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:35,260
as we're thinking about a normal worker.

226
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:38,240
As we're thinking about a contract worker

227
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,167
or one of our employees, this is given.

228
00:09:40,167 --> 00:09:43,690
But as we're thinking about
these new freelance workers

229
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:46,653
or gig workers, we have to
address that differently.

230
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,340
Let's talk about threat
management and this insider threat

231
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,530
and how do we address this threats?

232
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:57,209
Well first of all,
understanding the persona,

233
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:58,630
of those folks may be doing this.

234
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:01,350
And here's some examples
but there's lots of them.

235
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:05,670
An application programmer,
Bob was in that category.

236
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:08,360
But let's just talk about it
a little bit more generically.

237
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,880
You have application
code, you are working on.

238
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,460
And this application code,

239
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,940
if it gets sent in a freelancer's hand,

240
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:18,710
can be put in a GitHub
and it can be copied out.

241
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:23,710
So that code that IP can actually
leak into our competitors.

242
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:26,350
Maybe it's not one of your
number one competitors today

243
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:28,410
because you work in a large organization

244
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:29,850
and no one would do that.

245
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:32,920
But I got to tell you as an
X application programmer,

246
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,949
when we write a cool sub-routine,

247
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:37,620
we reuse them, it's part of our toolbox.

248
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,639
So what you spent maybe $100,000

249
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,650
of time developing a new routine,

250
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:46,350
maybe used that supposed
tool in the next gig.

251
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:49,494
So think about the loss of
the investment in your R and D

252
00:10:49,494 --> 00:10:53,463
and potentially enabling your
competitors to go faster.

253
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,400
Market analyst, research often done

254
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,300
by freelancers these days.

255
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:02,250
That may contain very
sensitive information

256
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:05,440
you've provided them to
do this market research.

257
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,820
Think about your pricing schedule.

258
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,700
Maybe you've got them looking at pricing

259
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:12,390
or your compensation for yourself
staff and commission rates

260
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:14,260
and all that goes in and
guess what's in there,

261
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,430
your top salesman,
cause they're gonna know

262
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:17,620
who's selling what.

263
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:21,360
Your commission rates, your
pricing for your customers.

264
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,940
This is all the most sensitive
data you could possibly have.

265
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:27,070
I had the pleasure of serving as the CEO

266
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:31,000
for about seven and
half years at a startup.

267
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,520
And what I found was my most,

268
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,520
even though it was a software company

269
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:37,140
and we had a product
that I was very proud of.

270
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,350
And I didn't want that code to get out.

271
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:42,960
The most sensitive data I
had was those customers,

272
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,200
my pricing and my prospects.

273
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,070
Because that's what I was battling with,

274
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:49,010
when I had to respond to an RFP.

275
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:51,800
If my competitor knew my
response was gonna be,

276
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,520
they could undercut me easily.

277
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,010
So these are the kinds of
things we have to think about.

278
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:58,510
That market analysts, that researcher

279
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,220
can be one of those freelancers

280
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,520
that you really have
to be concerned about.

281
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,880
Sales account managers, Sales accounts

282
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,810
where they can offload
your customer accounts.

283
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,829
Again could be a freelancer.

284
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:12,960
IT database analyst, any role in IT

285
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,800
can be tough to act to a freelancer.

286
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,420
You're gonna have really trouble here

287
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:19,969
because you're gonna think
you're hiring a contractor.

288
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:21,440
How do you even know the difference.

289
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,420
That's gonna be what we got
talked a little about later.

290
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:27,079
How do I protect against and a contractor

291
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,880
which I've hired for
years and years and years.

292
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:33,630
And we know how to protect
ourselves in that case.

293
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:36,100
And how is that different
from this freelancer

294
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,830
and what I need to do?

295
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:39,570
And then litigation support.

296
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:42,150
Often you'll outsource litigation support,

297
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:45,890
especially for a lot of
the heavy lifting work.

298
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,774
You just don't simply
have the attorneys inside

299
00:12:48,774 --> 00:12:50,930
that can do all that grinding.

300
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:54,079
So as you outsource again you're
gonna have litigation data

301
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:57,220
and maybe sensitive data
as part of that discovery

302
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,720
going outside of your company.

303
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,000
That's a freelancer might
be a different situation.

304
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,260
So as you think about threat analysis,

305
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:07,680
think about the Mitre attack scenarios

306
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,560
and going through those or ISO 27,001

307
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,040
and structure that threat analysis

308
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,870
against these threat models.

309
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,900
And then as you think about this,

310
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,427
also reassess your crown jewels.

311
00:13:20,427 --> 00:13:21,770
cause you've probably already done

312
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:22,880
a crown jewels assessment,

313
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,750
you know where the important stuff is.

314
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:28,080
But reassess that in the
mind of a freelancer.

315
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,390
What would really be
critical to the organization

316
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:34,872
in these cases, where we
may be using freelance help.

317
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:38,330
And then of course the
freelancer, what can they do?

318
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:39,987
They can copy that code.

319
00:13:39,987 --> 00:13:42,841
They can do pricing data, marketing data.

320
00:13:42,841 --> 00:13:45,290
They can only use it
for their gig with you

321
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:47,339
but they also can use
it for their next gig

322
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,460
to be more effective.

323
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,250
Cause they're gonna wanna be successful

324
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,520
at every gig they do.

325
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:54,220
And the more data they can
bring with them the better.

326
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:59,950
So when we do risk analysis,
you know risk assessment,

327
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:02,060
you know, we're looking at the likelihood.

328
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,819
And what's the likelihood
of this happening.

329
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:06,180
And that's, by the way,
this is all very subjective,

330
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:09,170
but it's your expertise that matters here.

331
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:11,819
So what is the vulnerabilities
and what are my threats?

332
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,950
And we just talk through
some of those threats.

333
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:16,800
So given those threats,
what's the likelihood

334
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,180
that a vulnerability here will allow them

335
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:21,770
to create an incident for me.

336
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:24,140
So we're looking at that risk to the data,

337
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:26,040
but overall what we wanna understand

338
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,910
is what is the impact?

339
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:30,622
What's impact of that
data should it leak out

340
00:14:30,623 --> 00:14:32,360
through a freelancer?

341
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,670
What's the impact of that data

342
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:38,290
or those processes are used
for one of our competitors

343
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:40,780
or actually even becomes public knowledge?

344
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:43,470
So as we think about that risk assessment,

345
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:44,720
go through this process,

346
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,180
do a very deliberate risk assessment

347
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,173
around this specific topic.

348
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,840
And once you've that
you're gonna now use that

349
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,420
to inform your controls.

350
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:57,640
You're gonna use that risk assessment

351
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,300
to really develop your protection plan.

352
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,790
And when I think about
a protection plan here,

353
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:04,640
I'm gonna think about three things.

354
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:08,270
My administrative controls,
my process controls,

355
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:10,453
and then of course my technical controls.

356
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:14,080
So let's look a little deeper at those.

357
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,750
So administrative controls,
what could those look like?

358
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,110
Well, many of these are gonna be,

359
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:21,720
clear direction first from the top.

360
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,110
We need to have a policy.

361
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:26,440
We need to understand
from our top executives,

362
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,670
where do we use freelance?

363
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:31,069
Where do we using gig economy workers?

364
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:32,800
Where are the appropriate places

365
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,640
and where are the inappropriate places?

366
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,130
I'm gonna talk about
later leaning into this.

367
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:39,300
This is actually an effective way

368
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,130
for high-performing
organizations to get things done.

369
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:44,500
So you can't just say, we're
not gonna use freelance.

370
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,130
In fact you may not even know,

371
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:48,670
you're using a freelance contractor.

372
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:51,449
But looking at that creating a direction

373
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,593
that meets your cultural
goals and your risks goals.

374
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,469
You're gonna create remote worker policies

375
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:58,303
or you probably already have them,

376
00:15:58,303 --> 00:16:00,140
they're gonna become key here.

377
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,930
And your vendor management policies

378
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:04,489
on how do we engage these folks?

379
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:05,600
Do we go to independence?

380
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,790
Do we only hire through
contract organizations?

381
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:12,067
And does our contract with
that contract organizations

382
00:16:12,067 --> 00:16:14,500
specify they must be full-time employees?

383
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,791
Cause they're not allowed
to do other outside gigs

384
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:18,990
if you will.

385
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:20,560
For instance, when I was at Optiv,

386
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,699
we weren't allowed to do any side jobs.

387
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,470
That was part of our agreement.

388
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:25,730
Because they wanted to make sure,

389
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:27,920
if we were doing work for one company

390
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,660
we couldn't accidentally be
doing work for a competitor.

391
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:34,170
So contracts have to have
those clear requirements

392
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:35,040
with gig users.

393
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,439
And I'm gonna talk about

394
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,140
some of the key contract
requirements that I look for.

395
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:42,770
Process controls, you know,
your new hire training.

396
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:44,770
When they come on board,
you've gotta make sure

397
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,526
they understand how you do things

398
00:16:46,527 --> 00:16:48,510
and the way you're gonna do that.

399
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:51,460
Awareness of those risks in a gig economy

400
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:55,340
and making sure people, your
leadership, your managers

401
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:59,440
are aware of the risks of hire
these gig type freelancers.

402
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,380
Where they're just gonna bring them in

403
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,470
to do some some temporary work and off.

404
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:04,369
They're not full-time.

405
00:17:04,369 --> 00:17:06,550
And safeguards by preventing bypassing

406
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:07,960
the vendor management process.

407
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,650
So your vendor management
process gonna say,

408
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:13,329
Hey, if we're gonna
engage a new organization

409
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:15,419
or new person, here's
the things we need to do.

410
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,079
I get a written contract.

411
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:19,018
We need to have that contract
specify these things.

412
00:17:19,018 --> 00:17:21,609
And you think about
insurance and liability.

413
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:24,010
Well, if you bypass those controls,

414
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:26,140
you can put the
organization in real danger.

415
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:30,050
So looking at how do we prevent
that from being bypassed?

416
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,810
And then of course, we're
gonna talk about monitoring

417
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:34,320
a little bit more, in
the incident response

418
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,082
as part of those process controls.

419
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:41,310
So when you think about
security for these gig workers

420
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:44,360
or freelancers, it's really
gonna be a combination

421
00:17:44,361 --> 00:17:48,460
of your remote worker controls,
your contractor controls

422
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,800
or vendor management
controls, third-party risks

423
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,149
and your Zero Trust.

424
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:55,670
And Zero Trust becomes
a big part of this play

425
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:57,150
because that's gonna give us,

426
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:58,950
the ability to do deeper inspection.

427
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,040
So as we look at remote worker controls,

428
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,430
and these apply to most any remote worker.

429
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:08,530
So if we look at best practices there,

430
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:11,370
again that policy, making sure we have one

431
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:14,070
security awareness and
training is a big part of that.

432
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:18,260
Setting up VPN, but you'll
notice for gig workers,

433
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:21,840
it's not just a normal
VPN that takes that worker

434
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,270
and dumps them into your network,

435
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,810
cause they can go lateral and get things

436
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:26,280
they're not supposed to get to.

437
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,300
Think about using a next generation VPN.

438
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:32,770
One that provides a direct
access to those applications,

439
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:35,330
and doesn't allow them
to go to other places.

440
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:37,439
So think about that as
one of those key controls

441
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,410
for remote workers.

442
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:41,560
Require two-factor authentication,

443
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,500
pretty standard now,

444
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:46,030
but across the all
organization applications.

445
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:48,139
Tighten your access rules.

446
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:52,160
Gig workers really need to
be very tightly controlled,

447
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,530
on what they can get to.

448
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:56,100
So you know what applications,
what data they can get to

449
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,230
or what code repositories.

450
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:59,450
And then some of the physical security

451
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:01,660
for a normal remote worker,

452
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:02,710
where are they putting documents?

453
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:05,140
Are they printing that
at their remote spot?

454
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:08,763
Are they safeguarding that
laptop when not in use?

455
00:19:08,763 --> 00:19:10,330
So, think about those,

456
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:13,320
often those are very standard
remote worker controls,

457
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,983
but we need to apply them here.

458
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,610
Now let's talk about
third-party risk management.

459
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:20,070
I'll go through the normal life cycle

460
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,750
with you real quickly here.

461
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,860
But we need to have these things in place.

462
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:26,159
So we're gonna talk about
risk identification.

463
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,460
So anytime we're setting up a new vendor,

464
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:31,860
or a new gig economy
worker, what's the risk?

465
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,449
What are they working on?

466
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:35,540
So we have an idea of what they're doing.

467
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:38,250
What sensitive data will
they have access to?

468
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,900
How are they gonna protect our systems?

469
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:43,380
What protections do we need
in place for that gig worker?

470
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:46,360
We're gonna require them to
have encryption on their laptop,

471
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,620
anti-virus, some of the standard things.

472
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:51,139
And who's gonna make
sure that it gets done?

473
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,710
And then looking at
their financial viability

474
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:56,210
if you're coming through
a contracting outfit,

475
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:59,150
or if you've got a big
contract you're doing,

476
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:01,850
how are you protecting
your company financially,

477
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:04,980
in case you should pay them
and then it should go away.

478
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:07,010
Insurance, think about insurance

479
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:09,670
for both cyber insurance
and liability insurance,

480
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:11,240
as you hire these folks.

481
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:14,070
And then a remediation plan
for anything that isn't done,

482
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:16,210
that you need done,
before they start working.

483
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:19,750
Again for the gig economy,
this becomes really problematic

484
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,040
because they're usually short term,

485
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,639
they're in and out like that.

486
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,990
So this is gonna be more difficult

487
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,920
than it's been in the past.

488
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,250
So if you think about contracts,

489
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,690
and this is third-party risk contracts.

490
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:33,020
But I recommend to the extent possibly,

491
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:35,660
gonna need a written
contract with a freelancer.

492
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:39,100
Don't think, and don't
allow them to engage them

493
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,219
without a written contract.

494
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:42,320
The liabilities need to be addressed.

495
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,810
All these things need to
be dressed in writing.

496
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:48,770
So getting that form put
out and having one specific

497
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:51,950
for gig workers that specify
the certain things you need

498
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:54,700
with them, for these short-term contracts.

499
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:58,160
But think about security
safeguards you want in place.

500
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,780
Restrictions on outsourcing.

501
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:02,639
Can they outsource the
work you've given to them?

502
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,270
It needs to be specified, yes or no.

503
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:07,170
Security service level agreements.

504
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:10,030
What if they're not meeting
your security controls?

505
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:12,807
Do you have any need in there that says,

506
00:21:12,807 --> 00:21:16,490
"We're gonna hold back 10, 20% or not pay,

507
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:18,010
if you don't get these things in place

508
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,610
by the time you start our gig."

509
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:21,979
So think about a penalty process here.

510
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,850
What are those security controls

511
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:25,100
and what do you need them to do,

512
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,919
if they don't get it done?

513
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,290
Breach notification,
you gotta have it there.

514
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:33,440
If for some reason, the sensitive
data you have given them

515
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,850
is then compromised, you need to make sure

516
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:37,820
they notify you in a timely way.

517
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:40,530
'Cause you have an obligation yourself.

518
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:43,250
That right to audit, come
in and check those controls,

519
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:45,160
to make sure they're in place.

520
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,560
Identification, cyber insurance.

521
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:51,330
Make sure your liabilities are
spelled out in this contract.

522
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:53,131
And of course, an exit strategy.

523
00:21:53,132 --> 00:21:56,490
Just like a good marriage,
how are you gonna break up?

524
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:58,700
When you leave, what are
your expectations of them,

525
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,280
around deleting the data, returning data,

526
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:05,930
archiving the data, erasing
or reformatting things?

527
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:09,310
Make sure that exit strategy
has been thought through,

528
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:10,610
and they've agreed to it.

529
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:11,716
And here's the key.

530
00:22:11,717 --> 00:22:13,710
You gotta make sure you
follow through on it,

531
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:17,823
at the end of this gig worker engagement.

532
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:24,220
So, as we think about gig
worker best practices,

533
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,530
it's a form of a contractor,

534
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:29,629
so many of the same controls apply here.

535
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:34,120
The written contract, turn the
focus towards the end point.

536
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,040
This is where you're most sure,

537
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,659
cause you're gonna
probably using cloud-based

538
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,270
collaboration tools for them to work on,

539
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:42,570
or maybe see your backend
private application.

540
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:46,020
Notify them you will be
monitoring their activity.

541
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,730
Always a good practice.

542
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:48,700
And background checks.

543
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,610
Now background checks, have to be quick.

544
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:53,219
They could be in and out in two weeks.

545
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:55,400
And if it takes two weeks
to get a background check,

546
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,233
guess what?

547
00:22:56,233 --> 00:22:58,820
They're gone before you've
even got the results back.

548
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:01,830
And often with a gig worker,
they're gonna start soon.

549
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:03,350
It's not they're gonna start in 30 days.

550
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:04,790
They're gonna start tomorrow.

551
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:06,850
So again, that goes back to your policy,

552
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:09,520
and how your company wants
to engage these gig workers.

553
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,360
And then of course, making
sure that's followed through.

554
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,193
So monitoring.

555
00:23:13,193 --> 00:23:14,470
Here's some things about monitoring.

556
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:16,300
When you think about
this monitoring thing,

557
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,659
that becomes really tricky.

558
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:22,660
And I actually did some work
before this presentation today.

559
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,380
And I went out to my LinkedIn community.

560
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:30,370
And I can describe this
presentation as gig economy worker.

561
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:32,550
And I asked for crowd thoughts

562
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:35,627
on what can we do about this gig worker,

563
00:23:35,627 --> 00:23:37,830
and what controls should we put in place.

564
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:39,439
It was an amazing experience.

565
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,850
I'd never crowdsource a
topic like that before.

566
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:45,469
So, I wanna thank those by the way,

567
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:46,780
that did participate in that,

568
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:49,903
because it did add value
here to this presentation.

569
00:23:49,903 --> 00:23:52,800
So, as you think about activity.

570
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,669
So, it's gonna be behavioral activity.

571
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:56,450
You're gonna see some differences.

572
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:57,670
If you see, you know

573
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:59,510
the normally they're
gonna be in work on files

574
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:03,530
and it's intensive work, as
a gig worker is very focused.

575
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:06,340
Well, also you notice
they're coming online

576
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:08,520
for a few minutes, they
look and do something,

577
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,050
they go back offline.

578
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:12,330
And you're seeing this maybe repetitively.

579
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:14,689
that could be because
they're working another gig

580
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:16,760
on their computer, they
have to sign off that,

581
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,910
sign on to our system.

582
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:20,070
Look at what they've done before,

583
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:22,889
maybe copy some routines
down or some data down,

584
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:25,290
and then log off, go
back over there and work.

585
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:27,420
So think about that pattern.

586
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:30,020
And think about the pattern
email and data movement.

587
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:35,490
Understand the normal life cycle of data.

588
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:37,710
And see where data is moving and why.

589
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:39,590
And this becomes, that's
what I said earlier,

590
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:42,419
you'd have some pretty good data movement

591
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,960
capabilities in place.

592
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:47,810
The ability to go beyond
just the first 2000 bytes

593
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:50,820
which are our legacy
secure web gateways can do,

594
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:54,139
and actually decode that JSON
and be able to look deeper

595
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:56,710
into that JSON code, to
see what data is moving?

596
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:57,920
How much is moving?

597
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,830
Where's it moving from?

598
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,210
Where's it moving to?

599
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:01,230
And understand that,

600
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:05,050
and be able to distinguish the
valid alerts from the noise.

601
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:06,899
That's gonna be the challenge here,

602
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,780
is really understanding it.

603
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,620
Now I hate to bring up
that dirty secret again,

604
00:25:10,621 --> 00:25:14,330
that this freelancer
may not be a contractor.

605
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:17,129
This freelancer may be one
of your fellow employees.

606
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:21,840
That's working on another gig
to maybe enhance her income.

607
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,159
So think about how
you're gonna detect that.

608
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,340
And then of course, how
are we gonna prevent it.

609
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:27,730
And that's what all this is about.

610
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:29,890
And in the end, that's
what we're trying to do.

611
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:32,360
We're trying to enable the business,

612
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,810
to do the things they need to do,

613
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:36,580
move at the speed of cloud, and of course,

614
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:38,330
meet our own risk management goals.

615
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,210
So as you think about data protection,

616
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:44,850
again it's gonna be kind of a hybrid here,

617
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:47,620
with stronger access authentication.

618
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,010
We're gonna identify the user risk,

619
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:50,610
through their user behavior.

620
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:52,409
We're gonna look at the device risk.

621
00:25:53,253 --> 00:25:54,960
How much do we know about that device?

622
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,030
Is it a managed device that
we've provided to them,

623
00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:00,310
we know is a secure device,

624
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:02,620
or is it more of a BYOB device?

625
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:04,550
We're gonna look at their
behavioral analytics,

626
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:06,899
understand and watch for those.

627
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,040
Application risk.

628
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,230
What applications are they going to?

629
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:13,320
Are they going to, because
now in the cloud world,

630
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,780
we can see where they're going.

631
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:16,540
We have visibility again.

632
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:19,350
Are they using applications
that may be causing its risks?

633
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:21,240
Are they storing data in a place

634
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,700
they shouldn't be storing it.

635
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:25,130
And that's key for us 'cause
we don't want that data

636
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:26,633
to be inadvertently lost.

637
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,670
Application instance awareness
and this is absolutely key.

638
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:33,980
If you've got Office 365 or G Suite,

639
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,300
you need to be able to see

640
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:39,680
if it's going to the business
version of Office 365

641
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,450
or personal version.

642
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:44,580
Standard, secure web
gateways, the ones I deployed

643
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:47,149
a few years ago, can't
tell the difference,

644
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:48,588
but we need to in this case,

645
00:26:48,588 --> 00:26:50,530
GitHubs, Black, all these things,

646
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:53,260
we need to be able to understand
the instance they're using

647
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:56,303
because we may enable it as
part of a corporate facility

648
00:26:56,303 --> 00:26:58,240
but we need to keep it limited

649
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,873
that data to only those
corporate for approved sites.

650
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,560
Adaptive access controls, this
really comes into the sense

651
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:08,220
of Zero Trust and being adaptive,

652
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:11,200
to where we know it's
coming from unmanaged device

653
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,630
but they're going to our
standard collaboration.

654
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:18,070
Let's say a SharePoint and
they're storing in SharePoint,

655
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,100
that's okay.

656
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,270
I'll let them work on it there,

657
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:22,210
but I'm not gonna allow him to download

658
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:23,580
to that unmanaged device.

659
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:26,929
Being adaptive to time of
day, the working behavior,

660
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:29,840
the device, the destination applications,

661
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,179
this is all key to Zero Trust.

662
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:34,020
And if you send me a note,
I'd be happy to talk to you

663
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:36,260
about Zero Trust another time.

664
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:38,600
But activity controls,
what are they trying to do?

665
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,530
What kind of activities are they doing?

666
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:41,530
Are they doing share?

667
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:42,710
Now think about this.

668
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:44,027
They just put it out in SharePoint

669
00:27:44,027 --> 00:27:46,120
and they put it in your corporate one.

670
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,820
You were able to limit them to that

671
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:51,570
but now they shared it
to an outside identity.

672
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:53,689
Maybe it's their own personal SharePoint.

673
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:56,320
So you've gotta be able to see that share

674
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,540
and prevent that share to an
external entity if you want to.

675
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:01,510
But your business is also gonna want you

676
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:04,520
to enable shares for vendors and partners.

677
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:07,150
So being able to put
those controls in place,

678
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:10,200
is what makes a successful
security group today.

679
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,350
What makes a successful security leader

680
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:15,919
is having an agile program
that can allow these things.

681
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,120
So think about that and
think about your career.

682
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:21,409
So data being able to discover this data,

683
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:24,420
classify this data in an automatic way.

684
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:28,460
I used to do classification
policies and DLP years ago.

685
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:31,250
And I grown just thinking about it.

686
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:34,290
But today's DLP, today's classifications,

687
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:35,170
they're intelligent.

688
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:36,400
They use machine learning.

689
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,570
They use AI.

690
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:40,939
So it's much different than
yesterday's implementation.

691
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:43,150
Single-pass policy enforcement.

692
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:46,380
That means I can look at it in real time.

693
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:50,120
In real time and make
adaptive control decisions

694
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,899
of whether I'm gonna allow
it, I'm gonna deny it.

695
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,350
I can also redirect it.

696
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,850
They're gonna store it and Zippyshare.

697
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:59,169
Now I can have them stored
in SharePoint automatically.

698
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:00,560
I can even coach them.

699
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:04,379
I can say what you're
about to do is high risk.

700
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:07,220
Please enter a justification
for doing this.

701
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:11,060
95% of the time, they will
back out and go somewhere else,

702
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,550
cause they know you're watching them

703
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:15,800
and you just educated them
of where it should be going.

704
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,820
So this coaching provides an opportunity

705
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:20,173
to educate your users.

706
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:24,190
And then, looking at the DLP,

707
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:26,990
that'd be AI/ML learning, you know

708
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:28,970
your exact match fingerprinting.

709
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:29,960
A lot of the things we've seen,

710
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:33,143
but it's been enhanced so
much in the last few years.

711
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:37,550
So as we think about where you wanna be

712
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:39,889
and how do we do data protection

713
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:42,650
around these gig workers
and these freelancers?

714
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:44,920
Well this data protection
is Zero Trust world

715
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,753
is where we're at today.

716
00:29:45,753 --> 00:29:47,683
Where we don't trust the
computers they're coming from

717
00:29:47,683 --> 00:29:49,900
because they're coming from BYOD's.

718
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:52,220
We don't trust the network,
it's not one we control.

719
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:54,700
We're using Cloud and
it's running on machines

720
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:55,860
that we don't own.

721
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:59,510
Or using ISPS, or even SaaS applications.

722
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:03,260
So we started with Zero Trust
and we need to gain more trust

723
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,810
to be able to make this happen.

724
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:09,150
If you look at the diagram,
the data is in the center here.

725
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:12,440
And we've got around it,
the user, the devices,

726
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:15,000
the device risk, our private applications

727
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,750
runs in our data center and of course,

728
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:19,620
web and SaaS applications,
the IaaS workloads

729
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,290
that are running out in the internet.

730
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:22,760
And we've got the
networks they're carrying.

731
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:27,120
What we wanna establish is
this visibility and analytics.

732
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,209
That visibility and analytics
around all these things

733
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:33,540
that give us the ability
to put the right controls.

734
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,720
And of course these days,

735
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,520
automation and orchestration
absolutely essential.

736
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,900
The end goal here is to have

737
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:42,660
this continuous risk monitoring going on.

738
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,370
That's when you know you've won.

739
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:46,580
That's when you know
you've made real progress,

740
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:48,639
is when you can get these things in place

741
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,010
and help, not only with your gig workers,

742
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:53,588
this is across your entire organization.

743
00:30:53,588 --> 00:30:56,040
So as we think about this data trust,

744
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,850
I'm gonna switch gears now a little bit

745
00:30:57,850 --> 00:31:01,540
to some very tactical
different things we can do

746
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:04,610
for the gig worker or the freelancer.

747
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:06,360
The first thing to talk about is VDI.

748
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,949
VDI has been around for a very long time.

749
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:11,060
At least three times in my career career,

750
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,820
I've looked at implementing it.

751
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:15,919
The problem I always ran
into as a user experience

752
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:18,010
just wouldn't be accepted.

753
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:19,430
If we were trying to roll it out

754
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:22,936
into some of those organizations
I talked about earlier,

755
00:31:22,936 --> 00:31:24,602
the culture would not accept it.

756
00:31:24,603 --> 00:31:26,360
Some of the financial institutions

757
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:29,372
where they've grown up with
VDI, it's very acceptable.

758
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:33,840
But other organizations
especially younger companies

759
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,879
startup mode, where they're going fast,

760
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,290
they're going strong or,

761
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:39,700
or even in less traditional environment,

762
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:43,750
VDI doesn't make it from
a cultural perspective.

763
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:45,110
But what it does is it allows you

764
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:47,010
to virtualize that desktop.

765
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:49,920
So none of the data actually
ever goes to that desktop.

766
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,910
So therefore all those threats
you were thinking about

767
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,310
data being copied off, or screen-printed,

768
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:56,290
et cetera kind of go away.

769
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:59,470
So it does provide a very effective way

770
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:01,890
of protecting that data and keeping it

771
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:04,930
in where you wanna keep it and
not allowing it to be reused

772
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:08,280
or copied to other place, very effective.

773
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,649
Another alternate that has emerged now

774
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:12,820
is remote browser isolation.

775
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:17,139
So think about, RBI is
being more of a subset

776
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:20,307
where everything going through
the browser is virtualized.

777
00:32:20,307 --> 00:32:21,720
Well that makes a lot of sense today.

778
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,260
I don't have to virtualize
the whole machine

779
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:25,879
because they're working remotely,

780
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,270
they're gonna be working in my G drive

781
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:29,823
or my SharePoint in my teams.

782
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:34,600
And I can contain it there
and prevent any bad things

783
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,010
from getting outside of that browser

784
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:38,990
to my underlying desktop.

785
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:41,660
So from a threat
perspective it's very nice,

786
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,760
helps stop malware.

787
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,440
But of course it provides
me an alternative here.

788
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,810
So you can look at these alternatives

789
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:50,169
and see if either of these work for you.

790
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:53,013
Because again, this is very,
very cultural specific.

791
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:58,730
Now, if we think about
one other type control

792
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:01,130
we have here at our disposal.

793
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:03,630
And that is around
information risk management

794
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:05,433
or information rights management.

795
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:09,429
Data encrypted requires
authorization at the time of use.

796
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:11,250
And I've used some of these products.

797
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:14,210
And frankly I wish they
were more available

798
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:15,650
because there are amazing.

799
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:17,260
I can email it to someone.

800
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:19,629
They can open it, if they
have the right credentials,

801
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:22,150
they've been authorized,
it's fully encrypted,

802
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:23,237
but it actually does it.

803
00:33:23,237 --> 00:33:25,880
And if they email it to
somebody else or leaks it,

804
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,250
they can't open it.

805
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:29,890
So it's not like a file that
can get actually leaked out

806
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:32,300
and get in the wrong
hands, these are files

807
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:36,639
that actually can be
self-contained encrypted files.

808
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,110
Amazing if we could do it everywhere.

809
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:43,266
The problem with this is that,
it really has limited use.

810
00:33:43,267 --> 00:33:47,200
You know, you can restrict
actions such as copy, paste,

811
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,027
modify, print screen, et
cetera, which is great,

812
00:33:50,027 --> 00:33:54,100
but how am I gonna protect
application code with this?

813
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,719
How am I gonna protect
some of those crown jewels?

814
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:58,004
Documents, probably yes.

815
00:33:58,004 --> 00:34:00,300
Excel spreadsheets, again, probably.

816
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:03,830
Maybe even PowerPoints, things
that are contained like that.

817
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:06,870
But my crown jewels is this research data,

818
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:08,589
it's gonna be really tough especially

819
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:10,500
if they're copying it
down to your machines.

820
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,699
So again, it might come
back to making sure

821
00:34:12,699 --> 00:34:13,750
you don't allow that.

822
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:15,159
But you don't need VDI to do that.

823
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:17,440
You can do that with secure web gateways,

824
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,377
DLP and classic controls.

825
00:34:19,377 --> 00:34:21,770
But in this case, we're looking at

826
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:24,420
information rights management.

827
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:27,810
So look at the use cases
might make sense for you.

828
00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:30,350
There's some really good
products out there today.

829
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:34,889
Some great progress has been
made over the last few years,

830
00:34:34,889 --> 00:34:37,862
in this area of information
rights management.

831
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:43,483
So I'm gonna wrap up
today and check to see,

832
00:34:43,483 --> 00:34:45,130
if there's been any questions.

833
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:48,223
But you know, the gig
economy is here to stay.

834
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,411
Lean into this.

835
00:34:50,411 --> 00:34:53,230
It's not going away, it's not a fad.

836
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:58,100
And that gig worker represents
a significant threat.

837
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,350
So if you think about
this gig worker workforce

838
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:03,290
and this first kinda
takeaway I have for you,

839
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:05,630
lean in and embrace that gig worker.

840
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:08,940
Think about those tactics
I just went over with you

841
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,040
and your overall strategy.

842
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,430
Key to any successful security program

843
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:16,460
is understanding your culture.

844
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:19,010
What is acceptable and
what isn't acceptable?

845
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:21,940
Now here, you're probably gonna have to

846
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:25,420
educate your senior staff
about this new threat.

847
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:28,710
Cause they're probably not
really on top of the freelancer

848
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:32,240
and what they could do and how
they could harm your company.

849
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,669
And think about that and
again it's always difficult

850
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:37,050
to think about that insider as being

851
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:38,810
one of your other employees.

852
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:40,120
But in this case it can be.

853
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,359
And with 90% saying yes.

854
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,143
And most likely there will be some.

855
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:47,940
Think about your risk assessment

856
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:50,240
and how are you doing
that risk assessment.

857
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:53,060
Assess your environment, create a roadmap

858
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:56,270
with monitorizing your system

859
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:58,560
and putting the right
monitoring and control.

860
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,813
And maximizing that effectiveness.

861
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:04,770
Think about your gig worker controls.

862
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:07,860
And as I said earlier, it's a
combination of remote worker,

863
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:12,280
vendor management and some
specific ones around gig workers

864
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,870
and of course Zero Trust.

865
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:16,500
I'm hearing Zero Trust from my colleagues,

866
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,150
across the world right now.

867
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:21,250
It seems to be getting a lot
of momentum and implementing

868
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:23,930
because we've reached that tipping point

869
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:26,830
and sassy describe what
we've got more data

870
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:29,460
going outside of our
organizations and insight.

871
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:32,640
So having a good Zero Trust
strategy and architecture,

872
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,960
again is gonna be key to being able

873
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:36,380
to put the right controls in place here

874
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:40,810
for these remote workers
that are gig type workers.

875
00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:43,759
So there can be a
combination of those things.

876
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,990
Think about your sassy strategy,

877
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:47,899
think about your Zero Trust strategy

878
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:50,720
and how you're gonna develop those

879
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,759
into this gig worker type economy.

880
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,420
So with that, I'm gonna leave you today.

881
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:59,430
And I hope you've got a
lot from this presentation.

882
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:01,049
Feel free to follow up meeting time,

883
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:02,300
you can send me an email.

884
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:04,310
Ask questions.

885
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:05,810
My email address is there on the screen.

886
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:09,180
It's James.Christiansen@Netskope.com

887
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:12,375
and really looking forward
to hearing how you react.

888
00:37:12,376 --> 00:37:15,890
Give me some posts, tell me
what you think we should do

889
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:18,100
because this is a new problem.

890
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:20,730
You know, maybe I got some
things right here today

891
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:23,750
but I'll bet you, you have
some great ideas as well.

892
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:25,930
So I'm looking forward
to hearing back from you.

893
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:29,047
With that, I wanna say thank
you and good afternoon.
