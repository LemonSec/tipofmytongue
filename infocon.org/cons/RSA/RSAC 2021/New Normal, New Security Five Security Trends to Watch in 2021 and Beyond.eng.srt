1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:03,990
- Welcome to this RSA Session.

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,490
I'm Nicolas Fischbach, the Global CTO

3
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:09,560
at Forcepoint and the
VP of SASE Engineering.

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:14,120
And I'm joined today
by another CTO Nicolai

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,730
and we're gonna talk about
the new normal in security.

6
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,130
What's it gonna look like?

7
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:22,730
Last year, we spent some time looking

8
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:25,210
at what 2021 could bring,

9
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:27,430
what are the security trends?

10
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:30,080
And, we wanna share with you,

11
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,449
the findings so far and especially Nicolai

12
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:34,360
who's gonna introduce himself in a second,

13
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,680
he's gonna talk about
from his point of view

14
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,940
how is he helping clients

15
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:42,150
apply some of those findings,

16
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:44,810
some of those outcomes
through his user base?

17
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:47,920
Nicolai welcome and thanks for joining me.

18
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,270
- Thank you very much
for having me here today.

19
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,019
- You wanna talk a
little bit about Help AG

20
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:53,950
and what you guys are doing?

21
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:57,537
- Yes of course.

22
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:02,130
Help AG, we're a cybersecurity
systems integrator

23
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:05,319
in the Middle East, we
deliver services on a number

24
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:08,460
of cybersecurity topics,
everything from, of course

25
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:13,460
your solutions to also a
lot of (indistinct) services

26
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,842
for some of the large
clients in the Middle East.

27
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:20,939
- Thank you.

28
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:22,699
So what Nicolai and I are gonna do,

29
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,730
and you get two suits we
needed to dress the same way,

30
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:27,740
we had to tuck (indistinct) to align.

31
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:30,339
We gonna talk about, we picked five trends

32
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,580
obviously there's, many more than that

33
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:36,270
but we picked five, kind
of across the spectrum.

34
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:37,589
Some of them, you will see,

35
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:40,300
like the first one is
more about user experience

36
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,160
and how security and user
experience are so critical

37
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,539
and kind of happen,

38
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:48,250
nowadays hand in hand actually
have to happen, hand in hand.

39
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,760
The second one, it's
more about the people,

40
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,520
because people are core and center

41
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,000
when it comes to security,

42
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,630
not just security awareness

43
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:57,220
you would see that there
has many other things.

44
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,160
And not just because of work from home,

45
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,770
I think, many of us have been

46
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:04,399
in a working from home
for a year plus now,

47
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,080
it looks like the lock downs are easing

48
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,079
in some parts of the world, but still,

49
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,930
some things will remain and
we are gonna talk about that.

50
00:02:12,873 --> 00:02:15,609
The other macro trend that
we've seen, disinformation.

51
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:17,260
It keeps happening,

52
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:19,670
it's probably something
at society level, but,

53
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:22,809
let's talk about it because
it's still impacting

54
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,473
businesses day in, day out,

55
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,980
and they're using very interesting tricks.

56
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,000
And again, Nicolai is gonna talk about,

57
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,790
what are some of the things
we can do to make sure

58
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,500
you stay on the safe side.

59
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,740
Finally, and it's linked to the people

60
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,730
disinformation, insider threats

61
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:40,670
is still a growing concern
inside organizations.

62
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,600
Also because of the
shift to work from home,

63
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,140
and also because the bad guys,

64
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,380
being in the (indistinct) state,

65
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:51,350
organized criminals, dress
the same ransomware crews

66
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:53,720
I've been using those tricks

67
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,760
to drive more insider threat risk.

68
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,493
And finally, the last one you will see it,

69
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:00,450
it's about data.

70
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:03,579
We talked so far a lot
about the users and,

71
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,450
there's kind of an umbrella theme that,

72
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:09,070
we're gonna use at the end to recap is,

73
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:10,162
where is your data?

74
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:14,030
And I think many of you
maybe already found out,

75
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,550
because of some of the breaches lately

76
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:17,650
and some of the leaks, but,

77
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:19,960
data is core and center in a way it comes

78
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,250
to any data protection
strategy in organizations.

79
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,470
So is that, we'll dive in,

80
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:28,710
I'm gonna present more kind of,

81
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:31,190
crystal ball sinking, some of the insights

82
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,420
that we've been looking at,

83
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,399
as Forcepoint or X-Labs

84
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,150
or research group that
does data scientists

85
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,630
cyber security researchers,

86
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:42,420
human behavior, psychologists
and then Nicolai,

87
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,299
we'll share a whole like,

88
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:48,150
he has been helping clients apply, protect

89
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:52,550
defend against some of those
findings we're discussing here.

90
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:54,530
Hopefully you're gonna enjoy this session

91
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:56,183
and thanks for being with us.

92
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:00,700
So let's dive in, the first one,

93
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,589
the emergence of the
Zoom of Cybersecurity.

94
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:06,090
Many of us, have switched

95
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:08,500
from being an office,
or many of us are being

96
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,203
on the road all the time
using productivity tools.

97
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:16,050
And, Zoom or any corporation
tool has become core and center

98
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:19,529
for business operations
in any organization.

99
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:22,450
And people realized that, whereas,

100
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:23,909
other piece of technologies
have been around

101
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:24,770
for very long time,

102
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:27,440
and you look back at the
the regular conference calls

103
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,540
voice only WebEx, SASE
(indistinct) for very long time,

104
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:35,670
people wonder, why why did
Zoom take off that rapidly?

105
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,760
Why did it grow so fast?

106
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,223
Well, at the end of the day,

107
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,539
it's the user experience on one hand side

108
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:46,830
and also other hand side
is how easy it is to test

109
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:49,210
and buy a security offering.

110
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:52,840
So what we're saying here
is that cyber security

111
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,270
has become a business differentiator.

112
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:58,750
It's something you need as
part of your business processes

113
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,890
it's not just any more something

114
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:03,000
that we call it a category creation.

115
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,830
I think the whole buying cycle

116
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:07,469
what business processes
are on testing, new tools

117
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:10,150
adopting new tools, deploying new tools

118
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,729
has completely changed.

119
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:13,360
From an end-user point of view,

120
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,070
the user experience is critical.

121
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:17,730
Users don't want more friction,

122
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:21,180
they want quicker time
to value and ease of use.

123
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:24,100
And finally, before I
hand over to Nicolai,

124
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:27,020
you will see that this
has actually changed

125
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:29,979
the mindset at all
levels in organizations,

126
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:30,903
at the user level,

127
00:05:31,747 --> 00:05:33,790
at the (indistinct) or CIO level,

128
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:35,710
but also at the exec and the board

129
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,680
of director level.

130
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:40,090
Because topics like SASE,
Secure Access Service Edge,

131
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,830
are being discussed at that level.

132
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:45,090
So you see much more business
partnership happening

133
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:48,729
on security topics on board level.

134
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:51,310
And that's kind of all the three key items

135
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:54,900
we've decided to really
push into this topic

136
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,679
of the Zoom of cybersecurity.

137
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,750
Nicolai, what did you guys do about this?

138
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:03,053
How did you help implement
answers to this problem?

139
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,049
- So there's a number
of discussions we have

140
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:08,763
with clients, so first of all,

141
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,680
cybersecurity is really
one of those things

142
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,340
that you need to think into any kind

143
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,070
of transformation within
your organization.

144
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:20,420
I think the last year
we've done more discussions

145
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,950
about digital transformation,

146
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,417
how it impacts organizations

147
00:06:23,417 --> 00:06:26,099
and we've done the 10 years before

148
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,120
simply because organizations were pushed

149
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,220
to doing that digital transformation

150
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:33,430
due to the situation we're
in with the pandemic.

151
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:35,690
And key for that is to make sure

152
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:38,650
that cybersecurity gets thought into that.

153
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:40,580
Because if you don't start off by thinking

154
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,590
about how could this
impact your organization

155
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:44,810
from a cyber security perspective

156
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:46,950
or what kind of risk there
is associated with them

157
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:49,330
how do you address those risks,

158
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:51,530
unfortunately, you
could become a disruptor

159
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:53,619
of your own business and that's also

160
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,570
not an outcome that you want from that.

161
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:57,610
So that's a little bit
linking to what you're saying

162
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:59,420
about the board of directors.

163
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,870
I also think that the
boards in organizations,

164
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:05,020
they have much, much better
security capabilities

165
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,150
and understanding, about technology today

166
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:09,159
than they've had in the past.

167
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,000
And that means that
they can make much more

168
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,090
educated discussions within the boardroom.

169
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:16,869
And finally, I also have
to say that we're involved

170
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,070
on those kinds of levels to discuss

171
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,650
with the board on what they can do.

172
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:22,500
And that's, at least a development

173
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,773
that we haven't seen before.

174
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:29,549
Another thing that we are
constantly requested by clients

175
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:32,900
is it's how we deploy

176
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:37,549
and how we also go to market
with products and services

177
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:40,840
where customers the same
way that they're ordering

178
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:44,580
a Zoom subscription to
take that as an example,

179
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:49,580
also expecting the same
kind of buying pattern

180
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,020
for cybersecurity products as well.

181
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:58,020
So really subscription-based
service outcome-based solutions

182
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,740
and the same way that
you can choose to say,

183
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,310
well, this month I'm using Netflix

184
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:05,040
for streaming and next
month I'm using Disney Plus,

185
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,900
if I'm not happy about
the content I'm getting

186
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,239
on one streaming service over the other,

187
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,000
it's a little bit the
same with cybersecurity

188
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,180
that customers want that kind of success.

189
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,950
Of course, a lot of that being decided

190
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,630
of how good is the service

191
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:21,963
and also, what is the
user experience from it?

192
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,040
Obviously we talk a
lot about cybersecurity

193
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,540
and a lot of different kinds of vendors.

194
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:33,980
One of the biggest areas
that we're looking at it

195
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,510
also with clients is of course

196
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:37,453
how do we integrate all of this stuff?

197
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:40,869
I think we're blessed
with the fact that many

198
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:42,750
of the vendors, they understand

199
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:46,270
that they are living in an ecosystem now,

200
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:49,079
and they're not just in their
own little world anymore,

201
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,500
which means that we have these rich

202
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,680
kind of integration capabilities

203
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,540
whether you call it a platform or sore

204
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,490
if you're one other
vendor or something else

205
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:58,720
if you're a third vendor,

206
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,010
what's key is to make sure

207
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:03,202
that you are able to get information

208
00:09:03,202 --> 00:09:06,353
to go from one system to the other.

209
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:11,690
- Perfect, so this is really
becoming real, which is great.

210
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:14,310
Next one, let's kind of not switch gears,

211
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:16,973
but, you go back to the roots.

212
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,450
I'm not gonna say the roots of all avail

213
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:23,412
because for way, way too
many years or decades,

214
00:09:23,412 --> 00:09:26,550
people kept repeating
users are the weakest link.

215
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:29,240
And we wanna make sure that you and I,

216
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,790
having been out in the fields,
like it is not the case.

217
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:36,709
Actually users are play their role

218
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,540
in making security better.

219
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:40,780
Users should be trusted,

220
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,350
and that's something we
wanted have a conversation

221
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:46,340
about also like, we spoke
about SASE previously.

222
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:47,920
There's always the zero trust concept

223
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,699
which is very negative, by definition.

224
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,090
There is no trust, you have to build trust

225
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:55,870
when maybe it should be
the other way around.

226
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:58,850
Trust exists, most
employees are good people,

227
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:01,550
good employees they wanna do
the right things for them,

228
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:03,870
so that is important.

229
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,810
And the work from home situation

230
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:10,032
this kind of new, normal
has shown many of us as,

231
00:10:10,989 --> 00:10:12,370
and it was kind of predicted

232
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:15,260
that users cannot take more friction.

233
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,530
It is complicated enough
to work from home,

234
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:20,430
this is home office, which has become like

235
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:22,359
a branch office of one,

236
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,320
in a very complex environment,

237
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,580
where, you have sometimes
the kids working from home

238
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,940
you have shared computer, shared WiFi,

239
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,890
you need to print locally,

240
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:33,510
things move off USB keys again,

241
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:34,560
that is very important.

242
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,020
And any security tool,

243
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,230
should actually empower
users to be better,

244
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:41,260
act like a safety net, for them

245
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:43,530
to make sure confirmation doesn't happen

246
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:46,069
but also protect company data.

247
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:47,380
And the other thing that,

248
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,240
we predicted to be very helpful,

249
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,760
kind of building on the active coaching,

250
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,790
coaching in the moment in DLP tools

251
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:58,199
is that those real-time interactions

252
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,870
will help make better decisions.

253
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,780
With all the stress or the noise

254
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:05,530
or the signals or interrupts
people keep getting

255
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:06,949
all the time,

256
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:09,150
even sometimes cussing the
beeps coming from Outlook

257
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:11,980
which maybe I forgot to shut down,

258
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,760
those real time interactions,

259
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,220
this are some in the moment coaching

260
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:18,120
because it helps people to stop

261
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,610
and think about what they're gonna do

262
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:22,690
and maybe not do the wrong thing.

263
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:25,410
So this model where we used to do

264
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:27,390
like this legacy DLP approach

265
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:30,640
where people switch from
audit mode to enforcement mode

266
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,340
and the enforcement models
only is a block hollow

267
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:35,260
is actually blocking the business.

268
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:38,590
People don't switch DLP from
audit to enforcement mode

269
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:39,890
because of the risks,

270
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:44,890
but also it's being seen
as a wall by many users.

271
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:47,090
So I think what we were predicting,

272
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:50,150
is that something which
is more risk adaptive,

273
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:54,680
based on understanding a
user process to company data

274
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,170
or company systems at
a certain point of time

275
00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:01,449
and adjusting the level of
access makes probably more sense.

276
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:03,920
What do you see is that aligned

277
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,953
with what you see in the field Nicolai?

278
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:07,913
- Absolutely.

279
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:12,157
First of all, by blocking,

280
00:12:12,158 --> 00:12:15,650
it's an extremely expensive
way of doing security

281
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:17,530
because you're actually inhibiting people

282
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:18,699
from doing what they're supposed

283
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,850
to do which is their job right?

284
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:22,840
So if you have the capability of getting

285
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,090
to a level where you have
a much better understanding

286
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:28,020
of what is good and
potentially bad behavior

287
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:30,150
or a malicious behavior,

288
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:32,560
then you can choose to say,
well I'm going to allow

289
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,319
everything that's with good intent

290
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,510
which does not necessarily break

291
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:40,360
my DNP process around some really, really

292
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,600
sensitive data in the organization.

293
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,620
I don't think we'll ever
get to the point where

294
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:47,143
we are turning off our DMPs and just,

295
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,877
purely trusting our employees to always

296
00:12:51,877 --> 00:12:55,599
make the right decision because
there's some governance risk

297
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,070
and potentially some compliance
around some of the data

298
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:59,760
that you're working with.

299
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,180
But it would be really, really nice

300
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,964
if we could, in those,
let's say areas where

301
00:13:03,965 --> 00:13:07,130
we're not required to
do these kinds of things

302
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:08,809
and we can make the decision based

303
00:13:08,809 --> 00:13:11,660
on the intent of the user.

304
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:14,183
Also, because it's so much easier to do.

305
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:17,190
But I also have to say, it also depends

306
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:20,130
on how do we actually
create those processes

307
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:22,853
that our users are working based on,

308
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:28,740
as an example, we had

309
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,240
right at the beginning of the pandemic

310
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,540
where everyone was fleeing
home to their home offices

311
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,770
we saw in our digital
risk protection service

312
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:40,877
we saw quite a big increase in data loss,

313
00:13:40,877 --> 00:13:44,870
and the reason why it was
actually not malicious data loss

314
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:47,060
it wasn't like people got
hacked or anything like that,

315
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,209
maybe some of it was that.

316
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:50,020
But the largest part of it,

317
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:53,550
was simply because people had
fled to their home offices,

318
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:55,839
had to do the job and figure out that

319
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,090
potentially they couldn't send

320
00:13:57,090 --> 00:14:00,160
that large Excel file on
the exchange environment

321
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,959
because there was a file limitation.

322
00:14:04,366 --> 00:14:07,420
And then they decided to send
that on their private email

323
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:10,500
address instead, which caused
potentially a data leak.

324
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,460
So these are some things
when we design processes

325
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:16,140
that we need to do in the right way.

326
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:19,730
And then finally, what we talk
a lot with clients about is,

327
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:22,540
that you need to assume breach.

328
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:26,010
So you need to assume
that one day your systems

329
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:28,120
will not work, that your
users will potentially

330
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,920
do something that they shouldn't do,

331
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,630
again not out of malicious intent,

332
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:36,090
but that something will happen.

333
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:38,250
And if you kind of plan for that breach,

334
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,540
you can start to walk in and you can start

335
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,319
to think about what would happen

336
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,000
if these things happens.

337
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,610
And I think assuming breach
with all of the changes

338
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:49,580
that we've had in the
last year is something

339
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,730
we should be spending
a little bit more on.

340
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,830
- And you actually
already kind of concluded,

341
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,580
that's gonna be the last point,

342
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:57,413
but you're good one.

343
00:14:57,413 --> 00:14:58,560
And I think today

344
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,859
people do people's things right.

345
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,710
Amazon prime delivery, I'm just waiting

346
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:04,490
for the kids to run in, and the
neighbor to start the chain,

347
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:05,640
so to cut the tree.

348
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,982
And then we'll have all
the people do people things

349
00:15:07,982 --> 00:15:10,610
on the Zoom recording.

350
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:13,010
Next topic, disinformation.

351
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:15,463
This has been going on
for quite some time,

352
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:19,420
it's kind of a macro level issue.

353
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,589
But we also believe it is very specific

354
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:23,960
to what we see in the enterprise.

355
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,090
People have been doing this

356
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:27,100
for quite some time,

357
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,890
sometimes the most kind
of handmade, so to speak

358
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:32,220
to drive, business, email compromise,

359
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,863
some phishing and other techniques.

360
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,207
And spinning nights,

361
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:39,410
kind of societal behavior

362
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:41,113
you look at some of the
things that's happened

363
00:15:41,113 --> 00:15:44,410
during the election period.

364
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,959
But the other thing we've seen is that,

365
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,860
some criminal organizations
have turned this

366
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,040
into like a service.

367
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,870
So you can actually, although,

368
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,691
send in the data you want
and they're gonna produce

369
00:15:54,691 --> 00:15:57,380
is the voice recording the video recording

370
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:59,730
or something to help
spread this information

371
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:02,070
or actually trick users to do something.

372
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:03,080
Again under stress,

373
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,400
I think the combination of work from home

374
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,069
the time differences
in some organizations,

375
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:08,650
the level of stress, the fact that people

376
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:11,673
don't pay attention as much,

377
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,050
is still a problem.

378
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:16,240
The awareness is much better,

379
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,260
because there's been many, many examples.

380
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,460
Most of the times, they
actually funny examples

381
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,410
but it's also still very a symmetric,

382
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:24,500
like many things in security,

383
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,700
it doesn't take a lot of effort to create

384
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:27,990
and it can be reused.

385
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:29,640
We've seen that a lot also driving

386
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,353
kind of Crypto Locker, ransomware.

387
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:34,390
How do you see that there is a kind of,

388
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:37,020
in region, where you operate Nicolai

389
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,560
with Help AG or in general,

390
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,770
what do people see?

391
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:41,840
How did they react to this?

392
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,410
And it's that a real problem?

393
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:46,219
- Well, first of all,
it's something that we see

394
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:49,680
at clients across the board.

395
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,949
Actually for me personally,

396
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:54,130
this is one of the things
I'm the most worried

397
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:56,945
about being also a citizen in the world,

398
00:16:56,945 --> 00:16:59,170
and these kinds of things is this,

399
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:01,089
this information deep, fake, and all

400
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:02,410
of these things that we're gonna start

401
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:04,710
to see being weaponized for real,

402
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:06,260
there's apps on your mobile phone

403
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:09,540
that can do certain parts
of this, of course, for fun.

404
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:13,569
But, but if you can do
it on your mobile phone

405
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:15,649
and it's relatively trustworthy,

406
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:18,450
it's probably quite certain that attackers

407
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:22,260
they will be weaponizing
this very quickly.

408
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,650
Which of course in an enterprise setting

409
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:26,869
can be utilized in phishing scenarios

410
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:28,820
and these kinds of things.

411
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:32,110
So I think awareness is
really becoming a real

412
00:17:32,111 --> 00:17:34,283
business requirement.

413
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:39,176
So that's something that
I work with clients around

414
00:17:39,176 --> 00:17:41,580
on thinking about how
do they do awareness.

415
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:44,426
And I think what we see
with awareness programs

416
00:17:44,426 --> 00:17:48,330
they should no longer be a
point in time awareness program

417
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:50,330
but it should really be
something where you test

418
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:54,280
and probe and educate
your users constantly

419
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:58,900
in that kind of awareness scenario,

420
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,900
so that it becomes an ongoing session

421
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,760
also because it's a
very, very moving target

422
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,970
what these things are happening.

423
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:07,890
And then finally,

424
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:10,630
I think it's very much a technology

425
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:12,500
created problem specifically

426
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,080
when we're talking about deep fakes

427
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,169
and some of the more advanced
phishing capabilities.

428
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:20,880
So I think that at some
point of time that also needs

429
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,790
to be some form of electronic
or a solution for it.

430
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:27,590
So I can easily see that as an industry

431
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:30,129
or as a society that
there will be some form

432
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:33,040
of validation service
around some of these things.

433
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,889
Of course now, I'm talking
a little bit outside

434
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:37,260
of the topic of enterprise

435
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,330
but I think the whole way that we think

436
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:43,330
about information and
validating sources is important.

437
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,750
In the setting of business

438
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,943
and here in the Middle East specifically,

439
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:53,260
we have seen way too
many successful attempts

440
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:56,450
of getting people to
change account information

441
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:58,740
for suppliers and these kinds of things,

442
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:01,880
low level stuff that's happening,
but it's still successful.

443
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,950
And the reason why is because often,

444
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:08,020
organizations do not have
the right business process

445
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:10,407
in place to make sure
that that becomes secure.

446
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,540
- And that's an interesting point.

447
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:15,379
It's just a security technology

448
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,580
that needs to solve the problem

449
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,840
is also business processes needs to start

450
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,090
to account for some of those risks

451
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:22,110
fairly true.

452
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:24,229
And that's actually a good lead

453
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:27,490
into the next topic, which is,

454
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:28,780
I think twofold,

455
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,510
insider threats and we've been seeing

456
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:33,253
insider threat becoming more of a problem,

457
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,800
during the pandemic and lock down,

458
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,520
because the security
exposure and security posture

459
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,430
the work environment has changed so much.

460
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:45,760
And, things have been, kind
of changing here and there,

461
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,070
and not being, probably
controlled in the same way.

462
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:51,210
But also to the second part is,

463
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:53,810
it's become like a little bit as again,

464
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:55,409
like this information,

465
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:56,510
insider threat-as-a service,

466
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:58,790
like compromising accounts,

467
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:02,180
compromising people has
been something that people

468
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:05,117
have been weighing as a
service to (indistinct).

469
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:08,562
So what we're saying here is,

470
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:11,970
really what we were expecting is

471
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:13,850
for organizations to rethink where

472
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:15,860
their threats are coming

473
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:18,503
in this very shifting environment.

474
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:20,889
I remember having conversation

475
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:23,315
with CIOs and CFOs and CEOs like

476
00:20:23,315 --> 00:20:25,280
(indistinct) a year from now,

477
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,610
that we're kind of reinventing the network

478
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:31,449
reinventing security
or reinventing desktops

479
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:34,310
and laptops overnight, over weekends,

480
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:35,840
sometimes a company credit card

481
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,520
and shifting data from
on-prem to the cloud.

482
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,520
And users, their environment
has changed as well.

483
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,790
I think, people forgot that everybody

484
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:47,930
and new technology we kind of,

485
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:50,250
we live and breathe day in, day out,

486
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,750
but we probably didn't start

487
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,766
in one, two, 5% of people that do that

488
00:20:53,766 --> 00:20:57,116
but everybody else is
just a consumer of those

489
00:20:57,116 --> 00:20:59,750
(indistinct) and security
services, we are awful.

490
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,620
And I don't think people really realize

491
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:04,139
what the psychological

492
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:07,120
and the intellectual
impact is on those people

493
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,550
and how do you deal with that?

494
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:11,110
And that's why the second data point,

495
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:13,129
or the second point and data point

496
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:15,090
is quite interesting.

497
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:17,790
Yeah they're good but they make mistakes.

498
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:19,860
Some of them go roque, you
always have people going rouge

499
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:20,909
because their have flight risks,

500
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:23,960
because of espionage because
they're being compromised,

501
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,019
but most of the (indistinct)

502
00:21:26,019 --> 00:21:27,810
that we were expecting is actually

503
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:30,280
people making mistakes.

504
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,780
I remember some of the data points,

505
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:32,790
we were seeing

506
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:35,230
back in the early days of
the pandemic at Forcepoint

507
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:37,133
or X-Labs team was picking like,

508
00:21:37,133 --> 00:21:41,120
1.5 millions of emails per day,

509
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,320
that were very sophisticated COVID theme

510
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,879
or Office 365 laid out, phishing attempts.

511
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,290
So people were getting compromised,

512
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:53,470
And the idea here is also that,

513
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:55,410
you revert or you turn the table

514
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:56,340
on the insider threat

515
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:59,020
where the idea is that we as an industry

516
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,620
we need to help people defend themselves

517
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,100
from being compromised and being used

518
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,419
and abused because they
didn't even know about it.

519
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,863
And I think the other topic that I think

520
00:22:06,863 --> 00:22:08,330
Nicolai you already touched on

521
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:10,120
in one of the previous items is,

522
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,979
the goal is, you could assume
breach, but I think the goal

523
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:16,090
should also be as an industry that

524
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:18,649
we are staying left of loss.

525
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:21,330
So rather than trying to
address the forensics,

526
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:23,080
the remediation, the mitigation

527
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,490
when you happen to have a breach,

528
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:26,890
AK you are, or you right of breach,

529
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:30,150
I think the tools without
being in the user space

530
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:33,560
are either creating more
friction should actually

531
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:37,960
help industries use a CIO,
simplify the toolboxes

532
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,100
have better user experience
and make sure that

533
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,540
this risk adaptive approach
we've been talking about

534
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:44,290
for quite some time now,

535
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:48,610
enables organizations to
really stay left of loss.

536
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:50,139
Again, what's your take on that?

537
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:52,093
Is that something you see as well?

538
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:58,100
- Well, breaches are ridiculously
expensive to deal with.

539
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,887
First of all, there can
be legal implications

540
00:22:59,887 --> 00:23:02,090
there can be clean of implications

541
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:03,419
and all of these things, of course

542
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:06,320
you want to avoid those things happening.

543
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,760
And of course that's also why we see

544
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,660
so much investment going
into an effort going

545
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:13,700
into avoiding those
breaches in the first place.

546
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,650
But there is fundamental
changes that happened

547
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:16,890
in the last year.

548
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:20,140
Obviously moving back
home and the home office,

549
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:23,230
again, I think anyone on this conference,

550
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:24,560
that's on this conference,

551
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:27,540
we've been used to working
at home or from remote

552
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:30,490
and all of things even
before the pandemic happened

553
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:32,560
but we need to remember
that most of our coworkers

554
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,250
in our organizations, may not

555
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:38,060
have had that kind of experience,

556
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:39,623
for them it was brand new.

557
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,790
So this kind of like
the hybrid workforce has

558
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:44,800
that has come up.

559
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,129
I also think that now, as organizations

560
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:48,580
have figured out that,

561
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:51,149
that working from home
does not maybe really

562
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:56,150
impact the efficiency of the individual,

563
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,330
they're going to start
speculating much more

564
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:00,070
how can they actually utilize this

565
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:03,320
even after we have all been
vaccinated and the pandemic

566
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,253
has been solved.

567
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,350
And they might also look
into different kinds

568
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:10,169
of ways of hiring resources,

569
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:13,370
which means that the
association between the employee

570
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:16,800
and the corporation may not be as strong

571
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,730
as it used to be, which
potentially can lead

572
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:21,795
to some insider threat issues.

573
00:24:21,795 --> 00:24:24,710
So I think that's really important.

574
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:27,290
So having the right visibility

575
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:30,930
and being able to create the right view

576
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:33,320
on what distributed workforce

577
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:36,340
is doing with our data, or with data

578
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:40,449
is extremely important as we move forward.

579
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:42,530
And that's really about
being able to detect

580
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:44,643
before the loss actually happens.

581
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,690
So I think as we have all moved home

582
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:51,959
and all working in these environments now,

583
00:24:51,959 --> 00:24:55,190
hand on hand I think anyone maybe revisit

584
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:57,290
if you have that right level of visibility

585
00:24:57,290 --> 00:24:58,930
and understanding what's happening

586
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:01,313
with the data, no matter where it is.

587
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:04,943
- Perfect.

588
00:25:04,943 --> 00:25:08,101
And this is kind of our summary section.

589
00:25:08,101 --> 00:25:10,060
it's probably a topic on its own,

590
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,110
but at the same time,

591
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,960
what we talked about here
is a lot about the users,

592
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,768
a lot of other data.

593
00:25:16,768 --> 00:25:17,710
And then at the end of the day

594
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:19,620
what we wanna protect is your data.

595
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:20,699
And one of the predictions,

596
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,760
we were making as kind
of Forcepoint X-Labs

597
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,643
at the end of last year is that,

598
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:28,600
somebody else is probably having a backup

599
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:32,030
of your data, kind of
jokingly, so to speak.

600
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,649
And the tagline we came up with is like,

601
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:35,483
you know where is your data?

602
00:25:35,483 --> 00:25:37,190
You're probably gonna find that in 2021.

603
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:40,710
And I think so far, like four months in,

604
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:42,190
we've been proven right.

605
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:43,370
There's been so many breaches

606
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:44,729
there's been super chain attacks

607
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:46,520
and they look at solar
winds and the puzzles

608
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,900
there's all the ones we
don't know about yet.

609
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:53,900
So it is sadly the start state of affairs,

610
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:57,290
I think we didn't have to
wait till 2021 to find out,

611
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:59,070
criminals don't rest.

612
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:01,460
The attack affairs is still going on.

613
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,260
People burn more zero days,

614
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:06,283
no chain more components
to get to the end goal.

615
00:26:08,088 --> 00:26:09,360
There's still many breaches happening

616
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,810
many organizations,

617
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:14,250
still don't take security
seriously enough.

618
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:16,132
We send a little bit of everything,

619
00:26:16,132 --> 00:26:17,790
and it's the full spectrum.

620
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:19,260
We are still investing a lot,

621
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:21,180
people have been doubling down,

622
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,120
probably starting last summer in kind

623
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,830
of retrofitting security into
the work from home plans.

624
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:28,230
Making sure that the policies

625
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:30,330
for data protection also get applied

626
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:33,780
to remote devices that, the remote desktop

627
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:36,530
or that the shared
environment is better secure,

628
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:38,629
but we've seen everything,

629
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:41,320
from various stupid and basic phishing

630
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:44,293
and ransomware to full kind of Sunburst

631
00:26:44,294 --> 00:26:46,810
(indistinct) type attacks.

632
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:48,653
So what we're saying is,

633
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,730
the work from home setups,

634
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:54,680
the changes that have been driven

635
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,650
from a digital
transformation point of view

636
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:59,270
so to speak, in an organization where,

637
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:01,477
applications shifted from
on-prem to the cloud,

638
00:27:01,477 --> 00:27:06,477
people are investing into
private access type offerings

639
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,590
and so on.

640
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:10,060
That security posture and that secure

641
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:13,423
that attack surface actually
needed to be readdressed.

642
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,173
And I think the organizations are still

643
00:27:15,173 --> 00:27:16,670
in the process,

644
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:21,200
and in the meantime, many organizations

645
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,053
or nation States,

646
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:27,260
in a criminal organizations
have spent the time to approach,

647
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:29,920
their pins on the board, here and there

648
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,640
and are just waiting to
probably do more harm.

649
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,160
What's your take on that?

650
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:37,140
What can organizations do about that?

651
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:41,060
Because like we saying,
here, it is true that,

652
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:43,560
SASE application consumption has exploded,

653
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,720
data has moved,

654
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,843
the ownership of the
application has moved sometimes

655
00:27:46,843 --> 00:27:48,130
from the IT teams,

656
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:50,720
to the business owners, especially look

657
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,270
at CRM tools and marketing
or customer experience tools

658
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:57,690
and people at the same
time should not forget

659
00:27:57,690 --> 00:27:58,740
about infrastructure security.

660
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,479
We're not trying to say here that

661
00:28:00,479 --> 00:28:03,020
infrastructure security
is the same from the past,

662
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:05,750
it's still part of your maturity model.

663
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,420
But what we've seen is,

664
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:09,147
people finally starts to address also

665
00:28:09,147 --> 00:28:11,320
the data protection layer

666
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,159
and this needs to be looked at.

667
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,760
And people handing over to you,

668
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,350
for the final comments, Nicolai,

669
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:19,750
I think like you said earlier

670
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:21,350
the whole orchestration automation,

671
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:22,860
having better tools

672
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:26,310
making more sensitive data is
also very important because

673
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:29,909
there's been so much more noise generated

674
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:32,380
by events by (indistinct) and so on,

675
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:33,630
that this also needs to be reduced

676
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:37,190
because you cannot scale
your sock with more people.

677
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:39,490
So I think to touch on
a lot of things here,

678
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:42,290
what's kind of your take on this,

679
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:45,510
probably very kind of wide-scale?

680
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:46,587
Over to you.

681
00:28:47,699 --> 00:28:52,360
- Well, the pandemic was a
perfect stone for attackers.

682
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,149
I think that's something that we also

683
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:55,460
from an academic perspective,

684
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:57,712
it has been really, really interesting

685
00:28:57,712 --> 00:28:59,160
to observe what happened.

686
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:02,280
So everything from the phishing emails

687
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:05,870
that were theme that way and
hitting the soft underbelly

688
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:08,280
of people working from at home,

689
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,830
obviously it was fantastic

690
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:11,899
for the attackers to
have all of these things.

691
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:14,490
And these things are by
the way playing out still.

692
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:17,050
Like right now it's phishing campaigns

693
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:19,080
around vaccination that's happening.

694
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,653
And you need to remember that
users in their home offices

695
00:29:21,653 --> 00:29:24,150
have very, very different behavior

696
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:26,090
than they have in the office.

697
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:27,820
So this really means,

698
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:31,970
that you need to reconsider
how you do on-prem security

699
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:36,040
versus what you do in when
people are working from home.

700
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,270
You also need to revisit,

701
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:39,800
how do you think about SaaS security.

702
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,659
In the sense that that's a whole new topic

703
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:44,910
for certain organizations as
they start to utilize that.

704
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:47,500
Also remember SaaS organizations

705
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:50,120
or companies that deliver access services

706
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:53,850
are also targets in this big cybersecurity

707
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,363
challenge that we're having.

708
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:58,850
And I'm not talking about the big ones

709
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:00,756
but if you're buying
a smaller SaaS service

710
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:03,680
you need to evaluate if
that specific SaaS service

711
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,320
is secured in a way that you can except

712
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,317
for the data that you're
gonna put into it.

713
00:30:09,317 --> 00:30:12,240
So that's also a new
challenge for organizations

714
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,723
as they move into cloud.

715
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,960
One low level thing which I
think we haven't done enough

716
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,080
where an organization,
haven't done enough with,

717
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,350
is really assessing how your
endpoints are going to do

718
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:26,719
against what I would call
normal attack scenarios.

719
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,270
So really performing an assessment

720
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:32,139
of the security robustness
of the end points.

721
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:34,190
That's something that many organizations

722
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:35,543
could benefit from.

723
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:39,970
We generally, when we do
these kinds of services

724
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:41,920
are able to break through the systems,

725
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,040
it's really only a question of effort

726
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:46,700
but the outcome of that
is that organizations

727
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,580
can fix those specific issues

728
00:30:49,888 --> 00:30:53,122
or scenarios that we played
out on the environment.

729
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:57,640
It's also about understanding
where the user is sitting.

730
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,040
So it may not be appropriate

731
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:02,100
that they do everything at all locations.

732
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,230
It may not be appropriate

733
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:05,100
that they do everything or have access

734
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:08,043
to all data at any location
that they're working at.

735
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:11,930
So that's also an element
that I think is very important

736
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:14,740
that you create policies
that can follow the rules

737
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:17,570
and follow the location of the user.

738
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:20,129
And then maybe a final
thing, a call to action,

739
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:22,680
if you haven't done
this already is to think

740
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,590
about which kind of disability you have

741
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:26,003
in this new paradigm.

742
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:28,649
Because if you haven't got visibility

743
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:30,450
you're also not really going to catch

744
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:32,240
what's going to happen out there.

745
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,360
And, you have to understand the fact that

746
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:37,719
where your security used
to be maybe centralized

747
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,750
in a couple of locations
where the users were sitting

748
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:43,970
and you had your centralized
firewalls and proxies

749
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:45,980
and these kinds of things to look at,

750
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:48,660
now the users potentially are everywhere.

751
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:49,620
And how do you deal

752
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,973
with creating that kind
of visibility layer?

753
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:56,140
- True, thank you.

754
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:59,260
I think super insightful, I hope,

755
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:01,733
you and the audience, enjoyed
to the end of the conversation

756
00:32:01,733 --> 00:32:03,403
between Nicolai and I,

757
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,909
I think we are kind of proven right.

758
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:07,880
To summarize on some of those insights

759
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:10,490
and the crystal ball is always a risk.

760
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:14,560
but I think, what Nicolai shared with us,

761
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:17,909
his field experience, what
he has implemented in clients

762
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:18,743
resonates with you,

763
00:32:18,743 --> 00:32:23,330
and he's gonna help you
make your environment better

764
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:25,250
make the user experience
better for your users

765
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:26,740
make your data more safe

766
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:29,360
make your infrastructure more resilient.

767
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,679
With that Nicolai, let me hand over back

768
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:34,190
to you for maybe one last final statement

769
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:35,740
or recommendation to the audience before

770
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:36,923
maybe we open to QA.

771
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:41,070
- Not much more for me to say here,

772
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:42,453
apart from the fact that,

773
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:46,430
I think we should all utilize
the time and also the fact

774
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:51,430
that we don't have to necessarily
be physically present.

775
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,270
I'm really looking forward
to being able to travel again

776
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:55,560
and be able to go to events.

777
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,070
I think there's a lot of benefits

778
00:32:57,070 --> 00:33:00,550
and also meeting face to face
with industry professionals.

779
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:02,690
So next year I hope that it's going

780
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:04,810
to be face to face instead. (laughs)

781
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:07,393
- I agree, I think we all
miss being face to face,

782
00:33:07,393 --> 00:33:09,683
networking and all the cool chats.

783
00:33:10,648 --> 00:33:12,837
- Thank you all, thank you for attending.
