1
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:03,303
- Hi, everybody.

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,320
Before I bring out my topic for this year,

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,470
taking you down the
checklist of things to do

4
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:11,590
in order to absolutely slow, hinder,

5
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:15,150
even ruin your security
operations center function,

6
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:18,210
I do wanna recognize that
as we sit together virtually

7
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,610
here in the spring of 2021,

8
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:23,919
we have all been remarkably resilient.

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,010
The central theme for this
year's RSA Conference,

10
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:29,820
through what can only
be described as tough,

11
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,093
painful and tragic year.

12
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,669
As a longtime RSA employee,

13
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,800
more than a decade at this point,

14
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,470
I didn't want to let 2021 slip away

15
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:46,470
without a quick look back to
the fall of 1991, 30 years ago,

16
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:49,150
when a group with 60 cryptographers

17
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:51,310
piled into a meeting room at a hotel

18
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:53,380
in Redwood Shores, California,

19
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:57,203
at what was the very first
iteration of RSA Conference.

20
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,480
RSA Conference itself has
been resilient over the years,

21
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:05,060
growing and growing into the
tens of thousands of attendees,

22
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,270
becoming a driving force

23
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:09,009
behind the world's cybersecurity agenda.

24
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:11,770
The central point where people
from around the world gather

25
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:13,993
to share, learn and grow,

26
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,780
and the place that provides a forum

27
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,533
for innovation and partnership.

28
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,770
Please accept my sincere
thanks and gratitude to you

29
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:24,170
and all your fellow attendees

30
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:27,310
for continuing to make
RSA Conference relevant,

31
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:29,203
interesting and valuable.

32
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,670
Now onto the main event,
at least for this session.

33
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,990
I'm pretty sure you're not
here trying to figure out

34
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:41,163
how to sabotage your security
operations center function.

35
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:45,720
The purpose behind my talk is
to lay out five discrete areas

36
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,212
where we've seen organizations,

37
00:01:47,212 --> 00:01:50,230
even the best funded and most mature,

38
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:51,963
sometimes fall into a hole.

39
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:56,050
If you'd like to fall into any
or all five of those holes,

40
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,440
then have at it.

41
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,340
But my goal is to point out these holes

42
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,000
and to get you thinking about
how you and your colleagues

43
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,670
can do a better job securing
your organization from threats,

44
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,863
both external and internal.

45
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:12,040
I'll also make this
commitment to you upfront,

46
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,010
thus far you've probably already
seen too many presentations

47
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,840
with far too many bullets,

48
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,520
what I have for you today
is almost all images.

49
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,190
There's only one slide
with bullets at the end,

50
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,929
where I'll delivering some
actionable recommendations

51
00:02:24,929 --> 00:02:26,643
for you to get started.

52
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:30,193
So let me get started here now.

53
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,590
Regardless of where you and
your organization may be

54
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:37,070
on your security maturity journey,

55
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:41,680
most of us realize that we
can't protect what we can't see.

56
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,180
Clear and unimpeded visibility
into everything you manage

57
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,840
is a must have.

58
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,840
But visibility means different things

59
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,885
to different security
operation centers or SOCs.

60
00:02:51,885 --> 00:02:55,980
It's not unusual to start with
a log collection capability

61
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,230
often through your SIEM,

62
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:01,250
your security information
and event management tooling,

63
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,810
good technology that's been around

64
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:05,463
for more than 15 years at this point.

65
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,950
And so you bring your set of SIEM glasses

66
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:11,339
to maximize your visibility.

67
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,210
You've spent good money on those glasses,

68
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:14,530
you've got the right prescription,

69
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:17,510
you're pretty sure you can
see things pretty clearly.

70
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:19,929
And as a bonus, your
SIEM might not help you

71
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:22,720
only with your security operations needs,

72
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,880
but also with demonstrating
your compliance

73
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,260
with externally-imposed regulations,

74
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:30,070
where you may need to store
those collected logs for months

75
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:31,063
or even years.

76
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:36,059
The fail in many SOCs is to stop there,

77
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,840
to stop with the SIEM and
think that you're finished.

78
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,245
Why is that?

79
00:03:41,245 --> 00:03:44,370
In today world with today's adversaries

80
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,540
if you've just brought
a single set of glasses

81
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:49,600
to this fight, a single set of lenses,

82
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,579
relying only on your SIEM
to detect the badness

83
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:55,380
that may be inside your
environment already,

84
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:57,343
you and your SOC are going to fail.

85
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,750
Let's remember that your SIEM,
however old or new it may be,

86
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,680
is primarily designed to capture logs,

87
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,640
and logs are a look into
the past, not the present,

88
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:13,010
not what's happening
right now on your network.

89
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:15,370
Collecting logs is table stakes,

90
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:18,329
it's the foundation of
many SOC functions today,

91
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:20,380
but it's absolutely not the end state

92
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,750
for securing your organization,

93
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,343
at least it shouldn't be.

94
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,599
Think about your cell phone bill

95
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,040
and the high level call
detail records it shows,

96
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,190
I made a call on this date, at this time,

97
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:38,332
to this phone number, and the
call lasted for X minutes.

98
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,500
Logs are the call detail records

99
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,450
of what's going on in your environment.

100
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:48,020
But what about understanding,
about having visibility

101
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:51,690
into what was actually said
during the conversation,

102
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:53,510
who led the conversation?

103
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:55,150
Who were the two or more people

104
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:58,162
who were actually using the
phones during that conversation?

105
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,140
To get to that level of detail,

106
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:04,210
to get to full visibility
throughout your environment,

107
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:06,510
you need another set of lenses,

108
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:09,250
you need to collect network traffic.

109
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,950
It's the network traffic which
answers all the questions

110
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:14,210
in the analogy I just laid out:

111
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:16,380
the specifics of the conversation,

112
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:19,793
and the people and the devices
used in that conversation.

113
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,210
Monitoring network traffic is a key leg

114
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:26,729
to any successful
zero-trust implementation.

115
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,500
If you're zero trusting today

116
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,050
but not monitoring your network traffic,

117
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:34,030
both North/South, in and
out of your infrastructure,

118
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:36,169
and East/West, within your environment,

119
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,150
perhaps the internal
traffic amongst servers

120
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:39,609
and data centers,

121
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:41,590
if you're not doing these things

122
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,140
then you're not doing it right.

123
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:48,380
I mentioned devices in the
context of network traffic,

124
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:50,830
true visibility also
means being able to see

125
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,969
into what's happening on each device

126
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:55,210
plugged into your network.

127
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:57,359
What's running in memory on that laptop,

128
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,709
on that server right now?

129
00:05:59,709 --> 00:06:03,170
Which specific processes are
originating outbound traffic

130
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:04,400
from that device,

131
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,912
perhaps to a destination you
know represents a threat?

132
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,780
With more and more data
traffic being encrypted,

133
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,909
would it be valuable to
see that original data

134
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:16,960
on the endpoint before
it's been encrypted?

135
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,633
Do I really need a third set of lenses?

136
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:23,289
Yes, is the correct answer.

137
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:26,010
Visibility is all about seeing your logs,

138
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:29,740
your network traffic
and your endpoint data.

139
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:33,030
It's about consuming these
very heterogeneous data sets

140
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:35,489
and normalizing those data points

141
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:38,030
to make it easier for your
SOC analysts to surface

142
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:42,119
and distill actionable information
out of that sea of data,

143
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,570
and to work more effectively,

144
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,409
it's about bringing all this information

145
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:47,770
into a holistic view

146
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:50,099
of what's happening
throughout your environment

147
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,770
from the user, through the
network and into the cloud,

148
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:55,659
to provide visibility anywhere

149
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:58,683
and everywhere data and applications live.

150
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:04,650
This is the XDR or extended
detection and response space.

151
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,740
This is where you need to be headed

152
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,440
if you're not already there today.

153
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:12,230
Or if you prefer to fail,

154
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:14,100
just keep on looking at those logs

155
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,360
collected by your old school SIEM,

156
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,760
and don't think about
what you might be missing.

157
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:22,330
As it turns out,

158
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:24,793
visibility is just the
start of the journey.

159
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:28,383
Your SOC team is drowning in data today,

160
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,140
converting that data into information,

161
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:36,150
into knowledge, into action,
takes a lot of resources.

162
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:38,150
And here I'm not talking about the tools

163
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:40,000
and technology you've deployed,

164
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,223
I'm talking about the mental
resources of your human beings.

165
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,700
Working memory, that place in our brains

166
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,060
which effectively serves
as short-term memory

167
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,830
around current tasks,

168
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:55,830
our work bench, if you will,
is a limited finite resource.

169
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:58,930
Even your sharpest, most
valuable SOC analysts,

170
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:00,790
incident responders, and threat hunters

171
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:04,050
routinely run low on
working memory capacity

172
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,363
as the day goes on.

173
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:09,000
Working memory can be renewed with rest.

174
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,400
But resting to recharge in the
middle of an active incident

175
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,073
is typically not an option.

176
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:18,080
Too many organizations
choose to attack this problem

177
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,789
by lining up an impressive
array of technologies and tools,

178
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:23,800
but ultimately fail to
put them all together

179
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,950
in the right way to maximize
both their investment

180
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:30,039
and their reaction time to an incident.

181
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,070
It's like you have an orchestra

182
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:34,360
where the music and the
instruments are there,

183
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,970
but there's something missing.

184
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:39,585
If you don't have
empowered humans involved,

185
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:42,679
if you don't have a
conductor to help guide

186
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:46,257
these overworked, overpressured
humans working in your SOC,

187
00:08:46,258 --> 00:08:48,863
you're not maximizing your capabilities.

188
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:53,700
I once sat across the table
from a recently arrived CISO,

189
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,830
chief information security officer,

190
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:58,010
and I asked him if he had a defined set

191
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:00,560
of incident response procedures.

192
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,555
He got excited and texted
one of his staff members,

193
00:09:03,556 --> 00:09:05,670
who showed up a few minutes later

194
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,390
carrying a couple of
three-inch thick binders

195
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:10,427
into the conference room.

196
00:09:10,427 --> 00:09:12,357
"What's this?" I asked.

197
00:09:12,357 --> 00:09:15,530
"This," the CISO proudly said,
"is the comprehensive set

198
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:17,620
of instructions and policies to follow

199
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,450
for all the potential attack factors

200
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:21,227
we've identified so far."

201
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:23,709
I congratulated him

202
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:26,830
on what was clearly a huge
documentation project,

203
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:29,270
one created with the best of intentions.

204
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:31,420
But when I then asked
how the humans in the SOC

205
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:34,500
were supposed to reference
this collection of information,

206
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,680
he assured me that every member of the SOC

207
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,593
had copies of these two
binders at their desks.

208
00:09:40,427 --> 00:09:42,787
"How frequently do you update them?"

209
00:09:42,787 --> 00:09:45,433
"A couple of times a year,
probably." he answered.

210
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:49,440
When your SOC team and your organization

211
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,440
are in the middle of trying to diagnose

212
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,590
and respond to an incident,

213
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:55,660
it's probably not the optimal time

214
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:59,290
to pull a binder off the
shelf, go to the index,

215
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:02,480
scan for the use case you
think you're experiencing,

216
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,969
find the correct and
approved-by-management response steps,

217
00:10:05,969 --> 00:10:07,650
go to the other binder

218
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,550
where that information actually lives,

219
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:13,423
and then flip to page 98
to finally start reading.

220
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,209
Doing all that without making a mistake

221
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:19,750
or skipping a step is somewhat unlikely

222
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:23,160
under the pressure of a
still developing incident.

223
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,100
Relying on your humans
to memorize those steps

224
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,760
and carry them out perfectly every time

225
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,893
is an even better way to fail.

226
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,459
Orchestrating your response,

227
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:37,020
having those steps laid out in a runbook,

228
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,750
preferably not a physical book or binder,

229
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:43,180
but via an online resource,
which is always up to date,

230
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:45,479
is your path to success.

231
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,550
This is the lead ingredient
of the security orchestration,

232
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:51,762
automation and response, or SOAR space.

233
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,480
You want those steps to
be universally accessible

234
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,820
by your incident responders.

235
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:00,320
You need those steps to
be absolutely current

236
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,060
and appropriate for
today's threat environment,

237
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,113
not the landscape from six months ago.

238
00:11:05,975 --> 00:11:09,560
If you don't think about how
to orchestrate your response,

239
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,640
how best to combine your humans,

240
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,330
your workflows, your runbooks,

241
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:16,060
and the many tools and
platforms in your environment,

242
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:18,449
which you've purchased and installed,

243
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:21,098
you're not just failing to
maximize your investments,

244
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:25,050
you're failing your SOC by
not helping your analysts

245
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:27,530
conserve their precious working memory

246
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:29,250
so that they can devote all their efforts

247
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,023
to resolving the current issue.

248
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,680
Remember, the best technologies,

249
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,910
the best instruments
don't play themselves.

250
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:40,329
You can't have an orchestra
without your humans

251
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:43,470
and a conductor to guide them along.

252
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:45,690
That's where a solid SOAR solution,

253
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:49,173
security orchestration,
automation and response, can help.

254
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:53,903
That's the O for
orchestration in SOAR model,

255
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,223
but what about the A for automation?

256
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:59,800
Even if you and your SOC

257
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,750
are fully orchestrating
your incident response,

258
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,840
too many teams still struggle

259
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:08,330
with far too many manual processes.

260
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:10,690
And even if you are that rare organization

261
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:13,310
who has completely
documented your processes,

262
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:15,439
if those processes require your analysts

263
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,290
to check the right box

264
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:21,550
or call the right person in
the right order and timeframe,

265
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:25,010
your SOC team is being
burdened by the process

266
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:27,383
instead of being supported by it.

267
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:31,220
We've already established
that a complicated,

268
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:33,930
manually-driven, hard-to-reference process

269
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:36,689
runs the risk of your
analysts being overwhelmed

270
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:38,490
in the heat of the moment.

271
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:41,590
Human beings tend to make
mistakes under stress.

272
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:43,950
So why not automate as much as you can

273
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:45,610
to reserve that limited attention

274
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:49,500
and conserve the working memory
of your first responders?

275
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,720
Automation at its best,
as you might guess,

276
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,580
is all about speed, reproducibility,

277
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,400
and hopefully, accuracy.

278
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,880
All of which goes hand in hand

279
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,380
with the orchestration
capability we talked about.

280
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,640
For example, automation

281
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,710
working with your orchestration capability

282
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:08,780
can be leveraged to track
how long a specific step

283
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:11,689
in your runbook should
be in a specific state,

284
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:12,990
escalating automatically

285
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:16,363
when that time period crosses
the threshold you've defined.

286
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:18,819
But here's the thing,

287
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:23,439
automation isn't just about
streamlining processes,

288
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,020
it can also be used to
programmatically make changes

289
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:28,980
to your infrastructure as
part of your full response

290
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:29,813
to an incident.

291
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:32,520
Think about the power

292
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,560
of automatically updating a firewall ACL,

293
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,520
removing privileges or
entitlements from a user,

294
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,853
or even knocking an infected
endpoint off the network.

295
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:44,939
Think about the danger

296
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:47,760
of automatically updating a firewall ACL,

297
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,700
removing privileges or
entitlements from a user,

298
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,823
or knocking an infected
endpoint off the network.

299
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:57,350
Automating changes to your infrastructure

300
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:00,140
as part of your SOC's
incident response function

301
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,830
can fit in very cleanly

302
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:04,750
along with steps your
analysts need to take.

303
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,800
But this is one area in particular

304
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,630
where understanding
your own infrastructure

305
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:13,710
and the business processes
that infrastructure supports

306
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:14,543
is critical.

307
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,510
Don't automate infrastructure changes

308
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:20,880
until you're certain you know
the potential dependencies

309
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,033
and the potential impacts
of pulling that trigger.

310
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,220
One area where there may be some prior art

311
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:30,980
to help you figure out this question

312
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:34,723
is robotic process automation or RPA.

313
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:37,990
If your organization
already has done some work

314
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:41,350
in this space, find out who
those project managers are

315
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:42,770
and what lessons they learned

316
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:46,199
as they tied systems together through RPA.

317
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,140
I can guarantee that those
lessons will be applicable

318
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:51,400
to your decision to automate some

319
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,013
or all of your incident response playbook.

320
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:58,810
Finally, don't focus only
on automating internal tools

321
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:00,780
as part of a response,

322
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:03,350
you should actively
look into external tools

323
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:06,840
and external data to
help your SOC diagnose

324
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,547
what's happening within your environment.

325
00:15:09,547 --> 00:15:13,490
Including a threat
intelligence platform, or TIP,

326
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:16,593
as part of your tooling
isn't optional anymore.

327
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:20,630
Whether that threat intel
arrives from the outside

328
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:22,580
or if it's internally generated,

329
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:25,210
having a TIP intertwined
with this automation

330
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:28,520
and orchestration question is essential.

331
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,480
In a perfect world, your source solution

332
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,540
will natively contain a
threat intelligence platform.

333
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:37,500
That's how tightly these two
features should be designed

334
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,543
and delivered.

335
00:15:40,855 --> 00:15:43,570
Orchestrating and automating
your incident response

336
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:47,320
are solid foundations to
being the best SOC you can be,

337
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,610
but your extra credit
goal is to figure out

338
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:52,080
how you can win more information

339
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,820
out of the data you've already collected

340
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,790
throughout your environment.

341
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:59,339
Data about your devices,
your users, your network

342
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:00,640
and everything in between.

343
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:05,350
We humans, and specifically
our human brains,

344
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:07,810
are pretty remarkable
pattern-seeking machines

345
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:10,270
that are always on the
hunt to connect the dots

346
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,720
in any complex picture.

347
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,570
We are wired to create
meaning out of chaos.

348
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:20,943
Sometimes A really is connected
to B, sometimes it is not.

349
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:25,180
But if there's one truism
where I think we can all agree,

350
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:28,150
even your biggest brained
analyst will crumble

351
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:30,400
under trying to make
sense of tens of thousands

352
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,510
of incoming events per second

353
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:35,430
on top of the gigabytes and
gigabytes of network traffic

354
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:38,122
you may be ingesting at
any given point in time.

355
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,963
There's just too much data
and not enough information.

356
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:48,190
Why not make it easier
to see new information?

357
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:50,120
How can you make it easy
for your extended team

358
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,025
to see the outliers,

359
00:16:51,025 --> 00:16:53,920
which may represent a
higher than probable issue

360
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,593
that could grow into an incident?

361
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:58,000
Some organizations hear this

362
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,150
and start thinking about big data,

363
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:02,110
and the staffing and expertise required

364
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:04,963
to fully exploit these
expensive skillsets.

365
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:07,480
The good news is,

366
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,823
you don't need a data
scientist on your team,

367
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,170
you just need the right
tooling to help both identify

368
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:15,410
and contextualize what you are seeing

369
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:17,288
amongst the avalanche of data

370
00:17:17,288 --> 00:17:20,770
your infrastructure naturally
creates every minute

371
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:22,782
of every hour of every day.

372
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:25,470
Too many organizations

373
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:28,339
don't put all those
puzzle pieces together,

374
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:30,520
they're simply overwhelmed
with the existing noise

375
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,320
and activity within the environment.

376
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:36,420
I once had a conversation
with a multinational bank

377
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:39,000
who admitted they had
flat out stopped listening

378
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,580
to a portion of their network,

379
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,582
stopped actively monitoring it

380
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:46,123
as they just could not cut
through the data flood.

381
00:17:47,836 --> 00:17:50,280
Under the power of analytics,

382
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,460
just like SIEM is table
stakes for the SOC,

383
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,430
teasing information out of that noise

384
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:58,330
through correlating different
data points with one another

385
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:02,223
is the place to start,
but not a place to stop.

386
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:05,680
Today's strongest threat
analytics solutions

387
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,197
leverage machine learning
to automatically monitor

388
00:18:08,197 --> 00:18:12,030
and alert on potentially
dangerous behaviors of users

389
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:13,443
as well as devices.

390
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,710
A good analytics solution,

391
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:18,410
especially in the context
of threat detection,

392
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:21,020
needs to be up to date with data models.

393
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,710
These models are at the very heart

394
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:24,423
of any machine learning solution.

395
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:27,040
Traditional on-premise solutions

396
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:30,680
must wait for model updates
to be released by vendors,

397
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,560
and may then be further
delayed through change control

398
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,322
and other IT procedures
at the customer side.

399
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:39,700
That's why you should look
first for this capability

400
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:43,963
delivered as a cloud-based
software as a service or SaaS.

401
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,740
It won't surprise you to learn

402
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,513
that analytics solutions
are very data hungry.

403
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:53,650
A traditional on-premise
analytics implementation

404
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:57,240
might require you to purchase
capacity years in advance,

405
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,570
much of which may not
be needed anytime soon.

406
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:03,679
SaaS-based analytics gives
you tremendous flexibility

407
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,980
to add new capacity only when it's needed,

408
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,450
and with no local installation needed,

409
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:11,780
no rack space for the new storage,

410
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,530
no concerns about powering up

411
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:16,203
yet another piece of
equipment in the data center.

412
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:19,950
We've spent a lot of time

413
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:23,300
talking about technology and
tooling, but of course you know

414
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,860
that your most important
ingredients in the SOC

415
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,090
are your people.

416
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:29,699
And sometimes we forget that human beings

417
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:34,520
are not widgets to be snapped
into an unflexible process.

418
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,433
We don't wanna strip the gears, right?

419
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:40,010
Beyond everything else
we've covered today,

420
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:42,300
what can you do to relieve the friction

421
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:45,070
that can drive away your best SOC analysts

422
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,123
and threat hunters?

423
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,590
One way to make those
tough jobs in the SOC

424
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:50,730
a little stickier

425
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:54,320
in an effort to keep your
A-players around and engaged,

426
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,383
it's to set up job rotations
for your key personnel.

427
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,929
You know, that level one analyst

428
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:02,070
who's only been on board for six months,

429
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:05,330
but you've already figured
out that she is a rockstar,

430
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:08,370
someone you cannot afford to lose.

431
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:10,090
You don't want to just tell her

432
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:13,260
about her potential career
path at you're organization,

433
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:17,040
you can show her by taking
her out of her triage seat

434
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:17,909
every now and then

435
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:20,340
to shadow a level two
or level three analyst

436
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,669
elsewhere in the SOC,

437
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:25,363
maybe a half day, every
other week for example.

438
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,710
Let her see what that next step looks like

439
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:31,233
and experience that
next level career step.

440
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:34,740
Job rotations aren't just a benefit

441
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:38,190
to that frontline SOC
analyst, in my example,

442
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:40,260
that level two or level three analyst

443
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:44,150
is not someone you assigned
this shadowing project randomly,

444
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:48,640
he may also be just as
much a rockstar as she is.

445
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,660
Perhaps you publicly
designate him as a mentor

446
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:54,800
or a champion within your organization,

447
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,580
recognition that doesn't cost money

448
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:59,122
or require a formal title change.

449
00:20:59,123 --> 00:21:02,910
It's a role that makes him or
her stand out from their peers

450
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:03,743
in a good way.

451
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:07,370
In my own organization,
we leverage mentorships

452
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:10,679
to dry run potential
future people managers

453
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:14,670
as the skillsets between
mentors and managers overlap

454
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:16,313
in several important areas.

455
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:21,500
Now you may be an organization
that isn't large enough yet

456
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:25,293
to have two or three levels
of analysts within your SOC.

457
00:21:25,293 --> 00:21:28,060
You may have outsourced
some or all this function

458
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:32,790
to an MSSP, a managed
security services provider,

459
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:34,180
that's great.

460
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,980
And it's not a model reserved only

461
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:38,440
for small or medium-sized organizations,

462
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,423
even larger companies may
benefit from this model.

463
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:45,149
If I'm describing your situation here,

464
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:46,310
I strongly encourage you

465
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:48,790
to plan on comprehensive review sessions

466
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:52,950
on a regular cadence
with your MSSP provider,

467
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:54,073
maybe once a quarter.

468
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,930
You want to maximize your
investment by learning more

469
00:21:57,930 --> 00:22:01,540
about how exactly they
protect your environment.

470
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:04,110
Think of it as a skills transfer

471
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:07,082
so that you gain more and
more knowledge over time.

472
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:11,840
Good MSSPs won't be
threatened by this possibility

473
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,300
that you may leave them at
some point in the future

474
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,669
once you can do everything yourself.

475
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:18,710
The good ones will be more than happy

476
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:20,763
to have this conversation with you.

477
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:26,550
Finally, one more approach to
avoid stripping those gears

478
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:29,180
is to remind your entire
employee population

479
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,890
that securing the organization

480
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:34,623
isn't just the responsibility
of your folks in the SOC.

481
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:39,889
All of your employees need
to know, need to be reminded

482
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:42,913
that they are extended
members of your security team.

483
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:46,280
Every employee is on the front line,

484
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,960
and your security awareness program

485
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,323
should take that approach.

486
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:51,670
That security awareness program

487
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:54,650
is hopefully something you
already have in place today,

488
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:57,983
something that gets revised
on at least an annual basis.

489
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:02,679
The more educated and empowered
your frontline workers are,

490
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,660
the better it is for your analysts

491
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:06,873
and threat hunters working in the SOC.

492
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:13,873
Okay, that's five ways
to not ruin your SOC.

493
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:17,340
By the way, mastery of these five areas

494
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,879
adds up to a successful XDR,

495
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:23,350
extended detection and
response capability.

496
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:25,889
Look for partners and vendors who get it

497
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:28,463
and can help you navigate all these areas.

498
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:31,903
Some next steps for you to consider:

499
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:35,800
carry out an inventory so that you know

500
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:39,253
what visibility technologies
you already have in-house,

501
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:43,230
confirm that you have
runbooks that are up to date

502
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:46,320
and easily accessible by your SOC team,

503
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,750
and start thinking about
metrics you can deploy

504
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:51,633
to help your team become
even more effective,

505
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:55,690
be thinking about upping
your game to start leveraging

506
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:58,740
that analytics capability I talked about.

507
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,794
Can you combine data
you're already collecting

508
00:24:00,794 --> 00:24:04,380
about your users and devices
to get to the right answer

509
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,603
about a potential incident more quickly?

510
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:10,790
And always be mixing up the glue

511
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:13,336
to keep your A-players on board.

512
00:24:13,336 --> 00:24:16,840
A burnout in the SOC often
happens very gradually,

513
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:20,112
monitor and act quickly
to avoid this scenario.

514
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:23,980
While my session today was recorded

515
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:26,280
just ahead of the start of the conference,

516
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,350
I will be here, plausibly live,

517
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:30,810
for the remainder of my allocated time

518
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:34,550
to take any live questions you
might wish to throw my way.

519
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:37,730
I'll do my best to clarify
anything I covered here.

520
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:39,660
I'd love to hear from you.

521
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,110
Have a great conference.

522
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:44,219
And on behalf of
NetWitness, an RSA business,

523
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:47,040
thanks again for being
here with us this year.
