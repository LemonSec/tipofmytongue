1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:02,062
- Welcome.

2
00:00:02,063 --> 00:00:03,000
Russell Eubanks here

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,210
along with my friend and
colleague Randy Marchany.

4
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:07,720
And looking forward to
covering this topic today,

5
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,270
what's new with the CIS Controls.

6
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:11,103
Who am I?

7
00:00:11,103 --> 00:00:13,404
Russell Eubanks, been
cyber for a long time,

8
00:00:13,404 --> 00:00:15,330
been privileged to lead in the past

9
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,290
the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's,

10
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:19,740
cybersecurity team and IT team,

11
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,549
been teaching with SANS for a long time

12
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,770
and also on the (indistinct)
faculty as well.

13
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:25,930
Randy.

14
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:27,100
- I'm Randy Marchany,

15
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,610
nice to meet all of you.

16
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:30,610
I'm the CISO at Virginia Tech,

17
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:33,519
I've have been in depth
position since 2010.

18
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,230
I'm also a SANS instructor.

19
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:38,290
I'm one of the original SANS instructors,

20
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:39,530
and one of the charter members

21
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:41,880
for the Center for Internet Security.

22
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,033
And so with this, we hope that
we give you some information

23
00:00:45,033 --> 00:00:46,410
that you can use.

24
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:47,392
Take it away, Russ.

25
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,400
- Alright, thanks, Randy.

26
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,510
Wanted to walk through just
a little brief overview

27
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:52,343
for those of you

28
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:54,120
that may not be as
familiar with the controls

29
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,320
before we introduce version eight to you.

30
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,170
So like it shows here,

31
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:59,470
just a reminder of what the controls are

32
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:01,250
and what they're trying to represent.

33
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,970
Really a focus is not to
just have another list

34
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:05,650
of good things to do.

35
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:07,216
Randy and I and CIS SANS,

36
00:01:07,216 --> 00:01:09,919
we all believe that we
have plenty of lists

37
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,210
of good things to do.

38
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:13,490
Instead, we want to have a prioritized set

39
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,660
of things that map to non
compliance initiatives,

40
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,479
things that when you do them,

41
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,910
you can improve and demonstrate

42
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:24,289
how well you can improve your
cybersecurity posture as well.

43
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:26,430
They've been around since 2008.

44
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:29,950
And by design, we like to update
them to make them current,

45
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:33,170
to make them relevant, and
meeting the needs of today,

46
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:35,190
as well as trying to predict the needs

47
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:38,740
that we might have in the future
from a control perspective.

48
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:41,220
Again, by design, we
update them quite a bit,

49
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,820
we focus on quick wins.

50
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,839
What are some quick
wins where we can create

51
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,760
and sustain some momentum,

52
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,910
so that we can show the
advancement to our leadership,

53
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,700
to our board, to our governance groups

54
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,020
to show that we're not just staying busy.

55
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,520
But we're focusing on a
prioritized set of actions

56
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,080
that make a big difference.

57
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,860
I love Venn diagrams,

58
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,740
one of the bottom points
that are showing there

59
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:06,410
that shows interfere with
attackers getting in,

60
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:07,243
attackers staying in,

61
00:02:07,243 --> 00:02:10,000
and attackers doing damage.

62
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,180
I love how we can focus on again,

63
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,320
not just staying busy,

64
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,890
but focusing on actionable
real, measurable things

65
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:18,380
that we can tie metrics to.

66
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:21,269
And we'll have metrics for
each one of these areas

67
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:23,360
to be able to demonstrate where you are,

68
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,190
and where you want to
be in your cyber journey

69
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:30,410
at understanding the
implementation of these controls.

70
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:32,230
Why bother using these controls?

71
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:34,149
Again, a key focus here is,

72
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:37,550
looking at the ability to
measure how well we're doing

73
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:38,980
at applying these controls

74
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:41,399
and using that to show the improvement

75
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,380
of our respective cybersecurity programs.

76
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,000
Reminds me like when I go to the doctor,

77
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,100
every year ago, the
doctor, I get a physical,

78
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,130
they do lab work,

79
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:50,590
they take my blood pressure,

80
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:51,960
they do all the things they do.

81
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,170
And then I have a
conversation with my provider

82
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:56,160
and my provider,

83
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,549
based on what I'm sharing,
the concerns that I have,

84
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:59,980
they gives me a tailored plan

85
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,670
that brings in all that information.

86
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:05,420
And it gives me an idea of
things that I should work on,

87
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:07,109
maybe I should exercise more,

88
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:09,920
maybe I should eat less
desserts at the end of the day,

89
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,100
whatever the advice might be,

90
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,835
I can take that and apply that

91
00:03:12,836 --> 00:03:15,440
so that when I come back again next year,

92
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,930
I get a good report.

93
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,760
Very same thing that we want to do

94
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,149
with the controls as well.

95
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:22,810
To have measures and
metrics that we can use

96
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:25,070
to demonstrate our improvement,

97
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:27,527
to demonstrate our journey
of trying to be better,

98
00:03:27,527 --> 00:03:32,440
responding faster to events
and incidents when they happen.

99
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,600
And again, measures and
metrics for every single action

100
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,859
that we want to take.

101
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,770
Why do we want you to do that?

102
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:41,250
Well, Randy and I, we want
you to look good to your boss,

103
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:44,540
we want you to stand out and
be that rock star that shows

104
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,400
where you're at and have a clear path

105
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,660
of knowing what to do next,

106
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,930
to show how you can do that.

107
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:54,177
And then trying to remove
some ambiguous language,

108
00:03:54,177 --> 00:03:55,940
sometimes looking at the wording

109
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:58,570
when the team worked on this
upgrade to version eight,

110
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,440
wanted to have some enhancements,

111
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,970
some improvements to
help make it more clear

112
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:05,390
of the actions that we want you to take.

113
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:08,109
And even better making it so those actions

114
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:10,470
can be repeatable as well

115
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,973
so that you can do them
over and over again.

116
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,720
Another area really
focuses around alignment.

117
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,360
Alignment that we have here

118
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,825
to all the other compliance frameworks,

119
00:04:21,825 --> 00:04:23,590
to the best of our knowledge

120
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:27,150
that we have alignment of every
single compliance initiative

121
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:29,620
that we know that exists in the world

122
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:32,860
to map to the critical security controls.

123
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,010
Why do we do that?

124
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:35,950
We want to make sure
that it's gonna be easy

125
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:38,479
for you to do a transition or translation

126
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:42,470
even for doing a particular
action and the controls

127
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:44,240
and getting that double win

128
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,010
where you can take the
action against the controls

129
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:50,039
and then also gain your
compliance requirements,

130
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,290
your regulation requirements
that are in place.

131
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:56,350
It's gonna make your
auditors happy by design.

132
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:59,610
Again, the goal isn't to just
get a pretty green checkbox.

133
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:01,570
That's good, to get your
pretty green check boxes,

134
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:03,680
we want you to have your
pretty green check boxes.

135
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,240
But the goal is to look beyond that,

136
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,900
the goal is instead,

137
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,909
to get to that level
of security assurance,

138
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:14,440
how can you know that
you know that you know,

139
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,400
the status of your cybersecurity program.

140
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,140
And that's really a
big focus that we have.

141
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,740
And that with the controls,

142
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:24,960
a big concept that came with the controls

143
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,870
comes to, we have
offense informed defense,

144
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,100
how can the red team
informed the blue team?

145
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:33,190
How can the attackers
inform the defenders,

146
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:37,610
as we're wanting to put
these controls together.

147
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:40,240
The best advice I've ever
been given in my whole life

148
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,550
came to me from someone,

149
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,160
it has nothing to do with security,

150
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,350
nothing to do with cyber,

151
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:46,070
nothing to do with IT.

152
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:48,193
And the advice is this.

153
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,390
That advice is,

154
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:53,969
get wisdom as cheaply as you can.

155
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:56,190
Get wisdom as cheaply as you can.

156
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,490
What does that look like in cybersecurity?

157
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:00,860
Well, in cybersecurity,
we're looking at that to say,

158
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,910
how can we learn from the offense?

159
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:05,270
How can we learn from
recent breach case studies?

160
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:07,599
Or how can we learn from
things that are happening

161
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,750
in the cyber ecosystem,

162
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:13,480
and take that and get
wisdom as cheaply as we can,

163
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,540
learn our lessons from others

164
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,490
versus having to repeat the mistakes

165
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:20,078
and repeat the concerns that are happening

166
00:06:20,078 --> 00:06:23,239
in different organizations as well.

167
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,510
And that's the key design function

168
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,253
of version eight of the controls.

169
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:31,760
Next thing I wanted to share is looking at

170
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,539
a practical implementation steps

171
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:34,860
that you might be able to use

172
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,850
when applying or when choosing to apply

173
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:40,080
version eight of the controls.

174
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,820
And through a five step journey.

175
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:45,050
One key area is look for
the frameworks that fit,

176
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:47,080
maybe those decisions
have been made for you

177
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,300
based on the industry or the regulations

178
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,340
that your organization gets to follow

179
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:54,239
by looking at different
control frameworks,

180
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,410
risk frameworks, and
program frameworks as well.

181
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:00,410
Then we invite you to have that mapping

182
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:02,830
of the controls of those frameworks

183
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,190
to the controls themselves.

184
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,010
And you'll see a little
excerpt that shows here

185
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:08,520
of where we're doing a mapping

186
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,810
of the NIST cybersecurity framework,

187
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:13,600
identify, protect,
detect, respond, recover,

188
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,540
those categories that are underneath

189
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,780
each of those five sections,

190
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,530
and then a mapping too,

191
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:20,659
when you do those particular actions

192
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,950
that particular controls

193
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:24,019
that you get credit for doing there.

194
00:07:24,019 --> 00:07:27,790
Then manage and assess the risks,

195
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:28,710
the risk assessments,

196
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:29,909
occasionally looking back

197
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:31,880
and making sure that you're
not just staying busy,

198
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,159
but working on things
that are representative

199
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,280
of the highest risks to you

200
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,429
and your respective organization.

201
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,520
And then for me, I love this,

202
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,460
I call this the money slide.

203
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,650
This idea of my current state,

204
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:44,719
my current state assessment

205
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,610
that's shown in the dark colors here,

206
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:49,160
aligned to the NIST
cybersecurity framework,

207
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,640
and then also having this alignment

208
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,812
towards a maturity capabilities.

209
00:07:52,812 --> 00:07:54,860
And then casting vision for

210
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,650
what would it look like in the future

211
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:58,960
if we improve by taking certain actions

212
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,030
to improve our capabilities

213
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:03,729
at measuring at the
cybersecurity framework

214
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:05,700
to improve that on purpose,

215
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,637
intentionally, and by design.

216
00:08:08,637 --> 00:08:10,760
And again, when we do that we can measure,

217
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,480
we can monitor with metrics,

218
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:16,080
and give many example measures and metrics

219
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,120
with respect to that controls.

220
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,850
So again, an overview of
what to expect from this

221
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:22,570
and wanted to really set
the stage and level set,

222
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:24,070
as Randy is about to start now

223
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:27,050
and give us a review of
what actually changed

224
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:29,530
with version eight of the controls.

225
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:31,150
Randy, oh, you.

226
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:32,039
- Thanks a lot, Russell.

227
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,949
So basically, you know,

228
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:37,210
we've been at version 7.1 of the controls

229
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:38,409
for a number of years now.

230
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:40,299
And what we're gonna talk about here

231
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:43,209
is what we've seen with
the new version eight,

232
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:45,020
And so you know what's new?

233
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:48,620
So let's take a look and see
what's new here with that.

234
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:49,870
So for the first time,

235
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,030
those of you that are familiar

236
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,400
with the 20 critical controls,

237
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,630
the first thing you'll notice is,

238
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:58,114
we don't have 20 anymore,
we have 18 of them.

239
00:08:58,114 --> 00:09:01,910
What we've done is we've retired
one or two of the controls,

240
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:04,040
combined a couple of other controls,

241
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:08,550
and added one extra control
to deal with cloud computing.

242
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:10,770
We're gonna take a look
at that in just a minute.

243
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:13,280
But basically, what we did was we again,

244
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,699
this is a reflection of how
the technology has changed

245
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:19,100
from when the controls first came out.

246
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,520
So let's see what we've
got in our next slide here.

247
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,670
This is basically a list
of all of the controls.

248
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:28,610
If you read it across those of you again,

249
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,070
who are familiar with the controls,

250
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,330
some of these will look
very familiar to you.

251
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:34,620
Controls number one and two,

252
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,350
inventory of your hardware,

253
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:38,750
inventory of your software assets.

254
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:41,140
The big change for us in this one was

255
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:44,510
we moved data protection
to control number three,

256
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:47,330
and I'll talk a little bit
about that in just a minute.

257
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:51,190
We have our good buddy that
used to be control five

258
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,703
now, secure configuration of enterprise

259
00:09:53,703 --> 00:09:56,030
assets and software.

260
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:57,880
We've got account management,

261
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,980
we have control six,
access Control management.

262
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,700
Number seven is a tried and trued one

263
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,693
of doing continuous vulnerability,

264
00:10:06,693 --> 00:10:09,130
management and assessment.

265
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:12,710
If you don't do vulnerability
scans against your assets,

266
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:15,500
you know for sure the attackers will.

267
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,640
Audit log management is
now control number eight,

268
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,520
email and web browser protection
is control number nine,

269
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,150
malware defenses, 10,

270
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,656
data recovery, 11,

271
00:10:25,656 --> 00:10:28,718
network infrastructure is a combination

272
00:10:28,718 --> 00:10:32,870
of the old boundary defense controls

273
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:36,490
with the secure configuration
for network devices.

274
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:39,160
And then we have network
monitoring and defense,

275
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:42,790
which is another combination
of previous controls.

276
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:46,041
14, security awareness
and skills training,

277
00:10:46,042 --> 00:10:47,510
new title for it,

278
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:50,470
but basically deals with
technical awareness,

279
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:53,126
technical and user awareness training.

280
00:10:53,126 --> 00:10:57,630
You know, if you don't have
good well trained end users

281
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:59,090
as well as technical staff,

282
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:02,340
that is quite a danger
to your organization.

283
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,610
One of the new ones is control 15,

284
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:06,420
service provider management.

285
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:09,040
This has more to deal with
the cloud infrastructure

286
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,120
that we're seeing and
being implemented today

287
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,940
in today's technology.

288
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:16,880
Application software security, number 16,

289
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,250
incident response, and
pentesting number 18.

290
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:23,479
These are controls that
should be familiar to you

291
00:11:23,479 --> 00:11:27,200
from the previous version 7.1.

292
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,693
So let's see what we got next.

293
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:35,540
Again, we've added this
control for cloud services.

294
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:38,969
CIS has developed what
we call companion guides

295
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:41,050
to the critical security controls.

296
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:43,170
And these companion guides are great,

297
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:46,270
they show you how each of
the individual controls

298
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:48,050
map to certain things.

299
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:51,099
A new one here is the
cloud companion guide.

300
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,223
But there's ones on mobile devices,

301
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,810
there's one on measurement,

302
00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:00,880
how to measure your
progress through controls.

303
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,990
So we've added,

304
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:04,220
this is one of the new
things that's changed.

305
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,930
In addition to what we see here,

306
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:08,969
we have a couple of other things.

307
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:11,030
We've rearranged the controls,

308
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:14,110
the first three controls
into what we call inventory.

309
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:16,530
We started off, as always with you know,

310
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:18,740
you have to know what your hardware is,

311
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,750
where is it?

312
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:20,780
What is it?

313
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,970
How long has it been in your network?

314
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:26,440
Same thing for software
inventory, control number two.

315
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,010
The big change that we did was,

316
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:30,490
we elevated data protection

317
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:34,260
and data discovery and data inventory,

318
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:39,116
all of this into this
third inventory class.

319
00:12:39,116 --> 00:12:41,177
You know, as I always used to say,

320
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:46,170
a lot of states don't have
device breach notification laws,

321
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:49,110
they have data breach notification laws.

322
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:51,840
And so that's why we elevated data

323
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,010
and sensitive data in particular,

324
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:55,730
as more and more states develop

325
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:57,560
data breach notification laws.

326
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,750
And we start having privacy laws,

327
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,700
especially those in Europe,

328
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:04,310
and regulations that
are starting to affect

329
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:06,430
how we handle sensitive data.

330
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:09,439
So this is one of the big
changes that we've made

331
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,450
here in the controls, okay.

332
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:12,854
So in our next slide,

333
00:13:12,854 --> 00:13:15,550
we've got some supplemental
guides and tools.

334
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:17,012
Also in there.

335
00:13:17,013 --> 00:13:19,311
There's all sorts of mappings,

336
00:13:19,311 --> 00:13:22,033
a number of scripts, and sites,

337
00:13:22,033 --> 00:13:25,420
auditscripts.com is one great resource

338
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,819
for getting a mappings framework

339
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,660
that shows how each of the controls

340
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:32,905
maps to a wide variety of standards,

341
00:13:32,905 --> 00:13:35,100
not only US standards,

342
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,683
but international standards, Singapore,

343
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:40,117
Saudi Arabia,

344
00:13:40,117 --> 00:13:41,579
Canada,

345
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:44,130
are some of the international countries

346
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:47,870
that are whose standards
we can map to our control.

347
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:51,560
And so there's lots of
these types of tools

348
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:55,420
and guides out there for
you to reference as well.

349
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,990
In addition to what you
see here in this slide,

350
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:02,940
we have some again, as I talked about,

351
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,830
all this national legislation stuff.

352
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:07,780
When someone says, when an auditor says,

353
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,459
you know, what's your
security strategy based on?

354
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:15,213
Well, ours is based on
ISO 2702, and NIST 800-53.

355
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:19,939
And so we can look at these frameworks

356
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:22,150
and these guides here
that was talking about

357
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:25,730
and show how each control
maps to certain subsections

358
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:29,494
of those standards and
frameworks that we're using.

359
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:31,653
So in our next one here,

360
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:36,689
you know, we have what we
call implementation groups,

361
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:39,720
these are tailored for small
and medium enterprises.

362
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,844
You know, implementation group three

363
00:14:42,844 --> 00:14:46,514
is a large organization that's
got a relatively mature,

364
00:14:46,514 --> 00:14:49,270
you know, security infrastructure,

365
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:52,530
in terms of staff, audit
staff and things like that.

366
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:57,530
Implementation group two, IG2
that we call it for short,

367
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,770
it's sort of a medium size organization

368
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:04,780
that has some moderate resources

369
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:07,240
in terms of personnel and skill level,

370
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,340
and for dealing with, you know,

371
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,800
to implement the sub controls

372
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,420
in each of these critical controls.

373
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:15,969
And then you have
implementation group one.

374
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:19,790
These are smaller organizations
with limited resources,

375
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:22,849
there may only be four or five, six people

376
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:23,950
doing IT work,

377
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:26,380
and everybody's got to
wear a different hat.

378
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:29,610
So we have these implementation groupings

379
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:31,950
set up to help you, you know,

380
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:35,074
decide where your
organization fits in, okay?

381
00:15:35,074 --> 00:15:38,109
So in our next slide here,

382
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:39,780
then we also have,

383
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:42,339
you know, there's lots of pointers

384
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:46,280
to white papers and other
materials that people have written

385
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,750
that show how they implement the controls.

386
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:49,900
A number of talks,

387
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,770
Russell and I have done numerous talks

388
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:54,050
on various implementation schemes

389
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:56,400
for the critical security controls,

390
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,310
both in the SANS classes we teach,

391
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:02,930
and in, you know, normal
presentations like this one.

392
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:05,699
And we also want to make sure that

393
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,160
everybody understands
that there are resources

394
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,610
to help you show the alignment

395
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:12,900
between the critical security controls,

396
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,631
and the NIST cybersecurity framework.

397
00:16:15,631 --> 00:16:17,339
So with that,

398
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:19,110
I'm gonna turn it over to Russell,

399
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:19,973
to take it away.

400
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:23,060
- You got it, thank you,
Randy, for sharing that again.

401
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,280
Talking about the highlight.

402
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,449
So what's changed,

403
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:27,950
what's stayed the same
to help us wrap our minds

404
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:31,730
around the change from
version 7.1 to version 8.0.

405
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:34,440
And certainly encourage any
questions that you have,

406
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,370
build up those questions,

407
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:36,740
go ahead and send them our way,

408
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:39,740
we'd be happy to answer those questions.

409
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,630
But one thing that's really
important to Ran and I,

410
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:44,080
is we're wanting to
communicate the differences

411
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,200
and partnering with friends at CIS

412
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,780
to help you understand what's changed,

413
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:51,000
and why it was necessary
to change it this time

414
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,236
and really launching this version,

415
00:16:53,236 --> 00:16:56,200
in alignment with the RSA conference.

416
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,180
We wanted to not just talk about that,

417
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,069
but give you some practical guidance,

418
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:02,210
give you some ideas from best practices

419
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:05,170
that we've experienced, or
ways to implement the controls

420
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:06,520
both at Randy's organization,

421
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,000
at organizations I've
been privileged to work at

422
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,970
in the past,

423
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:13,900
for companies that want to
lean in and take action.

424
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:17,030
A couple of ideas that we wanted
to share with you here one,

425
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:19,520
give yourself a little grace to say okay,

426
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,720
lemme take time to digest this.

427
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,297
Lemme take time to understand this.

428
00:17:23,297 --> 00:17:27,010
And then for you to determine
when's the right time?

429
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:28,190
Work with some clients.

430
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:29,940
Some of them are eager to get to

431
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,190
and habit assessments
against version eight,

432
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:34,110
while others prefer to wait a little bit

433
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:36,080
and just do a wait and see approach to see

434
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,490
when does it make most sense for them.

435
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:39,870
And so your approach will vary,

436
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:43,159
but spend some time to digest
the materials that we have,

437
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,980
and information that will share links for,

438
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,870
coming up at the end of the presentation.

439
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:49,689
So you can go to the CIS
website and get there,

440
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:51,780
and make that decision for yourself.

441
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,120
Give yourself a little bit of a grace,

442
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,010
but not too much,

443
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:56,470
to understand that but
then have actionable steps

444
00:17:56,470 --> 00:18:00,430
to determine when's the right
time for you to do that.

445
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:03,503
Focus on two to three controls at a time,

446
00:18:03,503 --> 00:18:06,040
you didn't get where you are overnight,

447
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,250
you're not gonna get where
you want to be overnight.

448
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,880
And so being able to understand

449
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,980
what is the most important
areas for you to focus on

450
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:15,920
in your journey at
applying these controls.

451
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,920
Three to five, six year project,

452
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,460
sometimes if you start from
not having done this before,

453
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:24,830
and you want to move in
the direction of applying

454
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:27,470
these controls and building the momentum.

455
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:29,720
Again, you have the opportunity to create

456
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,500
and sustain some momentum
by having projects,

457
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,930
maybe project managers,

458
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:34,850
maybe funding,

459
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:37,560
maybe support for these initiatives.

460
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,659
But make sure that you don't try

461
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:41,222
to solve all this overnight,

462
00:18:41,222 --> 00:18:43,100
even over a year or two.

463
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:46,591
But instead, create and
sustain some momentum,

464
00:18:46,591 --> 00:18:49,120
brag to your boss, show off to your boss,

465
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,070
your leadership, your
governance, your board

466
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:52,370
to show where you're headed

467
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:55,080
and how heading this
way makes a lot of sense

468
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,870
for your respective organizations.

469
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:59,500
And I just recognize you
need to go do it again,

470
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,350
do it again, remind your leadership,

471
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:03,490
remind those that you're
privileged to lead,

472
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:06,030
where you're at and where you're headed,

473
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:09,250
and how some of the anchor
points that we gave earlier,

474
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:13,333
can help you communicate that
status much more clearly.

475
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,930
More practical implementation tips here.

476
00:19:16,931 --> 00:19:19,120
One thing that super important as well

477
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,439
is to find a champion,

478
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,650
find someone maybe on your executive

479
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:25,490
or your leadership team
who can represent you.

480
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:28,260
Equip them with information so
that when they go to meetings

481
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,530
that you don't get to go to

482
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:30,860
or they have conversations

483
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,530
that you don't get to be a part of.

484
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:34,720
They're armed and equipped
to be able to talk about

485
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,120
at a high level,

486
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,030
why you're focusing on the controls,

487
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:40,940
why you chosen to go ahead and assume

488
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:43,280
the usage of version eight of the controls

489
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,870
and how it helps your business

490
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:48,570
by aligning to mission, vision,
values of your organization

491
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:53,210
and truly help protect your
organization like never before.

492
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:55,910
A key tool and very happy,
Randy mentioned this before.

493
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:57,830
Here's a link directly to it.

494
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:00,389
Privileged to work with
James and Kelly and others

495
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:03,150
at AuditScripts and Enclave Security.

496
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:06,460
And we're so happy to be able
to give you this capability

497
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,020
to do a gap analysis to say,

498
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:09,210
where are you right now

499
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:11,780
with respect to version
eight of the controls.

500
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,975
And where are some
areas that where there's

501
00:20:13,975 --> 00:20:16,040
not a weakness or a gap,

502
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,730
well just let's just say opportunities.

503
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:19,670
The optimist in me comes out and says

504
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:22,260
opportunities to improve on purpose

505
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,290
so that we can by design,

506
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:27,030
make our programs more repeatable,

507
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:28,430
more automation,

508
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:31,620
perhaps even leveraging
tools that you already have

509
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,939
to be able to unlock capabilities

510
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,260
that may be sitting there dormant

511
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:38,150
that you can leverage
for your organization.

512
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:38,983
That's what I did,

513
00:20:38,983 --> 00:20:40,770
when I first got
introduced to the controls

514
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:43,840
I heard about success
by major organizations

515
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,980
in the United States
who apply the controls.

516
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,230
I was excited,

517
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:49,360
I was motivated.

518
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,753
I was the security team,

519
00:20:50,753 --> 00:20:53,080
I was the whole team,
there was nobody but me.

520
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,429
And I didn't have any
budget to buy any more tools

521
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:57,924
and started reading the fine manual,

522
00:20:57,924 --> 00:21:01,590
looking for how can I
creatively solve this problem

523
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:04,159
that are outlined in that
version of the controls.

524
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,630
And it was amazing how that unlocked

525
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:09,710
the desire to find more,
to have automation.

526
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:12,760
And to really get a lot
of those capabilities,

527
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,550
even though I was the team,

528
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:17,172
even though I wasn't able to
get any additional funding,

529
00:21:17,172 --> 00:21:20,220
you may just find that
there's ways to leverage

530
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,280
some of these capabilities

531
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,610
to move in the direction
where large organizations

532
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:27,520
sometimes struggle to achieve.

533
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,153
The classic model of
what's my current state?

534
00:21:30,153 --> 00:21:32,256
How do we understand that?

535
00:21:32,256 --> 00:21:33,810
Accept that

536
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:35,149
and then have this desire,

537
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:37,340
especially for you as
a cyber security leader

538
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:38,689
to cast a vision for

539
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:40,680
what would a better future look like?

540
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,250
What would it look like
if we improved on purpose

541
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:45,730
and by design and these tools,

542
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:49,100
like we have here with the
AuditScripts, free resources

543
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:52,110
here can help you to do just that.

544
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,649
And then another thing is,

545
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:54,943
who can help you?

546
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:58,410
Who are some colleagues
in your organization

547
00:21:58,410 --> 00:21:59,980
that can help you?

548
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,570
Could it be the helpdesk?

549
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,240
Could it be your CIS admins,

550
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,950
application development teams,

551
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:06,410
application owners,

552
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:07,940
security awareness officers,

553
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:10,010
there's a role to play for that as well,

554
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:11,430
Incident Response Team,

555
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:15,670
how can you engage in equip
them to help in this journey

556
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:17,980
to improve your organization again,

557
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:20,710
by intention, by design,

558
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:24,490
so that you can go further and go faster,

559
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:27,510
get a lot of things where you
can practically implement this

560
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:30,133
and put together a plan to do just that.

561
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:34,800
Turns out, you've got some
of the answers already.

562
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,730
We've equipped you with
what we talked about today,

563
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,830
as well as in addition to

564
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:41,179
some of the things that we've
outlined in our presentation.

565
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:43,233
So far, you can see some of these changes,

566
00:22:43,233 --> 00:22:44,960
you know, fundamental areas,

567
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,920
control one, control two, control three,

568
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:52,000
center around this concept
of having a good inventory.

569
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,870
How can we understand that inventory

570
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:56,030
of our devices and our software.

571
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:58,700
And again, a new ad is promoting

572
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:03,503
this area of having an
inventory of our sensitive data.

573
00:23:03,503 --> 00:23:06,629
This idea of when we
have those capabilities,

574
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:08,950
and we start with one and two and three,

575
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:10,990
on purpose and by design,

576
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:14,600
then future controls that
we work on are easier.

577
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,240
We can literally take the output

578
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,380
for control one, our hardware,

579
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:20,750
and use that as input for future control.

580
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:24,310
So it's easier to do things
such as malware defenses,

581
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:26,129
or secure configurations

582
00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:28,410
for our workstations and our servers.

583
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:30,490
Because we know exactly the scope

584
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:31,830
to we're going to apply that.

585
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:34,199
You can see that
practical guidance of how,

586
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,730
the reasons that we have start here.

587
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:38,590
And then when you have that capability,

588
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:42,889
then you can move forward
to future controls.

589
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:45,960
And it'll be easier to do that
when you follow the process

590
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,230
that we've outlined in the controls.

591
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:50,940
Again, good inventory can
make the later controls

592
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:53,093
be so much easier.

593
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:57,740
All right, Randy, back to you.

594
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,190
- So one of the things is,

595
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:01,250
once you find out what you have,

596
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:04,420
then you wanna make sure
that you've got a process

597
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,501
to make them more secure,

598
00:24:06,501 --> 00:24:09,620
from both internal unauthorized access

599
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:12,010
and external unauthorized access.

600
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:14,780
Typically, we call these
minimum security standards,

601
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:16,840
I always like to say you must be this tall

602
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,186
to play in our network,

603
00:24:18,186 --> 00:24:20,240
where you know, basically,

604
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,760
you wanna have all the devices

605
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,060
that connect to your network

606
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:26,357
to be at a certain level
of security settings,

607
00:24:26,357 --> 00:24:28,452
and configuration.

608
00:24:28,452 --> 00:24:32,600
Old names like gold disk stick things,

609
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,439
these are all some of the older
terminology that was used.

610
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,621
But the idea here is that you wanna have,

611
00:24:38,621 --> 00:24:41,750
regardless of the type of
hardware that's out there,

612
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:44,240
you wanna have a good policy structure.

613
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,940
And you wanna have good standards

614
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:48,650
that give you the details

615
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:51,220
of what the high level
policies talk about.

616
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:53,240
It's really critical that you do get your

617
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,240
upper management involved in this

618
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,929
because at the policy level,

619
00:24:56,929 --> 00:24:58,900
as Russell talked about,

620
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,982
there's gonna be a lot
of politicking going on,

621
00:25:00,982 --> 00:25:03,649
when especially when
you're trying to find out

622
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:06,420
who has the information that you need.

623
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:07,890
A lot of this, as you mentioned,

624
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:10,540
is already in your organization.

625
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:13,480
The challenge for you
and both Russell and I,

626
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:16,200
we're in the middle of
implementing the controls

627
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,500
at our respective organizations.

628
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,220
The big challenge, of course, is

629
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,870
finding out who's got the data

630
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:23,729
and then getting it from them.

631
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,920
And making sure that you don't run into

632
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,220
any bureaucratic resistance there.

633
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:31,570
That's one of the key things
that you wind up doing.

634
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:33,659
I was lucky in the sense that I had a hand

635
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:36,360
in the development of
policies and standards.

636
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:39,479
So when we were going
through that vetting process,

637
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,700
we kinda knew who had you know,

638
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,540
the types of data that we need,

639
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,860
but at the same time,

640
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:47,510
you talk to one person
and he and they'll go,

641
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:49,590
Oh, you know, you need
to talk to this person,

642
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,770
because they have a better idea

643
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:55,360
of how this particular
type of data is being used.

644
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,590
You know, you go see the
bursar for your organization

645
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:00,500
for a lot of financial controls.

646
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:03,950
For us, our bursar,
very, very bright woman,

647
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:07,210
she just does, you ask her a question,

648
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:10,140
and she's got the answers
you need for stuff like that.

649
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:13,370
So finding out who has
the information you need

650
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:16,649
is a big key in helping you
develop these standards.

651
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:18,060
Some other stuff, of course,

652
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,840
now that you've got these answers,

653
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,209
then what's the next step?

654
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:22,143
Well, let's see.

655
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:26,470
You wanna run your
vulnerability assessments

656
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:29,030
against your critical servers and assets,

657
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:33,500
you wanna do this on a
weekly basis, if you can.

658
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,480
I came from the sysadmin world,

659
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,860
you know, being one for 25 years.

660
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,139
And the last thing we ever wanted

661
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,300
was somebody to run a vulnerability scan

662
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,770
against our critical servers,

663
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:44,750
because you could knock down the system,

664
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:46,760
and that could cause millions of dollars.

665
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:49,100
And my retort is that if all it takes

666
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:52,129
is a vulnerability scan to
knock down a critical server,

667
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:54,960
we have more serious
problems to worry about.

668
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,130
And then they go, oh, no, that's
not what I'm talking about,

669
00:26:57,130 --> 00:27:00,010
you know, there's all sorts
of ways to work that out.

670
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:03,200
But it is really important that you do run

671
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,010
a vulnerability assessment

672
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:07,000
and fix the problems that you find.

673
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,820
Because what's the number one thing

674
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,520
that people do in pentest,

675
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,150
they recon your systems,

676
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:13,440
they recon your networks,

677
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,000
they recon your assets,

678
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,160
and they're looking for these weaknesses.

679
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:22,000
So you might as well get a
jumpstart on that process.

680
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,410
And know what's out there.

681
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:25,158
And hopefully address and fix the problems

682
00:27:25,158 --> 00:27:27,330
that you find at a time.

683
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:28,702
Malware defense,

684
00:27:28,702 --> 00:27:32,580
a lot of you already have
malware detection tools,

685
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:35,699
they could be commercial
products, like (indistinct),

686
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,730
they could be antivirus software,

687
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:38,765
Windows Defender,

688
00:27:38,765 --> 00:27:40,920
you know, all sorts of things,

689
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,666
Wazuh, for instance, for Linux systems,

690
00:27:43,666 --> 00:27:47,639
(indistinct), you may be
using these tools already.

691
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,410
And again, you wanna
leverage what you have

692
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:54,560
in your tool kit already to
help you with malware defenses.

693
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:58,129
But to sort of emphasize what
Russell was talking about,

694
00:27:58,130 --> 00:27:59,610
your biggest challenge is gonna be

695
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:02,469
getting the data from your
business and IT units.

696
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:04,470
When I go as the CISO, and I said,

697
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:05,400
hey, how's it going?

698
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,300
Everybody kind of goes, why is he asking?

699
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,133
How's it going, right?

700
00:28:08,133 --> 00:28:08,966
What's wrong?

701
00:28:08,966 --> 00:28:10,899
I go, no, no, no, you
know, nothing's wrong.

702
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:14,200
But you know, I need
some information here.

703
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,420
And then, you know, why do
you need the information?

704
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:20,040
You know, well, I can't
give you access to say,

705
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,091
Well, I don't want
access to your databases.

706
00:28:22,092 --> 00:28:25,300
But I would like a copy of the databases.

707
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,388
And so you have to do a
little bit of that type of,

708
00:28:27,388 --> 00:28:29,520
you know, salesmanship,

709
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,480
that's what you're gonna be doing

710
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,980
when you're implementing this.

711
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,640
But that's gonna be your biggest challenge

712
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,510
is getting the data that you need,

713
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:39,350
especially for the first three controls,

714
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:40,683
the inventory controls,

715
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,743
and getting from your
business and IT units here.

716
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:48,100
So once again, if you
do have any questions,

717
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,570
please, please ask them,

718
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:52,120
we'll be glad to answer those for you.

719
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:55,860
And so, what we wanna
do here for our goal,

720
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,409
you know, apply what you've learned today,

721
00:28:57,410 --> 00:29:00,140
we've given you a landing page,

722
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:04,952
for the CIS version eight of the controls,

723
00:29:04,952 --> 00:29:08,210
you can find out more about
mappings of frameworks

724
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:10,080
from the auditscripts.comm site.

725
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,040
And along along the side of that

726
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,550
there's all sorts of other resources

727
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:16,260
that are on those pages,

728
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,610
that you can follow the trail

729
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:19,810
to get the information
you need to help out.

730
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:23,149
Russell, I think you would agree with me

731
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:25,410
when we were both say that,

732
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:28,640
you know, this is an auditable operation,

733
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:33,030
it strengthens your
overall defensive posture.

734
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:36,379
I'm a big fan of playing defense.

735
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:39,460
You know, I'm hired as the CISO

736
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:42,600
to defend my organization's assets,

737
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,840
data, hardware and software.

738
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,709
You know, we're not a pentesting company,

739
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:49,720
but my job is to defend its blue team.

740
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,930
And this gives me a good way

741
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:54,510
to map out my defensive strategy.

742
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:57,030
So again, email us with questions,

743
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:58,610
let us know what we've got

744
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:03,670
and let's see what we have
here to end our little session.

745
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:07,278
Again, my contact information is here.

746
00:30:07,278 --> 00:30:10,260
Again, email address,

747
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:12,573
the only thing I'd ask
you to do is if you say,

748
00:30:12,573 --> 00:30:16,700
you know, put down RSA
2021 in the subject line,

749
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,690
so I've got some context for you.

750
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:21,410
And Russell's contact information

751
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:24,029
is here in this slide, here.

752
00:30:24,029 --> 00:30:27,120
We wanna thank you for attending

753
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,060
and joining us in this talk.

754
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:32,030
We hope that we gave you
a good starting point.

755
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:34,433
And Russell, you got anything else to say?

756
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,990
- I just say echo what you said, Randy,

757
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:38,670
what a privilege it
was to work with a team

758
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:39,750
to help put this together

759
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:41,520
and then represented be the mouthpiece

760
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,889
here at RSA premier security
conference to launch

761
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:47,010
and outline the steps that you can do

762
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:48,330
to learn more about

763
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:50,760
and at the right time decide to implement

764
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:53,240
and apply version eight, the controls.

765
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,320
We believe it's a repeatable process.

766
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,010
It's a way that you can make it easier

767
00:30:57,010 --> 00:30:59,860
to communicate what you're
doing and why you're doing it.

768
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,580
And with so many people involved,

769
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:03,000
literally around the world doing this,

770
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,530
you've got a whole community backing you,

771
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,273
supporting you and cheering for you.

772
00:31:07,273 --> 00:31:09,219
I know that you can do it.

773
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:11,947
- Right, we'll see you later.
