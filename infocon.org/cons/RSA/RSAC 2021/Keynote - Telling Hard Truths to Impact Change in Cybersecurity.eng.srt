1
00:00:00,497 --> 00:00:01,847
(sign whooshing)

2
00:00:01,848 --> 00:00:04,848
(uplifting fanfare)

3
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:17,100
- [Announcer] Welcome to
our keynote conversation

4
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,580
for RSA Conference 2021.

5
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:21,169
Please welcome Angela Weinman,

6
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:24,200
Head of Global Governance Risk
and Compliance for VMware,

7
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,509
and Jimmy Sanders, Information
Security for Netflix.

8
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:28,600
- Hello and welcome.

9
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,030
It's great to be here with you today,

10
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:33,540
and to be joined by Jimmy
to cover some hard truths.

11
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,450
Both of us have a passion for
driving change in security,

12
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,653
and being just a little bit disruptive.

13
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:41,690
- (snickers) Just a little bit disruptive.

14
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:44,339
Oh, that's a little
understatement, Angela.

15
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,528
It is an honor to be here alongside you.

16
00:00:46,528 --> 00:00:48,177
I remember the often used quote,

17
00:00:48,177 --> 00:00:50,280
"May you live in interesting times."

18
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,170
I'm sure our colleagues
watching this can agree

19
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:54,890
that we've all experienced
dynamic revelations.

20
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:57,400
Angela and I don't presume
to have the answers,

21
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,170
but we have some ideas.

22
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:01,860
Thus, the hard truth
should not be a surprise.

23
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:04,239
We're here together in support of the idea

24
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,429
of empowering one another,
and maybe some of you.

25
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:10,160
Our shared goals are not to patronize you,

26
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,179
but to hopefully motivate
you to embrace emerging ideas

27
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,590
to make things better in cybersecurity.

28
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:18,970
Angela and I, I feel as though
we're partnering together

29
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:20,960
on this ambitious journey.

30
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,640
- Agreed, and with that in mind together,

31
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,580
we're gonna cover three
hard truths about security,

32
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:29,630
with suggestions on how to
address these more effectively,

33
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:32,420
in light of the past
year shared experience.

34
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,720
There's a lot to cover,
but our overall goal

35
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,840
is to increase security
resilience going forward.

36
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,960
Let's jump right in.

37
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,179
Jimmy, can you please take
us to the first hard truth?

38
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,100
- Yes, hard truth number one

39
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,289
is that the security risk
picture is out of focus.

40
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:49,430
This is directly linked
to greater resilience,

41
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:52,270
since if we can't
accurately determine risk,

42
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:55,259
it becomes difficult to
rapidly recover from impacts.

43
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,970
We have to acknowledge this,

44
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:59,690
considering the last year
that we've all experienced.

45
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:01,580
Angela, what are your thoughts?

46
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,320
- Well, if we don't get this one right,

47
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,419
we're initiating projects,
we're investing resources,

48
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,070
using the wrong priorities.

49
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:10,669
It's essential, that
risk drives what we do,

50
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:13,000
because security is after all,

51
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,630
one big risk management program.

52
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,890
So what's the hard truth here?

53
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:19,859
We're not managing our risks well enough.

54
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,780
This reflects directly at the
business level, of course.

55
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:25,890
In a study we just did with MIT recently,

56
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:27,820
less than half of top executives said,

57
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:30,040
they were happy with how
their resiliency risk plans

58
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,519
were executed last year.

59
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,510
- Less than half?

60
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:34,876
That's not even a passing grade.

61
00:02:34,876 --> 00:02:38,360
- (chuckles) Exactly, so
what's the observation here?

62
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,960
It's that our desire as
security professionals,

63
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,730
to be accurate can cause
us to be too conservative

64
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,910
when predicting risks, and
impacts, and necessary treatment.

65
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:49,160
Maybe we should be zooming out.

66
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,460
Trying a wide angle lens instead.

67
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:54,070
Thinking in terms of a spectrum of impact,

68
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:56,890
rather than a narrowly defined scenario.

69
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:58,510
As an example with the pandemic,

70
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:01,040
it wasn't enough to
plan for critical staff

71
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,239
working from an alternate
location, or from home

72
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,000
for a period of time.

73
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,027
- I could not agree more.

74
00:03:06,027 --> 00:03:08,100
That's the crazy thing.

75
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:11,130
Many of us focus our
plans for who is critical.

76
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:13,519
And as it turns out, last year that meant

77
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,220
everybody in your organization.

78
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,053
- Looking back,

79
00:03:17,053 --> 00:03:19,430
virtually no one anticipated
things correctly.

80
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,680
Turns out the business need

81
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:24,560
was for almost everyone to
be remote for a year or two,

82
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,940
not a few folks for a month or two.

83
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,010
If we'd look back a hundred
years to the 1918 flu,

84
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,870
and used a spectrum of impact

85
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:34,440
to help consider more of the edge cases,

86
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,510
it might have helped.

87
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:39,760
It turns out those who could
pivot fastest, last year

88
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,109
were the ones who had the broadest plans,

89
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:44,400
or who could mitigate
by being the furthest

90
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,170
along their digital
transformation journey.

91
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:50,570
- So Angela, if there is a
struggle currently today,

92
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:51,880
with the credibility that we have

93
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,010
in the way our companies view
our current risk strategy,

94
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:58,653
how can we handle presenting
broader and bolder risk views?

95
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,989
- Well, the best way is not to struggle,

96
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:04,820
to make decisions alone,
but lay it all out.

97
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,170
Present the spectrum views to your CISO,

98
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:10,209
risk committee, executives,
your audit committee,

99
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:12,860
the board, wherever you
normally do your readouts.

100
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,690
Let the business drive agreement

101
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:18,420
on where on the spectrum
predicted impact should go,

102
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,800
just as similar dialogues

103
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,510
drive risk posture decisions today.

104
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:25,159
So Jimmy, apart from the pandemic.

105
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,511
Wow, did I just say that sentence?

106
00:04:26,511 --> 00:04:27,900
It's kind of an odd one,

107
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,349
but what else did we
see over the past year

108
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:34,200
that shows us that the risk
picture is out of focus?

109
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,900
- Focus is a matter of deciding

110
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,599
what things you're not going to do.

111
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,610
And what we've seen,

112
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:40,620
is we've been protecting
our security environment

113
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,550
like pieces on a checkers board,

114
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,950
where every piece is valued the same.

115
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:47,490
We must broaden our views,
and prioritize environments,

116
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:49,220
so we ensure that not all environments

117
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,930
are protected and viewed the same.

118
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:54,270
In chess speak, we must
see the entire board.

119
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:56,870
We must ensure we build
resilience into our environments

120
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:59,400
where the taking of a symbolic pawn,

121
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,686
or even a rook doesn't
mean it's game over,

122
00:05:01,687 --> 00:05:04,340
or a total disaster for
our entire environment.

123
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,580
So let's zoom out as Angela was saying,

124
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,090
and see the entire board.

125
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:08,923
- Thanks, Jimmy.

126
00:05:08,923 --> 00:05:10,650
Great analogy.

127
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:13,070
There's so much more we could
cover on the risk front,

128
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:15,230
but let's leave this one here,

129
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:18,030
with the suggestion to
shift our risk perspective,

130
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,640
and zoom out.

131
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,820
That leads to our second takeaway.

132
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,719
We have to throw out some of
our old ways of doing things

133
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,410
because second hard truth,

134
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:30,600
legacy security practices
are slowing us down.

135
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,760
This is a big one.

136
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,870
We might ruffle some feathers here, Jimmy.

137
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:36,150
So where should we start?

138
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:37,909
- And so ruffling feathers is something

139
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:39,620
that I'm very comfortable with,

140
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:42,410
because I spend my time railing

141
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:44,700
against legacy security practices,

142
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,510
and the lack of diverse voices

143
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,719
within our security community.

144
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,340
Witnessing the rise and fall of companies,

145
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:55,409
products, and best business
practices throughout my career,

146
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:58,280
it is an imprinted, a deep
belief within my psyche.

147
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,650
That belief is that we, the collective we,

148
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:03,400
must create an environment
where the best ideas win.

149
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,270
And what happens

150
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:07,049
is this improves our
security posture overall.

151
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:08,310
These diverse thoughts stem

152
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:11,231
from allowing competing ideas
and viewpoints to be voiced

153
00:06:11,231 --> 00:06:15,420
without the fear of
ridicule and condemnation.

154
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,900
My current company, they do a great job,

155
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,650
an amazing job, at
diversity and inclusion.

156
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:23,780
We work toward the goals of
freedom and responsibility.

157
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,669
That is a great starting point.

158
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:27,050
But diversity and inclusion

159
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:29,490
is not about any one person or company.

160
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:30,860
What I am championing

161
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:33,810
are the many intelligent minority voices

162
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,580
that do not get heard within
the security community.

163
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:39,349
People, get the diversity aspect.

164
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:41,660
Diversity is about getting
various cultural groups

165
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,860
and individuals a seat at the table.

166
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,170
Inclusion is about being intentional,

167
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:49,500
and allowing every voice
at the table to be heard.

168
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,390
- I love that, Jimmy.

169
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:52,930
Inclusion is about being intentional.

170
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:55,460
Such a great perspective, thank you.

171
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,650
Allowing all voices,

172
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,770
in fact requiring all voices to be heard

173
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:00,630
is tremendously empowering.

174
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,969
It's also a great tie back
to our first hard truth

175
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:04,370
about the risk picture.

176
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:06,390
We can get better risk
management and inputs,

177
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:08,289
if we have more points of view.

178
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:10,520
- My truth is that I
realized my company and peers

179
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,539
could not be great at security

180
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:15,000
by sticking to outdated
security practices.

181
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,840
Thus, what I started to do

182
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,900
was continually reach
out to various peers,

183
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,099
and ask them questions, and
to stand on the shoulders

184
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,160
of thought leaders in our industry.

185
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,060
This pushed our team to start
doing a proof of concept,

186
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:29,040
of a tool, or a technique
on a monthly basis.

187
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,640
What transpired from that,

188
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,729
is our team developed a
resilient and nimble mindset

189
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:36,560
that does not get worried
when change happens.

190
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,550
Change is just a matter of course.

191
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:39,820
Angela, similar to me,

192
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:42,270
I know that this is an
important topic for you.

193
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:44,039
What are the other
ideas on this hard truth

194
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,860
about legacy security
practices do you have?

195
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,570
- Well, let's shake the trees a little bit

196
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:51,020
regarding security processes.

197
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:53,219
Driven by the need to be deemed mature,

198
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:56,490
we've built, and often
automated a lot of processes,

199
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:59,960
layer upon layer, almost
like a geological formation,

200
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:03,020
hard and inflexible, weighing us down.

201
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:06,469
And not only us, the business
units we work with day to day.

202
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:08,870
How many things exist, so
that we can check a box

203
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,780
with some long forgotten reason?

204
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:14,109
Is everything we're doing value
add to our security posture?

205
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:16,150
If not, why are we doing it?

206
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:19,393
Again, more support for
thought diversity here too.

207
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:22,500
- I love that idea of thought diversity,

208
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,080
because it's often the employees

209
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,580
in new positions that
provide a new perspective

210
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,609
on what might be redundant work.

211
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:30,700
They can question without
having been involved

212
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,689
in the history, or
ingrained into the thinking

213
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:35,710
of this is how we like to do it.

214
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:37,610
- Yes, new team members are great at this.

215
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:40,090
Also, someone on rotation
from another group,

216
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:42,929
or anyone frankly, who's had a long break.

217
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:45,920
There's so much opportunity
to throw things out.

218
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,219
Let's just go ahead,
get them out of there,

219
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,240
maybe replace with something better.

220
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,470
Even with compliance,
continue to question,

221
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:55,660
and throw out things that have changed.

222
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,990
Cross questions off
questionnaires, make them shorter.

223
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:01,920
Everything should be open to
be legitimately challenged,

224
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,500
and potentially thrown out.

225
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,620
- Well, but for many of those,

226
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,340
those are fighting words, Angela.

227
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,800
And so my question to you

228
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,689
is what do you think about how
we decide what to throw out?

229
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:15,180
- It's going to depend on what
we're looking at for sure.

230
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,900
But as long as we
actively map efforts back

231
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,949
to cyber hygiene fundamentals
and business goals,

232
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:23,240
and find the areas of concentration,

233
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,000
are they, what we'd expect?

234
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,900
We can validate these decisions.

235
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,090
Also, it's going to take
a bit of negotiation

236
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:31,920
with those around us, but
going to be well worth it.

237
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,670
It's not just a good
idea to throw things out.

238
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,189
It's a survival tactic,

239
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:39,030
in order to scale and to move faster.

240
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:42,470
Let's constantly challenge
the how, as well as the why,

241
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:43,570
and to be brave.

242
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:46,400
There's plenty of security
work to do, be bold.

243
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,280
Throw things out.

244
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,000
Lastly, we have to be
willing to reach out.

245
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,840
Jimmy, please bring us home

246
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,083
with the third and last
of our hard truths.

247
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:59,439
- Certainly, the last hard
truth is very relevant

248
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,600
to the past year.

249
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:05,290
The last hard truth is that
security is not a solo sport.

250
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:07,709
It's been a tough year
and let's be honest,

251
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:09,970
being able to talk to
each other has helped us,

252
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:12,190
especially me, get through it.

253
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:14,610
You may be a super security person

254
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,810
at your current technology company.

255
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:19,560
Whatever stage you are in
your current career cycle,

256
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,770
we, the security community,
we need your ideas.

257
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:23,740
We need your effort.

258
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,650
We need your collaboration.

259
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:27,840
I think of the term snowball effect,

260
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:31,190
because of all the great
ideas build upon each other.

261
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:33,290
We, the security community needs to ensure

262
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:35,016
that the best security practices

263
00:10:35,016 --> 00:10:37,790
are accessible to everyone.

264
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:40,140
Similar again to great chess players.

265
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,280
All the moves of all
the great chess players,

266
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:45,155
in the great matches were out
in the public for masters,

267
00:10:45,155 --> 00:10:47,290
and beginners like to study from.

268
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:50,750
Instead of chess terms,
I view us as heroes.

269
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,590
We are the heroes protecting
our companies and employees

270
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:56,800
from the threats that we
face on a day-to-day basis.

271
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,109
However, a single entity
can't curb the overall rise

272
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:02,780
in security breaches,
regardless of how amazing

273
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:06,060
their individual security
structure may be.

274
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:10,209
But together, us, the
security superhero group,

275
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:12,640
sharing knowledge and
effective techniques,

276
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,280
can achieve what a single company can't.

277
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:18,110
And that is, achieve
greater security resilience.

278
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:21,760
With that, I wanna pass to my
partner, and superhero Angela,

279
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,673
for her ideas.

280
00:11:23,544 --> 00:11:24,696
- (laughing) Thanks, Jimmy.

281
00:11:24,696 --> 00:11:27,470
This one is close to my heart, literally,

282
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:30,160
because relationships and connections

283
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,839
are table stakes for success in security.

284
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,590
This applies at all stages of
having a career in security.

285
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:37,740
It can be a common misconception,

286
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:38,770
but because of what we do,

287
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:41,520
we must work in individual secrecy.

288
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,120
It doesn't need to be
lonely to tread a new path.

289
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,520
Of course we have to stay
within what's legally allowed,

290
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:50,150
but it's as if we never
graduate from security school.

291
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:52,540
It's always good to join a study group.

292
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:55,290
Personally, I wouldn't be
anywhere near as successful

293
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:56,670
without the help of others.

294
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:59,410
I still vividly remember
the first help I got

295
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:02,620
from reaching out to a vendor,
very early in my career.

296
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:03,883
It was an eye-opener.

297
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,230
- Angela, I wholeheartedly agree.

298
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:08,063
My journey started out

299
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:10,550
as I was the only security
person at my company,

300
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:11,920
where I would threaten my company

301
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,550
that if we didn't buy this tool,

302
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:17,750
or buy this silver bullet item,
we wouldn't pass an audit.

303
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:18,610
But what ended up happening

304
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:20,230
was my rapid learning curve occurred,

305
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:22,530
once I started joining organizations,

306
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:24,839
and I worked on my professional network.

307
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,730
And what I see currently is
that the most rapid growth

308
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,740
in many security practices happens,

309
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:32,030
when they start sharing what went right,

310
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:33,920
but also what went wrong.

311
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,260
I lead the emerging technology
group for ISSA International,

312
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,750
and our charter is to explore, document,

313
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,840
and distribute information
to the security community.

314
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:46,130
We wanna do that so that we
can illuminate leading edge,

315
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:48,920
and effective security
practices and controls.

316
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,900
I welcome you to join this
expedition that we're going on,

317
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,970
or find other like-minded groups

318
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:56,070
that are readily available to join.

319
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:57,760
- There were so many options,

320
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,560
sometimes too many options.

321
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,060
Back to our earlier
takeaway, maybe keep some,

322
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:05,369
throw others out, make our own new groups.

323
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:07,120
Security is such a great community,

324
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,230
and supports reaching out.

325
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:10,700
We just have to be willing to give,

326
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,200
as well as to take along the way,

327
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,400
and be prepared for the fact

328
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,660
the answer will sometimes
be no, and that's okay too.

329
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,130
Back to our community.

330
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,710
There's a concept called
community resilience,

331
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:22,080
where a community works together

332
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:25,300
with creativity and
flexibility to solve problems.

333
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,709
This sounds just like us,

334
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:29,920
reaching out to drive
greater resilience overall.

335
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,680
Well we've certainly reached
out to each other today.

336
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,949
Thanks, Jimmy.

337
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:36,000
Any final thoughts?

338
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,879
- I've had such an amazing experience

339
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:40,319
that I know that Angela
and I will be continuing

340
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,520
this conversation offline.

341
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,750
I encourage you to reach out
to me with any questions,

342
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:48,660
or anything, because
for us working together,

343
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,050
we can make security better.

344
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:51,410
Personally, I'm excited

345
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:52,870
about the current and future generation

346
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:56,120
of visionary security leaders
that are driving the industry

347
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,000
with their amazing ideas.

348
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,930
The technology community
has shown amazing resilience

349
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:02,349
in these trying times.

350
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:05,380
We hope that all of you are
as optimistic is Angela and I,

351
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:08,020
because together we've
looked at these hard truths,

352
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:10,240
and taken actions to make things better.

353
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,700
We understand that shared accountability,

354
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:16,490
increased diversity, as well
as embracing innovative,

355
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:19,720
scientifically effective
techniques will allow us together,

356
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,440
to impact amazing progress,
and change within our industry.

357
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,120
However, the ultimate lesson

358
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,140
that I want you to take home with this,

359
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:29,020
is that we need each other now,

360
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:31,340
more than ever in these exciting times.

361
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:34,710
- To wrap things up, there are
three takeaways from today.

362
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:36,810
How do we become more resilient?

363
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:40,560
We've got to zoom out,
throw out, and reach out.

364
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,959
To zoom out, try a wide
angle lens for viewing risks

365
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,810
and the spectrum of impact.

366
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:49,290
Throw out those old ways of
doing things, and reach out.

367
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:51,380
We're more resilient
and better at security

368
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:53,000
when we leverage our relationships

369
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,460
and collective knowledge.

370
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,180
Jimmy, it was a real pleasure

371
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:58,729
working through these truths with you.

372
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:00,800
Thanks everyone for joining us,

373
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,219
and to moving forward and
being more resilient together.

374
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:07,610
Please stay safe, and enjoy
the rest of the conference.

375
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:08,764
- Hi, Mom.

376
00:15:08,764 --> 00:15:11,847
