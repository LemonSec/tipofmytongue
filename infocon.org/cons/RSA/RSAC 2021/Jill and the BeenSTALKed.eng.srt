1
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:04,019
- Hi Roy, my name is Chloe Messdaghi.

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:06,039
And I'm the founder of WeAreHackerz

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:09,550
and cofounder of WoSEC and
Hacking is Not a Crime.

4
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:13,010
And today we're gonna
talk about stalkerware.

5
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:14,823
And I have an incredible panel,

6
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:18,590
ready to share everything
about stalkerware

7
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:21,700
and the, where we stand
actually today about it.

8
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,310
So welcome to Jill and the BeenSTALKed,

9
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:29,299
and with me today, I have
Xena Olsen and Joe Gray.

10
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,660
Before I introduce them,

11
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,120
I'm gonna briefly tell you why I'm,

12
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,890
why this topic means so much to me

13
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:39,190
and our panelists when
they introduce themselves

14
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:42,949
they will also share why
this matters to them as well.

15
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:45,290
So I have friends and family members

16
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:48,170
that basically have
dealt with Stalkeraware

17
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:49,960
for many years.

18
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:54,340
And usually it's an
ex-boyfriend or an ex-husband

19
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:58,913
or even just a friend that
had a love interest in them.

20
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:01,210
And it becomes really scary

21
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:04,010
because it's not just someone
stalking outside your window.

22
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:06,860
They're also knowing everything
that you're looking up.

23
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:08,910
Everything that's going on in your mind

24
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:12,070
because when you have a access
to someone's cell phone,

25
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:13,619
you learn what are the
things that are going

26
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,710
through their mind.

27
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:17,960
Everything about them and
who they're connecting with,

28
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,800
also where they're located.

29
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,980
This opens a door for abusers

30
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,353
to take full advantage of victims.

31
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:28,680
So Xena, why don't you share
a little bit about who you are

32
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,680
and why stalkerware, this whole
conversation matters to you?

33
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:36,240
- Sure, thank you Chloe.

34
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,380
And thank you to everyone
that has come to our talk.

35
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,250
I'm really excited to
share about stalkerware.

36
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:47,990
I am, I have an MBA, I'm a
cybersecurity doctoral student

37
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:50,059
at Marymount University.

38
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:53,600
I am a graduate of the
SANS Women's Academy.

39
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,770
I'm also involved with
DEF CON Blue Team Village.

40
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:59,610
I have eight GIAC certifications

41
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:03,140
and why is stalkerware important to me?

42
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,580
Well, I was a victim of stalkerware,

43
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,730
you got to experience it firsthand.

44
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:12,530
And my experiences with
stalkerware actually led

45
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:15,380
to my career in Information Security.

46
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,840
So that's why it means a lot to me,

47
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,160
I firsthand experienced.

48
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,530
Also I have family members

49
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,920
that have been impacted by it as well,

50
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:29,920
so I can tackle it from
multiple angles, thank you.

51
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,980
- Thanks Xena, Joe, do you mind

52
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,540
share a little bit about yourself

53
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:36,850
and why this is such an interest to you?

54
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:39,680
- Absolutely, so hi I'm Joe Gray.

55
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,420
I'm the founder and principal
instructor with the OSINTIon,

56
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:48,190
as well as the founder
and lead investigator

57
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:50,483
for Transparent Intelligence Services.

58
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:53,910
I'm a Hacking is Not a Crime advocate.

59
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:57,030
I also work with nonprofits

60
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,130
such as Operation Safe Escape,

61
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:03,222
National Child Protection
Task Force and Trace Labs.

62
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,390
I'm passionate about most things

63
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:10,299
dealing with Open Source
Intelligence, OSINT,

64
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:14,400
and while stalkerware is
something that crosses

65
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,340
the proverbial plane that we normally say

66
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,640
we don't cross with OSINT.

67
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,100
Based on my work with
various organizations

68
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:27,630
and seeing the damage
that this can do to people

69
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:32,630
and how just dirty
stalkerware in general is,

70
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,250
I feel that I should probably speak up

71
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,900
and say something about this

72
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,730
because my main goal working
in the security industry

73
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:46,359
as a whole is to make
the world a safer place

74
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,260
tomorrow than it is today.

75
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:51,600
And I'm in such a point

76
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,519
that we really just can't bury our heads

77
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,310
in the sand and ignore something.

78
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,143
This is not something

79
00:03:57,143 --> 00:03:59,183
that's going to go away by ignoring it.

80
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,620
- I fully agree.

81
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:02,620
And I'm very glad

82
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,830
that RSAConference excepted this talk

83
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,550
and allowing us to speak about this

84
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:08,020
because more and more people need

85
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,020
to know about stalkerware.

86
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,400
It is so critical,

87
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,430
because one out of eight in the US

88
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:17,690
have stated that they
have used stalkerware

89
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:20,709
or spyware on someone

90
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:22,599
that they've been in a relationship with

91
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,430
or were in a previous relationship with.

92
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:28,640
And that's those that admit to it.

93
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,810
So think about that.

94
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:32,380
That might number, might be way higher

95
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:35,240
than what we think of at this moment.

96
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,533
It's becoming prevalent and
especially in our industry.

97
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,320
So what we're gonna be talking about

98
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,900
on this entire panel

99
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,650
is first of all, what is stalkerware?

100
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:47,483
How its used?

101
00:04:47,483 --> 00:04:49,390
So if you're a beginner,
this is the first time

102
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:51,159
you've ever heard about stalkerware,

103
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,570
don't worry, we're gonna walk you through.

104
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:54,820
What are the characteristics
of stalkerware?

105
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:58,800
Also what are the motivations
of using stalkerware?

106
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,810
Who are these victims of stalkerware?

107
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:02,920
Where are the psychological issues

108
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,050
and resources as well?

109
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,650
And Xena I'm looking forward

110
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:07,859
for you sharing a little bit about

111
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:12,110
your actual experience as well.

112
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:16,030
And the most important thing
at the end of this panel,

113
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:19,330
is for everyone to know
how they have a role

114
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,090
in protecting people

115
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:24,210
and how they can stop
stalkerware from occurring.

116
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:26,919
Or at least try to reduce that
one out of eight statistic

117
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,373
that I shared earlier.

118
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,640
Throughout the panel,
there's gonna this slide

119
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,640
that's gonna be sharing.

120
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,270
And I just want you all to know

121
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,880
to please take a screenshot

122
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,070
of it or take a photo of it and share it.

123
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,300
Because people need to know

124
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:44,210
that there are resources out there,

125
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:47,049
for those that are victims of stalkerware

126
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:50,230
because sometimes when people
are dealing with stalkerware,

127
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:53,253
it's incredibly hard to get help.

128
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,620
There are times where we know of people

129
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:00,160
that have been, basically they
have shared with a therapist

130
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,760
because it's such a traumatic experience.

131
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,150
And what ends up happening

132
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:07,919
is that the, they will be notified

133
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,760
as someone with psychosis

134
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,760
and then go to a Mental Health Institute

135
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:16,060
thinking that they're
delusional or paranoid.

136
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:18,970
But to be honest this is such an ongoing

137
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:21,970
and really prevalent issue

138
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:23,460
that we need to really address

139
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,450
and have more of the public understand,

140
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:26,823
how prevalent it is.

141
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:29,480
I wanna first note that

142
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,240
none of us are credentialed

143
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,340
in mental health practitioners at all.

144
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:38,679
We're just some InfoSec
nerds at the end of the day,

145
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,610
but this topic is so
critically and important

146
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,410
and we want to share from our perspectives

147
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:45,900
of what it is like,

148
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,820
but also I'm looking forward to doing this

149
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,683
because I know too many people

150
00:06:50,683 --> 00:06:52,383
that have had this happen.

151
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:56,580
And I do wanna just state

152
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,070
that the opinions expressed

153
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:01,240
in this entire presentation
are those of the presenters

154
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,150
in their individual capacity

155
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:05,823
and not necessarily those of employers.

156
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,020
So let's start, shall we?

157
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:12,370
So the first question I have is for Xena.

158
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:16,683
Xena what exactly is
stalkerware or spyware?

159
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:21,849
- So the coalition
against domestic violence

160
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:24,910
and a lot of the other
organizations out there,

161
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:29,910
the generalized description
of stalkerware is software

162
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:35,370
that's used to facilitate
intimate partner violence, period.

163
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:38,600
That's just a very broad definition of it.

164
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:42,210
And so it falls under the category

165
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:45,200
of intimate partner surveillance tools.

166
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,830
And with that, you know

167
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:50,690
it could include commodity
Stalkware or spyware,

168
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:55,110
it could include dual use
apps, like Find My Phone,

169
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:56,330
it could be mRATs,

170
00:07:56,330 --> 00:08:00,760
which is a mobile Remote
Access Trojan i.e malware.

171
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,920
It could also be shared accounts.

172
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,480
A lot of times in
relationships and all of that,

173
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,300
you share your account

174
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:10,650
and they gain access to your information.

175
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:14,520
And there's also, of course
OSINT and social media.

176
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,370
People a lot of social
engineering could be involved

177
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:21,260
with the intimate partner
surveillance tools or techniques.

178
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,830
And then, you know asking to see receipts

179
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:26,820
to confirm that you
were at a certain place

180
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:29,813
at a certain time and
just things like that.

181
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:34,640
- And Joe briefly, can
you just share with people

182
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,909
who usually uses stalkerware on victims.

183
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:41,189
- Anyone really could use stalkerware

184
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:42,750
often times to Xena's point

185
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:47,750
it would be a abusive or
jealous lovers', acquaintances

186
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,210
or could even be co-workers, employees.

187
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:55,450
But because at the end of the day

188
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:59,480
stalkerware is a type of malware,

189
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,280
basically it is malicious in nature,

190
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:06,040
the intention of the
software is malicious.

191
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:10,569
It could just be the,
someone could be targeted

192
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:12,460
as the target of opportunity.

193
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,540
It could be that someone got access

194
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:18,780
to data breach information
and just started to hone in.

195
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:21,620
We can talk about anyone leading up

196
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:24,270
all the way up to nation-states
doing this kind of stuff.

197
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:27,319
This would definitely be that level

198
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:31,270
of espionage or surveillance
and reconnaissance

199
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:35,213
although it doesn't pass the
litmus test for OSINT per sem.

200
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:41,840
Or it could just be bored people
with incredible capacities

201
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:46,660
for writing code that just decide

202
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:49,540
they're gonna do something
for the laurels if you will

203
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,849
and they don't think
things all the way through.

204
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:56,100
So, in summation it could
be pretty much anyone.

205
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,290
There, because at the end of the day

206
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:00,010
you don't have to be able
to write it yourself.

207
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:01,870
There are places you can go to get it,

208
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:04,900
we won't mention them, we're not going to,

209
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,829
because we are actively advocating

210
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:09,540
against advertising that
type of information,

211
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:13,370
but it's not terribly challenging

212
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:15,260
to hop on the internet

213
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,780
and go to certain places on the internet

214
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:20,230
and purchase stalkerware,
purchase ransomware

215
00:10:21,067 --> 00:10:23,193
and mRATs or whatever you may want.

216
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,900
- Yeah, I definitely have
heard a bunch of cases

217
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,363
of this happening to journalist.

218
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:32,960
There's been a lots of stories

219
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:37,180
about stalkerware being
used on journalists

220
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:39,180
to, we special their reportings

221
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,760
on story that is very
sensitive to governments

222
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:46,113
or like multinational like companies.

223
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:49,730
Xena, I have a question for you.

224
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:52,800
So how does it work and
how accessible is it?

225
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,099
I know that Joe mentioned
that it is pretty easy to get

226
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,710
and I know that we're not
gonna share where to get it,

227
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:02,410
but do you mind sharing a
little bit of how accessible is?

228
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:05,492
And how does it work exactly?

229
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:10,050
- Yes, type in your
browser, spy on my wife

230
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:14,579
and that pretty much
answers all your questions

231
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:17,050
and you know, for cost-wives,

232
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:19,939
it's actually really affordable,

233
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,670
you know, anywhere from $50 to 200

234
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:26,520
for either monthly, quarterly,
or annual subscriptions

235
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:30,210
depending upon the particular
flavor of stalkerware

236
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:32,020
that you want to purchase.

237
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:36,720
And stalkerware offers
either, they offer tiers

238
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,310
of service based upon what
it is that you purchase.

239
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:43,400
But overall in general, you know

240
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,880
the straight out of the box

241
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,930
without doing any add-ons essentially.

242
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:54,050
There's basic and there's active

243
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:56,370
and passive data collection.

244
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:57,930
So what does that mean?

245
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:59,390
It can read your texts,

246
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:04,287
it can read your call logs,
some chat apps, pics and videos,

247
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:09,130
some of your browser
history, GPS location,

248
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:10,980
you can tear up, you know

249
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,100
add in being able to monitor social media.

250
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,410
It just depends.

251
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:19,520
And basically Commodity stalkerware

252
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:24,520
is extremely easy to use,
super cheap, readily available

253
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:27,650
and it has similar capabilities

254
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:32,650
to mRATs, mobile Remote
Access Trojans and spyware,

255
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:37,750
it requires no user interaction
and no technical skill.

256
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:41,360
One of the spyware or stalkerware vendors,

257
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,575
they actually advertise that

258
00:12:43,575 --> 00:12:48,010
the purchaser can call
them at like 2:00 AM

259
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:50,460
and get help with setting up stalkerware

260
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:53,000
on the device that they wanna put it on.

261
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,190
So, I mean the only drawback

262
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:59,300
is that it does require physical access

263
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:02,089
to the device for the attacker.

264
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:04,100
Like I said, no user interactions,

265
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,350
no victim interaction
with the stalkerware,

266
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:08,880
it actually requires the attacker

267
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,710
to gain access to the device.

268
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:15,130
And then on, in most cases
it requires internet access.

269
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:18,060
So for instance Android,

270
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:21,540
they need to have the
ability to install apps

271
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,640
from unknown sources

272
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:27,439
and they need to disable
Google play protect.

273
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,160
And then for Apple devices,

274
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,490
they need to be jailbroken

275
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:35,273
or you can spy on them
via iCloud account access.

276
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,810
- I'm glad that you brought up

277
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:39,949
about the physical access to device,

278
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:42,500
because I know of some of my girlfriends

279
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,900
they actually had to
throw away their phone

280
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,300
and get a brand new,

281
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,859
not reconnected to the cloud, nothing.

282
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:53,300
They had to start fresh all over again

283
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,219
because the devices and
also brand new laptops too,

284
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:59,640
like it's expensive when we're like dating

285
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,963
and we have people that want
to use this stuff on us.

286
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:06,930
Joe, you mentioned a little
bit about OSINT earlier,

287
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:08,989
when it comes to stalkerware.

288
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:10,500
Can you share a little bit more

289
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,570
about how would an attacker use OSINT

290
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:14,410
and for those in our audience

291
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:15,959
that don't know what OSINT is,

292
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,293
can you briefly touch on that please?

293
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:24,140
- Sure, so OSINT isn't acronym
for Open Source Intelligence

294
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:28,650
that is data collected in
an intelligence context

295
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:30,810
from publicly available sources.

296
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:33,619
You don't have to utilize any hacker tools

297
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,060
or techniques for it.

298
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:39,030
Oftentimes the people readily share

299
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:42,130
that information with you via social media

300
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:44,530
or it could be from search engines,

301
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:48,660
it could be from data
aggregators and data brokers.

302
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,430
On the business side,

303
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:52,620
there are some aspects of OSINT

304
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,670
that are part of what I call

305
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:56,530
the cost of doing
business on the internet.

306
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:59,500
Things like Domain Name Service, DNS

307
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,470
or for publicly traded companies,

308
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:05,370
public filings, not to mention
public records as well.

309
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:07,810
So for people who weren't aware

310
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:10,050
of what the term OSINT really means,

311
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:10,882
there's a good chance

312
00:15:10,883 --> 00:15:13,010
you've probably been doing OSINT for years

313
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:15,800
and you just didn't know
that's what it was called.

314
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,810
OSINT can play into
stalkerware a variety of ways,

315
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:22,000
because as someone goes
to stalk someone else,

316
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,940
there are a lot of ways that they could go

317
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,370
to gain that access.

318
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:30,140
So they may be able to gain
access to iCloud credentials

319
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,220
because people reuse the same passwords

320
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,500
and someone uses OSINT techniques

321
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,370
to find data breaches

322
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:38,510
that a particular email address

323
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:40,990
or username may be associated with.

324
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:42,030
And they find a pattern

325
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:47,030
of, oh this person uses
spring 2021 as their password.

326
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:49,990
So let's see, oh they
created their account

327
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,740
in the fall of 2019.

328
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,410
Let's try fall 2019.

329
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:56,680
Oh, that didn't work autumn
2019, oh that did work.

330
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,709
Or it could just be that people

331
00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:00,750
just legitimately use the
same password everywhere.

332
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:04,980
But it also affords potential
stalkers and adversaries

333
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:08,010
the ability to watch what is happening

334
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:11,740
and use it in concert with the stalkerware

335
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:14,120
to confirm information

336
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,060
that they are collecting in terms

337
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,099
of what are they getting it,

338
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,290
from the photos, where are they?

339
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:21,520
They may get the photos

340
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,130
but not find the location data.

341
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:26,960
So they may have to use
image intelligence techniques

342
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,490
like reverse image searching

343
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:33,490
or looking at exchangeable
image format, photo metadata

344
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:37,990
or even forensic images,
not forensic images

345
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:41,110
in the regard of like memory
captures and hard drives

346
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:43,280
but looking at an image

347
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:46,699
from a forensic perspective
to look for alterations,

348
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,290
there's a lot of stuff that
could be done for that.

349
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:51,730
And it's important to note

350
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:55,800
that from the OSINT perspective,

351
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,560
we try to stay as passive as possible.

352
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,930
We try to be transparent,

353
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:03,109
if we were talking about the team colors

354
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:05,130
like red team, blue team, gold team

355
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:06,680
orange team, et cetera.

356
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,420
If OSINT was its own team,

357
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:10,359
OSINT should be the transparent team

358
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:13,709
or the clear team because
there should be little

359
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:15,849
to no detection capability.

360
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:18,010
And as a by-product of that,

361
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:21,900
that can really go sideways really quick.

362
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,099
There are a lot of noble uses for it,

363
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:26,889
like assisting in finding, missing people

364
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:29,610
and investigating a potential crimes,

365
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:33,169
dealing with things like
children or cryptocurrency

366
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:36,030
and of course a threat intelligence.

367
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:38,490
But at the end of the day
regarding the techniques,

368
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:39,970
what are the OSINT techniques,

369
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:41,943
as well as any software.

370
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:47,850
It, what really determines
the outcome is the intention.

371
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:50,300
So you can have great intentions,

372
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,210
but cross lines using OSINT

373
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:54,420
just as you can with any other software.

374
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:58,203
So this can definitely play
a significant role in it.

375
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:03,469
Not to mention that if
anyone uses, say a smishing

376
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:07,763
or phishing technique to
try to gain further access,

377
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:11,740
having the proper amount
of OSINT collected

378
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:14,190
before that engagement can provide

379
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:18,210
some invaluable context
to be able to impersonate

380
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:21,550
whomever or whatever
to be able to influence

381
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:23,030
or manipulate the victim

382
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:25,583
into doing what they need to do.

383
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:32,340
- And Xena how prevalent is this problem?

384
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:35,580
Well really quick, since
we're in the pandemic

385
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,090
I just thought I'd mentioned

386
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:39,770
that all the reports that I've read on it

387
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:43,270
have stated that the use of
stalkerware has increased

388
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:45,050
by a ridiculous amount

389
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:47,690
since the start of the pandemic.

390
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:52,657
So for whatever reason, it's increased.

391
00:18:52,657 --> 00:18:57,657
Malwarebytes actually
reports a 190% increase.

392
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:01,687
And Bureau says that they're
seeing a 99% increase

393
00:19:01,687 --> 00:19:03,909
in the use of stalkerware.

394
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:08,720
And according to the
Stalking Prevention Awareness

395
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,853
and Resource Center, it's called SPARC.

396
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:14,100
In the United States,

397
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:19,100
stalking impacts about
6 to 7.5 million people

398
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,173
or devices per year.

399
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:25,629
And that one in four

400
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:28,180
of the victims report being stopped

401
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:30,310
through some form of technology.

402
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:33,693
So that's a pretty big deal to me.

403
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,040
- So clearly it seems pretty easy to do

404
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:41,023
and it's very prevalent at this time.

405
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:47,370
Can you give like maybe one
or two or specific examples?

406
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:51,460
- Yeah, so like I said that
there's different flavors

407
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:55,300
of stalkerware and then
different the tiers of service,

408
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,649
that is available.

409
00:19:57,650 --> 00:19:59,740
So for instance, Mobistealth,

410
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,760
they provide information

411
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,610
on how to disable two
factor authentication

412
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:08,590
when accessing a victim's iCloud device

413
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:10,620
that's extra helpful, right?

414
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:14,114
To get more stalkerware
and more visibility,

415
00:20:14,115 --> 00:20:17,310
mSpy they let you hide the icon.

416
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:20,290
So you can spy on someone
and they might not see

417
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:22,000
that that's going on.

418
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,530
FlexiSPY lets you look at deleted messages

419
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:28,920
and the fun part is
that it's undetectable.

420
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:33,120
So that's great for the victims of course.

421
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:37,290
And spyic set claims

422
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:41,283
that it doesn't need to be
on a device that's jailbroken

423
00:20:41,284 --> 00:20:44,040
or routed to install.

424
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,340
I haven't confirmed that claim

425
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,889
but that's what they're claiming

426
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:49,940
I know if I believe it,
but that's what they say

427
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:52,270
probably to get money, but we'll see.

428
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:55,510
And then true spy markets itself

429
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:58,040
as an alternative to quote unquote

430
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,350
hacking the victim's the cell phone.

431
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:01,983
So that's fun.

432
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,840
- So clearly there's a
lot of abusers out there

433
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,840
and that are wanting to do this.

434
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,250
And there are plenty
of technology out there

435
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:14,950
that helps abusers continue the abuse.

436
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:16,410
Wonderful, this is

437
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:17,896
great to know.
- That's true.

438
00:21:17,896 --> 00:21:19,030
(laughing) Yeah.

439
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:20,300
- I'm being sarcastic

440
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,342
just for people that know on that front.

441
00:21:23,387 --> 00:21:25,179
Joe, all right.

442
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,180
- Stick as well (laughing)

443
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,957
I don't think it's a good thing.

444
00:21:27,957 --> 00:21:31,710
- Chloe, if I may, there,
here are some other vectors

445
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:33,620
that could even go with that though.

446
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:37,469
It, instead of even going
the route of purchasing

447
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:39,520
any of the wares mentioned

448
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,220
or anything along those lines,

449
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:44,830
you could easily use
Parental Control Software,

450
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:47,320
other ways that this could be perpetrated

451
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:52,320
would be the aggressor inviting someone

452
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,440
to join their password manager account

453
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,970
so that they can gain access

454
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:02,250
to the vault or whatever
terminology is used

455
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,540
to get all of their passwords.

456
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,290
That's a method as well.

457
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:08,590
Of course, you know,
Parental Control Software

458
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:11,850
things like Net Nanny
and things to that nature

459
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:13,510
that could be used,

460
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:16,780
not to mention joint Facebook accounts

461
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:18,300
or joint social media accounts,

462
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:22,149
joint email accounts in general
that could be used as well.

463
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:24,130
In addition to things like Find My iPhone

464
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:28,270
and similar products for that.

465
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:32,420
There's a lot of different
creative ways people could go.

466
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:35,710
I mean, if someone had
the technical expertise

467
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:38,780
they realistically could
take a forensic image

468
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:40,879
of a mobile device.

469
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,140
And I mean, in this
context I actually do mean

470
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:48,030
like the true forensic
image of memory and storage

471
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:51,520
and potentially reverse engineer,

472
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,740
some information out of it

473
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:56,373
and basically do oftens
of forensics if you will.

474
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:59,830
- And so we've talked a lot

475
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:04,830
about people and in particular
being victims of stalkerware

476
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:08,400
but I know Xena, you've also have

477
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,170
quite, you've done a lot of research also

478
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:14,410
about how could stock
war impact enterprises?

479
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:16,650
Do you mind sharing a little
bit about that front too?

480
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:19,720
- Yeah, I'll give a really
high level overview.

481
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,030
It's not gonna be in depth at all.

482
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:24,740
And I'm just gonna run
through this really quick.

483
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:29,490
So basically stalkerware vendors
are notoriously compromised

484
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:31,630
because hacktivists hate them

485
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:34,530
and they're constantly getting popped.

486
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:38,860
Let's see poor security
practices, MSConfigs.

487
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:42,270
There's just a long list
of stalkerware vendors

488
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:43,670
that have been compromised.

489
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:45,050
Some of them twice.

490
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:47,409
So there's that to think about,

491
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:48,780
you know the data's on there,

492
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,010
let's say, you know,

493
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:52,340
let's say I had stalkerware
on one of my devices

494
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,610
and I'm in a work meeting

495
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:56,760
and they're recording the device
and it's on a compromised,

496
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,640
you know, stalkerware
vendors infrastructure

497
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,550
what's gonna happen with that, right?

498
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:04,990
So that's one potential
vector to think about.

499
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:09,020
There's also Mobile Device
Management, MDM servers.

500
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:12,310
So checkpoint actually released a report

501
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:15,340
where 75%, that's a lot,

502
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:18,449
of a multinational
companies, mobile devices

503
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:21,780
were infected with an mRAT

504
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:24,710
and basically they
compromise the MDM server.

505
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:26,000
They pushed out the mRAT

506
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,620
and then anything that the people did

507
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:31,959
on that particular phone,
such as corporate creds

508
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,430
or to a fake codes or anything like that,

509
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:35,490
it was compromised.

510
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:38,400
And the company had to do just a big

511
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,660
or glide factory reset

512
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:45,660
so that's a big impact to
daily business operations.

513
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:49,020
The other point is that if you look

514
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,384
at the infection chain of stalkerware,

515
00:24:51,384 --> 00:24:53,780
just the technical aspects of it,

516
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:56,629
it actually maps back to a kill chain.

517
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:58,090
The Lockheed Martin kill Chain.

518
00:24:58,090 --> 00:25:01,280
And you can go step by step through that

519
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,500
and I'll spare you all for it.

520
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,760
But basically trust me, it does.

521
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:08,210
And I can, I'm more than
happy to discuss this,

522
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:10,620
you know, afterwards if you're curious.

523
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:11,810
And the other fun thing

524
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:15,870
is that Mitre ATT&CK has a mobile option

525
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:18,560
for their tactics,
techniques and procedures.

526
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,679
So for instance with me,

527
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:24,260
my particular stalker or a attacker,

528
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:28,720
he used a dental mold to lift
the prints off of my phone

529
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,710
to gain access to it.

530
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:32,700
And believe it or not,
that is actually a tactic

531
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,330
in Mitre ATT&CK techniques for mobile.

532
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:39,919
And its initial access,
it's a lock screen bypass

533
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,150
and then of course the specific procedure

534
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:43,680
was dental mold.

535
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,040
You can also use PLATO as well.

536
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,850
There are actually YouTube videos on it.

537
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:50,709
If you just type in YouTube

538
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:53,170
like how to gain access,

539
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:56,260
there's tutorials, they
explain everything.

540
00:25:56,260 --> 00:26:01,260
So it even has, you know,
how to capture SMS messages,

541
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:03,890
that's also a technique as well.

542
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:08,050
So definitely check that
out if you're interested.

543
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:09,899
The Citizen's Lab data report

544
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:14,050
on the effectiveness of
AV at catching stalkerware

545
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:15,409
and it's actually really bad.

546
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:17,850
So that's also another concern

547
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:21,270
and I looked up, I wanted
to give concrete figures

548
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:23,960
for the numbers, people out
there for corporate America.

549
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,940
I found some stats based on men and women,

550
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:29,600
I apologize for the non-binary folks.

551
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,260
I don't mean to exclude you,

552
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:33,290
it's just, those are the stats I have.

553
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:34,899
So please forgive me.

554
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:39,660
And basically they said
that one out of three women

555
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:42,720
have experienced some form
of intimate partner violence

556
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,870
and one out of six men.

557
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:47,229
And so what I did is I took a sample size

558
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:49,450
of about 20,000 employees,

559
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:51,490
let's say the corporate America, right?

560
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:54,780
And I did the math, I did the figures

561
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:58,860
and that came to about 25% or 5,000

562
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,949
of the employees have been impacted

563
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:02,240
at some time in their lives

564
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,120
with intimate partner violence.

565
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,780
So then I did some more digging

566
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:10,780
and I found some stats on
people that were impacted

567
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:13,840
with intimate partner violence
and also had stalkerware

568
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:18,629
and it came out that 54% of
intimate partner violence.

569
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:21,280
Survivors they were also
tracked with stalkerware,

570
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:24,510
so when you do 54% of 5k,

571
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:28,717
that comes out to 2.7 K
or approximately 13.5%

572
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:34,440
of the general number
of employees of 20,000

573
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,680
that were impacted at
some point by stalkerware,

574
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,920
that's a lot.

575
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,603
So it can impact corporate America.

576
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:45,840
- Jeez (laughing)
- Also with

577
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:49,060
Yeah, we should also factor in that

578
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:54,060
while we're focusing on
the stalkerware aspect,

579
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:56,030
going back to the intention,

580
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:59,312
this could very easily be used partially

581
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:04,140
by nation-states for
corporate as pay use as well

582
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:07,430
or industrial espionage to gain access.

583
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:10,480
So that's always a vector
- 0kay.

584
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,840
- As well, especially
when we factor in that

585
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:18,870
a lot of countries try
to use people to date

586
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,280
or get intimate with people to put

587
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,960
this type of stuff on there.

588
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,960
It's, it has that perspective as well.

589
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:33,060
So this is vitally important

590
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:34,850
for the people who are
actually being stalked

591
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:37,830
but it's also something that
businesses should not put

592
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:39,010
their heads in the sand for

593
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:43,040
because while it may be an
employee being targeted,

594
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:46,580
at the same time it could
have potential outcomes

595
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:48,960
at the corporate level as well.

596
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,510
- So basically from
what I'm gathering here

597
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:56,180
if when I want to prevent a
stalkerware on their device

598
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:59,260
basically never leave
your phones unattended.

599
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:01,370
Even when you're dating someone,

600
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:03,500
don't trust them, have zero trust policy

601
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,160
at the very beginning of the relationship

602
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,620
and always monitor your phone.

603
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:10,379
Always delete unused
apps I'm guessing it too

604
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:12,920
maybe check permissions on installed apps,

605
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,720
check browser history,

606
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,430
constantly regularly search

607
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:20,150
for suspicious apps
and activity on phones.

608
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:21,910
And I guess the other thing

609
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:24,690
for sure everyone should
be using a password manager

610
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:27,120
if you're attending RSAConference.

611
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,629
If you're in security,
you should be on that

612
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:31,500
and never ever share a
password with anyone,

613
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:34,090
don't use the same password more than once

614
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:35,629
like Joe pointed out earlier,

615
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:39,350
and change your phone pass
codes very frequently.

616
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:40,709
Those are things I know,

617
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:43,691
if I'm gonna prevent it, but now

618
00:29:43,691 --> 00:29:45,350
- (indistinct) authentication well of.

619
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,649
- Yes.

620
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:48,460
- And if you can do a hardware

621
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:50,700
based multi-factor or token

622
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:53,390
that is probably the number one pick

623
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:55,270
but it can be a massive pain in the rear,

624
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:57,650
if you need to access something
and you don't have it.

625
00:29:57,650 --> 00:30:01,430
So number two would be
something application-based,

626
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:03,240
like Google authenticator or duo

627
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,440
and then worst comes to worse,

628
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,150
if you have no other options,

629
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:12,580
then SMS based multifactor authentication,

630
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:15,683
but know that that could be
played into the vectors as well.

631
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:21,940
- All right, and so now I have
to ask the big question Xena,

632
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:24,960
as someone who went through stalkerware,

633
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,820
I have definitely have heard
of stories from my friends

634
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:30,290
and family members that
they went to the FBI,

635
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:32,490
they went to the police

636
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:34,960
and there was no attention to it.

637
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,010
They didn't know nothing ever happened

638
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:38,710
when they reported it.

639
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:42,190
So what are some resources
that actually exist out there

640
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:45,110
that actually does help or helped you

641
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:47,060
when you were dealing with stalkerware?

642
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:51,760
- Well, I honestly didn't
have the best experience.

643
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:55,129
I consulted with lawyers, multiple lawyers

644
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:58,850
and I even went to a hacker
community quote unquote

645
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:01,230
and they kind of laughed at me

646
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:05,870
because they said it's so
common that it's not a problem.

647
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:07,209
And it was new to me,

648
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:08,850
you know not being a part

649
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:10,745
of information security or anything.

650
00:31:10,745 --> 00:31:13,840
I was still kind of in shock
that someone would do it

651
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,260
and it seems pretty

652
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:19,890
like they weren't shocked by it basically.

653
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:23,070
Some really great
resources otherwise though,

654
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:27,639
I personally at the time
decided not to pursue it.

655
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,200
I just got a new phone,

656
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,950
got a new, got new laptops, all of that.

657
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:35,730
But you know, if you do
want to speak with people

658
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:37,730
or get help or whatever operation

659
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:40,100
safe escape is a good option.

660
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:43,730
Checking out stopped
stalkerware.org as well.

661
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:46,510
The national coalition
against domestic violence

662
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:48,000
is also helpful

663
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,420
and the national network to
end domestic violence as well.

664
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:54,910
And for the corporate America participants

665
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:58,400
if you are interested in
finding out solutions,

666
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,870
for corporate America

667
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:03,810
specifically in dealing with
employees and all of that,

668
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:08,480
there's a company called
Tall Poppy, tallpoppy.io.

669
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,120
And they are willing to help,

670
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,750
they're super awesome.

671
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:14,550
Definitely check them out.

672
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:19,050
And you know, Kaspersky
actually came out with a tool

673
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:21,419
recently called TinyCheck

674
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:25,020
and it actually checks
the internet traffic

675
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:26,370
from your devices.

676
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:30,030
And it searches back,
you know, related IOCs.

677
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:31,660
And I believe Tall Poppy changed

678
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:33,500
their website to tallpoppy.com.

679
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:36,120
So I apologize, tallpoppy.com.

680
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:40,139
And then Kaspersky also
offers AV solutions.

681
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:41,810
Norton AV does as well.

682
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:46,200
Malwarebytes, you can scan
your device would look out AV,

683
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,750
I mean, generally a
lot of the AV solutions

684
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:50,360
they're still kind of up and coming,

685
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,620
sometimes it catches it.

686
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:55,520
So just it's better to
have it than not have it,

687
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,530
in my opinion, personally

688
00:32:57,530 --> 00:32:58,760
when I was going through it,

689
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:03,760
I purchased AV just in case, right?

690
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:05,233
So there's that.

691
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:11,300
- Okay, so from what I'm
gathering from both of you guys

692
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,540
and thank you once again

693
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:14,920
for sharing your knowledge and everything,

694
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,580
is that right now as individuals

695
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:18,320
we can actually do something about this.

696
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,510
And the first thing is
to push for app stores

697
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:23,260
to remove any applications
that track or monitor others

698
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:24,590
without their permission.

699
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:26,580
And also not allowing the advertising

700
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:30,470
of any type of stock
word vendors anywhere.

701
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:32,400
And also we need legislation.

702
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:35,690
So supporting, you know,
EFF and the coalition

703
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:38,170
it gets stuck where
this is really important

704
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:40,700
because they're right
now trying to do better

705
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:44,253
and trying to give more protections
and go into legislation.

706
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,070
As you guys are aware on
your screen is a link.

707
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:51,250
So if you have any other thoughts

708
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:53,610
or want more statistics
than what was presented

709
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:56,389
or the same statistics all over again

710
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:59,440
and also some resources
about the situation

711
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,950
and how to go about protecting
people from stalkerware

712
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:04,530
or getting help for people

713
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:06,180
that are dealing with stalkerware,

714
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:09,250
feel free to visit the site that's listed.

715
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:12,400
I want to say thank you again Xena and Joe

716
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:15,000
for sharing your expertise

717
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,290
and this situation is
a terrible situation,

718
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:19,969
in the first place.

719
00:34:19,969 --> 00:34:23,770
And also, again thank you RSAConference

720
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,690
for having this talk.

721
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:27,850
It is so critical that we start

722
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:31,929
really having not just
conversations but we take it further

723
00:34:31,929 --> 00:34:33,750
and do some actions around it.

724
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:35,540
So thank you so much for existing

725
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,800
and thank you all for joining us.

726
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,010
If you have any remaining questions,

727
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:42,163
please feel free to DM Zena or Joe

728
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:46,080
or myself directly on Twitter or LinkedIn

729
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,259
or even if you're on Instagram.

730
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,360
Thank you everyone.

731
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,063
- Yes thank you for having us.

732
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:54,080
- Thanks and please be safe.

733
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,002
- Yes be safe everyone.
