1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:05,040
- Hello, my name's Bill
Malik, I'm with Trend Micro

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,100
And I'm here today to speak

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:09,950
with you about the Zero Trust
challenge for hybrid cloud.

4
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:13,489
Now, what is this gonna involve?

5
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:17,230
In the course of this
talk we're going to ask

6
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:18,910
a little bit about what Zero Trust is,

7
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:20,080
a lot of definitions out there

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,959
and I wanna level the playing field.

9
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,690
Then we're gonna look particularly at what

10
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:28,890
hybrid cloud lacks that
Zero Trust can help with.

11
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,940
This really will explain the
core of this presentation

12
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,580
but in order to balance this,

13
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,220
there are no panaceas,
there are no silver bullets.

14
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:40,350
We're gonna ask some things about

15
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,330
what Zero Trust cannot do

16
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:45,129
and what hybrid cloud
does not need from it,

17
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:47,460
so that'll balance things out.

18
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,580
In order to expand our horizons a bit,

19
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:55,580
I'm gonna delve into some future
problems for hybrid cloud,

20
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,470
in edge computing and 5G in particular

21
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:03,990
that are gonna cause us to have
to extend our understanding

22
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:06,140
of information security architectures.

23
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,020
And then we'll finish up

24
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:11,490
with a couple of slides of
recommendations and next steps.

25
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:14,759
As for me, I've been at
it for four or five years,

26
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,980
I started work as a programmer in Boston,

27
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,800
wrote code in COBOL.

28
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,890
Yes, I did the Y2K
problem, like many others,

29
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:24,920
which YBM in Poughkeepsie wrote
code for operating systems.

30
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,180
Joined Gartner, who there for 11 years,

31
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,500
managed the information security service

32
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,220
and also the application
integration in middleware service.

33
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:34,640
In the turn of the century,

34
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,190
I became a member of a
consulting organization

35
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:39,009
then was CTO of Waveset

36
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:41,970
and after leaving that
following sun's acquisition,

37
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:44,070
I spent most of the time as
an independent consultant

38
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:47,630
and I joined Trend about
three and a half years ago.

39
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:51,449
So that's me, that's our
task and let's step in.

40
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,780
What is Zero Trust?

41
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,960
In order to understand the management

42
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,199
of an environment this complex,

43
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,160
I'd like to start with a story.

44
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:03,970
This is about two people who
are excellent watchmakers.

45
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:06,350
They both make beautiful watches

46
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:08,859
and each watch has a thousand parts.

47
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,120
Now Tempus, the watchmaker,

48
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,390
assembles the thousand part
watch, one piece at a time

49
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:19,109
Hora breaks down the task,

50
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:22,440
he builds a watch when
he has 10 assemblies.

51
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,290
And assembly consists of 10 sub-assemblies

52
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:28,320
and each sub-assembly has 10 parts.

53
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,239
So they put together there watches

54
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:35,970
but when they're interrupted
they have to put the watch down

55
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:40,459
and whatever they're
working on falls apart.

56
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,230
So on the average Tempest
gets 500 pieces done

57
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,399
before he puts it down and it falls apart.

58
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,370
On the average Hora he
gets five pieces done,

59
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:50,610
when he puts down the
thing he's working on

60
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:51,643
and it falls apart.

61
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:56,130
They both create the same watch,

62
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,170
with the same number of parts,

63
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:00,829
they both have the same skill.

64
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:05,830
The difference is because
Hora uses a methodology,

65
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,510
because he compartmentalizes the tasks,

66
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:12,483
because he understands the
relationships of the components,

67
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:17,320
Hora makes 4,000 watches

68
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,993
for every watch that Tempus completes.

69
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:24,070
This is a paper on the
architecture of complexity

70
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,410
that was published many, many years ago,

71
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:28,549
I have the reference in the deck.

72
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:31,430
Bear this in mind as we go
through what's necessary,

73
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,080
to secure a cloud.

74
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,120
If you get interrupted,

75
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,240
we don't want you to lose
more than a handful of parts,

76
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,700
we certainly don't wanna have to start

77
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,500
over from the beginning.

78
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,420
So, what is it with cloud

79
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:44,179
that requires all this
additional care and feeding?

80
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:47,230
Well, first thing is there's
always gonna be something

81
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:50,630
that you remain responsible for in cloud.

82
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:54,710
Even if you're using a
business process as a service,

83
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:57,600
you're still gonna be
responsible for making sure

84
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:02,019
that the service level
agreement is being fulfilled,

85
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:04,150
that you're paying for
what you're asking for.

86
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:07,000
Of course, the more you
put in the more you control

87
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,660
but at no point does
it completely go away.

88
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:13,530
And we're gonna remind ourselves
of that as we move forward,

89
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:15,540
notice the cloud does
take some responsibilities

90
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:18,730
off your desk but not all of them.

91
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:21,373
So let's begin by looking
at what Zero Trust is.

92
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:26,733
Zero Trust dates from the
actually the late 1990s,

93
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:31,490
when it was known as the concept
of Network Access Control.

94
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:35,510
The philosophy behind Zero
Trust is there is no perimeter.

95
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:38,140
There is no boundary of trust.

96
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,030
There is no reasonable
assumption of people

97
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:43,250
who are inside that mythical boundary,

98
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,970
are somehow trustworthy

99
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:47,690
and therefore don't need
to be authenticated.

100
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:51,170
In a Zero Trust world
there are no perimeters

101
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:52,810
and the cloud has no perimeter.

102
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:54,980
There is a source of trust
and this is problematic,

103
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:58,050
it's why the name is
kind of difficult for me,

104
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:59,530
when I initially ran into it.

105
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:01,260
There is one source of trust

106
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,680
and you go to that source of
trust to authenticate yourself

107
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,410
and to get the appropriate permissions.

108
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:08,360
So let's say minimal
trust, maybe a better name.

109
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,570
You assume a minimal need to know,

110
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:12,560
you will need multi-factor authentication

111
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,930
to provide security in critical tasks,

112
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:16,650
such as super users,

113
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,280
such as permissions that
involve control over,

114
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,431
devices that themselves have
critical security functions.

115
00:05:23,432 --> 00:05:27,330
Zero Trust includes the actions
of logging and verifying

116
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:29,550
and auditing and reviewing those logs.

117
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:31,200
Making sure that what is going on

118
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,570
is what you expect to go on

119
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:34,550
and other processes don't happen.

120
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:36,710
And one of the principles
of Zero Trust very much

121
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:40,510
is to establish and maintain
the separation of duties.

122
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:43,270
We don't wanna have a single individual

123
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:45,873
responsible for too many components.

124
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,770
This involves some changes
to our traditional mindset

125
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:52,120
about information security.

126
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,040
Traditionally, if you were

127
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:59,100
on the private corporate internal network,

128
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,790
it was assumed that everything
there was trustworthy.

129
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:05,500
In the Zero Trust philosophy,
nothing is trusted by default.

130
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,320
We assume that the identities
are who they say they are,

131
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,270
in the Zero Trust world
we verify everything.

132
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:12,530
In fact, in Network Access Control

133
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:14,700
if you attempt to link to a network,

134
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,400
the system, the network
before admitting you

135
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,390
will scan your device to see
if you've got current patches,

136
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,710
you've run an antivirus scan.

137
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:24,609
Your antivirus scan is, they
relatively current and correct

138
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:27,537
and from an approved vendor
and so on and so forth.

139
00:06:27,537 --> 00:06:29,690
You assume that users act responsibly

140
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:30,627
in the traditional security model

141
00:06:30,627 --> 00:06:32,600
and we grouse about the fact that

142
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,580
the user didn't follow a policy

143
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:38,580
or our awareness and training
program isn't working.

144
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:42,530
Well, maybe a better
approach would be to say,

145
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:45,400
users are busy and they
have other things to do,

146
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,630
so while they're gonna do
their best with security,

147
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:51,740
it's not what they're being
evaluated on professionally,

148
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:52,880
it's a component.

149
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,590
And so therefore we're going to nudge them

150
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:57,719
towards not making mistakes.

151
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,060
And finally, in the
traditional security model

152
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:04,950
we try to model, we try to
detect security attack behavior,

153
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:06,500
we look for indications of compromise.

154
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,160
Well, in the Zero Trust philosophy,

155
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,570
we're gonna make it harder for
the attacker to do anything

156
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:14,110
rather than looking for a particular

157
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,800
indication of compromise,

158
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,820
we're gonna put everything
in its own segment

159
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,570
to the extent that that's feasible.

160
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,430
So how do we get there?

161
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:26,820
Well, in order to verify identity,

162
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:29,840
we're gonna rely on
multi-factor authentication.

163
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,060
In order to restrict network access,

164
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:34,520
we're gonna segment, we're gonna use DMZs.

165
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,109
We're gonna be parsimonious

166
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:38,100
about what resources
are available to users

167
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,500
on what networks.

168
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,060
And we're gonna use
applications safe listing

169
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,660
to prevent updates,

170
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,860
to prevent the installation of road code,

171
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:50,720
to close down the
attractiveness or availability

172
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,720
of shadow IT or shadow
cloud or even shadow OT.

173
00:07:55,980 --> 00:08:00,980
Now, this relates to SASE as
a component of Zero Trust.

174
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:07,670
One of the keys of SASE,
secure access service edge.

175
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:10,300
It's a concept that says you're gonna put

176
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,710
security controls in the cloud

177
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:14,397
since that's where most
of what happens goes on.

178
00:08:14,397 --> 00:08:15,610
One of the concepts there

179
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:18,720
is to use a CASB, cloud
access security broker

180
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,350
and a secure web gateway

181
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:23,450
to make sure you know what
applications are being accessed.

182
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:26,159
And going beyond the traditional VPN,

183
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,300
we wanna have application
specific connections.

184
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:33,659
A lot's been written about
why VPNs are not the greatest,

185
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:35,510
why they don't really
solve as many problems

186
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:36,380
they pretend to.

187
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:38,340
I won't go through those arguments now

188
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,460
but it certainly is a topic

189
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:42,610
that we should discuss at some other time.

190
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:44,710
Anyway, so this together
brings Zero Trust,

191
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:47,410
and I've introduced the concept of SASE.

192
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:50,250
And we'll get later into edge computing,

193
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,700
seeing how all this comes together as

194
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:56,470
the next big things roll out,
one of which of course is 5G.

195
00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:00,620
So, why does hybrid cloud need Zero Trust?

196
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,930
That's our next topic and the answer is

197
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:06,010
because there are a lot of
security issues with cloud.

198
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:09,100
New sets of services
coming up all the time,

199
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:13,800
DevSecOps, the sec is often
silent in polite conversation,

200
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,229
increases the speed with
which new apps show up

201
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:18,740
in the environment.

202
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:22,960
These new capabilities
provide new routes of attack

203
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,230
for the bad guys.

204
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:27,550
I'm trying to stay away
from the word hacker.

205
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:28,979
Back in the old days,

206
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:31,540
a hacker was somebody who was very good

207
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:34,219
at solving hard problems with computers.

208
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:37,100
The notion that a hacker
would do so for profit

209
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,768
or reduce so to cause trouble.

210
00:09:39,768 --> 00:09:42,263
So that's a relatively late innovation,

211
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:46,220
so I'm gonna be a little
bit of a curmudgeon and say,

212
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:49,130
the cyber crooks are the
ones we're worried about.

213
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:53,010
There are many teams making
acquisitions in infrastructure.

214
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:56,210
They're making decisions about
security policies sometimes,

215
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:59,490
not even making them explicitly,
making them by default.

216
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:01,550
Experience has shown that the default

217
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:04,189
security posture is inadequate,

218
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:07,180
hence the need for a
Zero Trust environment.

219
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:09,500
Compliance requirements are increasing,

220
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,890
there are legal and regulatory issues

221
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:13,310
that organizations face.

222
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:14,750
These will get stronger,

223
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:18,060
we're beginning to see these
enter even in the world of OT

224
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:21,089
and finally, there are far
too many security tools.

225
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,810
And this is a problem for a lot of folks,

226
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:25,760
I'm gonna deviate from the
agenda just a moment here.

227
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:30,170
Most organizations use about
30% of the capabilities

228
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:33,930
of the information security
tools they have installed today.

229
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:37,800
And the reason is not because
they missed something,

230
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,449
the reason is because
when they bought the tool

231
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:42,300
it was fit for purpose.

232
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,180
And in the intervening months and years

233
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,910
since they installed the tool,

234
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:48,890
the vendor has continued
to add capabilities.

235
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:51,069
So there are a lot of functions

236
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:53,590
in the security products
you've already installed

237
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:57,590
that you probably haven't turned
on, may not have explored.

238
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:58,540
And in some cases,

239
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:01,930
tragically may have actually
bought alternative products

240
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:04,609
to provide a function that
you've already bought, paid for

241
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:06,260
or train your users on.

242
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:08,600
So a lot of challenges for cloud security

243
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,640
is getting more complex.

244
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,250
And this generates a lot
of different pain points,

245
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:17,260
here are some of the ones
that a person managing cloud

246
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,900
will have to worry about,
audit and governance.

247
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:20,900
Where's the data going?

248
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,340
who's operating on it?

249
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,770
If I'm using a SAS based service,

250
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:28,290
are there any residency
requirements about that?

251
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:29,980
There was an issue some years ago,

252
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,530
where an organization was
handling financial data

253
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:36,540
and they had subbed it
out to a SAS provider.

254
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:39,969
And the SAS provider had subbed that out

255
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:41,720
to a team working in a country

256
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,660
that was not on the approved list

257
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:46,520
for the handling of that kind
of financial information.

258
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,550
Well, guess who the problem ends up on?

259
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:52,656
You're not gonna go to the
sub subcontractor and say,

260
00:11:52,657 --> 00:11:54,750
"You have refused that work."

261
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,307
And you're not gonna go to
the subcontractor and say,

262
00:11:57,307 --> 00:11:58,420
"Didn't you know

263
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:01,900
that this data was supposed
to stay in this geography."

264
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,120
No, you're gonna have to look at a mirror

265
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,760
and said, "I didn't make it clear enough."

266
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,937
DevSecOps challenges the
traditional notion of change

267
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:10,540
and release management.

268
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,910
I'm a big fan of iTOL,

269
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:14,110
I'm a big fan of COBIT by the way also

270
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:16,670
but change in release is really the gate

271
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:19,670
by which you get stuff from
the world of development

272
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:23,130
and test and experimentation
into the world of production.

273
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:25,290
And although we've
certainly accelerated it,

274
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:27,630
I surely hope that you have not taken away

275
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:29,230
any of those controls.

276
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:30,800
The controls still need to be in place,

277
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,839
we still need to know
what's going out there.

278
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,340
We still need to be able to go back

279
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,570
to a point in time and say,

280
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:38,700
what set of application functionality

281
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:42,580
and what set of data was
available at a point in time?

282
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:45,440
How can we recreate the environment

283
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,313
that led to this transaction,
leading to that result?

284
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,150
Interesting problem, especially
when the data is not here

285
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:56,930
and the processes are not
here and all we've got

286
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:59,683
is some kind of an audit
or transaction log.

287
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:03,170
The pain points for information security

288
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:08,170
include shadow cloud, include Zero Trust,

289
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:13,580
which related to identity management.

290
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:16,210
The two are not synonymous.

291
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:18,520
The definition of a CASB includes

292
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,569
the notion of identity management.

293
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:24,720
The problem with that definition
is that identity management

294
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,290
is one of those things that we

295
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:29,323
in the high-tech role of
information security call hard.

296
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,989
Identity management is a tough problem

297
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:34,520
and you don't wanna
bundle a piece of it in,

298
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,920
with one other function,

299
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,839
you'd rather have the CASB
light capability interfaced

300
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,610
with a more general
identity management solution

301
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:45,503
that the enterprise
can run, one of global.

302
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,440
Garbage collection is
an interesting problem,

303
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,160
it has real implications for 5G

304
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,069
and I'll get to that later on.

305
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:54,190
There are pain points
associated with procurement

306
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:55,550
and contract admin.

307
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:57,099
How do you know you're
getting what you paid for?

308
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,720
How do you know you're
not paying too much?

309
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,880
How do you know that the acquisition

310
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,720
conformed to your
baseline is for security,

311
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:08,230
for management, for collection
of performance data?

312
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:10,100
Did we really need that bump,

313
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,920
was the transaction level so high

314
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,439
that we had to instantiate
another 20 images

315
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,690
at that point in time?

316
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:19,780
And how long did it take to clear it up?

317
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:22,890
And when people buy cloud on their own,

318
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:26,930
are they conforming to our
procurement guidelines?

319
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:28,010
Well, if they don't know what they are,

320
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:29,939
the answer is probably not.

321
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,250
And if they do know what they are,

322
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:34,660
one of the reasons they went
to shadow cloud was probably

323
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,900
because they didn't wanna go
through all of that stuff,

324
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,353
just like with shadow IT.

325
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,600
Performance capacity
management monitoring,

326
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,110
those issues are generally
harder with (indistinct)

327
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:47,960
because you can't put your
performance monitoring tools

328
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:52,500
into Google's or Azure's
or IBM cloud data center

329
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,210
and have them install them on the servers

330
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:57,890
where your stuff happens to
be running at the moment.

331
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:58,930
And then there are skill

332
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:01,739
and organizational challenges.

333
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:04,070
First one that comes to mind is G,

334
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,810
we moved everything to cloud

335
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:10,780
and saved a lot of money
on servers and storage, G.

336
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:13,610
I'm an employee and I'm kind of expensive.

337
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:16,150
If I take my salary and double it,

338
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:18,209
that's my fully burdened head count cost

339
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:19,850
for this organization.

340
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:23,390
I wonder if they're thinking
about saving money on people,

341
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:26,740
the same way they thought
about saving money on servers.

342
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:29,260
That is, am I likely to be replaced

343
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:32,939
by an outsourced third party individual?

344
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:36,660
And when an organization
takes the step to go to cloud

345
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:39,230
and to go through that and
to declare this success

346
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:42,070
because they downsize their data center,

347
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,620
the people that work in the data center

348
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,130
rightly, are gonna be concerned,

349
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:47,970
well, are they gonna downsize us next?

350
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:50,150
And where do those skills go?

351
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:52,569
Many organizations has
gone so far in cloud,

352
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:54,710
they cannot come back anymore.

353
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:57,230
They no longer have the skills

354
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:59,700
to handle change a release management,

355
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,960
performance and capacity management,

356
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:05,950
the installation and maintenance
of physical hardware.

357
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:09,356
Now, who has responsibility for what?

358
00:16:09,356 --> 00:16:12,930
The people in the organization
may have new duties

359
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,233
that may be rotated
into other assignments.

360
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,640
They now need to know

361
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,420
what constitutes effective performance.

362
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:24,689
Note that Zero Trust
does not enter address

363
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:26,610
most of these capabilities.

364
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,040
And that's the split

365
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:32,290
between where Zero Trust helps
cloud and where it doesn't.

366
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:33,880
There are some problems in other words,

367
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,980
Zero Trust doesn't solve.

368
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,610
So why do you need additional security?

369
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:40,570
Well, we've talked about the
increased range of threats.

370
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:42,450
The pace of attacks is going up.

371
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:44,650
The scope of attacks is increasing

372
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:47,523
and there are the issues I
mentioned with compliance,

373
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,410
payment card industry
standards are still in place.

374
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:55,449
HIPAA regulation, their
GDPR is getting stronger

375
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:57,220
and being enforced more rigorously

376
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,650
and internal audit and
compliance management.

377
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:02,459
Are we really spending the
money we thought correctly?

378
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:06,089
So where does Zero Trust work in cloud?

379
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:09,429
Well, hybrid cloud needs Zero
Trust for identity management.

380
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:11,432
In real time, I got to know who you are

381
00:17:11,432 --> 00:17:14,890
and I got to know what you're
allowed to do right now.

382
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:18,023
That depends on an identity
management infrastructure.

383
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:23,129
Quick bit of history,
we have a few minutes.

384
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:25,490
In the beginning computers
were used to manage money

385
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:29,740
in business, that was the first
use GE, calculated payroll

386
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:34,590
in order to save on the
costs of a line of clerks,

387
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:35,699
rows and rows of clerks

388
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,573
tabulating payroll and so on, manually.

389
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:43,460
Numbers are easy, they are dimensionless,

390
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:47,460
they're simply a quantity,
they don't age, okay?

391
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:50,830
So the fifties and sixties
were about digitization

392
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:53,870
in the sense of handling bucks.

393
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:58,379
The seventies and eighties we
began not just computing bucks

394
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:01,020
but we began computing stuff,

395
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:06,020
things, parts, bill of materials
and its successor database,

396
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,840
bill of materials, bump and d-bump.

397
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,610
Which led to enterprise resource planning,

398
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:12,540
which read the supply chain management.

399
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:15,389
Now, the interesting thing
when you're managing stuff

400
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:18,210
as opposed when you're managing money,

401
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:22,140
is that stuff ages, it wears
out and has a sell by date.

402
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,220
It has a serial number, it has a history

403
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,040
and it has a maintenance requirement.

404
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,620
It has an expiration date maybe.

405
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,280
And it has certain parameters

406
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,320
that may require it to be tuned

407
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,689
and updated at a certain time.

408
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:35,560
So it varies over time

409
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,810
but because these are physical things,

410
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:41,980
they vary with an exponential
decay kind of a curve,

411
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,630
they age at a certain known rate.

412
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,353
In the nineties

413
00:18:45,353 --> 00:18:48,840
we began looking at other
ways we can actually manage

414
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,659
the capabilities of a person,

415
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:55,540
that got us into the issues
of, can I solve single sign on,

416
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:58,200
(indistinct) solve
distributed administration.

417
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,490
Those two things came together
in identity management.

418
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:02,180
The problem with people is

419
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:07,180
people are non-linear and they
very non-linearly over time.

420
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:10,040
You have one job and then
you go through some training

421
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,409
and you go to another job.

422
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:14,320
Well, your permissions don't change.

423
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,950
When you go from one job to another,

424
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:18,430
it's not like you quit and started.

425
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:20,390
There are some tasks
that you gotta finish up

426
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:22,230
before the permission is let go.

427
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:23,770
There are some permissions
you're gonna keep

428
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:25,770
across the transition.

429
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:26,860
There are some new tasks

430
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,169
that you're gonna pick up immediately,

431
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:31,580
other new tasks that you're
not gonna be able to start

432
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,389
until you complete some kind of training

433
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:34,490
or background check.

434
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:36,820
And ultimately there are some
permissions that you have now

435
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:39,929
that will stop the
minute you lose that job.

436
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:43,173
So identity management is
a really complex problem.

437
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,490
Things that are in consistencies

438
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:48,750
may not be inconsistent at all.

439
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:52,820
And so managing identity
is a really hard problem

440
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,879
and doing it across multiple platforms

441
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,020
is incredibly complex tasks.

442
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:59,129
That's why there are
only a couple of vendors

443
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:02,950
that can even do this
anymore, rely on them.

444
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:06,410
Network attacks, big
problem for hybrid cloud

445
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:09,210
because who knows what
networks are involved there.

446
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:12,720
You have a limited set of controls

447
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,070
from your end as the enterprise manager,

448
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,840
as to what's going on

449
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:20,649
and shadow cloud is a
significant problem as well.

450
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:23,430
That's where a user
installs an application

451
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:26,160
and maybe unbeknownst to them,

452
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,530
they end up subscribing to cloud.

453
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:31,160
You put your Apple Watch
on, you bring it to work

454
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,610
and the next thing you know

455
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:36,719
you've got Apple cloud
capabilities on your work machine

456
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,230
because your watch found
its way through Bluetooth

457
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:42,440
to some local access point.

458
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,890
These are tough problems to solve

459
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:48,090
and Zero Trust makes it easier

460
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:52,530
because along the way people,
systems are gonna say,

461
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:53,879
is this permission allowed?

462
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,740
Is this access legitimate

463
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:59,600
given that individuals
requirements and business needs

464
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,033
and current set of authorizations.

465
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:08,260
So what does a Zero Trust not to do

466
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:12,750
and what does hybrid
cloud not need from it?

467
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,830
Well, looking at the security
challenge different way,

468
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:17,629
there's the visibility of
what's going on in the cloud.

469
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:21,580
There's the question, do I
know the rates, the speeds

470
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:26,030
and feeds of my portfolio
of instances right now?

471
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:29,290
Am I able to update
them through compliance?

472
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:33,720
Am I able to secure them as
they come into existence?

473
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:36,350
Do I have the ability to bring up

474
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:38,500
yet another secure instance?

475
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,240
And I'm gonna mention this point again,

476
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:46,173
every cloud instance is perfectly
secure when it's created.

477
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,719
It is only by the intentional acts

478
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,920
of the people working
on that cloud instance,

479
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:57,180
that it is rendered insecure,

480
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:01,920
that it is rendered visible
to unintended persons,

481
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:06,920
that it ends up on the internet
with access to everyone.

482
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:11,530
That is a huge problem.

483
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:13,960
And unfortunately, Zero Trust in itself

484
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,510
does not really address that.

485
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:21,379
If you've said the services
universally accessible,

486
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:26,240
then Zero Trust will diligently
grant universal access.

487
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,640
Now, we'd like to see products
that can nudge and say,

488
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,810
are you really sure

489
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:33,440
you want this to be
accessible by everybody?

490
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,670
Are you really, really
sure you want to be,

491
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:40,420
click here if yes and the
OK button is that big.

492
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:42,180
And that's the kind of human factors

493
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,087
we'll need to get it.

494
00:22:43,087 --> 00:22:46,550
The first people to think
through, what are we really doing?

495
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:49,100
Because what a cloud
builder is thinking about

496
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:51,230
is not about how to secure it.

497
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:53,070
They're trying to help organizations

498
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:55,800
that are doing cloud native,

499
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,840
bringing new stuff to the new world

500
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,959
in these various exciting new forms,

501
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,440
using DevSecOps to drive new
workloads with minimal delay,

502
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,873
going with serverless capabilities.

503
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:11,840
There is a Kubernetes joke
involving the Suez Canal

504
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,250
that I'm not gonna tell

505
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:14,530
but that's on the left side,

506
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:16,600
that's cloud native applications.

507
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,419
Cloud migration is the organization

508
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,990
that's in the process of migrating

509
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:25,290
from a traditional data center
or a blended environment

510
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:29,460
into a hybrid cloud norm,
cloudFast, if you will.

511
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:32,540
It doesn't mean there
won't be anything left,

512
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:34,770
it just means we're gonna be parsimonious

513
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:36,850
at stately and appropriate

514
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:39,980
in our progression from
this here data center

515
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,740
into that there cloud.

516
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:43,090
And then finally on the right,

517
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:44,929
the set of strategic priorities is,

518
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:47,870
are we doing as well as we can do?

519
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:50,370
I'm developing a talk to be
delivered later this year,

520
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:54,459
that actually looks at what
cloud operational excellence is.

521
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:57,990
Back in the nineties Gartner acquired

522
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:00,930
a company called Real Decisions,
they did benchmarking.

523
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:04,160
The goal of Real Decisions
was to help people figure out

524
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:07,120
how efficiently they were
using their data resource,

525
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,020
their processing resource,
their network resource.

526
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:13,230
And what they found was,
generally as a rule of thumb

527
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:18,230
the top 10% were an
order of magnitude better

528
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:23,179
at making use of those
resources than the bottom 10%.

529
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:25,470
Whether it was people or
staff or organization,

530
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:28,390
network hardware, a
software defined networking

531
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:29,990
whether it was software defined storage.

532
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:33,260
Whatever it was, the
difference between good and bad

533
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,940
is an order of magnitude,

534
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:37,380
which means you need to
know what you're good at.

535
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:39,540
And if you wanna use cloud,

536
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:41,620
you don't have the option
of backing out of it,

537
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,600
you've gotta figure out how to get better.

538
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,290
So we need to look at that.

539
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:47,649
Now I gonna dig in a little
bit some vulnerabilities,

540
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:51,240
shadow cloud, the problem
there, texts cheaper than ever.

541
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,490
Just like shadow IT, shadow OT,

542
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:57,840
individuals can purchase capabilities

543
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,740
for very small amounts.

544
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:02,230
Stuff that doesn't even
reach the threshold

545
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:03,640
of a purchasing decision.

546
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:07,660
Stuff that shows up on an
individual's credit card.

547
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:12,650
I use a service to
post-process my audio work,

548
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:17,650
when I do blogs, I pay
$11 and 70 cents a month

549
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:19,230
for that capability.

550
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:21,090
If I had to install the software

551
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:22,730
and train up on the product,

552
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,870
it would be probably
two months of training

553
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:27,889
and hours and hours of
work on the machine.

554
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:30,480
In multi-vendor environments,

555
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,120
digital platforms with
heterogeneous of ours,

556
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:36,070
this is the process of
digital transformation.

557
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:38,500
The fact that you're
gonna have shadow cloud

558
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,890
hanging around there is a real risk.

559
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:43,500
It can become a portal for attack,

560
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:47,060
it can become a path
for exfiltration of data

561
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:50,270
and the existence of these,
whether they're integrated

562
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:53,210
in a full digitally transformed enterprise

563
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:55,900
or whether it's just some
simple SAS application

564
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,900
with a new feature, you don't know,

565
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,420
for sitting inside IT,
is these things happen.

566
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:03,940
You do not know if you've been attacked,

567
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:07,570
if somebody made a mistake, if
it was simply a side effect,

568
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:09,220
you do not know what's going on.

569
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:12,130
Shadow cloud really
puts things in a pause,

570
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:15,690
so, yeah, the first reaction
is can we lock it down?

571
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:17,200
Don't think about perimeters,

572
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,270
think about actions and user needs

573
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:22,250
and what you can do to nudge
them towards correct behavior.

574
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:24,164
And here's the message,

575
00:26:24,164 --> 00:26:27,830
misconfiguration is the
biggest problem you've got.

576
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:31,800
Every cloud instance starts
out perfectly secure,

577
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:36,000
it is converted into an
insecure environment,

578
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,490
following the procedures
that your technical team

579
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:42,670
has well-grooved.

580
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:45,770
So here a big pitch for
process improvement.

581
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:49,960
Here's a big pitch for
first failure analysis.

582
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,680
Here's a big pitch for process innovation

583
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,033
to rectify, to correct
those kinds of issues.

584
00:26:56,850 --> 00:27:00,980
So lastly, I wanna get into
some of the exciting new stuff

585
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:05,840
that's happening, edge
computing, I jumped a slide.

586
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,090
New stuff that's happening,
edge computing, 5G

587
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:11,790
and how SASE, these are
gonna stress hybrid cloud.

588
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:15,629
So what is going on with edge computing?

589
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:17,260
What Moore's law, we all know,

590
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,560
the number of people who think Moore's law

591
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,919
is about 10 doubles every couple of years.

592
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,150
It turns out in reality,

593
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:24,290
there are three flavors of Moore's law,

594
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:27,879
a processor density at
constant cost doubles,

595
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,840
about 18 to 24 months.

596
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,610
Storage density doubles
about every 12 to 15 months,

597
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:38,520
network capacity doubles at a
nine to 12 months frequency.

598
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,353
In other words,

599
00:27:39,353 --> 00:27:41,200
there are three different
flavors of Moore's law.

600
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,910
Let's take a look at the implication

601
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:44,713
of these exponential growth curves.

602
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:48,410
The area I've highlighted
here on the bottom right

603
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:52,840
at months 120, shows that after 10 years

604
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,870
processor capacity has gone up

605
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:56,882
by about a factor of 10.

606
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:02,210
Storage capacity at
constant use has gone up,

607
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:03,770
I'm sorry, (indistinct) a hundred,

608
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:07,040
storage capacity has gone
up by a factor of a thousand

609
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:11,280
and network bandwidth
is 10,000 times greater.

610
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:14,290
That's been our experience
for more than a decade.

611
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:19,290
This means that you no longer
want to have a large computer

612
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:24,640
with resident data, that
is an inefficient model.

613
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,940
What you want to do instead

614
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:31,650
is to move the data to
the relevant processors.

615
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:33,590
Here are the conclusions.

616
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:35,770
Move the data to the relevant processes

617
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:37,830
because large amounts of
data can get there quickly,

618
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:39,449
we've got the bandwidth.

619
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:42,580
Latency is still a problem
for time applications.

620
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:47,010
So you wanna have the processor
is close to the action,

621
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:49,240
close to the devices
that are being managed.

622
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:52,170
Think self-driving cars,
think V to V environments

623
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:55,420
or V to E inside of crowded cities.

624
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:58,930
You wanna have lots of
data globally available.

625
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:01,450
You wanna move that data
to nearby processes,

626
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:02,880
those are edge machines.

627
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,180
It may persist there, it may not.

628
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:07,400
Note that interestingly enough,

629
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,630
edge computing partially solves

630
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:11,690
the problem of the outer join.

631
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:12,820
If you don't remember

632
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:15,750
what the outer joined
problem is, go in piece,

633
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:17,350
it was a tough thing

634
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:20,790
basically from the day
that SQL was invented.

635
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:24,330
So what SASE does is it says,

636
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:26,879
let's recognize the reality
of the new environment,

637
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:32,030
securing the establishment inside,

638
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:34,483
solves less than half the problem.

639
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:38,680
More people are doing work
off enterprise and enterprise.

640
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,320
More workloads are running

641
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,340
in various forms of
infrastructure as a service,

642
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:45,100
then in the enterprise data center.

643
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:47,850
More apps are consumed via SAS.

644
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:51,399
More data is located out the enterprise,

645
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,210
more traffic for public cloud

646
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:54,710
than the enterprise data center

647
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:58,770
and more traffic then for
branches heading to the cloud.

648
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:01,730
We are not a centralized organization.

649
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:03,830
There's a vestigial data center

650
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:05,480
at the enterprise headquarters

651
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,120
but everything is outside.

652
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,879
So protecting the perimeter
from an internal set of controls

653
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,870
is gonna miss me most of the action.

654
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:14,943
So we wanna get from SASE to Zero Trust.

655
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:20,030
SASE was defined in 2019,

656
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:22,800
a lot of vendors have
jumped on the bandwagon.

657
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,100
A lot of people are more confused

658
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:26,060
that's why we went
through the introduction,

659
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:27,663
secure access service edge.

660
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,400
Zero Trust is you never trust,

661
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:35,740
it's not focused on a particular
tool, it's a philosophy,

662
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:37,440
it's a design principle.

663
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,650
SASE on the other hand

664
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:42,330
is directly related to taking advantage

665
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:44,659
of security based right in the cloud.

666
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,730
The SASE vendors,

667
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:49,840
themselves will identify
themselves as SASE

668
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,899
and it must be deployed by a
cloud provider in the cloud.

669
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:58,900
So SASE is a instantiation of Zero Trust.

670
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:02,480
The common goal is to secure the business

671
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,740
with contact sensitive and
identity based policy management.

672
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:09,060
Zero Trust does that
generally as a design,

673
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:12,230
SASE does that specifically
as a particular dimension.

674
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:15,300
You can compare vendors of SASE products.

675
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:18,639
You cannot compare
discussions of Zero Trust,

676
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,180
except on terms of
intellectual completeness.

677
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:24,543
One last task I mentioned
is, I wanna get through this,

678
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:29,020
it's a detailed problem but
it goes back a long way.

679
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:31,050
John McCarthy in 1960

680
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:33,510
identified a problem
called garbage collection.

681
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:37,629
The programming language
lisp would operate

682
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:40,330
by defining trees and then pruning trees

683
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:42,850
for branches that were not needed.

684
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:44,439
The garbage collection problem

685
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:49,190
was these pruned branches
were not associated

686
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:53,440
with a potential free
space, storage location.

687
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:57,220
And therefore, they had to be dealt with

688
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:58,923
asynchronously and offline.

689
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,860
The problem was kind of solved

690
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:04,500
but all of us remember the days

691
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,310
when certain machines had to be restarted

692
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:09,169
after a few days or a week

693
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:14,170
because got jammed up, you
didn't have available storage.

694
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:17,229
Well, the garbage collection problem

695
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:19,720
is gonna to be coming
back in a big way with 5G.

696
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:24,720
The reason is, 5G is going to
be creating new cloud images,

697
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:30,730
new networks dynamically, new
storage spaces dynamically

698
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:33,840
and new suites of applications dynamically

699
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,899
for each user of a 5G phone,

700
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:38,880
for each machine that is
relying on a 5G set of services.

701
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,810
And those that move around,

702
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:43,470
for user walking through a city center,

703
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:48,350
they will be jumping from one
suite of cloud-based services

704
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:49,560
to another suite.

705
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:54,540
They will be crossing a
boundary every few hundred yards

706
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:57,389
and that entire stack
will have to be torn down

707
00:32:57,390 --> 00:33:00,720
and reinstated in the new environment.

708
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,570
The problem isn't cleaning
up the cloud remnants,

709
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:06,179
we got that down.

710
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:11,160
The problem is the metadata,
the tables that tell you

711
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,800
what's the number of the next instance.

712
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:18,800
What's the total number of available slots

713
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:23,620
to handle instances of a
particular application.

714
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:28,340
When those tables fill up,
then things go haywire.

715
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:33,340
We saw two years ago when
satellites rolled their counters,

716
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:35,830
we saw it again in the
last year and a half,

717
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:39,240
when certain aircraft
have to be cold rebooted

718
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,960
after about 140 hours of service.

719
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:45,340
we saw it when certain
printers started to fail

720
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:47,659
because they had exhausted some counters.

721
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:50,060
It wasn't because they
had data hanging around

722
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:52,760
is because the metadata didn't exist.

723
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,900
And that problem is not gonna go away,

724
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:57,930
it's gonna get significantly worse

725
00:33:57,930 --> 00:34:00,350
because of the presence of 5G driving

726
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:03,600
the rapid creation and
sanitation to take down

727
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,080
of all these new cloud environments.

728
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,103
So what have we learned today?

729
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:12,980
First of all, define your
processes and procedures,

730
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:15,530
refine them, clarify them, audit them

731
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:16,810
and then automate them.

732
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:18,889
Make sure you put the controls early

733
00:34:18,889 --> 00:34:22,783
in the development and
integration life cycle.

734
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:26,460
Consider boosting the strength

735
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:27,909
of your identity management program,

736
00:34:27,909 --> 00:34:30,520
identity centric security can not be done

737
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:33,409
on a domain specific basis,
it has to be universal.

738
00:34:33,409 --> 00:34:35,270
Take a look at the gap analysis

739
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:38,650
for infrastructure and operations,
functions for governance.

740
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:41,270
Ask senior leadership who does this,

741
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:42,739
they give you a name.

742
00:34:42,739 --> 00:34:46,069
Ask the it organization
does so-and-so do this,

743
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:47,179
who does this?

744
00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:49,516
And then look at the gaps and
say, what do I need to fix it?

745
00:34:49,516 --> 00:34:51,629
You gotta know what
software you're running,

746
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:53,880
including stuff that's been rented

747
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,159
not just stuff you built yourself

748
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:57,569
or stuff you purchased long-term.

749
00:34:57,570 --> 00:34:59,870
Make sure you align your procurement

750
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:02,150
with the informal buying centers,

751
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:05,050
provide information, provide guidance

752
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:06,640
and upgrade your tool set.

753
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,400
See what your vendor
capabilities are lying there

754
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:12,430
that you haven't been aware
were added to technology

755
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:14,640
you bought three, four or five years ago.

756
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,069
Take a look at SASE as an
evolutionary step forward,

757
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:20,070
as a way to protect your enterprise

758
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:24,310
as it becomes more cloud-based
and less enterprise-centric.

759
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:28,270
And take a look at Zero
Trust network architecture,

760
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:30,430
get rid of the notion of a perimeter.

761
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:32,149
Consider how you would pilot that

762
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:33,680
and consider bringing in somebody

763
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,520
from the industrial control
systems and OT sides

764
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:40,090
because they're thinking that
the perimeter will save them.

765
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:43,260
Make sure you architect your
solution one step at a time.

766
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:47,540
I don't want you to put
it down and fall apart

767
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:50,140
and have to start over from scratch.

768
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:52,900
Piecemeal doesn't work, make
sure you've got a solid plan.

769
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:57,900
So I would like to share
these references with you.

770
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:03,960
The paper by McCarthy from
1960 is right there at the top,

771
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:06,650
documents on SASE and cloud are available.

772
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:08,630
And I'll be happy to take questions,

773
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:11,580
put them in the chat and I will
be answering them as we go.
