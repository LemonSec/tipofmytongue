00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:03,900
- Hello everyone and
welcome to our presentation

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:05,750
at this year's RSA Conference.

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:09,560
Hello from Vienna, unfortunately
we cannot be there with you

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:13,280
this year in San Francisco
for our presentation.

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,329
My name is Daniel, I'm here
with my colleague Madita.

6
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:19,380
And we will give you a little lecture

7
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,660
and a little talk about rebel talents

8
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:27,400
and how you can use their
rule-breaking nature for good

9
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,942
in cyber security.

10
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,460
Let's start off with this quote

11
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,670
that has been floating
around the back of our minds

12
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,163
for quite a while now.

13
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:40,270
It inspired us for this talk

14
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:42,430
and it's a pretty good quote

15
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:45,140
that I personally like very much.

16
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:48,070
Because sometimes in my professional life

17
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:49,230
and in my personal experience,

18
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:53,080
I've been this kind of fool
that is referenced here.

19
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,190
And I just did things
that other people told me

20
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:57,300
were impossible, and nobody could do them.

21
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,163
And this is actually
where our journey begins.

22
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:05,239
In Europe, especially
my personal experience

23
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:08,300
between living in the US and Europe,

24
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:11,800
has been that in Europe,
especially but not only there,

25
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,310
people tend to admire the problem

26
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,973
much rather than the solution.

27
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,230
This sounds a bit weird

28
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:22,050
but sometimes we're way too
much focused on the problem

29
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:25,220
and not really thinking
about the solution.

30
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:29,240
And that's why people
don't even start thinking

31
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,039
of how could they wander
off the beaten path

32
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,793
and maybe think of a new solution
to an established problem.

33
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:40,030
So what is our talk today about?

34
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:42,160
Not only are we total meme experts,

35
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,649
and we wanna make it a little
bit more fun for you guys.

36
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:49,260
But also we wanna give you a sense

37
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:53,250
of that not only the technical
world might be our enemy,

38
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,610
but also we as a security community

39
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:59,650
can sometimes be our own
enemy without knowing it.

40
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:00,713
And yeah.

41
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:07,440
- That's why we would like
to take you on a pirate ship

42
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:11,310
and on a journey until we reach new lands.

43
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:14,120
We're going to get into this pirates,

44
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,570
and different types of
pirates a little bit later.

45
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:22,329
But what is the thing or
what is the rebel types

46
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:25,190
and what are the problems

47
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:28,520
that we have seen within
security projects?

48
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:32,185
And Daniel would you be so
kind to switch the slide?

49
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:33,180
(Madita chuckles)

50
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:36,600
So the contents of today's talk are,

51
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,910
first of all that we
are going to talk about

52
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:41,993
those rebel talents and their types.

53
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:47,830
Then we are going to tell
you or tell some stories,

54
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:51,670
war stories of known industry problems

55
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:54,220
caused by always sticking
to the beaten path

56
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,763
as Daniel already said.

57
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,820
Then we would like to give you a guide

58
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:02,170
on how to solve these problems
based on rebel talents.

59
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:07,170
And for the last, we would
like to give you some insights

60
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,023
on how to manage a team,

61
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:12,929
to get to unleash their
inner rebel talents

62
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:17,930
and to get the most of a
successful project you can have.

63
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:20,683
So who we are, as Daniel already said.

64
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:24,320
This is Daniel, who is actually a pirate.

65
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,519
We are going to talk about
that a little bit later.

66
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,110
And this is me, Madita, I'm a climber.

67
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:32,700
We're both working for
KPMG Cyber Security Team

68
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,290
here in Austria, Vienna.

69
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:38,100
And get in touch with us if you want to,

70
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:43,010
you can see our LinkedIn URLs down there.

71
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:46,959
So lessons from the field vulnerability

72
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,200
and patch management.

73
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,750
I think every security team
here knows that there's,

74
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:55,050
or knows such projects
that customers come to us.

75
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:58,470
And we have experienced
lots of these projects

76
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,850
in the past years.

77
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:02,430
And this is also just like a pirates,

78
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:03,890
where the pirate journey begins.

79
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:08,679
Who doesn't know that actually
in any security industries

80
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,173
there are vulnerabilities everywhere.

81
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:13,733
Next slide please.

82
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,750
And we want to set, if
you're just thinking again

83
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:22,330
of this pirate ship, we want
to set to get on this journey,

84
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:24,280
but before we can get to this journey

85
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,440
and to find many many treasures,

86
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,300
for example, in the
Caribbean sea, just imagine,

87
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,490
usually we are the ones preaching

88
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:33,750
that you need to patch your systems.

89
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,860
So it's our security engineers
telling the customers

90
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,490
and the team within the customers.

91
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:40,980
But before we hit the sea,

92
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,070
we realized that we cannot even start

93
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:45,120
because we don't have a map where to go.

94
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,140
So the problem doesn't
start with patching.

95
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:51,250
Mostly we do not even know which systems

96
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,853
we even have to patch.

97
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,770
And even if we finally
make it out of the harbor,

98
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:58,680
there's still people on the boat

99
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,670
who think that we don't
make it because it's too far

100
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:05,850
or there could be storms or
they can even be monsters.

101
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:07,560
Although they acknowledge

102
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,350
that there are actually no
monsters and they do not exist.

103
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:13,660
They're still staying afraid of them.

104
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,040
And this pretty much summarizes

105
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,400
every vulnerability management project

106
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,700
that we have experienced
in the past years,

107
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:23,830
that there are many people
who see no perspective.

108
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:26,729
They do not acknowledge
failure, they have no trust.

109
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:30,080
They're pretty much stressed
out, they have no hope.

110
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,729
And they always think that
the mountain is where to hide.

111
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:36,390
Yeah, people lose faith.

112
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:39,520
People actually want to go
back to the safe harbor,

113
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,662
because it's not convenient for them.

114
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,700
- So we have been wrecking
our brains for quite a while

115
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,580
on how to solve this problem.

116
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:53,490
And for, after long, long
discussions that we internally had

117
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:57,480
we figured out, and by now
you might have guessed this,

118
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,650
but it was quite a journey

119
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,780
to finally wrap our heads around it,

120
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:04,609
and to really grasp the
full extent of the problem.

121
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:07,470
It's rather a psychological
and social problem,

122
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:10,910
more than a technical problem, actually.

123
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:14,200
And after discussing various way

124
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,260
on how to encounter these problems

125
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:19,580
and to finally get teams
to actually start patching

126
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,070
and start fixing problems.

127
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:24,409
We encountered a great book
that we would reference later,

128
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:26,160
that describes the rebel talents

129
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,623
that we keep on circling around so far.

130
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:35,560
There are rebel types and
we need all of them to,

131
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,907
for our journey on our little sailing ship

132
00:06:39,906 --> 00:06:44,340
to reach our treasures
that we want to have,

133
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:47,409
and we need to embrace our
talents and those types,

134
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:49,740
until we reach a new land.

135
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,590
Because if not, we will
just go back to the harbor

136
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:54,380
and always for the rest of our lives

137
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:57,260
think about those treasures
that we could have gotten

138
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:01,513
when we only would have made
it to the Caribbean finally.

139
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:06,350
So, what are these rebel talents
that we're talking about?

140
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:10,040
So, big thanks goes out to
Harvard business professor

141
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,960
Francesca Gino, who inspired this model

142
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,299
that we're now referencing.

143
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:18,090
And she has written a
great book on this topics.

144
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:21,320
Please, please go out
and read it for yourself.

145
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:24,500
But in a nutshell, we
have four different types

146
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:29,500
and they actually have
different specialties

147
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:32,620
and different characters
as you might've guessed.

148
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:37,250
But their whole point is
they have different abilities

149
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,870
to break certain rules

150
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:42,160
and to look beyond the obvious things.

151
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,420
And some of them are better

152
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,710
in resisting against external pressures.

153
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:48,960
Some of them are better
against internal pressures.

154
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,310
By pressures, (indistinct).

155
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:57,320
And there's the most extreme
example of a rebel talent,

156
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:01,150
which is incidentally my rebel talent

157
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:02,669
that was attributed to me.

158
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:04,990
Also, you can't see her,

159
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:06,510
but Madita is really laughing about it

160
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:10,349
because when we first
figured out our rebel talent

161
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:13,390
by doing this little
test that Francesca Gino

162
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:14,473
has come up with.

163
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,060
Kind of everybody expected me

164
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,520
to be that kind of pirate type.

165
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,022
And it turns out, yeah,
actually it is true.

166
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:23,940
So what is a pirate?

167
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,900
A pirate is somebody who's ready to go

168
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,799
to the uncharted seas.

169
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,280
He's the fearless pirate,

170
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:33,089
he's resisting to external pressures.

171
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:35,179
Both internal and external.

172
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:37,579
He is the authentic kind of type,

173
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,500
always standing his ground.

174
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,750
He's able to show his
weaknesses or her weaknesses.

175
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:47,060
And he can connect with all
kinds of different people

176
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,792
if he or she wants to.

177
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:54,910
He's the classic rebel rule
breaker kind of a person

178
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,960
who immediately sees a rule
to be broken for success

179
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,053
and just goes on doing it.

180
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:06,600
Then we have the traveler.

181
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:11,090
The traveler is the kind
of free spirit person,

182
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:13,010
who's always interested
in meeting new people

183
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,120
and personalities.

184
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,870
Always up for sharing some
experience, telling stories,

185
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:21,100
sit around the campfire.

186
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,980
And this is especially strong
against external pressures.

187
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:27,163
He really doesn't like to be
held back by somebody else.

188
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:33,380
Also able to inspire other people

189
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,140
and also very focused
on breaking the rules

190
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:43,163
when there is success
looming on the horizon.

191
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:48,829
Then we have the climber,
so Madita's type.

192
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:51,260
And also this was no surprise to our team

193
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:53,463
when the results came in.

194
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:57,610
She's the one and the climber type persons

195
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:59,370
are the ones seeing problems

196
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:01,640
from all different kinds of angles.

197
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,630
They, funny enough, are
described in the book

198
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:07,670
and in the literature to
that as the natural rebels.

199
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:10,770
They have a strong urge for novelty.

200
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:15,750
They are very challenging to
beaten paths and patterns.

201
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,660
Always looking for new
ways of solving a problem.

202
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:23,660
And the drive really to
explore unfamiliar things.

203
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,770
They are the ones looking
behind the obvious,

204
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:30,380
and have a lot of ability to adapt.

205
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:33,010
And lastly, we have the guard.

206
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:36,960
He's the, or she's the weakest of the four

207
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,530
in terms of resisting pressures,

208
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:42,490
because this is that
person you want to have,

209
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:45,170
once you found a treasure to keep it safe

210
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:49,479
and nobody takes something
out of the treasure trove

211
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,763
before it's evenly distributed
between the team members.

212
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:56,010
That's the person that appreciates orders

213
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:58,270
and likes routines and traditions

214
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:00,410
and has a deep respect for others.

215
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:03,360
Is comfortable also with
missing opportunities

216
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,810
that when a rule presents
itself, standing against that.

217
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:12,530
And all of these talents are
necessary for expedition.

218
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:16,829
A pirate treasure hunt in the Caribbean.

219
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:18,670
All of these are necessary also

220
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:20,150
for a cyber security project.

221
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:23,270
And usually when you look at project teams

222
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:24,650
and our security teams

223
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:27,959
you will find all of
these different types.

224
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:32,960
And the next thing that
Francesca mentions in her book

225
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:36,940
are five rebel talents.

226
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:40,570
And the four types that you presents

227
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:45,330
that I've just shown to
you are really fun types,

228
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,920
and you can play around with those.

229
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,329
And the really interesting thing,

230
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:53,140
but for teams are those five talents.

231
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:56,250
And you have to keep
a close watch of those

232
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,510
for your project.

233
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:02,510
Because if you have a problem
and you need to fix it,

234
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:05,490
and it has been around for quite a while,

235
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:07,110
you need novelty in your team.

236
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:09,600
You need people with an urge for novelty.

237
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,740
You have to question the status quo.

238
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:14,650
No problem is impossible to solve.

239
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:18,970
This is just not an acceptable
position for people there.

240
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:20,520
You just have to put your mind to it

241
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,100
and figure out a smart way of doing it.

242
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:27,000
Yes, in the end, it might
not be feasible to go there,

243
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,080
but I've never encountered a problem

244
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,793
that was really impossible to solve.

245
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:38,170
Also, what you need to do in fostering

246
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:40,459
that all ideas are valuable.

247
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:43,310
So nobody needs to just hold back

248
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:47,050
because they think that
these are not worth it

249
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:50,240
or not worth to be heard in a team.

250
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:55,240
Next rebel talent that you
need to pay close attention to

251
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,240
is curiosity.

252
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,640
Facilitate for your teams

253
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,449
if you're faced with problems there.

254
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,610
An atmosphere of curiosity,

255
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:07,493
idea sharing is really important.

256
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:12,423
Also give people space to
explain their thinking.

257
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:18,100
The next rebel talent I wanna
give to you and present to you

258
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,570
is perspective.

259
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:21,900
Give your teams a new perspective.

260
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,990
Every (indistinct) management problem

261
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:26,270
to stay with that example,

262
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:29,490
starts with tens of
thousands of vulnerabilities.

263
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:31,740
But the remediation nonetheless starts

264
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,350
with actually applying patches.

265
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:36,950
And you have to actually
start your journey

266
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:39,360
before you can reach the top.

267
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,650
Some of you might've seen the
talk that we gave last year

268
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:45,810
at RSA Asia Pacific and
we were talking about

269
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:47,869
the security vulnerability mountain.

270
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:52,380
Also there, you have to start
at the very lowest point

271
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,543
of the mountain to finally get to the top.

272
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,089
Last but,

273
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:01,960
not last, but next to last
but not least important

274
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,880
is diversity,

275
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:07,130
Break that bias that
problems are unsolvable.

276
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:10,900
Bring in new people, new
outside help, new ideas.

277
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:14,370
Other types of personalities
to the project team

278
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:17,220
or to just the idea sharing sessions

279
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:21,680
and embrace that other people
and other personalities

280
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,020
have other views on problems.

281
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:27,569
Don't just limit yourself to what you know

282
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:31,690
and what you've come
across to like and cherish.

283
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:33,450
Also try out new things

284
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:37,060
and try to gain a diverse point of view.

285
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:40,030
Also, don't forget fun
and joy and creativity

286
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:44,520
always thrives with fun
and joy, in that respect.

287
00:14:48,069 --> 00:14:51,780
Last point on this list also not least is

288
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,420
let people be authentic,
let people be themselves.

289
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:00,910
Culturally diverse teams
are more successful

290
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:05,140
in solving problems
than non diverse teams.

291
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:07,590
That has been proven in so much research

292
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:08,780
over the last couple of years.

293
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,720
Let people be themselves.

294
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,720
Embrace that everybody in
their perspective culture

295
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:20,080
and way of approaching problems.

296
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,363
Encouraged them to think outside the box.

297
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,739
- So this was a very brief
introduction to the rebel talents

298
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,730
and the five creative rebels.

299
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:36,700
And on the left side of the
next slide, you see a pirate

300
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,970
and you can imagine this
is most of the time Daniel

301
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:42,320
in our (indistinct) projects.

302
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,200
Wu says your argument isn't invalid.

303
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:49,500
And on the right side, this
is a pretty much the solution

304
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,150
for actually every
(indistinct) management project

305
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:54,470
we've seen as Daniel has already said.

306
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:57,650
And he's laughing a lot
right now. (chuckles)

307
00:15:57,650 --> 00:16:02,350
Baby steps are key and the thing is that,

308
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:04,780
remediation starts with the first patch

309
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,694
and this pretty much sums up

310
00:16:06,694 --> 00:16:09,000
(indistinct) management project.

311
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,430
Yeah, what was back in the old days,

312
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:14,709
going with the pirate ship
from Europe to the Caribbean

313
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:16,010
to find some treasures

314
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:19,939
is now working in cyber security
these days for us as well.

315
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:24,940
So the nutritional facts
for cyber security is,

316
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,940
besides passion, determination, creativity

317
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:32,940
and critical thinking, what
was also discussed with Daniel

318
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:37,069
and the rebel talents
right now, is hard work.

319
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:41,060
And if you want to find treasures,

320
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:44,699
if it's treasures or today
if it's find vulnerabilities

321
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,083
and even patching,

322
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:49,700
back in the years they
did it maybe with rum.

323
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,930
Now we do it with caffeine and coffee.

324
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:54,569
So it's a hell of a work,

325
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:58,090
but it's a hard work that
really, really pays off.

326
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:01,020
And this is actually a good ingredient

327
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,860
for a successful security project,

328
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:07,859
besides there's also most
important, great leadership.

329
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:12,040
Keep your crew motivated
for this long journey,

330
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,782
because it's a long journey.

331
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:17,639
If you take the next slide, Daniel,

332
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:21,119
of course it's not like being
a bear, hunting. (chuckles)

333
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:24,500
Hunting people, of course, we mean another

334
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,390
rule of motivation.

335
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:30,580
And yeah, keep your
crew motivated as long,

336
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:33,879
because this is what
resilience also means.

337
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,650
And this is actually also the topic

338
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:39,010
for this year's conference.

339
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:44,010
- So for us, what is really
important for you to take away

340
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:47,110
from this talk and we will
spend quite some more slides

341
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:51,639
on this topic, but for you,
what we wanna give back to you

342
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,060
out there in the audience is,

343
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:57,669
you should look for inspiring
that kind of rebel leadership

344
00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:00,963
that Francesca Gino's
talking about in her book.

345
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,689
Quick question, just
answer it for yourself.

346
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:08,220
Did you read the little
tagline down there?

347
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,393
Because I always do.

348
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,790
Also something, not a takeaway

349
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:15,820
that would be important for you.

350
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:19,389
Don't always admire the
problem, admire the solution.

351
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:22,980
And for the start of your
journey, really any journey,

352
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,960
any solution is a good solution.

353
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,620
In order to get to the Caribbean,

354
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,939
there's a general
direction you have to sail.

355
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:32,450
You don't really need to
know the exact coordinates.

356
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:34,770
You pretty much need from,

357
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:36,670
imagine yourself being somewhere in Spain

358
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:38,300
and you wanna go, I don't know,

359
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,899
somewhere in the general
direction of the Caribbean,

360
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:43,929
you should go West probably.

361
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:46,350
So this will be your first solution.

362
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:49,490
A lot of the things you can
figure out along the way,

363
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:51,090
but if you never leave the harbor,

364
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:56,090
you will most definitely
never reach the Caribbean.

365
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,879
Unless finally, there's a kind
of hyper loop we don't know,

366
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,280
or the enterprise finally come through

367
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,623
and we are able to beam
ourselves to the Caribbean.

368
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,473
Yeah,

369
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,560
I already said that.

370
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,770
What are the takeaways
from today's session?

371
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:17,520
You can start off by figuring
out your own rebel type.

372
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,412
And this is really just to have
some fun play around with it

373
00:19:21,412 --> 00:19:24,010
and go to the website
or you use the QR code.

374
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:25,900
I promise this is a security conference,

375
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,603
no, this not a phishing attempt.

376
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:33,478
I guarantee you this leads you
to Francesca Gino's website

377
00:19:33,478 --> 00:19:36,320
rebeltalents.org, where you
can take a little survey

378
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,340
and it's just a little fun to be ahead

379
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,312
with those rebel talent.

380
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:45,700
If we would be in our office
right now, on a daily basis,

381
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,370
I probably would just wear
a pirate hat around all day.

382
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:51,360
And especially the
carnival season in Europe,

383
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,469
that would be something
I would definitely do.

384
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:56,750
Unfortunately, we cannot
be in the office right now,

385
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:59,450
but I'm really looking forward

386
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:02,873
to next year's carnival season with that.

387
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:07,280
Yeah, also here on the left-hand side,

388
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,193
the KitKat thing this is totally me.

389
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:15,112
Yeah, I really can relate
to this. (chuckles)

390
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,560
This is just for your amusement,

391
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,480
this is not a content slide.

392
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:22,070
I'm sure by now you have
spent hours and hours

393
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:25,780
in RSA presentation and this
should just give you a little

394
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,913
chuckle on the side.

395
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:31,570
Something that other people have told us

396
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:34,379
that really helps them to
embrace their rebel talents,

397
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,910
their inner rebel talents,

398
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:39,910
especially if you are starting
off in the guard area,

399
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:43,460
is to do a little
rebellious thing every day.

400
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,730
So what have you done rebellious today?

401
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:48,010
Where have you embraced
you're inner rebel today?

402
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:51,290
Have you changed up
your breakfast schedule

403
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:54,540
or did you take a different route to work?

404
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:57,700
If we ever get to go back to our offices

405
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,733
via public transport or cars.

406
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:05,233
Those little things also make up a rebel.

407
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:09,100
Yeah, until we reach new lands,

408
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:12,669
finally, we should arrive
at our treasure trove

409
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:16,843
and we'll be rewarded for our journey.

410
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,030
Those are the rebel talents.

411
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:25,243
If you don't remember
them, there they are.

412
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,350
We have the pirate, the
traveler, the climber,

413
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,842
and the guard.

414
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:35,910
Let me end with this slide on
our content side of things.

415
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:40,330
Don't let your teams and
organizations be too nice

416
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:43,580
by unseemingly unsolvable problems.

417
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,850
Join the rebel alliance today,

418
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:47,709
if you're a "Star Wars" person.

419
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:49,503
Join the rebel alliance today.

420
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,253
And yeah,

421
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:58,130
finally again, I was mentioning
or we were mentioning

422
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:00,423
the book all over our talk.

423
00:22:01,376 --> 00:22:04,910
A big thank you for Francesca
Gino's work at Harvard,

424
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:05,840
check out the book.

425
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,570
Also, there's a really great podcast

426
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:10,909
when she was interviewed
by the A16Z podcast,

427
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:14,410
which is also a really good
source of those kinds of things.

428
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:18,540
If you have the time check it out, yeah.

429
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:21,322
Thank you for your time.

430
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:24,180
We had a lot of fun.

431
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:27,640
Hopefully we can be
there in person next year

432
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,380
in San Francisco with you guys,

433
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,720
maybe we'll see each other there.

434
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,803
Thank you for your participation.

435
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,030
We will be available in
the chat for any questions

436
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:40,910
if you might have.

437
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:43,993
Thank you and have a good
rest of the conference.
