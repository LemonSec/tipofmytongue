1
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:02,880
- Good day, everyone.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,510
And welcome to RSA conference 2021,

3
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:08,740
session ID SAT W11.

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:10,730
Strengthening Resilience of Positioning,

5
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:12,830
Navigation and Timing Services.

6
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:14,080
My name is Jim McCarthy

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,640
and I'm a Senior Security Engineer

8
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,390
at the National Institute of Standards

9
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:20,220
and Technology or NIST.

10
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,479
And I'm accompanied by
my colleague, Jim Platt,

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,090
the Chief of Strategic Defense Initiatives

12
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:27,530
at the US department of Homeland security,

13
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:31,910
the Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Agency, or CISA.

14
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:34,480
We want to take the
opportunity to thank RSA

15
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,410
for allowing us to convey
this message to the public,

16
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:39,480
which we believe is an important one.

17
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,589
There's an executive order,

18
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,720
that's backing up all of
the federal governments

19
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,250
that are federal government efforts

20
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,520
that are taking place in this area.

21
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,860
So strengthening resilience
to position navigation

22
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:50,310
and timing services,

23
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:52,730
or increasing the
responsibly use of position,

24
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:54,099
navigation and timing services

25
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,950
is based of an executive order

26
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:58,260
that came out about a year ago.

27
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,260
We're gonna do this
presentation in two parts.

28
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,339
First, Jim Platt is going
to be walking through

29
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,080
a high level overview

30
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,426
of the threat environment regarding PNT,

31
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:09,479
some of the actions that
government's already taking.

32
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,393
And then finally,

33
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:14,570
I will come in later and talk
about a specific document

34
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:17,639
or specific efforts that
are in the executive order

35
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,120
that are provided to the public

36
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,320
to reduce the risk of any disruption

37
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,449
or manipulation of PNT services.

38
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:26,370
Jim, thanks a lot.

39
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:27,700
And go ahead please.

40
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,620
- Thanks, Jim, I appreciate
the introduction there.

41
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:31,670
Some of you may be wondering

42
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:33,070
what the problem is with position,

43
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:34,220
navigation and timing,

44
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,410
and why we would need an executive order.

45
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:37,630
While there was recently an article

46
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:40,030
within the wall street journal

47
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:43,340
that talked about America
having a GPS problem.

48
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,520
And it's not that the GPS has a problem.

49
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,229
It's the problem that
the US is in the world

50
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:52,980
to be tell the truth has a
problem overdependence of GPS.

51
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,040
So what we'd like to do

52
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,170
is talk about that over
dependence GPS and PNT services,

53
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:58,360
how it's become integrated

54
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,790
within our critical infrastructure

55
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:03,790
and steps that you can take to
help us address this problem.

56
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,890
As Jim mentioned,

57
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,240
back in February 12th of 2020,

58
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:15,240
President Trump signed the
executive order number 13905,

59
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,840
which is strengthening the resilience

60
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,370
of US critical infrastructure

61
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:20,660
through the responsible
use of position navigation

62
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,190
and timing services.

63
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,910
And the idea here was that

64
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:28,160
we would promote a responsible
use of PNT services.

65
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,850
And I'll get into that in just a second

66
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:32,829
about what a responsible
use of PNT services is.

67
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:33,810
And in many cases,

68
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:34,643
it's much easier

69
00:02:34,643 --> 00:02:37,840
to demonstrate what an
irresponsible use of position,

70
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,150
navigation and timing services.

71
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,400
And the idea behind this,

72
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,030
is should we lose positioning,

73
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,570
navigation timing services provided by GPS

74
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:48,320
or other global navigational
satellite systems

75
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,829
that there would be a mental impact

76
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,970
for US critical infrastructure.

77
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:56,320
A 2018 study by the
Department of Commerce,

78
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,250
indicated that the loss of GPS

79
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:01,510
could have a $1 billion a day impact

80
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:03,829
on critical on the US economy.

81
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:06,260
So the focus is executive order is valued

82
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,739
on critical infrastructure,

83
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:08,573
but as we know,

84
00:03:08,573 --> 00:03:09,680
our critical infrastructure

85
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,460
is becoming more and
more digitized every day.

86
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,560
And that is why we're here talking today

87
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,150
to the people in RSA,

88
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:18,530
because we believe this
is a security problem

89
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:21,030
that needs to be addressed
moving into the future.

90
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:26,063
So why now?

91
00:03:26,063 --> 00:03:27,220
Why GPS?

92
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:29,460
Or why PNT, and why now?

93
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:30,670
If you take a look on this screen,

94
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,679
you see just some of the applications

95
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,450
that use position, navigation
and timing services.

96
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:37,230
And many people don't even realize

97
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,899
that they are using them on a daily basis.

98
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:40,970
On the left-hand side,

99
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,010
we have things that everybody's
pretty familiar with.

100
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:44,810
With position navigation and timing,

101
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:48,030
you see people out
surveying with GPS devices.

102
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:51,000
We have our national
airspace is being controlled

103
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,800
by GPS and other position
of navigation services.

104
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,430
And also everybody's familiar
with the GPS on their phone

105
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:01,340
or the navigation system
they have in their car.

106
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,200
But hidden below that,

107
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,200
in many cases are more discrete uses

108
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:10,190
of position, navigation and timing,

109
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:12,329
and they can be found in
things like the power grid,

110
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:14,210
where we have sink of phasers

111
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:16,870
which are monitoring
the states of the grid

112
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,983
and our bee feeding systems

113
00:04:18,983 --> 00:04:21,760
that will automate how
the grid is operated.

114
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,610
Within precision agriculture,

115
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:25,470
nowadays, we have autonomous vehicles

116
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:26,760
moving through the field.

117
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,020
And these vehicles using data provided

118
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,560
by the Global Positioning System

119
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,920
and other augmentations

120
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:36,020
can actually get about four
centimeter bypass augmentations.

121
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:38,979
Should we lose GPS on
its augmentation systems,

122
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,460
we may not be able to produce farming

123
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,440
at the levels that we do today.

124
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,650
And then, highly important
to those out there,

125
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:49,370
especially those of us who
can't put our phone down,

126
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:52,310
the telecommunication system
is highly dependent on GPS

127
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:56,080
for keeping synchronized and
allowing the throughput of data

128
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,710
in the limited spectrums that we have.

129
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:01,169
Estimates that we completed in 2019

130
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:03,610
show that should we lose GPS

131
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:06,050
cellular communication that
works would begin to grade,

132
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:07,850
take it to grade almost immediately,

133
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:11,539
about eight hours we would
see the cellular network

134
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,670
going into alarming mode.

135
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:14,750
In other words, you could
talk on your phones,

136
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,400
but you won't be able
to drive down the road

137
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,580
and talking to your phone.

138
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,099
We would see decreased bandwidth.

139
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,710
So you may not be able to
watch movies or videos.

140
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:23,109
And then after several weeks,

141
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:24,580
we would actually lose the ability

142
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,370
to use our cellular networks.

143
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:28,440
So, throughout critical infrastructure,

144
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,620
there are these uses with a
position, navigation and timing

145
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:32,870
that needs to be addressed

146
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:36,190
as we becoming more digitized society.

147
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,340
And then on the right-hand side

148
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,210
are just some additional
things that you can see,

149
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:41,419
everything from our financial markets

150
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:44,240
to drilling in the seeds
for oil exploration,

151
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,310
and even some of our space-based systems

152
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:49,410
use GPS to maintain their orbits.

153
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:50,470
As we move forward,

154
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:52,080
is important that we understand

155
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,719
when these systems use position,

156
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,270
navigation and timing services.

157
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:58,640
And you would think that may be obvious,

158
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,620
but as GPS emerged over
the past 20 to 30 years,

159
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,720
what we saw take place was,

160
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,840
everybody would marveled
at the capabilities of GPS

161
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,530
and GPS receivers were viewed as radios.

162
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:11,859
So they weren't as designed

163
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:15,860
and built with the security
and resilience built into them.

164
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,470
And what we see now,

165
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:19,130
is that these GPS receivers

166
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:22,190
are becoming more and more like computers,

167
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:24,390
and therefore we need
to design our systems

168
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:26,750
to address the same cybersecurity risks

169
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:30,720
that we find in our everyday IT networks.

170
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,490
So a little bit about the GNSS systems

171
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:35,683
and Global Navigation Satellite System.

172
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:38,750
These systems broadcast
a very weak signal.

173
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,230
When you get the signal from GPS,

174
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:43,360
it's actually, under 1 billionth of a watt

175
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,940
Then put that in perspective,

176
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,120
it's like taking a 20 watt light bulb,

177
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,460
lighting it on the East coast,

178
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:50,270
and then trying to see it
in the middle of the day

179
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,740
from the West coast.

180
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,760
So, because the signal is so weak,

181
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,230
and because the GPS
signal is an open signal

182
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:59,640
and the US Air Force publishes exactly

183
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,650
what that signal structure is.

184
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:04,570
It is very easy to jam the GPS signal.

185
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:06,719
It can be done with the $30 jammer.

186
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,160
I would encourage you not to do that

187
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,210
since the illegal to do such.

188
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:11,390
But in recent years,

189
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:14,120
something that used to be the
purview of a nation-state.

190
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,430
You can actually replace the GPS signal

191
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:20,000
with a $200 software defined radio

192
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,210
and software that you
can download over GitHub.

193
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:26,520
So as GPS is becoming
more and more integrated

194
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,859
into our critical infrastructure systems,

195
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:33,430
it's becoming easier and
easier to not only disrupt GPS

196
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:35,400
through a denial-of-service attack,

197
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,299
but also to put a man in the middle attack

198
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:40,640
where you can disrupt and
replace the GPS signal,

199
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,610
getting to your system.

200
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:44,900
What we are really pushing
with this responsible use

201
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,710
is we should never design
critical infrastructure systems

202
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:49,090
in such a way,

203
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:51,929
that if we are using GPS
or any other position,

204
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,660
navigation and timing services,

205
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:56,810
that is not coming from
an authenticated source,

206
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,810
you should always do validity checks

207
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:02,040
to ensure that the signal you're getting

208
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:05,660
is coming from a trusted location
and that signal was valid.

209
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:08,530
And if either of those
conditions does not exist,

210
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,869
then your system behaves
in a predetermined

211
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,580
and expected way.

212
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:13,870
If you fail to do this,

213
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,380
we have actually seen situations

214
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,960
in critical infrastructure now

215
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,289
where false signals are introduced

216
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:22,820
and erratic behavior takes
place that was not expected.

217
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,510
And I'll cover just a few of those

218
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:25,993
in the next couple of slides.

219
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:29,680
Cautionary tale and the black sea.

220
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,720
Several years ago, a ship's captain,

221
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,600
you see the ship here was
trans versing the black sea.

222
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,380
And suddenly his ships started traveling

223
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:38,220
at speeds beyond which it was capable.

224
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:41,630
At least that's what his
instrument panel was reporting.

225
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:43,539
It was also reporting that
the ship was traveling

226
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:44,372
below the surface.

227
00:08:44,373 --> 00:08:46,490
And as you can see here,
it's not a submarine.

228
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:49,980
And then lastly as ship, jumped
miles inland to an airport.

229
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:53,320
And the captain simply did
not know what was going wrong.

230
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,880
Fortunately, it was the time of the day

231
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,390
where captain recognized that
his ship can travel that way,

232
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:00,840
it can jump in inland,

233
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,210
so the captain was able
to continue navigating

234
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,890
using visual aids.

235
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:06,240
Imagine the same scenario

236
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,480
where those jumps were not as dramatic,

237
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,320
but simply wonder that vehicle of course.

238
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:14,480
And if they were in more
enclosed water spaces,

239
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,360
the ship could have been running ground,

240
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,590
or it could have been diverted to a area

241
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:21,170
that would make it susceptible to a pirate

242
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:24,882
or some other type of
interventions on the high seas.

243
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,949
But, it is important here
that the captain recognized

244
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:31,220
that there were many other things,

245
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,410
position, navigation aids available

246
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:36,439
for them to understand
their situational awareness.

247
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,080
And when GPS was presenting false data,

248
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,600
they were able to adjust

249
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,533
and ensure that they were
able to stay on course,

250
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,423
the course that they were
predetermined to take.

251
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:50,150
And it's not just a matter of

252
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:52,613
if somebody is broadcasting a bad signal.

253
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:56,290
We all know that if you have an IT device,

254
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:57,610
it's sometimes it's going to give you

255
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:01,120
a bad behave in an erratic manner.

256
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,380
Well, back on April of 2019,

257
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:08,780
the GPS system tracks its months,

258
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:12,120
and now we assume it's week
numbers in attended register.

259
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,270
As every 19.7 years,

260
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:15,880
this 10 bit registered rolls over

261
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,500
from 10 ones to 10 zeros.

262
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,460
We knew this was coming
19 years in advance.

263
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:24,290
And despite that fact across the globe,

264
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,910
when this event took place,

265
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:29,400
some GPS systems failed to operate

266
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,223
or began to put out false data.

267
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,420
This should not have happened.

268
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:36,260
If the systems were properly designed,

269
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,569
it should have rolled over.

270
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,930
And if the system didn't handle it,

271
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,239
it should have passed data
into the supported system

272
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,370
and the supported system

273
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:45,200
should have handled it appropriately.

274
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,480
And as an example of the support system,

275
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,430
not handling it appropriately,

276
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:52,270
there were Jumbo jet liners on the ground

277
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:54,540
in China when this took place.

278
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,959
Those Jumbo jet liners,
when they booted back up,

279
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,570
the GPS receiver reported bad data.

280
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:02,460
And those Jumbo jet liners remain grounded

281
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,410
for approximately seven to 10 days

282
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:06,689
before the system could be restored.

283
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:08,800
So it's not just a matter
of getting bad position,

284
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,920
navigation and timing data,

285
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,870
because the GPS signal was interrupted.

286
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:16,370
There's always those technical
issues that can take place.

287
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:18,160
And what we're trying to ensure

288
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,920
designers of critical
infrastructure systems do

289
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,920
is design their systems in such a way

290
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,219
that if the PNT receivers you have,

291
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:29,600
for whatever reason, passes
bad data into your system,

292
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,820
the system is able to
recognize that bad data

293
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,050
and happen accordingly,

294
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:38,770
or maintain operations in a
manner that you have predicted.

295
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:41,800
And you think, well, that
that's, pretty simple to do,

296
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,990
but even the most complex
systems have issues with this.

297
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:47,240
And when I say the most complex systems,

298
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,410
I talk about human beings.

299
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:51,140
This is not an uncommon occurrence.

300
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:56,090
What you see here is actually
the Georgetown Canal in DC.

301
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:59,630
A driver was driving along with
relatively good visibility.

302
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:02,148
The GPS device on the dashboard

303
00:12:02,148 --> 00:12:04,210
was apparently malfunctioning,

304
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:06,490
and told the driver to turn right.

305
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:09,100
And without even thinking,
the driver turned right,

306
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,280
drove the vehicle into the canal,

307
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,750
and the driver had to be rescued

308
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,973
by a fire and emergency services.

309
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:19,880
Why I bring this up is just
to explain the concept that

310
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:23,060
even though a human had
all these other sensory

311
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:25,930
and situational awareness
cues available to them,

312
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:28,420
they still ignored them and follow GPS

313
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,610
and drove the vehicle into the canal.

314
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:33,100
So as you were designing systems,

315
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:36,060
that are receiving external PNT sources,

316
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,969
it's important that you consider the fact

317
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:40,830
that whether it be
through intentional means

318
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,960
such as we saw in the black sea,

319
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,480
through errant equipment,

320
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,553
such as we saw with the GPS rollover,

321
00:12:47,456 --> 00:12:49,430
or simply some anomalous behavior

322
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:51,339
that we don't know why it took place,

323
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:54,377
that the supporting system
must always assess the data

324
00:12:54,377 --> 00:12:58,829
that's coming in and be
programmed to react accordingly,

325
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:00,833
if that data is not trustworthy.

326
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:04,410
So this brings us back full circle.

327
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:05,270
I've just explained,

328
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,890
that last example was an example

329
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:08,840
of what irresponsible use of position,

330
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,430
navigation and timing is.

331
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:11,959
It's when you've received bad data

332
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,820
or data that does not make sense.

333
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:16,170
And the system that receives it,

334
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,670
takes that information,

335
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:19,880
operates in the way that it was designed.

336
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:23,510
But the way that it was designed
was not thought through,

337
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:25,500
or was designed with the concepts

338
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,820
that the input data
would always be correct,

339
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,730
or always be available.

340
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:31,480
As you move forward with this,

341
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,410
we ask that you look
at your critical input

342
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:35,400
versus critical systems that use position,

343
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,120
navigation and timing data.

344
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,680
You understand what the
source of that data is.

345
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,530
And then you design your
systems in such a way,

346
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:46,390
that if that data is ever
corrupted or is unavailable,

347
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:49,020
your systems will continue to behave

348
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:51,180
in a way that you deemed acceptable

349
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,810
until true position,

350
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:56,150
navigation and timing
services can be restored.

351
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:58,050
So what we want to do
here is not just tell you

352
00:13:58,050 --> 00:13:59,609
that's what you should do.

353
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:01,140
What we've done is worked with

354
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,110
the National Institutes
of Science Technology,

355
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:05,910
developed, something
called the PNT profile,

356
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:08,920
they will help you define
what the problem is

357
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,849
and develop mitigation strategies.

358
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,200
And with that, I'd like
to turn it over to Jim,

359
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,979
- Thanks a lot Jim,

360
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,110
for providing that excellent overview.

361
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:22,070
And we're looking at the
exact title of the document.

362
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,480
Again, this was born
of the executive order

363
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,370
13905 effort to provide guidance

364
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:29,810
to both the public and private sector

365
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:32,882
on how to increase the
resilience of PNT services.

366
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:38,689
NISTIR, or NIST inter-agency report 8323,

367
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:40,460
Foundational PNT Profile:

368
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,700
Applying the Cybersecurity Framework

369
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,580
for the Responsible Use of Positioning,

370
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,900
Navigation and timing, or PNT services.

371
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,100
There's a lot packed into the title.

372
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,890
And what I'll do over
the next couple of slides

373
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:51,723
is just unpack it,

374
00:14:51,723 --> 00:14:54,270
and to help everyone gain an understanding

375
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,959
in terms of assessing their own risk

376
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:00,020
in their own environments
at the organizational level,

377
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:02,680
sector level or sub-sector level

378
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,140
to properly mitigate against
potential disruptions

379
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:08,383
and manipulations of
PNT services, excuse me.

380
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:10,700
So jumping into it,

381
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,280
again, I'm going to defer
back to the executive order.

382
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,860
The whole purpose of the profile

383
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:17,863
aside from increasing overall awareness,

384
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,590
it's easy to say that

385
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:23,360
perhaps, there's a part of
the user segment out there,

386
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,300
users with PNT services who may be unaware

387
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,760
of the fact that they are
depending on timing signals.

388
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:32,150
And I'm using timing as a key example here

389
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:34,459
because many folks can
relate to that timing

390
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,700
for systems in particular.

391
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:40,790
The first objective here
was to allow for people

392
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:44,439
to be able to identify
systems dependent upon PNT,

393
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,640
identify appropriate PNT sources.

394
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,189
Now, whether your system

395
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:50,650
is receiving original signals or not,

396
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:53,209
it's gonna be important
to be able to identify

397
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:56,110
if your subsystem is part of a hierarchy

398
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:59,810
or it's receiving GPS or GNSS signals

399
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:01,819
from other systems in the hierarchy.

400
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:05,870
This is a rather important
point to pay attention to.

401
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:07,540
The ability to detect disturbances

402
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:09,910
and manipulation of PNT services,

403
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:11,860
and finally manage the
risk to these systems.

404
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:15,400
Again, this traces directly
back to the executive order.

405
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,870
So what do we do in terms
of being able to address

406
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:21,750
or providing for users

407
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,540
and users in the stakeholder community?

408
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:26,203
And this is all users
of PNT for that matter.

409
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,310
Is we use a methodical approach to it.

410
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:31,810
So based on the cybersecurity framework,

411
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:33,520
which I'll talk here in just a second,

412
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:36,790
but in terms of the overall
development process itself,

413
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:37,949
it's important to mention

414
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:39,890
that this whole process that we undertook

415
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:42,130
to create this cybersecurity framework

416
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:45,100
based profile was open,
transparent and collaborative.

417
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:49,520
I believe we had at least
a 75 to 80 collaborators

418
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:53,579
from government academia,
the private sector,

419
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:57,190
even individuals offering us information

420
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:59,550
on how they go about mitigating risks

421
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,790
in their PNT environment.

422
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:03,689
Of course, Jim mentioned he
was one of them, a major one,

423
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:07,619
in fact in terms of helping us
get this profile turned out.

424
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:09,010
So the primary stakeholders

425
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:11,170
in this case are everyone who uses PNT

426
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:12,050
as already mentioned,

427
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:13,980
the focus is on critical infrastructure,

428
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,670
that is specifically stated
in the executive order.

429
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:19,660
Why is this because we're so
heavily dependent upon it?

430
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:20,970
So the key point here,

431
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:23,650
again, going back to one of the purposes,

432
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:26,270
overall higher purposes
of the executive order

433
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,579
is to increase the awareness

434
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:30,199
that systems out there may be using PNT

435
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,230
whether you know it or not,

436
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:33,320
it's so ubiquitously used

437
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,300
and widespread that usually
they just take it for granted

438
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:39,810
that they may not be receiving
any direct timing signals,

439
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:41,210
either from an original source

440
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:44,770
or from a system that's
upstream from them.

441
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:46,620
So it's important to
have that understanding

442
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,020
and awareness primarily.

443
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:48,853
And then of course,

444
00:17:48,853 --> 00:17:50,610
leveraging the NIST
Cybersecurity Framework.

445
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:52,530
If you look over to the right,

446
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:56,870
those five items are the core functions

447
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:58,770
of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework,

448
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:00,537
which is what we're basing the profile on.

449
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:02,430
And again, be patient here,

450
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:03,870
cause I'll walk through this

451
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:05,270
so that everyone gets an understanding.

452
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:09,340
So giving some prerequisite
background on identify,

453
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:11,510
protect, detect, respond, recover,

454
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:13,693
these are all elements of cybersecurity.

455
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:18,370
Moving on in terms of how
we develop the profile,

456
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:20,580
we take through our outreach

457
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:25,230
and engagement efforts with
the private and public sectors.

458
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:29,270
We issued a request for
information in May of 2010,

459
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:30,533
2020, excuse me.

460
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:33,730
And all that input was used

461
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:36,710
to derive information about
how to properly mitigate

462
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:40,480
or address the responsible
use of PNT services.

463
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,150
So you have cyber security requirements,

464
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:45,330
business and mission objectives,

465
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:48,100
understanding of the
technical environment,

466
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,639
whether organizationally
or within a sector,

467
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,860
those inputs go into the
cybersecurity framework

468
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,629
into something called subcategories

469
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:57,000
of which there are a hundred native.

470
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,660
And we used only about 80 of them

471
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:00,390
for this particular profile.

472
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,970
And what is the outcome?

473
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:05,170
These are methods by
which to identify systems,

474
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:08,240
networks and assets
dependent upon PNT services.

475
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,810
I mentioned already identify
appropriate PNT services

476
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:13,980
or sources, as I should say,

477
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:17,540
detect destruction and
manipulation of PNT services

478
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:18,980
and manage the associated risks.

479
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,460
So sounding a little redundant here,

480
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:24,260
but I want to drive drive
home the point that,

481
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,840
you know, this was a careful approach

482
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:30,850
in terms of how the outputs were obtained

483
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:33,840
in order to provide the
document that we have.

484
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,699
So it's a completely free document.

485
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:39,720
It's not mandatory, but has
no regulations attached to it.

486
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,550
It's a purely voluntary document

487
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:45,230
should you feel the need
to be able to mitigate

488
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:49,150
against the risks associated
in this particular,

489
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:50,833
in these PNT environments.

490
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,810
The content of the profile itself.

491
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:57,179
Now, we're actually looking at a snippet

492
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:58,270
of what you will see

493
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:02,600
if you decide to undertake
a more deeper investigation

494
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,810
into the profile.

495
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:04,643
And mind you,

496
00:20:04,643 --> 00:20:07,110
this is not exclusively
what the document contains,

497
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,439
but this is the core part of it.

498
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,350
I should say there is some front matter,

499
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:13,219
which explains our rationale
or approach or scope

500
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,760
or objectives, things of that nature.

501
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,610
But this is really
where a lot of the grind

502
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:21,770
or the hard work took place

503
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:24,780
in terms of producing
this particular output.

504
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:25,680
So as I mentioned,

505
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,880
referring back now to the
cybersecurity framework,

506
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,010
these categories over to the left,

507
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:32,800
the function here in
this case is identified.

508
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,639
The category is asset management.

509
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,250
The sub category ID in this case is, M-1,

510
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:41,160
in this CSF language is taken directly

511
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,040
from the cybersecurity framework.

512
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,649
Physical devices and systems

513
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:46,240
within the organization or inventory.

514
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,330
This is very simple language
oriented towards cybersecurity.

515
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:52,370
The middle column, as I mentioned,

516
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:55,020
is the original work that was done

517
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,389
on this particular profile.

518
00:20:56,390 --> 00:21:01,040
So you're profiling a realm or an arena,

519
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,980
in this case it's PNT,

520
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,940
and you're getting all the information,

521
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:07,410
or we will have obtained
all the information

522
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:10,210
from our outreach and
engagement efforts to the RFI,

523
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:12,950
our conferences, our webinars,

524
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:15,610
gleaning all this information
from the user base

525
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:18,800
and basically putting the most
important components here.

526
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,560
So it gives a logical breakdown

527
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,780
of the things in this case

528
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,600
that you will need to pay attention to

529
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,360
in the PNT environment

530
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,929
in regards to asset management.

531
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:30,640
Equally as important over the right,

532
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,960
when you look at the references,

533
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,610
those were gotten from our interaction

534
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:36,399
or say engagement outreach efforts

535
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,810
with the private sector

536
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:39,990
and everyone else who
participated with us,

537
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:42,060
to provide possible mitigations.

538
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:46,110
Again, this document does
not specifically recommend

539
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:47,459
any particular mitigation.

540
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,760
It's all gonna depend on the environment,

541
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,930
your own organization or your
own assessment of your risk,

542
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:55,320
which the cybersecurity
framework provides for,

543
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,360
to be able to come up with
mitigations that you choose.

544
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,659
There's really no right or wrong answer.

545
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:03,080
It's basically what is
appropriate to your environment.

546
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:06,629
And that's perhaps the
most important point

547
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:08,670
in terms of implementing, implementing,

548
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:11,240
excuse me, this profile.

549
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,700
Again, at the organizational level,

550
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,570
at the sector or sub-sector level,

551
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:16,710
and I wanna emphasize that

552
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:19,000
because there are some plans in the works

553
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,970
to develop these four at the sector level

554
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:23,710
in various sectors,

555
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,640
because they're so heavily embedded

556
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,270
in critical infrastructure

557
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:29,953
and of which the importance
cannot be understated.

558
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:34,983
Moving on in terms of applying
what you've learned today,

559
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,070
if you want to undertake a serious

560
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:42,470
or more deliberate
investigation of your own risks

561
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:46,490
or the threat environment in
terms of your own PNT use,

562
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:50,530
you can read this foundational
profile for PNT services.

563
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:53,800
We've got some websites at the end,

564
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,350
here to give you work and you can click on

565
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:58,409
and go find it on the NIST website

566
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,540
and in several other areas.

567
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:02,050
So that would be the first recommendation.

568
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:03,560
Just read it, see if it's appropriate,

569
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,560
or if it applies to you
how heavily dependent

570
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:09,730
on PNT services or can
you figure that out.

571
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:11,880
These are really important components

572
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,620
for you to consider

573
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:15,580
if you wanted to do a
deeper investigation.

574
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:17,320
Within the first three months,

575
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,550
following the presentation,

576
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:20,510
consider inventorying all your systems

577
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:23,480
and devices that are
dependent upon PNT data,

578
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,120
take it a step further,
identify your sources.

579
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:29,850
So you may not be in a certain
initial recipient of a GPS

580
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:31,860
or GNSS signal out there.

581
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:34,040
Can you identify the source of your timing

582
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,370
for your assistance in particular?

583
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:37,560
And again, I keep
referring to this timing.

584
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,020
This does include position
and navigation as well.

585
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:43,260
The timing is the easiest
example to provide.

586
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,792
T folks just as an example

587
00:23:44,792 --> 00:23:47,673
of the measures you can undertake.

588
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,900
Now, consider also if you
believe in your investigation

589
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:53,800
that you have

590
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:59,360
in above average level of
dependency on PNT services

591
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,679
whereby a disruption

592
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:03,400
or manipulation could
cause you some downtime,

593
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,020
not only to yourself
and your own operations,

594
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,470
but folks who are downstream

595
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:09,320
or dependent upon your services,

596
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:12,159
you may wish to
incorporate alternative PNT

597
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,453
or timing sources into your architecture.

598
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,580
This could be another source
of GPS or GNSS signaling

599
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:21,703
or it could be,

600
00:24:21,703 --> 00:24:23,790
and this is one I'm about to mention here,

601
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:26,690
that's highlighted in this
time over fiber resources

602
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:29,060
and other alternative to get time

603
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:33,110
without using a PNT based signaling.

604
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:35,570
So there is an alternative out there.

605
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:37,439
I'm not saying you have to use this time

606
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,210
over fiber resource here,

607
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:42,550
but it is important to
remember if you decide

608
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:45,340
to move away in terms
of a fail-over from GPS,

609
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:47,709
GNSS related systems,

610
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:51,840
and there are alternatives
hardwired, let's say.

611
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,850
Within six months consider if you,

612
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:56,350
again, if you're
continuing to pursue this,

613
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:57,760
identifying the vulnerabilities,

614
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,520
threats and potential impacts
should threats be realized,

615
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,430
in terms of assessing your overall risk

616
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:05,800
to PNT disruptions or manipulations.

617
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,620
Implementing procedures, if you find that,

618
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:11,629
yeah, I could be very well be
vulnerable if this goes down,

619
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:13,570
or if my services is disrupted,

620
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:15,760
then consider implementing procedures.

621
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,660
Again, the profile walks you

622
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:19,310
through these steps methodically.

623
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:22,090
And then finally,

624
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:25,080
we're assuming here
that there are policies

625
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,409
and procedures in place,

626
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:28,850
at least at the organizational level,

627
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:30,070
in terms of cybersecurity,

628
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,450
you may wish to augment
your cybersecurity policies

629
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:34,910
and procedures to include
a specific mention

630
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:37,160
of PNT services.

631
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,540
Which would be a great idea,

632
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:43,180
if you find that you
are a more sophisticated

633
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:45,820
or more elevated user in the space

634
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:48,129
that we're dealing with here.

635
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:49,620
So with that being said,

636
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,679
just a quick summary of all the things

637
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,590
we talked about today.

638
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:55,580
Getting to the overall
point use of PNT data

639
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:57,960
or services in your
organization may not be obvious.

640
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,717
Again, going right back to
the executive order here.

641
00:26:00,717 --> 00:26:03,020
And our job was to increase awareness,

642
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:05,460
that you may be using this
without even knowing it,.

643
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:08,230
And we're hoping you can
assess your ultimately,

644
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:12,580
the amount of dependency
you have on PNT services.

645
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:15,290
Understanding the risks
posed by dependency is great.

646
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:17,100
So if you can understand the risk,

647
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:20,129
then you might want to take measures

648
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:22,140
in order to prevent
against serious disruption,

649
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:24,580
manipulation, particularly if you are

650
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:26,629
in the critical infrastructure space.

651
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:27,490
And then finally,

652
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:29,760
and obviously the next PNT profile

653
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,430
can help organizations provide

654
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:34,260
PNT related cyber security measures.

655
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,460
As I mentioned prior,

656
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:38,170
below our references that NIST homepage,

657
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:40,210
there is the homepage for PNT.

658
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:41,470
Not only will you be able to get

659
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:44,270
the PNT profile downloaded there,

660
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,940
but you'll find a lot of resources

661
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,810
that we provided at
their previous webinars

662
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:51,270
explaining the whole process we undertook

663
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:53,170
to develop the profile, et cetera,

664
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:57,124
and over to the right Jim's
homepage at Cisco there,

665
00:26:57,124 --> 00:26:59,430
www.cisco.govpnt.

666
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:02,780
A lot of excellent
supplemental information

667
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:03,950
on some of the mitigation,

668
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:08,640
some of the documentation that
is producing in this space.

669
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,750
So with that,

670
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:12,580
we'd like to thank you for
your time and attention here.

671
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:16,060
And Jim, any last words here to add?

672
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:17,919
- Jim, thanks a lot for that great rundown

673
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:22,113
of the PNT profiles and the
great work done by NIST.

674
00:27:22,982 --> 00:27:24,510
To close out and just like to say,

675
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:26,470
as we're going moving forward,

676
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:29,280
and our society is
becoming more integrated,

677
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,820
more automated, positioning,

678
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,240
navigation and timing services

679
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,130
are gonna become even more prevalent.

680
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:36,970
And as we are developing those systems,

681
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:39,270
it's always important for us to understand

682
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:41,590
what PNT services we're using,

683
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:44,600
what risk and which benefits they deliver,

684
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,199
and then have a well-informed
risk-based practice

685
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,240
to implement those in your system.

686
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,430
And that we do longer design systems

687
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:53,380
in such a way that we just assume

688
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,240
position, navigation and timing services

689
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,750
will always be accurate.

690
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:57,750
We'll always be there.

691
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:59,983
So thank you very much
for your time tonight.
