1
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:02,660
- Good afternoon, everybody.

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:04,870
I'm thrilled to be here with you today,

3
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:08,520
to talk about Convergence of
Cyber, Physical and Fraud.

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,469
What an amazing topic.

5
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:12,090
My name is Susan Koski.

6
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:13,580
I'm the Senior Vice President

7
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:17,180
and Head of Security and
Enterprise Response at PNC.

8
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:18,603
Security and enterprise response

9
00:00:18,603 --> 00:00:20,070
encompasses a number of things.

10
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:24,600
In security, it's not only
the product and the strategy

11
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,980
and the operationalization
of physical fraud and cyber

12
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:30,880
but it's also combining how
we respond to those things

13
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,533
that do go bump in the night.

14
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:35,090
Today I'm gonna talk to you

15
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:36,990
about how do you do these things?

16
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:38,850
And I'm gonna cover four topics.

17
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,740
One, how do you get executive support?

18
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,240
How do you tell the story?

19
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,620
What do you do to really encourage people

20
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:46,870
to get behind your mission

21
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:49,062
of converging physical fraud and cyber?

22
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,250
How do you define your mission statement?

23
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,300
How do you think about
your organizational change?

24
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,760
How do you bring in organizational change

25
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,300
or HR to help you with that?

26
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,269
What functions do you converge first?

27
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,910
Why, what are considerations for that?

28
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:04,519
And then really, how do
you measure the outcomes?

29
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:05,890
How do you look at automation?

30
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:07,490
And how do you look at the power of data

31
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:11,333
to bring these things together
in a wonderful ecosystem?

32
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:16,720
When you think about physical
fraud and cyber specialties,

33
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,030
they all have very common missions,

34
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:24,010
identify, protect,
detect, respond, recover.

35
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:25,140
So if you think about that

36
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,348
across those very similar capabilities

37
00:01:28,348 --> 00:01:30,710
but oftentimes they're in silos.

38
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:32,910
We wanna think beyond those silos.

39
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:35,753
We wanna help our company
converge these functions

40
00:01:35,753 --> 00:01:39,047
into one to get the beauty of them,

41
00:01:39,047 --> 00:01:41,323
and the essence of the original function.

42
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,280
So how do you tell the story?

43
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,380
What do you say to your executive leaders?

44
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:48,663
You really wanna start by helping people

45
00:01:48,663 --> 00:01:50,770
understand the challenge you face,

46
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:53,550
the challenge all of the areas face.

47
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,850
You know, when you look
at our adversaries,

48
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:58,169
they're smart, they're sophisticated.

49
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:01,560
In some cases, they know our
tax surface better than we do.

50
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,660
Our job is to know it better than they do.

51
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:07,640
There's a lot of things
up here on the screen.

52
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,730
Third parties, people,
your systems, your data,

53
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:14,239
what you're protecting, but as security,

54
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,580
we've got to cover it all we
can't afford to miss a building

55
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,890
an application, a piece of data.

56
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,989
We've got to cover all of that.

57
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:25,830
When you think about the
complexity of these solutions

58
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:28,250
sometimes we have legacy systems,

59
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,960
that connect to very
sophisticated systems,

60
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,230
very complex and pulling all that together

61
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:34,790
and protecting it.

62
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:37,829
When you think about people,
people who are working remote.

63
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:40,280
People are sometimes
in the office nowadays,

64
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,070
how do you make sure you cover that?

65
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,430
And then when you look at third parties,

66
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:46,560
you're entrusting those
third parties to take care

67
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,609
of what you entrusted them with.

68
00:02:49,609 --> 00:02:52,140
We have to then protect our data,

69
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:55,040
maintain the confidential
integrity, and availability.

70
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,140
We have to protect for life loss of life.

71
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,559
How do we protect our executives?

72
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,710
How do we protect our buildings?

73
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:02,010
How do we protect our people
when the various things

74
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:04,459
that go on in the world
today, and then financial,

75
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,540
when you think about fraud,
it's about financial risks

76
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,083
to the customers, and to the company.

77
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,100
Couple of topics and
a couple of key things

78
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,870
I'd like you to keep in mind.

79
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:17,343
There are 2 billion websites in the world.

80
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:24,020
From cybercrime magazine
is $6 trillion here in 2021

81
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:24,993
or plan to be.

82
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,220
It's expected to grow
to almost 10 trillion

83
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,053
in a couple of years

84
00:03:30,053 --> 00:03:32,390
which is about a 15% year
over year growth rate.

85
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:34,959
Wouldn't you like that
in your own portfolio?

86
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,210
And when you consider that
being about $10 trillion

87
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:40,650
the U S GDP is about 20 trillion.

88
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:42,280
So it really puts things into perspective

89
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,087
that it's, half of the GDP

90
00:03:44,087 --> 00:03:48,310
of one of the top four
countries with the highest GDP.

91
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:50,100
And when you look at spending in IT,

92
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:53,019
we're at about 4 trillion,
we could go to 30 trillion.

93
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:56,470
So, it's gonna be all about
the systems that we have,

94
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:59,300
the connectivity of them
and the ubiquity of them

95
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,260
and how do we protect them?

96
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,940
What I would also encourage
you to do is take the slide

97
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:06,700
use it, put the data on
there for your company

98
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,109
though how many applications,
how much infrastructure,

99
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:11,140
how much data get the numbers.

100
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:13,649
You can even use visualizations like maps

101
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:15,550
of all the locations of where you're at,

102
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:17,300
where your data is located.

103
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,980
Really important to paint
the picture visually

104
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,030
so you can get the support that you need.

105
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:25,660
Now talk about why?

106
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:28,670
Why is it better for these
functions to be together?

107
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:30,980
Why would you do that
and not keep it separate?

108
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,390
When you think about a threat landscape,

109
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:34,690
we know we just talked
about how vast and large

110
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:36,550
that threat landscape is.

111
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,966
Well, I'll give you an example.

112
00:04:38,966 --> 00:04:40,790
You know, when you first buy a house,

113
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:44,280
you may have maybe some
trees, some bushes.

114
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,559
Over time, maybe you really
become a great gardener.

115
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,750
And you've got all kinds
of different trees,

116
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,460
all kinds of different
bushes, flowers, et cetera.

117
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:55,930
And you find you have to
hire arborists or specialist

118
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:58,210
to come in and help you
with that landscape.

119
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:00,450
The same thing exists in our specialties

120
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:01,950
of physical fraud and cyber.

121
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,570
We have those specialists,

122
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,599
but we wanna bring the
beauty of that together.

123
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,270
And I just gave you an interesting example

124
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:11,150
of how to tell a story about a landscape.

125
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:13,880
When you're talking to
executives, tell a story,

126
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:17,280
storytelling and examples
that are visual and pictorial,

127
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,289
really can help you influence that change

128
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:21,790
you wanna make in the company.

129
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:25,340
Keep in mind our
adversaries work together.

130
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,030
So why shouldn't we?

131
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:30,760
When you think about solar
winds and that particular attack

132
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,590
is very well coordinated,
very well thought out.

133
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:36,929
Program managers, DevOps types of folks,

134
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:39,490
people working together collectively

135
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:41,550
to target that attack surface

136
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:44,350
to get in and change that supply chain.

137
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:47,220
So, why wouldn't we work
together in the same way?

138
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:51,010
You know, invites in
isolation can look myopic,

139
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:53,909
can look maybe not to be an issue.

140
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:56,470
When you look at them broader,
they may be indicative

141
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:58,890
of something really serious happening.

142
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:00,740
So not bringing that data and those plans

143
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:03,010
together can actually work against you.

144
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:05,400
In a lot of these areas,
we share risk domains.

145
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:09,729
Whether it be monitoring,
threat intelligence, responding,

146
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:13,340
or identity, and even insider threat,

147
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,919
same common concepts

148
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,970
they all have physical fraud
and cyber components to them.

149
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:20,490
So how do we really bring them together?

150
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:23,260
When you look at talent,
what's really important here

151
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:27,520
is our talent has to take us forward.

152
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,409
And this talent has to really
make us the best that we can.

153
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:34,390
And some of the people in our industry

154
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:36,710
can really move between teams.

155
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:39,820
You can even have talent
ignition that's coming in

156
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,030
from talent pools throughout your company.

157
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:44,789
And you can look even at
unique places to bring talent

158
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:47,220
in like philosophy majors, et cetera.

159
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,220
Or even people who are
really good with data

160
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,800
because it's really all about data

161
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,150
and bringing that together.

162
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,700
And last but not least,
you know, I mentioned data,

163
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:00,280
but think about data scientists.

164
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,969
You need those folks to
help you get the beauty

165
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:06,070
out of the information you
have, but how do you stream it?

166
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,450
How do you get it to the right source?

167
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:09,870
What are the platforms
that you need to use

168
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,093
and how do you do that?

169
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,053
And one other thing I
wanna mention about talent.

170
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,780
It's really important
to inspire the talent

171
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,409
and ignite the talent.

172
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:22,740
We're gonna talk a
little bit about a topic

173
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,570
that I call F-ovation in a little bit

174
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,219
and I'll explain what that means.

175
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:31,690
So, you've really put
the package together.

176
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:34,620
You've sat down, you socialize,
you've built consensus.

177
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,720
It's going to take time
to build this consensus

178
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,540
with your leadership team.

179
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,260
And it may take multiple iterations

180
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,950
of what I just shared with you.

181
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,810
Don't give up, keep at it,

182
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:47,140
because it's gonna be worth it in the end.

183
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:49,310
So now that you've got the buy-in,

184
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:52,670
the support to make the change
pull the teams together,

185
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:54,090
what is your mission?

186
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:56,250
What is your organizational design?

187
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,290
How is it simple?

188
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:01,470
How do you really think
through making that happen?

189
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:02,853
Well, let's talk about it.

190
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:06,760
First thing you really wanna
make sure with your teams

191
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,150
is that your teams are inspired.

192
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:12,120
I put it in italics here, "We"

193
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,750
for a very specific reason.

194
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,610
And oftentimes in conversations

195
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:18,960
I will say we, because
I want people to really

196
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,520
understand the emphasis of that.

197
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:24,799
We fight together, we protect
together, we defend together.

198
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,410
And by bringing people those three pillars

199
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:31,100
in an organization that
maybe hadn't talked before

200
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,580
really need to infuse

201
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:36,039
that they need to work with
each other, talk to each other,

202
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:40,039
embrace each other, embrace
each other's talent and skills.

203
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,849
How do you infuse that to people?

204
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:45,510
You need to have I think a
simple message and inspire them

205
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:48,240
get to the core of what they love.

206
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,640
So when you think about this,

207
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,640
you wanna have really a holistic response,

208
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,270
and explain to your teams
why this is important.

209
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:56,750
You know, use an example.

210
00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:00,000
When you think about police, firemen,

211
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,700
when they respond to an event, right?

212
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:05,460
They have a standard set of
practices that they follow.

213
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,850
Well, we wanna have the same thing.

214
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:09,810
So if there's an incident
whether it's a physical fraud

215
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:12,449
or cyber incident, our
business constituents,

216
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:15,150
have the same experience,
have the same message.

217
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,880
Things don't look disjointed,

218
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,350
or one team says this
another teams says that.

219
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,893
So make sure it's holistic.

220
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,660
When you think about strategy,

221
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,670
and you've got physical fraud and cyber,

222
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:26,847
you can use those to say,

223
00:09:26,847 --> 00:09:28,787
"Okay, where do we need to invest?

224
00:09:28,787 --> 00:09:31,757
"What's the most important
area to invest in?

225
00:09:31,757 --> 00:09:34,526
"And what's the strategy
of bringing that together

226
00:09:34,527 --> 00:09:37,010
"to unleash the power of the fusion."

227
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:40,720
I like the word fusion quite a bit

228
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,430
because it really embodies togetherness.

229
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:46,370
And we'll talk a little bit
about fusion centers later

230
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:48,210
but I think it really
embodies that togetherness

231
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:49,800
which is important.

232
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,079
Collaboration, oftentimes these teams

233
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,703
may not have talked before.

234
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,750
Some things that I've done is
I've brought teams together

235
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,490
to just have fireside chats.

236
00:09:58,490 --> 00:09:59,370
What are you working on?

237
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:00,590
What are you working on?

238
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:01,737
And then you find people go,

239
00:10:01,737 --> 00:10:04,719
"Wait a minute, I have an
idea here, or I've seen this."

240
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,570
And then they start the conversation.

241
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:08,670
One of the most important
things you can do

242
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:09,930
when you bring these teams together

243
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:12,870
is get them to talk and
start the conversation.

244
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:16,193
They will find ways to be
collaborative, people are smart.

245
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,900
Efficiency gains, bringing this together,

246
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:22,530
you can find better ways
to be more efficient.

247
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:25,660
I've coined a phrase in my
own company called efficiency

248
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:28,640
and innovation, which I call F-ovation.

249
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,080
It's about removing kind of the toil

250
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,130
or button clicking that goes on.

251
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:38,470
So we can really ignite our
talent to be knowledge workers

252
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:39,900
to think like knowledge workers,

253
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,823
to be very powerful about that.

254
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:44,680
When you're not thinking
as a knowledge worker

255
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,569
and you're not empowering
people to do that,

256
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:48,340
they may be looking
elsewhere for employment.

257
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:51,560
You don't want that, you want
them to stay in your company.

258
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,510
If any of you have ever read Daniel Pink,

259
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:54,569
he talks about this.

260
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:58,200
He talks about allowing people
to do innovative cool things,

261
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,740
but also allowing them to fail.

262
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:02,520
And that's okay because we
learn the most from our failures

263
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,460
not our successes.

264
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,710
And talent ignition,

265
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:07,650
I talked about this a little bit earlier.

266
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:10,530
How do we have our talent that can move

267
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:13,260
between maybe the three pillars
can learn different things

268
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:15,800
but can support one
another in our mission?

269
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,130
This is how you wanna inspire your teams

270
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:21,217
and lead them through
the change with "We".

271
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:25,230
How do you communicate this then

272
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:29,260
to your internal constituents,
even to your customers?

273
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:33,600
You know, you want one team
that inspires this trust.

274
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,870
Trust is incredibly important.

275
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:38,600
If you lose it, it's
incredibly hard to get back

276
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,660
versus sustaining that trust.

277
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:43,420
So make sure that as
you're explaining this

278
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:45,360
to your business constituents,

279
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,960
and you're building that
culture of security awareness,

280
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,350
throughout your organization
you've got, here's the mission.

281
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:52,100
Here's why it's important.

282
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,800
We're gonna do these things.

283
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,930
We're gonna have a holistic response.

284
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:57,319
We're gonna have a holistic strategy.

285
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,450
We're gonna be more
efficient and innovative,

286
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:02,527
just think about if you
could automate things

287
00:12:02,527 --> 00:12:04,700
and be more efficient and innovative,

288
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,310
and not having to really ask
the business to take things

289
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,050
off their bottom line to fund it.

290
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:10,550
That is an incredible pivot

291
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:12,800
and an incredible story
to tell the business.

292
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:16,456
But again, something very
simple that you wanna have

293
00:12:16,456 --> 00:12:18,700
and explain to all your constituents

294
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,250
to really get that groundswell support

295
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,730
from others across the company

296
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:24,393
for your mission and your vision.

297
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,454
How do you think about the
organizational evolution?

298
00:12:29,454 --> 00:12:33,030
When you look at physical fraud and cyber,

299
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:35,610
they're traditionally in
different reporting lines,

300
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:37,180
different executive leadership,

301
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,943
separate reporting structures.

302
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,810
You know, as I look through this

303
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:43,819
and not through how to do this,

304
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:46,220
I didn't hesitate to talk to HR,

305
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:48,140
organizational change people,

306
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:50,507
have them look at reporting
structures and say,

307
00:12:50,507 --> 00:12:54,030
"Well, wait why are you doing
it this way versus this way?"

308
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,890
And one of the really great things,

309
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:57,840
and it's noted here on the slide

310
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:01,570
was how do you keep the functional essence

311
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:04,550
and retain that beauty,
but also enable the change?

312
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:07,680
It's really hard, but it's
really really impactful

313
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,300
when you can make that happen.

314
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,250
So initially you'll
probably get to one word.

315
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,330
You'll still have three pillars.

316
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:15,320
Over time though, what you wanna get to

317
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:18,930
is fused functions and
functions that make sense

318
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:20,689
not all functions that I
may mention may make sense

319
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:24,530
for your company, but I
think they probably would

320
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:26,620
and really bringing
those functions together,

321
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:30,040
fusing them so that it's not a pillar,

322
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,060
it's really the essence of the functions,

323
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,173
but the beauty of the fusion together.

324
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:37,670
And again, make sure
you have others help you

325
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:38,502
think about it.

326
00:13:38,503 --> 00:13:40,730
Organizational change agents, HR,

327
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:42,450
people who aren't living it day-to-day,

328
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:44,230
who can maybe have a fresh perspective

329
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:46,310
and something different that will help you

330
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:48,833
be even more effective as you do this.

331
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,150
So, now that you've really
defined your first steps,

332
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,930
you wanna also make sure as part of that

333
00:13:56,930 --> 00:14:00,120
you think about what are
you gonna converge first?

334
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,940
How do you think about what are the most

335
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,990
critical areas to converge first?

336
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:06,930
I'm gonna talk about threat intelligence,

337
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:09,770
incident response, and
operations monitoring.

338
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:12,660
There are also areas of
convergence like identity

339
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:16,170
and insider threat that
are also very important.

340
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:18,500
I'm gonna focus on these
three and talk a little bit

341
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,533
about the latter two at the end of this.

342
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:25,569
So, threat intelligence.

343
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:27,010
Threat intelligence to me

344
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:29,230
is something that leads your program

345
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:31,370
an intelligence led program.

346
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,100
And I use the word glue

347
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,370
because it does drive priority, right?

348
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:36,880
Intelligence may tell you

349
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,380
that there's something tactical happening,

350
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,100
but there also may be something strategic

351
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,980
that's gonna occur that
you need to pivot to

352
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:46,050
or potentially invest in
it's new or different.

353
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:49,479
How many of us would have
expected solar winds?

354
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,410
We think we all knew that there
were some risks and issues

355
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:53,900
in our supply chain,

356
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,370
but, did we ever think
that was necessarily

357
00:14:56,370 --> 00:15:00,310
gonna happen at that complexity
and scale, maybe not.

358
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:02,989
But intelligence is really that
glue to drive the priority.

359
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:05,450
So when that happen, how
do you respond to it?

360
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:06,630
How do you act?

361
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:07,610
What do you invest in?

362
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:10,280
How do you change those
priorities for your company?

363
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:13,360
But how do you really take
that information and enrich it?

364
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,530
When you look at physical fraud and cyber

365
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:18,270
and you wanna bring these
specialties together

366
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:20,140
you wanna have threat intelligence.

367
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,780
If you don't have a threat Intel function

368
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,780
you can build this from the ground up

369
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:26,069
but maybe you had a
cyber threat Intel team.

370
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:29,270
Well, let's built in the
physical and fraud into that.

371
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:31,300
You know, physical folks really typically

372
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:33,400
have good coordination
with law enforcement.

373
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,030
They often come from law
enforcement types of roles.

374
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:38,860
Well, you know what, let
them keep that interaction

375
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,020
in that specialty.

376
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:42,360
In cyber, these folks
are often really good

377
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,830
with communicating with legal internally,

378
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:48,350
or doing threat hunting, let
them keep that specialty.

379
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:50,070
In fraud, they're very good

380
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:52,190
about customer interaction,
customer education.

381
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:54,241
They're often on the forefronts
of talking with customers

382
00:15:54,241 --> 00:15:56,449
or other teams in your organization

383
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:58,010
that may talk to customers,

384
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:00,290
make sure you allow that to happen.

385
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:03,180
But across them have the
seen common mechanism

386
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,930
for your intelligence request

387
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:07,709
your delivery of intelligence information,

388
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:09,260
and really that executive reporting

389
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,860
across all three of those.

390
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:14,270
And then strategically, you
want something that wraps around

391
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:16,949
looking at what is our
reporting, what our requirements,

392
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:18,600
how are we managing the vendors?

393
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,803
How do we ingest that data
and really take action on it?

394
00:16:21,803 --> 00:16:23,650
One thing too, I wanna mention here

395
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,620
is don't assume that a traditional tool,

396
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,840
perhaps that your traditional cyber tool

397
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:31,160
couldn't potentially be pivoted
to get physical information,

398
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:34,089
make sure that whatever tools you use,

399
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:36,100
you try to see if there
are some that can kind

400
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,640
of cross those three pillars for you.

401
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,470
And then industry organizations.

402
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:42,210
There are a lot of industry
organizations out there

403
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:43,910
that actually have all three pillars,

404
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:46,510
join those, have your
teams connect into those,

405
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:49,720
have them be part of the
threat intelligence journey,

406
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,160
really bringing it together
is incredibly important.

407
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,610
Whether you have nothing
or you may be just have

408
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:58,000
the cyber piece, you then
wanna bring in people

409
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,870
that do have fraud background,
or physical background.

410
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,650
You don't necessarily
wanna take a cyber person

411
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:04,869
and train them in fiscal
fraud intelligence,

412
00:17:04,869 --> 00:17:06,540
'cause they haven't lived the role.

413
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,649
They can cross train as they learn,

414
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:10,920
but you really wanna bring
in some critical specialties

415
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,270
and have this roll up to a single leader

416
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,730
can make sure that things are cross

417
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:16,630
coordinated across all of them.

418
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:18,980
So again, one of your first steps

419
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:21,893
that you could do in
converging threat intelligence.

420
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:31,230
One of the next areas to
consider is incident management.

421
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:33,092
You know, I mentioned earlier

422
00:17:33,092 --> 00:17:36,140
that response is really important.

423
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,550
A lot of us in security
whether it's physical fraud

424
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:39,930
or cyber, we're wired, right?

425
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:43,600
We're wired to respond, we've
got a passion to do this.

426
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,830
We're just like those firefighters
and policemen out there.

427
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,110
We want to do our jobs

428
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:51,459
and protect and defend
what we're entrusted to do.

429
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:55,170
And while intelligence kind
of is a glue in one way,

430
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:57,720
this is really a glue to drive response

431
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,473
in a coordinated fashion.

432
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:03,000
Often what you'll find is each pillar

433
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,060
may have its own methods.

434
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:06,903
Some may be more mature
than others or less mature.

435
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,090
You'll often find, I think probably

436
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:11,919
some of the more mature
ones in the cyberspace,

437
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,510
but bringing them all together

438
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:15,240
can be really really impactful

439
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,120
because you can train your responders

440
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:21,100
and your coordinators on how
to have common mechanisms

441
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,320
and how to ask the right questions.

442
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,200
And when you hire people
into incident management,

443
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,390
they can come from critical
incident management,

444
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:30,250
IT incident management,

445
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,810
and then figuring out how to train them

446
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,810
and help them understand
fraud, physical and cyber,

447
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:36,639
'cause this group is really
gonna coordinate and lead

448
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,970
your efforts throughout this.

449
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:41,530
But they're gonna pull in SMEs

450
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:43,190
from other parts of your company,

451
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:44,750
have them pull the SMEs in,

452
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:47,820
have them learn who those SMEs are.

453
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:50,909
Together, this function
really will coordinate

454
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:53,710
and have consistent messaging
to your lines of business

455
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:55,100
to your critical incident management

456
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,283
or even your IT incident management.

457
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,010
You'll notice here on this slide

458
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:02,170
there's a capital S priority.

459
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:04,220
When you think about technology incidents,

460
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:09,010
we often talk about
them in P1, P2, P3, P4.

461
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:10,890
Well, the same thing for security.

462
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:13,620
How do you define what a security S1 is?

463
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:16,310
Or S2, S3, S4?

464
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:20,270
I would suggest make it simple,
potentially use two things.

465
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:23,760
What was the monetary impact
or ongoing monetary impact?

466
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,510
And what's the customer impact

467
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:27,910
whether it be internal
customers or external customers

468
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:30,270
specifically if your internal customers

469
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:33,540
and you're responding to an
insider threat type of issue.

470
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,210
I didn't put insider threat on here

471
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:37,450
but I think you can also infuse

472
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:40,410
insider threat into this capability.

473
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:43,270
But you wanna kinda
make that a little more,

474
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:46,790
maybe closed, maybe underprivileged
or something like that

475
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:48,883
depending upon what may be going on.

476
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,340
And again, at the end of
this, what have you learned?

477
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:56,020
How do you communicate the
beauty of bringing this together?

478
00:19:56,020 --> 00:20:00,379
Quarterly, monthly, meet with
your businesses, share that,

479
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:02,470
but also in collaboration
with your businesses,

480
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:05,620
build those playbooks
for fraud as an example,

481
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:09,750
if you're dealing with
folks that are banking

482
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,050
or whether it's a commercial
client or retail client,

483
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:13,680
your response is going to be different

484
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,570
engage your business folks,
make sure they're at the table

485
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:18,419
to build that playbook together.

486
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,980
Don't assume you know it all.

487
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,380
Because by doing that you can
really bring a lot of power

488
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:25,763
to the function and the glue
that you're driving here.

489
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:30,360
So, incident response, intelligence,

490
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,169
these two things are very important

491
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:33,557
because they really
can drive your spending

492
00:20:33,557 --> 00:20:36,020
and your priority on what you need to do.

493
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:39,110
And incidents, you can learn
so much from incidents.

494
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:41,740
I love joining technology P1 calls,

495
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,890
because I learned so much from them,

496
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:46,360
really, really, important
and security incidents.

497
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:49,360
You can also a lot, and your
businesses can learn a lot,

498
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,510
and you together, again
we can make this better

499
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:54,540
for the entire company.

500
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:58,050
So, that's incident
management, what's next?

501
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:59,870
How about a fusion center?

502
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:01,860
Many of us in the industry have
talked about fusion centers

503
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:05,270
for some time, but these
centers really bring the beauty

504
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:07,460
of monitoring for cyber.

505
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:10,460
So your traditional cyber
sock, your fraud operations,

506
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:13,260
your physical insider monitoring

507
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,690
you bring it together, right?

508
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:17,860
You share the intelligence,
you share case management,

509
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:22,449
you share what means in
event, in alert, in incident.

510
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:25,340
What then goes into the
incident response team?

511
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:27,060
But really having a common data plane.

512
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:29,830
Your common data plane may be just a SIM.

513
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:33,010
And then you may get to
kind of a big data platform.

514
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:35,930
But having that common data
plane is really important

515
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:38,490
because it'll help you
really look at those things

516
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:40,760
that may seem myopic in one area

517
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,600
but when you look at them together,

518
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,370
it's much broader and much more important.

519
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:48,239
So, bring these teams together

520
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,790
have them learn from each other

521
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:54,080
see what you can automate and
how do you really determine

522
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,810
that you're all responding consistently.

523
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:58,360
You have a consistent
way, consistent method,

524
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:01,639
and that you're using
that to ignite the power

525
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,220
of bringing the teams together.

526
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:05,240
You're also gonna need a strong leader

527
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,460
in this particular role who can pivot

528
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,200
between these things quickly,

529
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,993
and adjust and lead these teams
from an agility perspective.

530
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,300
And I talked about insider
threat and identity.

531
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,790
When you look at identity
physical and logical,

532
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:22,290
physical and cyber, there's
a lot of things there

533
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:23,399
from that perspective

534
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,380
that can be brought together in insider.

535
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,020
You typically have your technical channel,

536
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:30,500
or your cyber and your
financial channel or your fraud,

537
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,927
bring those together as well.

538
00:22:31,927 --> 00:22:34,219
You can infuse those
into your fusion center.

539
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:36,630
Again, this is about how you decide

540
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:38,370
to bring these functions together,

541
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:40,199
to preserve their essence,

542
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,000
and ignite the beauty of the fusion.

543
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:48,720
So, what about the power of
data automation and measurement?

544
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:50,467
Now, when you bring these together,

545
00:22:50,467 --> 00:22:53,543
you also wanna have a
way that you can explain,

546
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:55,760
why did it matter?

547
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,980
Here's what you got
executive leadership team

548
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:00,630
for allowing us to bring
these functions together.

549
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:02,150
How do you measure that?

550
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:04,250
How do you automate, how
do you think through that

551
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,060
so that you actually can have the benefit

552
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:09,240
of bringing all of those
functions together?

553
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,040
Now you can use this converged data

554
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:14,440
to really drive decisioning
and drive better decisions

555
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,590
and drive better automation

556
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:18,653
instead of looking at
atomic parts of information.

557
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,973
So, some examples from
a converged data plane.

558
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:30,310
So, you might initially think,
"Hmm, impossible geography."

559
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,500
What does that mean?

560
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:35,030
So, maybe someone is
sitting in New York City

561
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:37,700
and someone lost their badge

562
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,740
or maybe they gave it to somebody.

563
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:41,320
And they're actually going into a facility

564
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,820
that you have in San Francisco.

565
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:45,020
Well, how's that possible?

566
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,777
So you can use the power of,

567
00:23:46,777 --> 00:23:49,233
"Hey, someone's logged
into the network here

568
00:23:49,233 --> 00:23:52,557
"and it's this person
'cause they've authenticated

569
00:23:52,557 --> 00:23:54,750
"but they've actually
tried to badge in here."

570
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:56,030
Well, there's no way physically

571
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:58,840
you could be doing that at the same time.

572
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,580
So, that would be some kind of alert.

573
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:02,010
It could be an insider threat issue.

574
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:03,910
It could be simply
someone lost their badge

575
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:05,280
and didn't report it.

576
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,660
But it's important to know
about impossible geography

577
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,410
and again, bringing together the power

578
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:12,930
of physical information
and cyber information

579
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:14,690
to make those decisions.

580
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:17,660
Contractor management,
when you think about this,

581
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,340
we all went home to work, right?

582
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:21,270
In global pandemic.

583
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:23,950
Our contracting firms
also went home to work.

584
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:25,617
So things that we were used to

585
00:24:25,617 --> 00:24:27,360
and things like offshore
development centers

586
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,199
didn't exist anymore.

587
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,940
So now we had to really
think about how do we know

588
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,670
that these folks are logging in

589
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:36,267
from where they're supposed to be,

590
00:24:36,267 --> 00:24:38,770
and how do we know that folks are working

591
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:40,810
the hours that they're supposed to be?

592
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:43,200
So, using that data.

593
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,690
And again, some physical
elements, cyber elements,

594
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:50,534
but also use to inform third-party risk,

595
00:24:50,534 --> 00:24:53,900
third-party risk management
and financial risk management,

596
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:56,140
to make sure that there was alerting

597
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:58,300
when things were not normal.

598
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,220
And when there might've been

599
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:02,410
some kind of unexpected
access during times

600
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:05,120
that weren't normal working times.

601
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,939
And I'm gonna talk a little
bit about third party risk

602
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,650
because if someone says they're working

603
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:10,490
they need to be working.

604
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:11,323
And if they're not,

605
00:25:11,323 --> 00:25:13,300
you're creating a financial
risk for your company.

606
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:15,899
You can also use this data to help inform

607
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,250
the third party risk program,

608
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:20,700
about the financial part
of that risk program,

609
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,440
and then cyber and fraud.

610
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,670
When you think about adversaries out there

611
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:25,810
what are they doing?

612
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:27,440
They're trying to use the same passwords

613
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,790
they find from multiple breaches.

614
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:32,379
So how do you understand
how that's potentially

615
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,970
hitting your organization?

616
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:36,110
You know, looking at failed login attempts

617
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:39,459
people trying to guess passwords,
how do you look at that?

618
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:42,010
And then how do you compare
that to fraudulent activity

619
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:44,570
or account takeover
that might be occurring?

620
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:47,990
And really bring the
power of account lockout,

621
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:51,820
account log in attempts,
along with fraudulent activity

622
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,570
for those compromised credentials.

623
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:56,000
And again bringing cyber
and fraud together.

624
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,840
This is what a converged
data plane can do for you.

625
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,330
And again, you may start out initially

626
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:01,790
with kind of separate towers

627
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:03,950
and you may be bringing it
together with conversations

628
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:06,150
but that's okay, 'cause
eventually you're gonna get

629
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:08,850
to bringing this data together
in a common data plane.

630
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:14,220
So, how do we transform our work?

631
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:17,500
How do we actually deliver
on what Daniel Pink says

632
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,620
knowledge workers want?

633
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:19,526
How do we do that?

634
00:26:19,527 --> 00:26:21,880
How do we make sure that happens?

635
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,530
Well, there's something
here called Click-Ops.

636
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:26,010
Let me explain what that is.

637
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:27,643
Click-Ops is essentially,

638
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:32,020
repetitive button clicking along the way,

639
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:34,330
or sometimes you'll
hear culture swiveling.

640
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:36,510
I look at this screen, then
this screen, then this screen

641
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:41,090
then this screen, or even
we often here call toil.

642
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:42,990
People don't wanna do that all day.

643
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:45,960
And when you look at that toil,
it not only exist in cyber

644
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:49,580
but it exist in fraud,
it exists in physical.

645
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:50,990
But when you look at cyber,

646
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:53,090
many of us have have used security,

647
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:56,490
orchestration, automation,
and response or SOC platforms,

648
00:26:56,490 --> 00:27:00,210
to do things for kind of
level one cyber SOC functions.

649
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:02,870
What if you could actually automate 80%

650
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:06,280
of whose level one functions,
compress your gearing ratio,

651
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,040
not ask the business for more people

652
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:11,270
because you've actually used
the power of automation,

653
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:13,930
but you've also transformed
the way someone works, right?

654
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:16,380
You've given them the ability

655
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:19,550
to maybe take an extra online class,

656
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:21,919
read articles, even threat hunt.

657
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,750
You've enabled those level one SOC folks,

658
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:27,350
to actually start to
transform what they do,

659
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:29,850
and get more towards that
level two level three,

660
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:32,159
or potentially even add capacity

661
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,600
to start looking at physical operations

662
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,100
or fraud operations as part of that.

663
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:39,459
You want to do that more curious work.

664
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:43,250
This is part of how you wanna
light up that F-ovation.

665
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:46,940
And do those cyber tools work and extend

666
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,040
to fraud and physical?

667
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:51,080
Can they, if they do we'll, then try them.

668
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:54,290
But if not, there are other
tools out there can do robotics

669
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:56,758
can do the button clicking
to help the humans

670
00:27:56,758 --> 00:28:00,980
ignite themselves and get more
interested and more curious.

671
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:03,260
That's why we can look at these beyond,

672
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:05,040
just a traditional cyber pillar.

673
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,376
Think across this across multiple pillars.

674
00:28:07,376 --> 00:28:08,870
And I use the word pillars here,

675
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:11,479
'cause you still may be
in a pillar formation,

676
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,910
but as you fuse the functions

677
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:16,000
really try to look at common
capabilities that you can use

678
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,310
across those that allow
you to transform that work

679
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:21,840
and allow people to be F-ovative.

680
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,983
You can do it, it will be fun.

681
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:30,540
So, this concept here
measuring your time to respond,

682
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:32,210
CrowdStrike actually did this study

683
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:35,170
I think of about 25,000 or so breaches.

684
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:39,180
And what they found is it took
about one hour and 58 minutes

685
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:41,960
for someone to get in and
start to move laterally.

686
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,970
So the concept here is
to detect in one minute,

687
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:47,260
investigate in 10, and respondent in 60,

688
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:49,560
and that's all within
the 60 minute period.

689
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:52,000
So that one minute, if you took one minute

690
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,220
it would now be 59 minutes.

691
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,120
If you took the 10 minutes

692
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:57,879
you'd still have 50 minutes
to kind of finish the response

693
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:01,200
but we've gotta be faster,
we've got to be more agile,

694
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,170
and bringing these teams together,

695
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:06,390
and the data can actually
help you be more agile

696
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:10,170
in responding to maybe a new
fraud, a new physical attack

697
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:14,250
that maybe, going into a
building where you have computers

698
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:16,880
and things like that, that
could be a cyber issue.

699
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,320
You've got to have that information

700
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,876
so you can respond faster.

701
00:29:20,876 --> 00:29:24,879
Traditionally, some folks may
think this is aspirational.

702
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,260
And I think sometimes
you can see it that way.

703
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:30,050
However, if you don't measure it and try

704
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:32,889
how do you ever get to
achieve the aspiration?

705
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:36,710
So, when you look at cyber incidents

706
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:38,600
we've used this to actually look

707
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,260
at how long does it take to respond

708
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:43,990
to something whether low,
medium, or high or even critical?

709
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:47,500
And how do you continue
to improve that response?

710
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,430
The next step is really
how do you use this

711
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:51,520
for physical and fraud?

712
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,840
And actually have the
capability to monitor.

713
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:58,840
Oftentimes, this data can be
in a SIM or something like that

714
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,390
but how do you make sure when you build in

715
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:03,280
your alert response, you have the ability

716
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:06,399
to track the analyst and how they respond,

717
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,280
not only to help your overall response,

718
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:11,750
but understand where some
analysts may need more training,

719
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:14,520
and more investment to
get to them to that one,

720
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:17,150
10 and 60 and continue to shrink that.

721
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:21,480
So you and your company can
stay ahead of the adversary

722
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,350
and stop those potential breaches.

723
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:25,030
That's what you wanna do.

724
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:27,080
You don't wanna necessarily
be in the paper.

725
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,949
I mean, once you're in the
paper, it's a lot more money

726
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:31,410
than if you can stop that attack

727
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:33,173
much earlier in the life cycle.

728
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:39,430
And so with that, what should
you take back to your company?

729
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:43,883
Well, here's some things to think about.

730
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:48,210
Keep this in mind, we've just
gone through this presentation

731
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:52,540
re-listen to the video, talk about it,

732
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:55,670
start framing your
conversation, start with your,

733
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:57,460
how would you frame this
with your executives?

734
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,410
What leadership support would you need?

735
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:02,998
Start building that out,
start thinking about that.

736
00:31:02,998 --> 00:31:06,190
the first three months
you really wanna see

737
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:08,440
about gaining that executive support.

738
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,740
What would your organizational model be?

739
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:13,390
What areas would you initially convert?

740
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:16,350
So for example, maybe
there's a brand new function

741
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:18,899
it's an easy convergence,
'cause it's a brand new build

742
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,710
and maybe people don't bring

743
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:22,600
some of their baggage with them,

744
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:25,300
but maybe it's where
you have that function

745
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,600
that already exists,

746
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,469
and is one of the pillars
and you build around it.

747
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:31,170
How are you gonna measure this success

748
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:33,130
and tell your executive leadership team

749
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:35,640
what they got for their support?

750
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,890
And what is your plan to get
to that common data plane?

751
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:38,970
What do you have in place today?

752
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:41,030
Do you have a SIM?

753
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:43,879
Do you have a big data team?

754
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,160
Is there other things
you need to look for?

755
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,370
Are there other more innovative ways

756
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:49,860
that are appearing to actually pull

757
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,879
that common data plane together,

758
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:54,770
versus kind of iterating over time?

759
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:57,910
And then, in the next six months or so,

760
00:31:57,910 --> 00:32:00,340
start converging functional convergence.

761
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:02,080
You don't have to do them all at once,

762
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,020
you can do one at a time.

763
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:06,970
Make sure though that staff
understand it's coming

764
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:07,803
because you don't want them to go,

765
00:32:07,803 --> 00:32:10,270
"Well, wait a minute is
my team next is my team?"

766
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:12,570
You need to lay out the
plan, so they understand

767
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:15,460
that it's coming full transparency
is incredibly important

768
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:17,043
in this organizational change.

769
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:21,220
And also make sure you have
a way to start thinking

770
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:23,400
about standing up that common data plane,

771
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,483
and you've got the support and
funding to make that happen.

772
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:30,290
Thank you for attending.

773
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:33,720
It was incredibly great for
us to spend time together.

774
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,950
Talk about this capability and how you too

775
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:39,730
can start to plan to
ignite your organization

776
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:41,540
with the essence of the functions,

777
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:43,300
and the beauty of the fusion.

778
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:45,379
Thank you so much, have a great day.

779
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,027
Look forward to your questions.
