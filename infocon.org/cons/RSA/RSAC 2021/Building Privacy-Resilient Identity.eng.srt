1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:02,170
- Hello everyone, and welcome

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:04,500
to Building Privacy-Resilient Identity.

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:05,670
My name is Ankur Patel.

4
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:09,190
I'm a Program Manager on the
identity team at Microsoft.

5
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:10,760
And with me is Daniel.

6
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,420
Daniel is with our standards team

7
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,320
and he leads the standards work

8
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,900
around verifiable credentials
and decentralized identity.

9
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,770
- Hey there Ankur, great to be here.

10
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,100
- Thanks man.

11
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,990
So, I wanna open the conversation with

12
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:26,330
why this topic is so important to us.

13
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:30,040
At Microsoft we believe that every person

14
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:34,780
and business deserves an
opportunity to achieve their best.

15
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:37,373
We believe that starts
with establishing trust.

16
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,160
As Satya said previously,
"all of us will have

17
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,083
to rethink about digital experiences.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,269
We create experiences
that are rooted in privacy

19
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,600
as a fundamental human right

20
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,497
will be a bedrock for
experiences going forward."

21
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:58,070
Today, more than 128 countries

22
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:00,190
have some form of legislation underway

23
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:04,379
whether it's drafted or
in practice like GDPR

24
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:06,440
as in the case of European Union

25
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,300
or in California it's CCPA.

26
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,130
In each of these cases, organizations

27
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:15,240
are facing increasing responsibility

28
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,449
across a wide variety of topics when

29
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:19,060
it comes to handling data.

30
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:21,230
Whether it's how we capture information

31
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:22,670
what's the minimum set of information

32
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:26,500
that we can request of users,
of employees, of partners.

33
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,800
How do we use it?

34
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,850
How do we present it to
regulators and auditors?

35
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:35,720
As well as data subjects
to prove suitable use

36
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,973
of such important information.

37
00:01:39,087 --> 00:01:40,323
This is not easy to do.

38
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:45,680
So what if we could verify
such information at scale

39
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,700
while protecting privacy?

40
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,950
This was one of the key questions

41
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,840
we found ourselves answering for Microsoft

42
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,483
but then for our customers as well.

43
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:57,070
What we discovered,

44
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:59,720
is that conventional
privacy management focuses

45
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,773
on finding personal information
that has been collected.

46
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,950
But often this information
is trapped across many silos

47
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,610
whether it's for employee purposes

48
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:11,223
or partner management
or consumer management.

49
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,000
And they have different
regulatory requirements

50
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,290
depending on the use
rights associated with it,

51
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,120
with the geography in which such scenarios

52
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,920
are being experienced.

53
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,410
And ultimately that results in
a lack of actionable insights

54
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:27,960
for what information does
a business need to retain

55
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,410
and manage on an ongoing basis,

56
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:33,303
or needed it at some point in time.

57
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:36,430
The net result of it is

58
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:40,540
a cumbersome, complicated
and high level of assurance

59
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:43,870
and risk processes around
keeping track of information

60
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:46,823
and proving compliant use
rights associated with it.

61
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,769
So we challenged ourselves to imagine

62
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,340
a different form of identity system.

63
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,640
So this slide used to have a title

64
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:59,029
called Incubation Hypothesis
for us four years ago.

65
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:02,120
Now it's the North Star
of identity at Microsoft.

66
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,450
We believe each of us
needs a digital identity

67
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,320
that we own and control,

68
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,340
one with securely and privately stores

69
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,920
all elements of our digital identity.

70
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,450
Now us here could represent
a person, a business

71
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:16,230
maybe a device, maybe
you want an application

72
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:19,602
or a service that represents
such persons and organizations.

73
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:22,720
But ultimately we also
believe that it needs

74
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,220
to fit seamlessly into our existing lives

75
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:27,830
or internet or business processes.

76
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:29,260
It would be a failure if we have

77
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:32,750
to reinvent a whole new technology stack

78
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,340
in order for such a solution to be useful.

79
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,200
So let's take a look at a demo

80
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,399
of what this new
experience could look like.

81
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:45,520
So here on my screen, we have a flow

82
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:49,220
where we are trying to
remotely onboard and employee.

83
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,609
This is a very common scenario

84
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:52,650
that just about every business faces.

85
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:55,490
Onboarding new employees,
partners, customers

86
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,350
or anyone else for that matter.

87
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,880
So let's imagine we received an email

88
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,579
to welcome us to the company.

89
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,840
In this case, we are Matthew Michael

90
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,660
and you're asked to as

91
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:10,230
is often the case
perform background check.

92
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:13,040
In our case number of
ID verification partners

93
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,829
around the world are leaning in with us

94
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:18,600
to explore identity verification
based on open standards.

95
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,250
So here's what Michael's
experience could look like.

96
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,810
In this case they're now clicking through

97
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,180
and going through a partner website

98
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,490
in this case it's TrueID

99
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:28,830
a fictitious ID verification
company for this demo.

100
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:32,890
And Woodgrove as a customer
has agreed on a policy

101
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:36,680
to verify their selfie and
their government issued ID.

102
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,960
Now, of course, this experience
could be as complicated

103
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,409
as the customer would like to make it.

104
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,950
It could even include
come see me in person.

105
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,110
But given COVID and remote verification

106
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:47,750
and remote onboarding
being a common place now.

107
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,330
Imagine you're asked to upload a selfie

108
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:52,310
and a government issued document.

109
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:55,840
ID verification partners
today are capable of

110
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,950
not only matching the
selfie of this person

111
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,250
to the state issued document.

112
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,870
In this case it's a driver's license

113
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:06,110
but they can do so across 192 countries,

114
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,490
6,000 different document types.

115
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:10,630
Now, of course, this is a
commonplace when it comes

116
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:12,540
to financial industries like banks.

117
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,270
They have been doing document verification

118
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,123
such as this for a long time.

119
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:22,530
But what's different now, is every user

120
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:25,590
can just as easily now scan such a QR code

121
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:28,859
that is issued at the end of
this verification process.

122
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:29,810
Type in

123
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:34,503
this pin which establishes
trust for remote signing.

124
00:05:35,432 --> 00:05:36,990
And

125
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:39,660
upon doing so I can accept this card

126
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:42,130
just like I would have
accepted a card from

127
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,560
any digital wallet today on the internet.

128
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:48,159
If we tap on this credential,

129
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,110
it shows not only the name was verified.

130
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:53,400
And then this was a genuine document.

131
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,780
The selfie was verified

132
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,159
but also the address that goes with it.

133
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,590
Now such a credential can be
presented back to the employer

134
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:03,210
and you can say, I've
completed my background check.

135
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:06,440
What used to take days,

136
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,820
time and money and personal information

137
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,840
being peanut buttered
all over the internet.

138
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,960
Is now under the user's control.

139
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,469
They can present such a credential

140
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:17,050
by just scanning a QR code

141
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:19,730
and upon verifying the employer

142
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:22,223
can give me access to the Employee Portal.

143
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:27,539
The employee now can
continue the journey instead

144
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,830
of getting usernames and
passwords being issued again.

145
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,510
They can get a digitally signed credential

146
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:33,700
from their employer, which
I can take possession of

147
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,763
by giving my employee ID number.

148
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,880
And now I have these two credentials.

149
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,390
One of the first things
that most people do

150
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,580
when they get their new job

151
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,979
is order some sort of computer.

152
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,220
So we've all gone through
retail websites like these

153
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,890
and signed up for corporate discount.

154
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:51,880
So in this case, I'm going to sign up

155
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:55,310
for proving that I work at a given company

156
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:57,133
by using usernames and passwords.

157
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:01,070
But how many such websites
would a retailer federate with?

158
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,920
So instead in this new world,

159
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,310
they're able to scan this QR code

160
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:07,380
and prove that they work at Woodgrove

161
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,940
with the tap of a button

162
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,380
And I get my corporate discount.

163
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:16,719
Furthermore, if I click on this credential

164
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,350
recent activity shows when
was this credential issue

165
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:20,800
to whom did I present?

166
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,600
And the user has far greater insight into

167
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,340
what information they're sharing,

168
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:27,063
with whom, for what purpose?

169
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:31,163
So this is a quick overview
of what's possible today.

170
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,470
So in this demo, we just looked

171
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:36,070
at how based on open standards

172
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:38,640
issuers can issue
credentials that can be used

173
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,979
at a wide variety of places

174
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:43,590
and not require the user to create

175
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:45,380
different usernames and passwords

176
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,409
with every website they interact with

177
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:50,310
and further give control to the user

178
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,533
for such information.

179
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:55,350
So we believe by extending the familiar

180
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,790
multi-factor authentication.

181
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:58,080
So in our case, what you noticed

182
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,960
was Microsoft Authenticator app

183
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,940
being used to not only prove

184
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,469
that you had possession of some credential

185
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:05,430
but presented to a wide
variety of websites

186
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:06,980
just like you were used to presenting it

187
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,740
for your own company.

188
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,740
So on the left side is your
Microsoft Authenticator

189
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,130
that you are used to doing
multi-factor authentication.

190
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:16,560
On the right side what you're
seeing is the evolution

191
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,490
which includes now this open
standards base authentication

192
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:22,330
and presentation flows.

193
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:24,890
Which enables a user to
have a more verifiable way

194
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:26,719
of presenting their information.

195
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,400
A more transparent way to understand

196
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,099
what was shared with whom
and for what purpose.

197
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,539
And ultimately have a convenient way

198
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:35,933
to track such information
and how it's been used.

199
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,220
In the coming weeks and months we'll

200
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,100
be building some features
which allow the user

201
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,760
to further restrict use rights
directly from their phone

202
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,010
instead of having to figure out

203
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:45,910
all the other websites I have visited.

204
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:51,580
So this work is based on open standards.

205
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:52,560
A lot of this work started

206
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,219
in Decentralized Identity Foundation.

207
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:58,740
And the standards have
been ratified in W3C.

208
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,320
The bedrock of this technology

209
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,470
is based on Decentralized Identifier

210
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:03,973
and Verifiable Credentials.

211
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,760
Now, in a traditional identity system

212
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,510
a user has a User Agent

213
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:13,360
which is provided by the identity system

214
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,803
such as a Microsoft account or
your favorite social network.

215
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,449
But the user doesn't have

216
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:22,970
the actual keys under their control.

217
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:24,880
They're sitting in a directory system

218
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,623
in a centralized identity provider role.

219
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,250
In a Decentralized System,
the users have a User Agent

220
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:36,500
like Microsoft Authenticator
being an implementation of it.

221
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:41,330
Where their biometrics or pin
are used to protect such keys.

222
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,430
And we use Blockchain to publish the state

223
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:44,762
of the latest set of keys.

224
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:49,310
Using a client implementation
of Universal Resolver

225
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:51,160
and open source library.

226
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:54,060
All participating
parties have equal access

227
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:57,959
to resolving these identifiers
and the state of keys.

228
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,480
As a result, any application

229
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,140
can request a credential of the user,

230
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:06,290
verify independently who issued it

231
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:08,730
and if this is the user who
should be presenting it.

232
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:11,220
This is very different than
a traditional identity system

233
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,790
where anybody possessing
a username and password

234
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:16,163
can pretend to be that person.

235
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:19,709
In such a decentralized world now,

236
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:21,530
we can decentralize verification

237
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:23,403
and establishing trustworthiness.

238
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:28,370
What I just demonstrated to you

239
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:32,040
was our platform implementation
of such open standards.

240
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,300
You can use Azure Active Directory

241
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,310
to configure an issue such a credential...

242
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:38,739
Such as a Verified Employee Credential.

243
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:41,900
You can use our developer APIs and SDKs

244
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,439
to request and verify such information.

245
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,030
And the end user wallet
is Microsoft Authenticator

246
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:48,980
to request and verify such information.

247
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:53,510
We believe such a tech
approach can help transform

248
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:57,170
our everyday scenarios
to be more trustworthy,

249
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:59,510
faster and easier for users to use

250
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:01,540
and ultimately result in reducing cost

251
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:04,120
and complexity for everyone involved

252
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:09,120
while improving control across
each of the stakeholders

253
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:11,453
whether it's issuers,
verifiers or end users.

254
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,350
But much more work remains on going beyond

255
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:18,580
just enabling this basic control.

256
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,860
We believe we can do better

257
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,650
in terms of limiting
disclosure and correlation.

258
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:24,610
So I wanna invite Daniel
Buchner from our team

259
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:28,000
who leads our standards work
on inventing some new ways

260
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,370
with the community and
collaborating with them

261
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:33,240
for imagining new ways
that we can restrict

262
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,880
such correlation and improve privacy.

263
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,713
Daniel.

264
00:11:36,713 --> 00:11:37,560
- Thanks, Ankur.

265
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,109
Yeah, like Ankur was saying

266
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:40,640
we have more to do in the privacy front.

267
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,660
So, I'm gonna walk you
through a few of the things

268
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,040
that we have planned
to enhance the privacy

269
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,790
of the systems that we're building.

270
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:50,240
Now, one of the first things we wanna do

271
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,920
is reduce the correlation points

272
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,860
in some of these identity systems.

273
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,580
When you're transferring credentials

274
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,530
getting them issued by issuers

275
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:00,209
users presenting them to verifiers

276
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:03,880
and verifiers doing revocation
checks, for instance.

277
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,410
There are many points at
which there's communication

278
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:08,819
between these parties where

279
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,490
you can essentially disclose

280
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:13,540
what and when is occurring
and when you may not have to.

281
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:16,230
So, all of those little disclosures

282
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:18,280
can leak little bits
of privacy information

283
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,370
and working with the community.

284
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:22,780
We have ways that we're going about trying

285
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,579
to remove some of those.

286
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,820
Some of the ways we're doing this is

287
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:28,310
by implementing Zero-K
Proof, Credential schemes

288
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:30,479
like BBS+ and some SNARKs based schemes

289
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:35,510
to really move some of
those communication channels

290
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:37,407
away altogether.

291
00:12:37,407 --> 00:12:39,740
And so to illustrate this right now,

292
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,750
as a user common flow

293
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,430
in some of the basic credential schemes

294
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,229
is going back to the issuer

295
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:47,390
for sort of this just in time generation

296
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:49,260
of a credential that they'd been issued

297
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,040
to present it to the verifier.

298
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,339
Now this presents a side-channel

299
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:54,340
in the sense that the
issuer then can learn.

300
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,460
You know, obviously just about

301
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:58,800
when you're going to present
a certain credential.

302
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,560
So remove this, we wanna be able

303
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,810
to generate derived credentials
on the user's device

304
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:06,650
without having to go
and speak to the issuer.

305
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:09,510
So in this example, here you can see

306
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:10,950
what occurs is now, the user

307
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:13,560
can cryptographically derive a credential

308
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,449
instead of going back
and having one issued

309
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:18,060
and present it directly to the verifier.

310
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,099
What that does is remove that channel

311
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,800
where the issuer is then
able to see what's happening.

312
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:25,480
Great for the user, same information

313
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,420
the verifier can verify
the business process

314
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,709
can still go on.

315
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:31,030
Another thing that we're doing

316
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:34,740
is implementing the W3C Status List 2021

317
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:37,230
which is a privacy preserving mechanism

318
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:40,200
by which a verifier can
check with an issuer

319
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,990
to learn whether it
credentials, for instance,

320
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:43,070
has bee revoked.

321
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:46,650
Might be like a driver's
license or something like that.

322
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:49,780
Today currently, some systems
disclose the exact credential

323
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:52,270
or user that the verifiers inquiring about

324
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:55,510
but with this Status List 2021,

325
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:57,410
standard we're able to remove that

326
00:13:57,410 --> 00:13:59,469
so that we're obscuring from the issuer

327
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:01,610
who exactly is being inquired about

328
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:04,260
what credential they're inquiring about.

329
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,810
So the next thing we're doing for privacy

330
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:07,430
is limiting disclosure.

331
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,819
And this just means like not disclosing

332
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:13,110
to verifying parties or
any other external parties

333
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:15,050
any information we don't have to, right?

334
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:17,120
We certainly wanna
facilitate the disclosure

335
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,380
of information that makes
business processes possible

336
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:23,160
and smooth interactions
between users and verifiers

337
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,160
but let's eliminate what
we don't have to disclose.

338
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,719
How we're gonna do this again

339
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,080
is by implementing certain
Zero-Knowledge Proof schemes

340
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,770
like BBS+ and SNARKs

341
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:35,530
that allow us to as you
can see here on the right

342
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:37,360
simply identify information

343
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,620
in this particular exchange
the street and city

344
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:42,600
that don't need to be disclosed
to a potential verifier.

345
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,040
And only present the
information that does need

346
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,890
to be disclosed like the birthdate

347
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:50,700
with schemes that enable
selective disclosure

348
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:54,400
and exchanged transport schemes,
like Presentation Exchange.

349
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,400
We're able to remove
those fields altogether

350
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,110
and present to the verifier,

351
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:59,180
just the information they need

352
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,979
for the business process
that engaged them.

353
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,833
So, last thing we're gonna do.

354
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,780
So additionally, we're going

355
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:09,510
to provide advanced capability
to mask data altogether.

356
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:11,550
We talked in the previous slides about

357
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:14,329
how we were going to reduce
communication side-channels.

358
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:17,870
We were going to eliminate
unnecessary disclosure.

359
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:18,703
And then the last...

360
00:15:18,703 --> 00:15:20,780
The advanced capability we wanna offer

361
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,670
is the ability to obscure certain data

362
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:24,050
even though you're presenting it.

363
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:26,250
And let's talk a little
bit about what I mean.

364
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:29,440
Over here in this example,
carrying on from the last slide

365
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,840
you see that we're disclosing
the user's birthdate

366
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,290
maybe that's required
by the business flow,

367
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:36,040
but it's for the purpose of understanding

368
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,079
whether the user's over 21.

369
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,740
Now, in this exchange
were given the exact date.

370
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:41,930
But we don't have...

371
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:44,969
If we implement certain
SNARK-based ZKP predicates schemes

372
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:47,800
and DIF Presentation Exchange features

373
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,579
as well as offer some
good libraries out there

374
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,120
for developers and companies

375
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,690
that are implementing these schemes.

376
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:55,430
What we can actually do is
provide people a mechanism

377
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:58,560
to transition from disclosing raw values

378
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,329
to disclosing simple predicates.

379
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:01,220
And the predicates are,

380
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:04,260
is basically computation
over data that allows you

381
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,260
to give people a true or false

382
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,060
a cryptographic true
or false as to whether

383
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:11,520
it meets the criteria
for a business process.

384
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,930
These are some of the more
complex schemes out there.

385
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:17,739
They certainly require being
honed and developed further.

386
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:20,950
We are really excited to work
with the community on that.

387
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:21,940
To advance some of these

388
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,780
more privacy preserving capabilities.

389
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:27,250
We wanna partner with
you out in the community

390
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,490
to collaborate and
contribute to these efforts.

391
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:31,440
Now that could look
like partnering with us

392
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,060
to identify privacy issues,

393
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,959
accelerating open standards work

394
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,150
that happens in the
Decentralized Identity Foundation

395
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:40,920
and the W3C, as well as partnering with us

396
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:45,319
on integrating these systems
into your own products

397
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,120
to help kickstart the issue
and verifier ecosystem.

398
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,660
You can learn more about this

399
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,453
at aka.ms/ownyouridentity.

400
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:54,130
Ankur

401
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:55,490
- Thank you, Daniel.

402
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:59,140
As you can see, while
we've taken as a community,

403
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:01,100
a good set of first steps to enable users

404
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,190
to have greater control
over how credentials

405
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,103
are issued,

406
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:06,990
presented and verified.

407
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:10,762
There's much more we need
to do to limit correlation,

408
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,629
enable user to have greater control how

409
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:15,339
and when that information is disclosed

410
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:16,909
and have some say in it.

411
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:20,010
And ultimately even
prevent needless disclosure

412
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:22,470
such as what Zero-Knowledge
Proofs can enable.

413
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:25,890
However, a lot more work
remains of taking these ideas.

414
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:27,640
Some of them like Zero-Knowledge Proof

415
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,010
are many decades old,

416
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:32,670
bringing these ideas to work
with the modern internet,

417
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:33,990
with current applications

418
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:36,320
that run on OpenID Connect, for example.

419
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,210
So getting these protocols standards

420
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:40,240
and implementations all to work together

421
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,510
is going to require a partnership

422
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:45,170
from all of us working together.

423
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:47,290
So we really look forward
to partnering with you

424
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:49,970
on building these new class
of issuers and verifiers

425
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:51,370
for a more trusted internet.

426
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:53,600
I would love to share with you

427
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,050
some of these resources

428
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:58,660
to help you get started.

429
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,960
As Daniel mentioned,
Decentralized Identity Foundation

430
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,010
is a key working group...

431
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:03,000
Industry working group

432
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
where a lot of these ideas are discussed.

433
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,670
We've published our own
white paper on this work

434
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,370
and it describes work that needs to occur

435
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:11,770
over many more years to come.

436
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:14,480
Some of it we've done
much more work remains

437
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,010
is a quick overview video.

438
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:19,770
There's a developer walk
through documentation

439
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:22,379
and an ongoing blog series that describes

440
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:26,040
all the details from how
might such a system scale,

441
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,879
how might recovery work

442
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,240
as a cellphone key recovery scheme.

443
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,280
And there are many more topics

444
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,540
that the community is discussing,

445
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,639
but these might be a few
set of good resources

446
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,840
to help you get started.

447
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:39,940
Thank you very much for this
opportunity to share our work

448
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:41,740
and requesting your help

449
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:45,630
to help us go build a more
privacy resilient workplace

450
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:48,210
and ultimately a more trusted internet.

451
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,043
Thank you.
