1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,700
- Good afternoon, I'm Michael Aisenberg.

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,420
I'm your moderator for
this afternoon's session

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:11,280
of Law Track 14, of the 20th year that we

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,187
from the ABA have done
a presentation entitled,

5
00:00:14,187 --> 00:00:15,320
"Hot Topics in Law."

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,810
This is "Hot Topics in
Cyber Law for 2021."

7
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:23,299
We have three distinguished
ABA based colleagues

8
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,570
joining me this afternoon.

9
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:30,570
Lucy Thomson, Steve Wu, Catherine Barrett,

10
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,860
all have been officers of the ABA Section

11
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:37,710
in Science and Technology,
and all are expert

12
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:41,123
in variety of fields
around cybersecurity law.

13
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,480
Our agenda for this afternoon will begin

14
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,870
with me giving some news headlines,

15
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:49,233
things that have happened
in the public space.

16
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,450
Catherine Barrett is going to take over

17
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:57,130
to present a discussion about
new developments arising

18
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:59,253
in the supply chain of ICT,

19
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,699
information communications technology,

20
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:06,323
and other sensitive infrastructures
during the COVID period.

21
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:09,440
Steve Wu is going to talk about the impact

22
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:13,149
of some recent updates to the
California data privacy law,

23
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:18,000
as well as emerging issues in
both data liability and AI.

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,040
And Lucy Thomson is going to address

25
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,450
some important implications of
new, cutting-edge legislation

26
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:29,730
regarding IOT cybersecurity
and regulations implementing

27
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:32,700
that new legislation being developed

28
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,793
by the National Institute
of Standards and Technology.

29
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:38,870
We have, as we do each year,

30
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:42,850
some ambitious objectives for the session.

31
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:46,610
We are always endeavoring
to provide vocabulary

32
00:01:46,611 --> 00:01:49,020
and awareness of recent events

33
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,369
and activities in the
law of cybersecurity,

34
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:54,140
and that's no different this year.

35
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:56,650
We're going to try to
bring to your attention

36
00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:00,640
the policy artifacts that
we think bear remembering,

37
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,230
going forward, that are
gonna impact your practice

38
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:05,940
whether you are an attorney,

39
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:08,329
a producer in the technology industry,

40
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:10,103
or part of the consumer community.

41
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,250
Catherine's objective is
that we come away from today

42
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,580
with an understanding of the transition

43
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,210
and the concept of due diligence

44
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:21,810
that's being visited on
us by the COVID epidemic

45
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:25,960
and the changes in transactional practice

46
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:30,440
as a result of the important
due diligence elements

47
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,840
and standards that are evolving.

48
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:36,410
Steve is going to update us
on some very important changes

49
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:40,900
in policy coming out of state
government in California,

50
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:44,970
but having implications on
a national and global level.

51
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:46,680
And finally Lucy, as I said, is going

52
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,000
to be addressing new IOT legislation

53
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,300
imposing cybersecurity requirements

54
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,543
currently under development by NIST.

55
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,260
You can go to the next slide, Steve.

56
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,630
I'll start off with the headlines.

57
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:03,720
These are things that we have selected

58
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,580
because we feel they are
pervasively important

59
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:10,107
or as the song goes, "the
stuff you gotta watch."

60
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:17,480
Since January, there
have been two critical,

61
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,140
new executive orders that have been part

62
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:24,160
of a rash of rescissions
of executive orders

63
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,609
and policies that were put
in place over the four years

64
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:31,010
of the preceding administration
that have important impact

65
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:35,340
on cyber security, the cyber
security infrastructure,

66
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,350
and perhaps the broader
critical infrastructure.

67
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:40,600
The first artifact that I wanna call out

68
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:45,549
is executive order 14007
that was signed the end

69
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:49,170
of January, entitled
"The President's Council

70
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:51,619
of Advisors on Science and Technology"

71
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,380
and it's important for
a number of reasons.

72
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:59,380
The important process
issue that it addresses

73
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:03,109
is the restoration of the
president's council on advisors

74
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:05,730
on science and technology,
which had been abandoned

75
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:07,940
by the previous
administration and taken out

76
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:12,940
of the arena of important advisory bodies

77
00:04:13,726 --> 00:04:18,339
by technical analysis for
the White House staff.

78
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:21,289
But importantly, included
in that executive order

79
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:24,397
are a number of important references

80
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,830
to changes in science
and technology advice

81
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:35,830
that tee up a subsequent executive
order from February 24th,

82
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:39,770
EO 14017, on America's supply chain,

83
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:43,870
which not only addresses the
critical cyber infrastructure

84
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:46,360
but also critical goods,
products and services

85
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,060
across the entire economy and is leading

86
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,120
to the legislative proposal
currently under debate

87
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,020
about our national infrastructure.

88
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:56,830
But importantly, this
executive order singles out

89
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:00,550
and specifically identifies
important technology artifacts,

90
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,933
semiconductors, software and other ICT,

91
00:05:04,138 --> 00:05:06,950
specialized batteries
providing electric power

92
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:11,950
to our information grid
and rare earth minerals,

93
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:15,180
the core and sometimes hard to protect,

94
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:18,870
hard to acquire substances
like molybdenum,

95
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:21,410
among others that are in global commerce

96
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:24,070
but sometimes under the
control of nation states

97
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:26,983
that have adversarial interests to the US.

98
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:31,469
Another important executive
order is EO 14024,

99
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:34,130
that was just signed in April

100
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:37,520
and it really addresses the solar wind tax

101
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,520
and the supply chain interdictions
that have been attempted

102
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:46,450
against the US, not only
our natural security

103
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:48,680
and nuclear command and control network,

104
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,960
but our election system and
other critical infrastructures

105
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,543
like the electric power grid.

106
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,300
All of these changes in
policy that have come

107
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:01,430
from the the new Biden White
House have been backed up with,

108
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:04,470
as I said, robust
legislative agenda items,

109
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:07,870
including the now pending
critical infrastructure

110
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:12,130
legislation that is winding
its way through the Congress.

111
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:14,203
Steve, we can move forward.

112
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:18,670
In order to shepherd these new policies,

113
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:21,020
there have been a number
of critical appointments

114
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,979
on cybersecurity policy positions

115
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:28,389
in the White House and in the agencies.

116
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:32,993
The five people named
on this slide represent

117
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:38,627
a combined body of experience
in excess of 100 years.

118
00:06:38,627 --> 00:06:41,800
Chris Inglis, who is taking
over in the White House

119
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,970
as the national cyber director
in the executive office

120
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:47,880
of the president was
former deputy director

121
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,813
of NSA for cybersecurity.

122
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,120
And he happens to be an attorney.

123
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,890
Anne Neuberger is also an attorney.

124
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:00,419
She's the deputy national security advisor

125
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,443
for cyber security on the
National Security Council staff.

126
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:08,530
Others who are holding
down important positions

127
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:11,530
include Jen Easterly, who
was a former NSA staffer

128
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:16,200
along with Chris Inglis
under Keith Alexander at NSA.

129
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,719
She was also at the Obama White House.

130
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,140
Rob Silvers is coming into the Department

131
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,610
of Homeland Security as the undersecretary

132
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,060
for strategy, policy and plans.

133
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,129
And Rob Joyce is coming back from a stint

134
00:07:30,129 --> 00:07:33,090
in the private sector to NSA as a director

135
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:34,450
for cybersecurity.

136
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:36,610
Each one of these individuals has a wealth

137
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:40,260
of personal experience, each
one of them is very familiar

138
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:43,270
to all of the others
and represents a fabric

139
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:48,270
of cybersecurity expertise
across the senior leadership

140
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:52,560
of the new administration
that will importantly provide

141
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,560
for a coherent program of
policy that could only benefit

142
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:02,283
those of us who are
involved in cyber policy.

143
00:08:03,857 --> 00:08:07,070
Go to the final slide in this section.

144
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:11,070
There are two artifacts that
I want to call out to you.

145
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:15,840
One is the general of the
Government Accountability Office's

146
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,989
recent report released
in March of this year

147
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:22,390
as part of its high risk series

148
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:24,969
that has elevated the concept

149
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:27,120
of cybersecurity and its challenges.

150
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,090
It's one of the five of
the 15 high-risk items

151
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:34,140
facing the federal
government and it's important

152
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:37,500
because it directs the
federal government to engage

153
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,460
in activities in four critical areas,

154
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:43,169
addressing them as four
critical challenges,

155
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:46,360
including developing a
cybersecurity strategy,

156
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,980
securing federal systems
and federal information

157
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:52,420
and datasets, protecting the
cyber-critical infrastructure

158
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:55,650
across both the commercial
and civilian economies

159
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:58,780
and the government, and
protecting individual privacy

160
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:02,500
and sensitive data, not only
government classified data

161
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,380
but data that's sensitive to individuals.

162
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:08,260
And finally, a companion document

163
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,220
that might be viewed as something

164
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:15,410
that rides well with the GAO report is the

165
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:18,880
now year-old Cyber
Solarium Commission report

166
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,250
with its more than 200 recommendations.

167
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:24,117
This bi-partisan body spent more

168
00:09:24,117 --> 00:09:26,270
than two years gathering
data about where do we need

169
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:29,199
to go on cyber policy in this country?

170
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,454
They released a report last year

171
00:09:31,454 --> 00:09:35,420
with the new administration
and the new congress.

172
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:38,380
Six pillars identified in that report

173
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:40,410
are going to be anchors of the direction

174
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:43,480
that those individuals
I identified earlier

175
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,770
are gonna be pursuing
in order to make sure

176
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:48,460
that the US cybersecurity community

177
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:52,560
and culture can benefit
from legislative support,

178
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,939
the useful working budget that
funds the needed activities

179
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:00,630
across both the government
and the private sector,

180
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:04,073
and makes America more secure
from a cyber perspective.

181
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,450
And with that, now we're gonna turn to

182
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:12,450
the three presentations
on hot topics in depth.

183
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,750
The following of which
there'll be some opportunity

184
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:19,810
for us to discuss these
issues amongst ourselves,

185
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:22,209
and to provide opportunities for questions

186
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:24,200
from those of you in the audience.

187
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,130
But we'll begin with Catherine
Barrett and her discussion

188
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:29,680
of the emergence of the new due diligence

189
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,780
as an essential element of ICT policy,

190
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:35,079
especially in the transactional space.

191
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,620
Catherine?

192
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,453
- Thanks, Michael, I appreciate it.

193
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:43,180
So, this pandemic has highlighted

194
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:45,500
the growing concern organizations have

195
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,920
about risks associated
with their supply chain.

196
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,849
Risks can arise from the lack

197
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,660
of visibility organizations have into

198
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:57,689
their information communication
technology supply chain.

199
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:00,170
The lack of visibility organizations have

200
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:05,170
into their supply chain is often
because they don't identify

201
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:09,020
and monitor how suppliers
develop, integrate,

202
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:12,189
and update ITC products and services.

203
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:15,810
The risks can include,
but are not limited to,

204
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:18,290
the following such as
insertion of malicious code

205
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:21,439
into the software, theft
of intellectual property,

206
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,730
insertion of counterfeits
and poor development

207
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:27,210
and/or manufacturing practices.

208
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:29,340
This presentation is
gonna focus on the need

209
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:32,480
to conduct due diligence
on suppliers prior

210
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,980
to the acquisition of
ICT goods and services.

211
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:41,170
One cyber incident, the
SolarWinds supply chain attack,

212
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:44,319
focused attention on the need to identify,

213
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,260
assess and mitigate supply chain risks.

214
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:50,080
The SolarWinds supply
chain attack, as we know

215
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:54,660
and as the world learned, was
disclosed in December of 2020

216
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,530
and while the investigation continues

217
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:59,000
on how the hackers originally gained entry

218
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,030
into the SolarWinds network,
in April of this year

219
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:04,319
the US government officially named Russia

220
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,410
as the nation state that
carried out this attack.

221
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:11,839
It's believed that Russia's
foreign intelligence service

222
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:16,600
placed malware into the
SolarWinds Orion software update

223
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,330
and that software update
was subsequently distributed

224
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:22,390
to more than 17,000 of their customers.

225
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:26,080
Once inside SolarWinds'
networks, Russian hackers turned

226
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,710
off security features
such as logging tools

227
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:31,720
and antivirus software to avoid detection

228
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:36,070
in search for valuable information
and data, read that data

229
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:39,890
and in some cases, exfiltrated
that data and information.

230
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:42,420
So what was so unique about this attack?

231
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,910
Three things: first, it was sophisticated,

232
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:47,890
as Brad Smith, the CEO
of Microsoft indicated

233
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:52,260
in his testimony before
congress in March of this year.

234
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,350
Unlike some attacks that take advantage

235
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:57,830
of vulnerabilities in
software, this attack was based

236
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:01,330
on finding and stealing
privileges and certificates

237
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:05,630
and tokens that provide access
to information in network

238
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:09,800
in the same way a trusted
user would have access to it.

239
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,599
Second, the scale.

240
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,160
Microsoft estimates Russia used more

241
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,140
than a thousand engineers to
execute the SolarWinds attack.

242
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,810
And third, scope.

243
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:22,400
The total impact is still
unknown, but upwards

244
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,620
of 17,000 SolarWinds users may

245
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,913
have been impacted by this attack.

246
00:13:26,913 --> 00:13:31,750
So what to do: to reduce the
risk of supply chain attacks,

247
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,560
we need to incorporate due diligence

248
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:37,339
into the acquisition process
for all ICT suppliers

249
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,950
of goods and services.

250
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:41,800
This step will improve
confidence and trust

251
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,199
in your suppliers, improve visibility

252
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,400
into one's supply chain,
and reduce the risk

253
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,770
of cyber-related instance.

254
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:53,120
Due diligence is not
a one and done effort.

255
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,470
Rather, it requires a
sustained investment,

256
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:59,140
a program within the organization
to continually monitor

257
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:02,310
for changes in the risk
profile of your suppliers.

258
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:06,859
A sample of major program
elements might include number one,

259
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:11,760
supplier inventory and assessment,
create a geographic map

260
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,110
of all your suppliers,
including sub-tier suppliers

261
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:17,470
of ICP products and services.

262
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:20,120
Prioritize those ICT
products and services.

263
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,320
Which ones, for example,
provide critical products

264
00:14:24,278 --> 00:14:25,340
and services to your organization?

265
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:28,440
Identify substitute
suppliers, if possible,

266
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,690
for those critical
elements; manage a database

267
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:34,380
of your suppliers and
update it continuously

268
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:37,490
as the risk profile
changes of those suppliers.

269
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:40,490
We often call this a
preferred vendors list.

270
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:43,840
And negotiate supplier
contracts for ICT products

271
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,090
and services where substitutes

272
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:47,443
are not reasonable or possible.

273
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,760
Another element of your program has

274
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,960
to look at national security.

275
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,680
For example, is there foreign control of

276
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,973
or influence over your supplier?

277
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:04,250
Foreign ownership, personal
and professional ties

278
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:07,520
between the source,
and any foreign entity,

279
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,079
legal regime of that foreign entity

280
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:13,330
where the resource is
located or headquartered.

281
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:15,880
Are there any suppliers
listed on the treasury's

282
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:19,620
Specially Designated
Nationals Blocked Person List?

283
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:22,650
So that might be something
you need to know about.

284
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:26,300
Legal: is the supplier
located in the United States?

285
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,520
If not, where's the
primary legal residence

286
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,860
of that supplier?

287
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:33,130
Does the supplier carry cyber insurance?

288
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:35,230
If so, what's the extent of the policy?

289
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:38,620
What's included and what's
excluded from the policy?

290
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:41,020
Has the supplier experienced
any cyber incidents

291
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,510
in the past 12 months?

292
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:45,270
If so, what was the
process the supplier used

293
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:48,230
to respond to that incident,
were any fines levied,

294
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:51,030
any lawsuits filed as a consequence?

295
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:54,189
Is the supplier willing
to represent and warrant

296
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:56,700
in writing that the
supplier is in compliance

297
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,390
with all applicable cybersecurity

298
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:01,240
and data privacy laws in its own internal

299
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:05,163
and external information
systems and networks?

300
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,440
Regarding incident response,
are appropriate agreements

301
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:11,280
in place with suppliers to
ensure speed of communication,

302
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:15,150
response, corrective action,
and other related activities?

303
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:17,829
Another essential element
has to do with governance.

304
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:20,900
Does the supplier have a supply
chain risk management plan

305
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,470
to manage their ICT suppliers?

306
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:26,190
Does the supplier have a
cybersecurity governance structure

307
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:29,010
in place, including policies,
procedures, standards

308
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:33,270
and controls to manage cyber
related supply chain risks?

309
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:35,640
Do they have the proper
roles and responsibilities

310
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:39,340
to find any organization,
such as the role of the CIO,

311
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:42,363
the role of SSO, the role of
the acquisition professional?

312
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:46,290
Does the supplier have an
incident response plan?

313
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:48,010
There are several others
we don't have time

314
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:51,060
to get into right now,
but asset management

315
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:53,089
is another essential element.

316
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:56,280
Does the supplier implement
requirements to secure IT

317
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,550
and manufacturing assets
throughout the life cycle

318
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:01,680
of the product or service being provided,

319
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,300
such as identification and classification,

320
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:07,480
media protection and
disposal, records management?

321
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,200
Does the supplier track and
trace, do they have a track

322
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,700
and trace program to identify the origins

323
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:15,640
of all parts, components and systems?

324
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,490
There's also another essential element,

325
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:20,079
is supplier operational awareness.

326
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,669
Does the supplier devote talent, resources

327
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:25,470
and tools to track events
from around the world

328
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:29,180
in real time that could
impact supplier operations?

329
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:33,300
For example, changes to a
supplier's legal environment,

330
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:37,169
such as laws that permit
the supplier's government

331
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:40,300
to compel a supplier to
turn over data on customers,

332
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,610
including potentially
intellectual property

333
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:44,850
and other sensitive information,

334
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:48,040
something like that should raise alarm.

335
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,430
Does the supplier have an
incident response plan,

336
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:52,010
including roles and responsibilities

337
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:54,040
of key leaders and staff?

338
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:57,300
Does the supplier practice
or conduct tabletop exercises

339
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,100
of that plan periodically
to ensure it is relevant

340
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,760
and operational when
an incident does occur?

341
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,350
Asset management is another key element.

342
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,689
Does the supplier design
and implement processes

343
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:12,400
and procedures to deny unauthorized access

344
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,160
to facilities, equipment and resources

345
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,170
to protect personnel and
property from damage?

346
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:19,440
Does your organization
impose tight controls

347
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,980
on suppliers with network
access to their organization?

348
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,667
And data protection, does
the supplier have policies

349
00:18:25,667 --> 00:18:28,199
and procedures and tools in
place to protect the data

350
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:32,290
that it stores and collects and analyzes?

351
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:34,430
Quality control is
another essential element.

352
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:36,900
Does the supplier meet
relevant industry standards

353
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:40,020
for cybersecurity practices
and procedures, for example,

354
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:44,680
do they rely upon NIST, ISO,
other such industry standards?

355
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,970
Does the supplier include
security engineering

356
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:49,920
and architecture best practices

357
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,190
during the design and development testing

358
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:54,980
and roll out of products and services?

359
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:57,420
And testing is the last critical element

360
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,978
I'm gonna talk about,
which is the testing.

361
00:18:59,978 --> 00:19:02,160
What is the testing process

362
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,590
to identify potential vulnerabilities

363
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:06,860
and defects, and does that process meet

364
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:09,774
or exceed contractual requirements?

365
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:12,609
Finally, there are several resources

366
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:15,460
that I would point you to,
we don't have time today

367
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,143
to go over, but there
are several resources

368
00:19:17,143 --> 00:19:21,440
that have a detailed
checklist, if you will,

369
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,135
of what ought to be
thought of and included

370
00:19:25,135 --> 00:19:28,170
from a due diligence perspective.

371
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:30,680
One of the newest ones is from NIST

372
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:34,910
and it was just released in April of 2021.

373
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:37,500
It's the Cyber Supply Chain
Risk Management Practices

374
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,420
for Systems and Organizations.

375
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:43,350
They also have a great resource
called The Best Practices

376
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,959
in Cybersecurity, Supply
Chain Risk Management.

377
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,750
It's a case study of how Sysco manages

378
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:50,580
their supply chain risks from end to end.

379
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,850
And finally, the director
of national intelligence,

380
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:55,350
the Office of Director of
National Intelligence put out

381
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:59,280
in September of 2020 a short framework

382
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,399
of how to assess and think
about supply chain risks.

383
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,550
Now, I'd like to turn
things over to Steve.

384
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,370
- Thank you so much.

385
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:08,679
Again, I'm Steven Wu, I'm a shareholder

386
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,900
at Silicon Valley Law Group.

387
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:13,700
It's a delight to be with you today

388
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:16,850
and thank you so much,
Michael, for your introduction.

389
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:21,659
I have discussions here
today to talk about updates

390
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,970
to California privacy
laws, digital liability

391
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:27,550
and artificial intelligence,
but let's go back a second.

392
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:28,940
Let's pull back and say,

393
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:32,230
what's going on here as a big picture?

394
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:37,230
So we're coming out of COVID,
we've had more mindshare spent

395
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,463
on data protection lately because people

396
00:20:40,463 --> 00:20:42,940
are working from home, so we're
concerned more about that.

397
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:45,590
And at the same time,
artificial intelligence

398
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:47,230
is marching onward.

399
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:50,550
That technology is becoming
the dominant technology

400
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:54,810
of the 21st century and with
that artificial intelligence,

401
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:59,360
comes a lot more intrusiveness
into people's lives,

402
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,830
so privacy is a bigger and bigger concern.

403
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:04,850
We've had the general
data protection regulation

404
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:08,169
from the European Union,
we've had a long history

405
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:10,580
of data breaches and at the same time,

406
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,899
people are starting to really get sick

407
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:16,160
of all of these data
breaches and dissatisfied

408
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:19,050
with what's going on with the way

409
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:21,070
that companies are protecting information.

410
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:25,070
So that is motivating
legislatures to take action.

411
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:28,179
Democrats in congress are focused

412
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:31,750
on President Biden's
COVID infrastructure plan,

413
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:35,130
American families plan, the
budget and things like that.

414
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:37,050
So there's a lot of things going on

415
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:38,940
at the beginning of this administration.

416
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,810
I'm not sure that we're going

417
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:42,740
to have cybersecurity
legislation anytime soon

418
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:45,444
because of all those other
legislative priorities.

419
00:21:45,444 --> 00:21:48,350
The Republicans have historically opposed

420
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:50,423
any additional privacy regulations,

421
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:53,790
taking the position that
this might stifle innovation

422
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:56,780
or put burdens on American business.

423
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:58,240
So those are the kinds of dynamics

424
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,700
that are in the background
and as a result of that,

425
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:04,970
state legislatures are
beginning to fill the gaps.

426
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:07,630
In California, where I'm located

427
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:12,400
in Silicon Valley Law Group,
it's in San Jose, California.

428
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,050
We've had a number of state
laws coming to the fore because

429
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:20,350
of these dissatisfactions
and state legislatures seeing

430
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:24,570
this opportunity to take on
this problem and in the absence

431
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:27,167
of federal action, the
state legislatures say,

432
00:22:27,167 --> 00:22:29,120
"We're gonna take an action instead."

433
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,719
So, what do we have?

434
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,820
We have the California
Consumer Privacy Act,

435
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:37,580
which is the nation's first
cross-industry privacy law.

436
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,929
It's not the first privacy law,

437
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:41,730
but it's the cross-industry privacy law.

438
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:45,680
Passed in 2018, effective
January 1st, 2020

439
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:48,060
with some amendments in 2019.

440
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:51,879
And I've given this talk
before about what is CCPA,

441
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,670
and there are many other
programs in this institute

442
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:57,810
about CCPA, so I won't repeat everything,

443
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:59,710
but it's worth mentioning a few things.

444
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:01,805
That there is a notification requirement

445
00:23:01,805 --> 00:23:05,600
for privacy policies for companies

446
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,000
that are covered by the law.

447
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,050
You have to tell people what you're gonna

448
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:13,080
collect personal information for.

449
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,419
There's a right of access by individuals,

450
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,820
California residents, to their information

451
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:18,996
so that the company has to say,

452
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:20,680
"Here's what we've got on you."

453
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:23,990
And we also have this
idea that you can take

454
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:26,500
that information and then
move it to somewhere else

455
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,040
if you wanna do that as
a California resident.

456
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,409
You have the right to ask the business

457
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:33,180
to delete information and you can opt out

458
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:36,680
of sales of that information
as California residents.

459
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:39,310
There are some regulations
with various notice

460
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:41,419
and privacy policy requirements,

461
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,710
service provider restriction,
handling of access requests

462
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:47,160
from individuals, identity
verification to make sure

463
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:50,570
that this person's really
the person who's allowed

464
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:53,460
to access that information
about a particular individual.

465
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,230
And rules against discrimination,

466
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:57,330
that happened in the summer of 2020.

467
00:23:57,330 --> 00:24:01,939
But understand that CCPA
only covers larger companies,

468
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:05,780
and what I mean by that is $25
million of revenue or over,

469
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:10,780
or 50,000 records of individuals,
households or devices

470
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:13,970
or data brokers, essentially
companies that are making more

471
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:16,910
than half of their
revenue from selling data.

472
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:19,610
And California consumers are
the ones who are protected

473
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:21,360
by this law, it's a California law.

474
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:24,919
Unlike some of the previous
laws in California,

475
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,040
there's a broad definition
of personal information,

476
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:30,590
which I think in reality tracks the way

477
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:33,372
the GDPR defines personal information.

478
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,179
There is a data breach right of action,

479
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:38,170
which is really interesting.

480
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:43,170
So for a narrower set of ID
theft potential information,

481
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:47,500
there is a private right of
action to allow individuals

482
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:50,610
to sue businesses that
lose control of their data

483
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:53,790
and their statutory damages,
meaning the plaintiff doesn't

484
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:55,710
actually have to prove actual damages

485
00:24:55,710 --> 00:25:00,130
between 170, $750 per individual.

486
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:04,003
So that's an important part of the law.

487
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:07,649
Following on the California
Consumer Privacy Act this year

488
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:10,480
in March was the Virginia
Consumer Data Protection Act,

489
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,400
which similarly cross-cuts industries.

490
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:17,190
That covers any company
that has a 100,000 consumers

491
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:20,393
or data brokers with more
than 50% of the revenues.

492
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:26,460
So those are the thresholds
for the applicability

493
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,750
of the Virginia law and like CCPA,

494
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:29,900
there's a notice requirement.

495
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:32,530
You have to tell individuals,
if you're covered,

496
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:34,410
what your privacy practices are

497
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:36,350
and what you're collecting
information for.

498
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:38,290
There is this right of access, the right

499
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:40,530
for an individual to
have the business delete

500
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:43,050
that information, the right to have access

501
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:45,530
to that information for
portability purposes,

502
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:49,129
right to opt out of processing information

503
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:52,290
and a non-discrimination
like with the California law.

504
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:55,139
It also adds, similar to GDPR, the right

505
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:58,320
to correct information
of record and the right

506
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,240
against automated decision-making,
so that can be opt out.

507
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,710
So what that means is something

508
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:05,350
like artificial intelligence,
you might be able

509
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:10,350
to opt out of that and have
a human look at the results

510
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,020
of software processes and
give a second judgment,

511
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,950
the right of human intervention, the right

512
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:17,560
of an explanation of what's going on.

513
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:20,550
There is a data minimization requirement

514
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:23,423
and security requirements
now under the Virginia law.

515
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:26,450
The companies have to
have a data protection

516
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:30,780
impact assessment and if
there are targeted ads

517
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:33,090
or selling personal information,
sensitive information

518
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:36,169
or high risk processing of information.

519
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:37,830
But unlike the California law,

520
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:40,550
there's only attorney general enforcement.

521
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:45,550
In November, we had the
attorney general, or I'm sorry,

522
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:46,990
the California Privacy Rights Act

523
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:49,970
which was passed by ballot
initiative in November.

524
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:53,270
It adds to the CCPA, so
it's not taking over that

525
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:55,240
in any way, it's not a substitute for it,

526
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:58,000
but rather it overlays on top of that.

527
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,250
It adds to the CCPA a
new enforcement agency,

528
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:06,460
a regulator, the California
Privacy Protection Agency,

529
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:10,920
the threshold for
applicability of CCPA/CPRA

530
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,860
has changed so that you have
to have 100,000 consumers

531
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:16,149
or households or more to
be triggered by this law.

532
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:19,480
So they're really shooting
for larger businesses here.

533
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,540
But it may be for some
businesses that are smaller,

534
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:24,450
you might have that number of records too.

535
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:26,740
It adds like GDPR, this category

536
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:29,100
of sensitive personal
information that is entitled

537
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,889
to more protection and adds this right

538
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:34,763
of correcting information
called rectification.

539
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,679
You can restrict processing
sensitive personal information.

540
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:42,900
It requires data minimization,
retention requirements

541
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:45,500
have to be disclosed, and
there will be regulations

542
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,870
regarding automated
decision-making that I mentioned

543
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:51,250
in the Virginia law, security
requirements, risk assessments

544
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:53,860
and security auditing
for high risk processing.

545
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:57,699
So we're now seeing the
beginning of this trend

546
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:00,860
and we might see more
state laws as time goes on.

547
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:05,860
I'm also looking at a lot
of data liability scenarios,

548
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,560
I guess you could say.

549
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,860
And data liability, I think
is going to become one

550
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:14,284
of the bigger issues associated
with our 21st century

551
00:28:14,285 --> 00:28:16,693
information technology environment.

552
00:28:17,634 --> 00:28:21,435
I was just reading today, we're
recording this on May 7th,

553
00:28:21,435 --> 00:28:23,835
I was just reading today
about how this company,

554
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,440
Clearview Artificial Intelligence,

555
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,940
is fighting for its life in court.

556
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,470
Basically what that company did was,

557
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:35,800
it scraped the entire internet for faces

558
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,580
and put that into a database of faces

559
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:41,730
for facial recognition purposes
and artificial intelligence.

560
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:45,340
And basically, there's a class action

561
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:47,280
that is seeking a preliminary junction

562
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:50,250
that would have the effect,
according to Clearview,

563
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:51,420
it would shut down the company.

564
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:55,600
So where you get your
data, how you collect it

565
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,060
and what you do with it
are going to be key issues

566
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:00,780
these days, especially
with data being used

567
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,910
to train artificial intelligence systems.

568
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:05,590
So what can go wrong with this?

569
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:07,550
Well, there are some scenarios
that I would give you.

570
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:11,850
One is the founders of
OkCupid, the dating site

571
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:15,360
thought it'd be really cool
to take the entire database

572
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,300
of faces from OkCupid and give it over

573
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:21,230
to this other company,
Clarifai, which then used

574
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:25,600
those faces to train their
facial recognition system.

575
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,290
It almost sounds like there
was a data breach going on

576
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:30,170
and it certainly triggered a class action.

577
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:32,860
It is true that there was a dismissal

578
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,990
of the class action for
jurisdictional reasons.

579
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:37,810
But it's one of those things that,

580
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:39,730
without asking anybody's permission,

581
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:43,740
the company founders, maybe
to even enrich themselves

582
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,395
because they were also
investors in Clarifai,

583
00:29:46,395 --> 00:29:51,395
transferred the entire database
of faces over to Clarifai.

584
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:54,300
So, that's a cautionary tale.

585
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,220
You need consent if you're going

586
00:29:56,220 --> 00:30:00,310
to do these kinds of things
and there has to be notice,

587
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:03,572
and even that we might trigger
a class action because of the

588
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:08,460
unfairness aspect of this activity.

589
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:10,180
There was also a company
called Flo Health,

590
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:13,640
which was involved in menstrual
and ovulation tracking.

591
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:17,630
And this company apparently
shared individual data

592
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:20,700
with Facebook and Google
regarding pregnancy cycles

593
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,880
and fertility, contrary
to what it promised

594
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,660
in its privacy notice.

595
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:29,010
So these companies were using
the data from Flo Health

596
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:31,090
for advertising and product improvement.

597
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:34,310
So what ended up happening was FTC came in

598
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:36,929
and put down the hammer basically,

599
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:40,280
and now Flo Health is working
under 20 year consent decree

600
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:43,160
that requires them to destroy
the data they shouldn't

601
00:30:44,269 --> 00:30:48,020
have shared, provide notice
to individuals users,

602
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:50,283
and there's basically
20 years of oversight.

603
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:54,149
I also had mentioned there's a recent

604
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:58,770
Federal Trade Commission
blog post on April 19, 2021

605
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,380
about taking action against bias

606
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:04,280
in the use of artificial intelligence.

607
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,820
But for the final thing I'm gonna turn to

608
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:09,370
is the European Commission's
proposed European

609
00:31:09,371 --> 00:31:11,035
Union Artificial Intelligence Act,

610
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:14,378
which was announced on April 21st, 2021.

611
00:31:14,378 --> 00:31:17,270
It talks about promoting European Union

612
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:20,150
artificial intelligence while
protecting fundamental rights

613
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:22,080
of EU citizens.

614
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,120
If you can think of it as
what does this law really do,

615
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:27,320
it combines privacy and
security, product liability,

616
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,629
anti-discrimination, national security

617
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:32,730
and youth protection all in one law.

618
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:37,531
And it will, like GDPR, have
extra territorial effect.

619
00:31:37,531 --> 00:31:40,409
The companies that are
covered, US companies

620
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:42,906
that are potentially covered are ones

621
00:31:42,906 --> 00:31:43,929
that provide marketing or putting

622
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:45,900
into service artificial
intelligence systems

623
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:48,304
in the European Union, regardless

624
00:31:48,304 --> 00:31:49,740
of location of the company.

625
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:52,300
It also covers users of
artificial intelligence systems

626
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,940
located in EU or providers and users

627
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:57,120
of artificial intelligence
systems outside the EU

628
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,527
where the output produced by
the system is used in the EU.

629
00:32:00,528 --> 00:32:02,610
And what then, what does this law do?

630
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:05,189
So American companies
are potentially covered.

631
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:06,130
What does this really do?

632
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:08,300
Well, it prohibits certain AI practices

633
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:11,930
like subliminal techniques,
exploiting individuals based

634
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:16,100
on age, physical and mental
disability, or applications

635
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:19,070
likely to cause foreign
social scoring systems,

636
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:21,230
real-time biometric recognition systems

637
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:22,670
like facial recognition.

638
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:27,010
And at the same time, it
regulates high risk AI systems

639
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:30,400
that cover health safety
or fundamental rights.

640
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:33,316
And you need risk management,
pre-market testing

641
00:32:33,316 --> 00:32:37,810
and conformity assessments,
transparency, human oversight,

642
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:41,179
accuracy, robustness,
cybersecurity, quality management.

643
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:44,200
It also creates a European
Artificial Intelligence Board.

644
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:48,140
Requires transparency, even
for the low risk applications.

645
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,620
You want the AI assistant
to say, "You're working

646
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:53,072
with a robot here" when
I'm calling you up.

647
00:32:53,072 --> 00:32:56,800
And I think it's impact
will be very much like GDPR

648
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,370
in its own area.

649
00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:01,989
I'll also mention that the
American Bar Association,

650
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:04,950
Artificial Intelligence and
robotics National Institute

651
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:07,780
will take place on October 12th and 13th.

652
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:11,590
So watch out for that
on the americanbar.org.

653
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,520
There'll be some announcements on that.

654
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:16,840
And so, what should you do,
given everything that I've said?

655
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:19,649
Well, you should know what
kind of data you have,

656
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:21,830
first of all, which is what
people have been talking

657
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:24,280
about for years, but it's now really time

658
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,190
to talk to your data protection team,

659
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:27,600
start assessing your data risk,

660
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,459
what data do you have, what are the risks?

661
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:33,100
And then after that, understand
your entire data lifecycle.

662
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,610
How are you really collecting this data?

663
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:37,129
Where is it coming from
and where is it going?

664
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:40,580
And then if you find out
instances like OkCupid,

665
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:42,639
like we don't know
where this data is going

666
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,050
or it could be going to
these other companies,

667
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:45,810
you really need to stop and figure out

668
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:48,432
what's going on within three months.

669
00:33:48,432 --> 00:33:49,755
And then within six months,

670
00:33:49,755 --> 00:33:51,210
you should have controls
to ensure compliance

671
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:53,120
for your personal data life cycle

672
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,409
and prepare for more
artificial intelligence

673
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:58,170
and legislation, because it is coming.

674
00:33:58,170 --> 00:34:01,243
So with that, I'm gonna turn
it over to Lucy Thomson.

675
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,543
- Thanks, Steve and Michael and Catherine.

676
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:13,750
IOT legislation is transforming
the security landscape.

677
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:18,750
The federal legislation that
was passed this past December

678
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:23,040
is called the IOT
Cybersecurity Improvement Act.

679
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:27,370
It's a bi-partisan piece of
legislation that was introduced

680
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:31,480
by Senator Mark Warner
and Senator Cory Gardner.

681
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:35,500
And for the first time, it
will be providing security

682
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:40,500
standards for the weakest link
in security, which is IOT.

683
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:45,739
In addition, California,
as Steve has said so well,

684
00:34:45,739 --> 00:34:50,469
is a leader in many of these
areas with its legislation.

685
00:34:50,469 --> 00:34:54,986
Has another statute that took
effect in January of 2020

686
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:58,953
and Oregon also followed suit.

687
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:04,033
Until now, IOT has been
largely unregulated.

688
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:09,080
Billions of consumer
and industrial devices

689
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:13,040
have been connected to the
internet and to each other

690
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:18,000
without any security or with
little reasonable security.

691
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,610
It's been a massive security problem.

692
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:24,230
So looking to the future, it's predicted

693
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:28,130
that 75 billion devices will be connected

694
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:32,923
to the internet and each other,
so it's time to take action.

695
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:36,833
We'll start with the federal statute.

696
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:43,150
The federal statute
defines security standards

697
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:49,970
for IOT devices and the
hub that congress use

698
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:54,970
to pass this legislation is
that the devices must be owned

699
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:58,569
or operated by the federal government

700
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:03,430
and connected to a federal
information system.

701
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:05,730
So where are the standards?

702
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:07,700
They're not in the law.

703
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:12,680
NIST is directed to draft the
statutes and publish them.

704
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,980
And on a 90 day timeframe,

705
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:18,017
so they should be published any day.

706
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:22,740
What is NIST directed to do?

707
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:26,700
They're focused on
cybersecurity risk management

708
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:30,890
and specifically, congress
called out four areas that are

709
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:35,299
of particular importance
with respect to IOT devices.

710
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,923
And this includes secure development,

711
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,140
which addresses secure coding practices

712
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:44,640
and supply chain risks.

713
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,129
The next area is identity management,

714
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:52,010
which has been the most
problematic area for IOT devices.

715
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:57,010
And that includes weak
passwords, no passwords,

716
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:02,070
default passwords
encoded into IOT devices.

717
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:06,380
So there'll be changes in
that area, also patching.

718
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:11,380
Most IOT devices are not
capable of being patched.

719
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:14,320
And configuration management,

720
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:18,990
which is having the software
configured properly.

721
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:23,959
Most IOT devices do not
support these functions.

722
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:27,378
So there's three main
things that will be going on

723
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:29,270
that you should watch out for

724
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:32,703
because it affects
lawyers and their clients.

725
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:38,109
After NIST publishes the
standards and guidelines

726
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:41,930
for the implementation of the act,

727
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:46,930
OMB is directed to issue
policies and procedures

728
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:50,210
that federal agencies must follow.

729
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:54,760
And the policies and
procedures will be consistent

730
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:57,670
with the NIST standards and guidelines,

731
00:37:57,670 --> 00:38:01,160
and their timeframe is 180 days

732
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:04,560
from when NIST publishes the standards.

733
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:09,380
And then Congress has
introduced a new initiative,

734
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:11,890
which is guidelines for the disclosure

735
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:16,220
of vulnerabilities that may
be found on the devices.

736
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:19,689
And they've actually
specifically asked contractors

737
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:23,750
and vendors to engage in a
collaborative process while

738
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:28,750
they'll issue coordinated
vulnerability disclosure policies.

739
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:34,259
So that should enable the
manufacturers and the providers,

740
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:36,950
as well as the government to take action

741
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:39,160
when vulnerabilities are identified

742
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,683
to correct and remediate those.

743
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:46,886
So turning now to California and Oregon,

744
00:38:46,886 --> 00:38:50,350
those two states took a
totally different approach

745
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:52,690
to IOT security.

746
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:56,850
The most narrow of the
two statutes is Oregon,

747
00:38:56,850 --> 00:39:00,690
which covers consumer devices.

748
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:05,364
California statute is broader;
it covers consumer devices

749
00:39:05,364 --> 00:39:10,364
and also may cover
industrial and B2B devices.

750
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:13,730
And the coverage comes from the definition

751
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:15,993
of connected device.

752
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:22,080
These statutes don't
protect just personal data.

753
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:26,800
They protect all data on the IOT devices

754
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:31,520
and they also cover the devices themselves

755
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:35,500
and any device that's connected

756
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:39,113
to the internet, as the
statutes are defined.

757
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:44,819
The enforcement mechanism is...

758
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:51,370
Neither one of these statutes
has a private right of action.

759
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:53,580
So enforcement, as Steve mentioned

760
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:57,049
under the other California law, is done

761
00:39:57,050 --> 00:40:02,050
by the state AG or city and
county attorneys general.

762
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:10,779
No private right of action in Oregon,

763
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:14,990
and the Oregon law is
directed to manufacturers.

764
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:18,470
So if a manufacturer
violates the Oregon law,

765
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:23,470
it's deemed an unfair trade
practice, so enforcement

766
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:29,480
will be done under the unfair
trade practice regimen.

767
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:34,300
These statutes actually try to define

768
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:38,790
what is reasonable security,
and that's a challenging issue.

769
00:40:38,790 --> 00:40:42,390
So I've included on this
slide the three bullets

770
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:47,390
that are what the states say
reasonable security features

771
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:49,000
should be.

772
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,906
Appropriate to the nature and function

773
00:40:51,906 --> 00:40:54,330
of the device, this is the security.

774
00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:57,520
Appropriate to the information
the device collects,

775
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:02,230
contains, or transmits, and
designed to protect the device

776
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:05,210
and any information contained therein

777
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:08,140
from unauthorized access, destruction,

778
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:11,779
use, modification, or disclosure.

779
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:16,090
So what does this mean
in practice, you may ask.

780
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:19,030
These laws are essentially very vague.

781
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:24,030
They do provide one clue about
what is reasonable security

782
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:28,120
by saying that a password, certain types

783
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:31,400
of password management would be considered

784
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:36,400
a reasonable security feature,
so they give two examples.

785
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:41,500
If a device contains a
unique programmed password

786
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:46,500
or the ability for a user to
develop a unique password,

787
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:50,569
then that's a reasonable security feature.

788
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:53,780
But otherwise, these laws are quite vague

789
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:56,970
and as lawyers and security professionals,

790
00:41:56,970 --> 00:42:00,049
we're gonna need to advise our clients

791
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:03,710
as to what will need to
be done to these devices

792
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:06,640
in order to comply with the laws.

793
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:10,700
So there's a number of
far-reaching implications

794
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:15,029
that come flow from this legislation.

795
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:18,450
And the first one is an obvious question

796
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:21,272
which is, what is reasonable security?

797
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,080
So we know under the federal law,

798
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:32,080
the reasonable security will
be what NIST says it is.

799
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:35,200
And NIST has already
published four documents.

800
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:40,200
They give us a deep
dive into how they think

801
00:42:41,790 --> 00:42:46,720
IOT device security should
be analyzed and managed.

802
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:50,240
But what about California and Oregon?

803
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:54,379
Since they don't provide guidance, well,

804
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:57,530
providers or manufacturers in those states

805
00:42:57,530 --> 00:43:02,530
be advised to follow the NIST standards.

806
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:05,779
So the next question is,

807
00:43:05,779 --> 00:43:10,543
do these laws create a
new standard of care?

808
00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:16,620
And you might say that that's very likely

809
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:20,730
because manufacturers and security vendors

810
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:23,000
are gonna need to have some guidance

811
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:27,350
as to what they're supposed to be doing.

812
00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:31,343
And then here's a sort of
a lawyer alert which is,

813
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:37,070
there may be a single product
with a different version

814
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:40,390
for different types of IOT devices.

815
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:44,620
So commentators have suggested
that some manufacturers

816
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:49,069
may create a quote,
"government grade IOT device,"

817
00:43:49,070 --> 00:43:50,970
which would be implemented

818
00:43:50,970 --> 00:43:53,990
on the government information systems.

819
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:57,042
And then they may sell less robust,

820
00:43:57,042 --> 00:44:02,042
less costly devices for
industrial or consumer use.

821
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:09,290
So the question for all
of us and our clients is,

822
00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:12,680
is this appropriate, does
it undermine the intent

823
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:16,710
of these laws, and will companies

824
00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:19,230
that implement less secure devices

825
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:22,620
be in jeopardy if a breach occurs?

826
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:26,540
So that leads us to the liability risks

827
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:29,493
which Steve and Catherine
have been talking about.

828
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:35,210
Companies must determine
what level of security

829
00:44:35,210 --> 00:44:37,500
they wanna provide on the devices,

830
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:40,590
and then what level of secure devices

831
00:44:40,590 --> 00:44:43,763
should be implemented in
the information system.

832
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:48,430
And there's a very
interesting proposed IOT law

833
00:44:48,430 --> 00:44:52,009
in Virginia that's very instructive.

834
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:54,540
The law hasn't been passed yet,

835
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:57,480
but it has an interesting
provision that I wanna read

836
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:01,831
to you because it's so interesting.

837
00:45:01,831 --> 00:45:05,820
That law says a provider
of computing devices

838
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:09,680
shall be liable for
vulnerabilities that contribute

839
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:13,129
to system breaches that compromise data

840
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:18,040
when the provider fails to
conform to the extent possible

841
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:23,033
to industry standards for
cybersecurity and resiliency.

842
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:26,970
So the argument may be made,

843
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:31,140
just as what Virginia
is considering enacting,

844
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:34,926
which is if the manufacturers

845
00:45:34,927 --> 00:45:39,050
and the providers don't
follow the NIST standards,

846
00:45:39,050 --> 00:45:41,513
they may be liable for a breach.

847
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:44,440
So that leads us to a question

848
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:46,920
of who would be liable for a breach,

849
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:51,240
and we know there have been
massive amounts of breaches.

850
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:54,482
IOT devices have been used as proxies

851
00:45:54,482 --> 00:45:58,250
for many different kinds
of criminal activity.

852
00:45:58,250 --> 00:46:03,250
There have been breaches
of the data on the systems.

853
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:05,923
So I threw out some ideas.

854
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:10,830
These entities may be liable and it could

855
00:46:10,830 --> 00:46:15,750
be the manufacturer, the
seller, the provider,

856
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:19,910
the tech integrator, or the data owner.

857
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:24,910
And what about homeowners
who use insecure IOT devices

858
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:29,590
at home or in their workplaces?

859
00:46:29,590 --> 00:46:32,280
So there are a lot of potential entities

860
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:37,070
that could be liable,
and then in addition,

861
00:46:37,070 --> 00:46:39,510
who would be responsible for a breach?

862
00:46:39,510 --> 00:46:42,610
Because analysis of cybersecurity

863
00:46:42,610 --> 00:46:47,270
on IOT devices is a very complex analysis.

864
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:49,570
And when you read the NIST documents,

865
00:46:49,570 --> 00:46:53,210
you'll see that there is a huge amount

866
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:56,993
of analysis that NIST suggests be done.

867
00:46:57,950 --> 00:47:01,419
The breach could be a
result of vulnerabilities

868
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:06,010
on the IOT device itself,
or on the network,

869
00:47:06,010 --> 00:47:08,750
which has to do with the interconnections

870
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:13,750
between the devices, or
in the IOT ecosystem.

871
00:47:16,074 --> 00:47:20,350
And NIST asked the question,
are the devices utilized

872
00:47:20,350 --> 00:47:24,500
for the purposes for
which they were designed?

873
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:29,490
So there's questions about
how the device is designed,

874
00:47:29,490 --> 00:47:31,923
and then how it's implemented.

875
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:37,170
One NIST document that you
may want to take a look at

876
00:47:37,170 --> 00:47:41,950
is special publication, 800-213,

877
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:45,710
which is Security Guidance
for the Federal Government

878
00:47:45,710 --> 00:47:50,710
but it's also a very
thoughtful, and section 3.1

879
00:47:51,330 --> 00:47:56,330
has many different
questions that data owners

880
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:59,819
and manufacturers and providers

881
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:03,600
of these devices need to answer.

882
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:07,180
And this says that no
one should underestimate

883
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:11,490
the difficulty of creating a secure system

884
00:48:11,490 --> 00:48:16,490
in an IOT ecosystem, so what
are the critical next steps?

885
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:21,450
There's several ideas and suggestions

886
00:48:21,450 --> 00:48:23,470
for what should be done.

887
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:26,910
The first is to understand
the changing legal

888
00:48:26,910 --> 00:48:30,680
and security landscape,
because this is a big deal

889
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:35,230
and should be on everyone's radar.

890
00:48:35,230 --> 00:48:37,853
And so, that's the first step.

891
00:48:38,730 --> 00:48:43,730
Read the NIST documents that
have been published so far.

892
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:46,130
There's a series of four of them,

893
00:48:46,130 --> 00:48:50,850
called NIST Inter-Agency
Reports in the series 8259.

894
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:57,520
So planning for publication
of the NIST IOT standards

895
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:00,860
and guidelines, you can
look at these NIST-ers,

896
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:02,520
as they're called.

897
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:05,340
And another important
thing is to inventory

898
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:09,660
your IOT devices, and then
think about the questions

899
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:13,160
concerning standard of care and liability

900
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:17,970
and figure out what level
of security is appropriate

901
00:49:17,970 --> 00:49:21,200
for your company or for your clients.

902
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:26,060
And then, implement controls
that will be appropriate

903
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:28,720
for the entire information system,

904
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:33,720
including these more secure IOT devices.

905
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:36,253
So now, I'll turn it back to Michael.

906
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:40,700
- Thanks, Lucy, and thanks to all three

907
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:45,111
of you for very compelling presentations.

908
00:49:45,111 --> 00:49:49,720
It occurs to me in the more
than dozen years that members

909
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:52,799
of the ABA leadership have
been doing "Hot Topics,"

910
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:55,260
this is the first time
I can remember seeing

911
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:58,050
such a coherent thread run through all

912
00:49:58,050 --> 00:50:01,220
of the presentations of
the "Hot Topic" issues.

913
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:03,810
And I think we have a few minutes

914
00:50:03,810 --> 00:50:05,790
for discussion amongst ourselves,

915
00:50:05,790 --> 00:50:07,938
and I'd like to throw open the proposition

916
00:50:07,938 --> 00:50:12,938
that really comes to the
forefront for media to work

917
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:16,339
that I've been doing as
the ABA's legal advisor

918
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:19,210
to the Uniform Law
Commission drafting committee

919
00:50:19,210 --> 00:50:22,587
on state-level privacy legislation.

920
00:50:22,587 --> 00:50:25,570
One of the things that
has been really difficult

921
00:50:25,570 --> 00:50:29,720
in that exercise, now in its
third year, is resolving issues

922
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:33,310
around private rights of
action and federal preemption.

923
00:50:33,310 --> 00:50:36,160
And it really begs the question of,

924
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:39,752
at what level can you
write policy that's binding

925
00:50:39,753 --> 00:50:42,960
around issues, especially
technology-driven issues,

926
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:46,620
that really confront the
population of the entire planet?

927
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:48,650
I recently participated in a webinar

928
00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:50,790
where that very question was posed.

929
00:50:50,790 --> 00:50:53,970
How can we reconcile a US privacy regime

930
00:50:53,970 --> 00:50:56,410
with GDPR in Europe?

931
00:50:56,410 --> 00:50:58,920
Does it make sense for
a state like California,

932
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:01,320
even though it's the sixth largest economy

933
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:03,800
on the planet, to have
its own privacy rules

934
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:07,340
when that may be entirely
antithetical to the rules adopted

935
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:12,070
in a 600 million person
country like Indonesia,

936
00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:14,480
or 200 million Brazilians?

937
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:17,210
Don't we need some
fundamental ground rules

938
00:51:17,210 --> 00:51:19,720
that the entire planet agrees with,

939
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:23,109
and efforts to harmonize
legal policy in a way

940
00:51:23,110 --> 00:51:26,240
that makes the rules applicable
to all of the citizens

941
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:29,160
of the world joined
together on the internet?

942
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:31,200
I see that as a challenge and I'd like

943
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:35,160
to hear some conversation
amongst the three of you

944
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:38,120
about each of these
areas of implementation

945
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:42,730
of policy that really, while
starting from a US focus,

946
00:51:42,730 --> 00:51:47,730
perhaps implicate a global
demand pull for coherent policy.

947
00:51:48,550 --> 00:51:51,300
- I have one question, which
is do you see this as something

948
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:53,960
that might be the province of
the United Nations Commission

949
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:55,960
under the National Trade Law, to harmonize

950
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:56,910
some of these laws?

951
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,480
- Some international body
certainly has to begin

952
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:05,250
to address the fact that we
are, whether we intend to

953
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:09,060
or not, we're moving
towards a balkanized system

954
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:14,040
of policy that doesn't help
resolve conflict when citizens

955
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:17,380
from every country, from every
jurisdiction within countries

956
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:20,120
are facing precisely the same challenges

957
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:22,880
in terms of their inequitable posture

958
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:26,130
vis-a-vis producers and
other corporate players.

959
00:52:26,130 --> 00:52:29,580
How does an individual citizen
get redress of grievances,

960
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:33,819
whether it's a privacy breach
or a liability consequence

961
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:36,360
that's imposed on them
because of poorly manufactured

962
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:39,150
or poorly designed technology product?

963
00:52:39,150 --> 00:52:42,060
These are challenges,
not just for the citizens

964
00:52:42,060 --> 00:52:45,279
of San Jose, California, but for citizens

965
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:48,640
of San Jose, Costa Rica and other cities

966
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:51,330
around the planet, and what
are we going to do about it?

967
00:52:51,330 --> 00:52:54,960
So certainly, the UN is
an important candidate

968
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:57,790
for taking responsibility for some sort

969
00:52:57,790 --> 00:52:59,340
of international harmonization.

970
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:03,970
- Well, and it seems like
the states are the place.

971
00:53:03,970 --> 00:53:07,810
The US states are the innovators,

972
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:11,360
'cause we've mentioned
California, Virginia, Oregon,

973
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:14,440
and there's others that are really trying

974
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:18,770
out different theories and
approaches all over the country.

975
00:53:18,770 --> 00:53:21,259
And hopefully these best practices

976
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:24,713
will come together in some coherent way.

977
00:53:25,790 --> 00:53:29,960
- Well, I being outside of
the Washington D.C. area,

978
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:32,340
I think I'm unique among all the panelists

979
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:34,830
and I would just ask the other panelists,

980
00:53:34,830 --> 00:53:36,670
what are you hearing about the prospects

981
00:53:36,670 --> 00:53:39,140
for federal data protection
legislation these days?

982
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:43,040
Is it gonna be backloaded
behind all the things

983
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:45,340
that Biden administration
is taking off with

984
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:48,210
to address the really key
concerns of infrastructure

985
00:53:48,210 --> 00:53:50,220
and COVID and American families,

986
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:53,243
or what are you hearing
about that in the beltway?

987
00:53:54,270 --> 00:53:56,980
- I saw a panel of staffers who work

988
00:53:56,980 --> 00:53:59,960
on the privacy legislation, and they said

989
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:01,890
there's agreement on many issues,

990
00:54:01,890 --> 00:54:05,440
but private right of action
is the sticking point.

991
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:08,490
And so, there's really just a few issues

992
00:54:08,490 --> 00:54:11,700
that they can't get bi-partisan support.

993
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:15,352
So there may not be
anything passed this year.

994
00:54:16,450 --> 00:54:19,830
- Well, when my colleague, Bob Gellman,

995
00:54:19,830 --> 00:54:22,817
who's been a privacy expert for decades,

996
00:54:22,818 --> 00:54:25,820
writes periodic reviews,
one of the things he likes

997
00:54:25,820 --> 00:54:29,440
to point out is that with
more than 150 privacy statutes

998
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:32,560
around the world, over
100 of them still rely

999
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:35,190
on the FIPs, the 10
basic, or eight or nine,

1000
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:37,520
depending on which version of
FIPS you'd like to point to.

1001
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:40,670
But the fact that nations
around the planet, at least

1002
00:54:40,670 --> 00:54:43,860
on privacy and data
protection, tend to coalesce

1003
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:46,340
with common views around
some basic principles

1004
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:48,910
around the importance
of notice and consent

1005
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:52,319
and right of redress, it seems to me

1006
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:57,320
that wherever those new
principles are adopted

1007
00:54:57,730 --> 00:55:02,400
for more pervasive global
system, that they're likely

1008
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:06,870
to echo a common set of
principles that are shared widely.

1009
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:09,549
And that set of principles
may be the place to start,

1010
00:55:09,550 --> 00:55:13,630
perhaps in that UN body
that you mentioned, Steve.

1011
00:55:13,630 --> 00:55:18,630
- Well, a controversial issue
that I'm watching develop

1012
00:55:19,090 --> 00:55:20,460
right now, I think we're all watching,

1013
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:24,960
is the vaccine passport issue.

1014
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:28,000
It directly impacts US
businesses and their ability

1015
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,220
to maybe reopen and bring folks

1016
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:33,200
back into the work environment.

1017
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:34,779
There's a lot of discussion about

1018
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:37,260
whether or not that can be forced.

1019
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:40,220
There's a lot of discussion
about the Europeans.

1020
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:42,129
They're already rolling out,
if they haven't already,

1021
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:44,900
they are rolling out vaccine passports

1022
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:49,900
to protect public health,
but also encourage opening

1023
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,340
up their economies back again.

1024
00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:54,570
So one of the, as you were all discussing,

1025
00:55:54,570 --> 00:55:57,580
the thing that keeps coming
back is this controversy

1026
00:55:57,580 --> 00:55:59,962
that's starting to brew
at the state levels,

1027
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:03,440
but also internationally around,

1028
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:06,113
what does a vaccine passport look like?

1029
00:56:07,226 --> 00:56:09,460
Are Americans gonna be
comfortable downloading

1030
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:13,020
an app that's approved by an
international standards body

1031
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:15,660
of data, what happens to that data?

1032
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:17,920
Which laws apply, what privacy rights

1033
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:20,360
do people have to that data?

1034
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:23,410
So I turn it over to my colleagues,

1035
00:56:23,410 --> 00:56:27,560
but that's one of the issues
that is very topical right now.

1036
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:29,480
- There's another item on the list,

1037
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:31,850
which is I was attending a meeting of

1038
00:56:31,850 --> 00:56:34,740
the American Bar Association
Cybersecurity Legal Task Force

1039
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:36,509
this morning and there's discussion

1040
00:56:36,510 --> 00:56:38,750
about an impending executive order

1041
00:56:38,750 --> 00:56:41,470
from the Biden administration
on cybersecurity.

1042
00:56:41,470 --> 00:56:43,930
So Catherine and Michael,
do you know anything

1043
00:56:43,930 --> 00:56:46,379
about what that executive
order is gonna contain?

1044
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:53,160
- I know that one of my clients
has seen the executive order

1045
00:56:53,630 --> 00:56:57,187
already, but I'm not
privy to what it contains.

1046
00:56:57,187 --> 00:57:01,470
- The vaccine passports
has really been a hot topic

1047
00:57:01,470 --> 00:57:04,731
on the news, but it seems like it really,

1048
00:57:04,731 --> 00:57:08,800
the issue is is even broader and actually,

1049
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,970
HIPAA is gonna need to be updated

1050
00:57:10,970 --> 00:57:14,149
in how healthcare
information, particularly

1051
00:57:14,150 --> 00:57:17,750
as it becomes more and more
sensitive, is protected,

1052
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:21,720
is gonna become an issue
for the next few years.

1053
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:23,209
- I think we probably have a minute or two

1054
00:57:23,210 --> 00:57:26,370
to take questions from attendees,

1055
00:57:26,370 --> 00:57:28,839
and we should reserve
that moment to do that.

1056
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:30,810
But I wanna thank all three of you

1057
00:57:30,810 --> 00:57:32,630
for the thoughtful presentations

1058
00:57:32,630 --> 00:57:35,650
and the extensive
preparation that I know it

1059
00:57:35,650 --> 00:57:38,350
has taken to get this far, but let's hear

1060
00:57:38,350 --> 00:57:41,493
from our attendees now and
see what's on their minds.

1061
00:57:42,803 --> 00:57:46,573
Again, thank you very much
for being with us today.
