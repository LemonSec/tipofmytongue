1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:01,202
- Hi there.

2
00:00:01,203 --> 00:00:02,210
This is Jim Ducharme.

3
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm Chief Operating Officer

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,970
and General Manager for RSA's fraud

5
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:07,880
and risk intelligence division.

6
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,340
And unfortunately, I'm here to tell you

7
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:10,903
that your fraud metrics suck,

8
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,920
but seriously, I wanna
have a discussion today

9
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,530
about how to best present fraud metrics

10
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:19,300
to a line of business.

11
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,340
So my session here at RSA Conference

12
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:22,990
is your fraud metrics sucks,

13
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:25,009
you're losing money and
the C-suite ignoring you

14
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:26,980
so now, what do we do?

15
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:29,150
So again, today, we'll
go through some tips

16
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:32,910
and tricks for how to make
sure that your fraud metrics

17
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:35,709
are making the most
impact to your business

18
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:37,820
in helping you achieve better results

19
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,640
within your fraud organization.

20
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,260
So this presentation really is geared

21
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:44,339
towards folks that work
in a fraud department

22
00:00:45,573 --> 00:00:47,150
inside of a banking institution,

23
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:49,220
some sort of a financial institution.

24
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:50,620
And your job is largely

25
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:53,760
historically has been to stop the bad guys

26
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,920
from stealing money from your customers.

27
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,190
Typically, we've got a fraud team

28
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:03,510
that's largely focused on again,

29
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,429
stopping fraud in its tracks.

30
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,623
That may be through things
like doing wire transfers,

31
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,310
peer to peer payments,

32
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,860
card not present credit card transactions,

33
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,250
things like that, anywhere
that you see money

34
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,260
going from one place to the next.

35
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:19,750
And your goal is to make sure

36
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:22,260
that those transactions are legitimate

37
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:25,250
and stopping fraud historically.

38
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:28,250
So you're worried about metrics
like fraud detection rates,

39
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,000
looking at false positives,

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,630
you're looking at account lockouts,

41
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:34,000
privacy issues, compliance issues.

42
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,560
And even on the security side,

43
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,090
you may be looking at
things like DDoS attack,

44
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:43,090
or SLAs around performance
of your infrastructure,

45
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:46,036
different types of events as we see there,

46
00:01:46,037 --> 00:01:48,940
the time it takes you to
respond to an incident,

47
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:51,250
or even in a fraud management team

48
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:54,550
how deep your case management
cues you're getting

49
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:57,450
when dealing with suspected fraud.

50
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,990
All these things are really important

51
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:01,820
as operational controls
within a fraud team,

52
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,220
but we tend to find with our customers

53
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,090
when a fraud team is reporting

54
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:09,910
these types of metrics
out of the organization,

55
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:12,470
people's eyes glaze
over and they sit there

56
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:15,840
and they really don't
understand a lot of the metrics,

57
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,610
because as we look at the business focus

58
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:21,320
they're speaking a completely
different language.

59
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,200
When we talk about the business focus,

60
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,510
what they care about is what
is the customer experience?

61
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:28,840
What do they think about our brand, right?

62
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,370
So for example, you may hear things like,

63
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:34,700
when things go bad you
think about all of it's

64
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,810
because we have a high rate of fraud,

65
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:40,950
or a high rate of step-up notifications

66
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:42,619
going to our customers.

67
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,800
What the business thinks about is,

68
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,850
Oh my God, we're getting
killed in Twitter right now.

69
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,750
Look at all the bad tweets about us.

70
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,860
Look at all the mean tweets about us.

71
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,090
What they care about from
a customer experience

72
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,970
is making sure it's frictionless.

73
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:57,530
These are valuable customers

74
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:59,620
and we want them to do business with us.

75
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:02,220
So anytime a customer hits friction,

76
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,620
that results in a mean tweet.

77
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,400
And then finally retention, right?

78
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,770
We wanna keep our customers.

79
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,150
We wanna keep them happy

80
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,323
and we wanna keep them using our service.

81
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:13,743
Next, speed to market.

82
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,560
As a financial institution,

83
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,640
you're always looking
for ways to innovate,

84
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,260
get your customers to make it
easier to move their money,

85
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,859
spend their money, do business with us.

86
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,660
It needs to align with the business

87
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:28,549
and our objectives as
a financial institution

88
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:32,270
to whether it's lend money,
let people borrow money,

89
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:34,480
transfer money, pay their parents.

90
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,783
Whatever it may be,

91
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,830
it's important that we understand

92
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:42,380
how these things relate
to our business objectives

93
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,440
as a financial institution,

94
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,579
and likewise, look for new
ways, new revenue stream.

95
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:50,200
So whether it's new forms
of peer to peer payment,

96
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,170
digital currency, easier your ways

97
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:56,230
to transfer money to a
friend or a colleague,

98
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:58,500
pay for dinner, that sort of thing.

99
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,850
And lastly, we need to make sure

100
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:02,366
that it's cost-effective, right?

101
00:04:02,366 --> 00:04:04,240
So they look at what is the cost

102
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,110
of all of this fraud management,

103
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:10,250
or even the infrastructure necessary

104
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,600
to run our fraud operations

105
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,290
or even our line of business around this.

106
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:16,599
So essentially, I've gone through

107
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,140
a number of very different
perspectives here

108
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:21,329
that we typically see from a fraud team,

109
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:23,580
really focused on a lot
of the operating controls

110
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,240
that are aimed at stopping fraud,

111
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,700
stopping us from losing money

112
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,969
to the business who really is more focused

113
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:32,250
on how do we accelerate our business?

114
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,510
How do we make sure our customers love us?

115
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:37,920
How do we make sure those
tweets online are all positive?

116
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,460
So what we need to do is figure
out how we bridge the gap

117
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,039
of this communication between them.

118
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,000
How do we have an effective
means of communication

119
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,173
between a fraud team and
the people in the business?

120
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,640
So a couple of tricks of the trade,

121
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,340
how do we maximize our metrics

122
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:58,510
as we communicate out
of a fraud organization?

123
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,343
First and foremost,

124
00:04:59,343 --> 00:05:01,520
we need to stop being
viewed as a cost center.

125
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,919
So while I put the emphasis
in the previous slide

126
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,220
around things like operational controls,

127
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,490
around fraud detection
and fraud management,

128
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:11,410
so for example, how many suspect fraud

129
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:12,940
incidents have we seen?

130
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:17,723
What is the dollar amount
associated with known fraud?

131
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:21,219
Those are important metrics,

132
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,590
but we also need to think about,

133
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:25,159
again, that impact to the customer.

134
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,780
How can we be viewed as
ways to reduce frictions

135
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,799
on customers to drive more business?

136
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,483
Let me be clear on that.

137
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:36,690
When you even in your
personal life go shopping

138
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:37,890
and you open up your wallet

139
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:39,510
or your purse to go pay for something

140
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:41,360
and you're gonna use a credit card,

141
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,220
you might have multiple credit
cards in your wallet or purse

142
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:47,070
which card are you gonna pull out?

143
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:49,330
The card that declined you the most,

144
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:51,750
because it suspects potential fraud

145
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,910
'cause you're traveling,

146
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:55,300
or the one that reduces friction on you,

147
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,490
the one that's easiest to use?

148
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,900
Of course, you're gonna
use the easiest one.

149
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,609
So when we think about fraud management

150
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:04,510
it's not just about stopping the bad guys,

151
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:08,370
but it's about putting in
technologies and capabilities

152
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:11,910
that allow our legitimate
customers to spend their money,

153
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:15,490
to transfer their money as
easy as humanly possible.

154
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:17,460
So don't just think about the metrics

155
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,099
that are about stopping bad guys.

156
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,440
They are important,

157
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,380
but you also need to think about metrics

158
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:25,219
that are viewed as positive
indicators of business.

159
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:28,890
So how many customers
did we allow to transact?

160
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:30,150
So when we think about that

161
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:32,380
don't just think about the fraud rates

162
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:36,423
or the amount of fraud that
we saw in the past quarter,

163
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,330
month, quarter, year, whatever it may be,

164
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:41,450
but also make sure that
we're communicating

165
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:45,360
the positive impacts of the
fraud center on the business.

166
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,270
How many positive frictionless experiences

167
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:51,909
did we make sure that our customers had

168
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:54,900
when using our financial services?

169
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:58,280
Next, remember what I like
to call the CNN headlines.

170
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,609
I've seen way too many presentations

171
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:02,560
from fraud teams to a business

172
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,570
that was filled with a
million and one metrics,

173
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:08,270
tons of data.

174
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:11,469
I've seen these very
complicated graphs being shown

175
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:16,470
that show the coefficient of
friction or fraud over time

176
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,750
as it relates to dollar
amount and location,

177
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,660
and your head wants to explode.

178
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,050
So one of the things I like to say

179
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,750
when I'm viewing these presentations

180
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,973
is I go what's your point?

181
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,659
That to me is a CNN headline.

182
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,540
How I do this I say,

183
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,860
okay, after you're done
presenting that slide

184
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:37,920
or that information to your listeners,

185
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,000
imagine they got up out
of the room and walked out

186
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,130
and there was a CNN reporter
on the outside and said,

187
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,270
so you came out of the presentation,

188
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,859
what did you hear?

189
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:51,080
What do you want them to
say after you're done?

190
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,890
What do you want them to go
out and tell that CNN reporter

191
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,640
about what they heard
about your presentation?

192
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,830
Start with that.

193
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:02,150
Write your own CNN headlines
of I want them to know

194
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:04,669
that the technologies
that we've put into place

195
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:06,020
have really helped provide

196
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,787
a frictionless experience
for our customers,

197
00:08:07,787 --> 00:08:11,669
and are driving business
results for our bank.

198
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:13,550
Maybe that's your CNN headline.

199
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:15,700
Maybe your CNN headline is,

200
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,460
look, we don't have enough
money to fight fraud.

201
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:21,049
It's taking to our
customers are pissed off,

202
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:23,620
because we're declining
their transactions too much

203
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:26,520
because we haven't put the
necessary controls into place

204
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,000
to really detect the good
guys from the bad guys.

205
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,700
So always write your CNN headlines.

206
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:35,230
And then once you've
written your CNN headlines,

207
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:37,150
build your content around that.

208
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,860
How important is that metric,

209
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,690
is that piece of information critical

210
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:44,049
to telling that headline story?

211
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:46,890
If you can't relate that piece of data

212
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:50,120
to that headline, leave it out, okay?

213
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,900
This is not a battle of how many metrics

214
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,199
can you show somebody.

215
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,780
It really comes down to how
you can be most effective

216
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:59,663
at telling the story that
you want to tell, okay?

217
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:02,500
So that's what my CNN headline was.

218
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,730
Next, drive investment
in your fraud programs

219
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:07,860
with actionable insights.

220
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,450
So when we think about the data

221
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:12,760
that we're gonna show
out in our CNN headlines,

222
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,319
are we trying to drive any sort of change

223
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,080
with how we wanna operate?

224
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,060
Are we looking to gain new investment

225
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:22,439
in additional technologies
or new practices,

226
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,510
new policies, or new people

227
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:26,710
to help us in this fight against fraud

228
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:30,070
and reducing friction for
our legitimate customers?

229
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,830
So when you think about your CNN headlines

230
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:36,240
maybe that is we need to invest
more in digital identity,

231
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,900
for example, to reduce
friction for our customers.

232
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:43,050
Think about how you
create actionable insights

233
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,010
out of the data.

234
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:46,710
So for example, if we do wanna,

235
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:50,040
for example, try to promote an investment

236
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,693
in say digital identity technologies,

237
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:55,480
what we might do is show some metrics

238
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,790
around what we call intervention rates,

239
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,240
which is how many times

240
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,850
are we causing our legitimate
customers to step up,

241
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:04,330
do a step up authentication

242
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:06,400
to prove they are who they say they are

243
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,329
only to complete their transaction.

244
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:11,480
So remember, these are
legitimate transactions

245
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,830
that we caused the user
to have to do something

246
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:17,100
whether it's respond to an OTP.

247
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,020
We may have even had to call them,

248
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:22,840
but it's friction we
introduced in the transaction

249
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,290
to help them move their money,

250
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:28,189
and maybe we say look at
the rate of interaction

251
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,330
of step up authentication
that we had to have

252
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:34,580
with these customers in their
legitimate transactions.

253
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:37,270
If we made an investment
in some, for example

254
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:38,890
digital identity solutions,

255
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:40,790
we could lower that intervention rate

256
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:45,650
resulting in happier customers
and more business, okay?

257
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:48,670
And to do that, this is the
investment that we need, okay?

258
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:50,479
So let's dive a little bit deeper

259
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,390
into that one for one second.

260
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:53,260
How do we do that?

261
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:55,660
So how do we do that effectively, right?

262
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,640
A lot of times what I see
in these presentations

263
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,240
is what I call there's a
bunch of what's on the page,

264
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,370
a bunch of metrics.

265
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:03,073
So I call those the what's.

266
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,550
My fraud detection rate,

267
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:08,532
my number of step up
authentications last month,

268
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,930
how many fraudulent transactions
happened are illegitimate.

269
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:14,870
Those are all the what.

270
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,030
You got to think about the

271
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:18,699
well, who cares about that and now what?

272
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,550
Or sometimes what I like to call the,

273
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:23,720
here's the what, now what's the so what,

274
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,600
and then now what, okay?

275
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,760
So when you think about the so what,

276
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,870
so what's the big deal

277
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:30,990
about the intervention rate being high?

278
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,110
Is it high?

279
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:36,430
You have to help your listeners understand

280
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:38,280
is that number good or bad?

281
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,670
Is that what we want it to be?

282
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,880
So there's a what that you show them.

283
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:46,323
Our step up authentication
rate of transactions is at 14%.

284
00:11:48,037 --> 00:11:48,870
Is that good?

285
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,270
Is that bad?

286
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:51,860
And that is not good.

287
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:55,920
We wanna strive to get an
intervention rate of under 5%.

288
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,170
So first of all, I've
established what good looks like

289
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:02,890
intervention rates should be less than 5%,

290
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:04,620
ideally even less than 2%.

291
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,210
We're running at 14%.

292
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:08,270
That's bad, okay?

293
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:10,829
So there's a bit of a so what there.

294
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,990
Make sure that you have
the now what, okay?

295
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:14,940
So how do we fix it?

296
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:18,050
That is your opportunity with the now what

297
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:21,750
to drive interest in
investments in new controls,

298
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:25,720
process changes, people
to get that investment

299
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:30,560
to improve that number
from 14% to under five.

300
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,170
And again, make sure
that you're communicating

301
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:34,949
what your did by making that investment.

302
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:37,240
Our goal is to get that from 14 to five.

303
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,770
Set a target, okay?

304
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:41,550
Very simply in that way.

305
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:43,620
Some other tricks on here when it comes

306
00:12:44,906 --> 00:12:46,370
to help you think about how do we do

307
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:48,870
the so what and the now what,

308
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,630
the so what's can be around

309
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:51,930
is there something you can do

310
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:53,079
that can help increase revenue?

311
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,950
The business gonna love
it if you can tell them,

312
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:59,210
look, by implementing this
sort of this solution,

313
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:01,510
we believe that that
will increase revenue.

314
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:04,740
By reducing friction from 14% to 5%,

315
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,310
our customers are gonna be more apt

316
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:09,390
to pull out our credit
card than our competitors.

317
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:11,910
Our customers are gonna
want to use our platform

318
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:13,360
to manage their money.

319
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,500
That means more money.

320
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,500
That means our customers are happier,

321
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:20,120
and we're getting more revenue
due to transaction fees.

322
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:23,460
Next, another idea is
again for the so what,

323
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,900
how does it help our customer?

324
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,290
Again, we've talked about that, right?

325
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:29,819
The frictionless experience
quantify that, right?

326
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,980
How do we reduce the
burden on our customers

327
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,130
which again can lead to more revenue?

328
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:35,970
Or lastly in some cases,

329
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:38,060
it could be operational expense, right?

330
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:40,780
It's like, look, I can save
the company a lot of money

331
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,100
whether it be in fraud losses

332
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:45,530
or even operational expense
if we implement this piece.

333
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:47,819
So those are just a couple
examples that you can use

334
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:52,690
in your so what part of your presentation

335
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:54,300
around your metrics.

336
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,079
The now what is obviously
the actual insights

337
00:13:59,035 --> 00:14:00,257
that you can drive out of that,

338
00:14:00,257 --> 00:14:02,060
the things that you wanna promote

339
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:06,173
to advance your fraud
detection capabilities.

340
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:09,170
So next, let's talk about a little bit

341
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:11,469
what you should measure and
how you should measure it.

342
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:14,450
The graphic on the right
I think is very important.

343
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:15,750
I tend to have this printed out,

344
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:19,050
and I put it on my wall of when
I'm doing this presentation,

345
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:22,420
did I check the box of
all four of those areas?

346
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,349
That sweet spot is right
in the middle of that

347
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:26,120
and we'll go through that.

348
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,550
So I like to start on the bottom

349
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,930
right of those concentric circles.

350
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:31,199
And the first thing is that

351
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,530
they're transparent simple calculations.

352
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:37,100
They've gotta be easy to understand.

353
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,660
If you're showing things
like coefficient of frictions

354
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,920
and people don't even
know what that means,

355
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,360
or any ratios things like that,

356
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,760
they've gotta be very simple

357
00:14:47,615 --> 00:14:49,440
and in ways that anybody can understand

358
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,840
that's that common interpretation as well.

359
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,990
Or I can say things rather than say

360
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:57,040
we have a 4% intervention rate,

361
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,079
what does that mean?

362
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:02,070
That means for every 10,000
legitimate transactions,

363
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:07,070
we have to tell a customer to
prove their identity 50 times.

364
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,600
So how can you put it in a way that people

365
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,800
are gonna understand the customer impact

366
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,349
or the revenue impact ,

367
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:15,190
something that the business can relate to?

368
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:17,010
And remember, they're gonna be thinking

369
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:19,160
about the impact on their customer,

370
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,770
the impact on their revenue,

371
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:23,380
or the impact of their
expenses for the most part.

372
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,560
Maybe there's other things
that they care about,

373
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,959
but communicate it in ways

374
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:30,090
that are simple to understand, okay?

375
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:33,230
Next, accessible incredible data.

376
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:35,380
Too many times I see metrics put up

377
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:38,080
that it diverts the conversation,

378
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:41,410
because everybody's got
a different calculation

379
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:43,530
around the same piece of data.

380
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:46,790
So examples here are where people

381
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:49,430
are computing them in different ways,

382
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:52,719
and so you end up in a room arguing about,

383
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,870
well, is our intervention rate 14%,

384
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,860
but that only applies
to this part of the bank

385
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:00,000
or this this number is too high,

386
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,140
that excludes this.

387
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:04,670
Make sure that the data
is readily accessible

388
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:07,723
by the people that are
gonna care about that,

389
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:10,199
and it's credible, right?

390
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,330
So there's an authoritative
source of information

391
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:14,800
that's readily accessible.

392
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,740
The accessibility part
is important as well

393
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,160
because if you're driving change,

394
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,469
in other words if you're trying to do that

395
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:22,370
I keep going back to that example

396
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:25,760
of we're gonna try to drive
a 14% intervention rate

397
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:30,000
or step up authentication
rate down to a less than 5%,

398
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,320
you're gonna need to measure that

399
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,970
to show you a progress towards that goal.

400
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:36,930
So it can't be something
of, like for example,

401
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:39,569
I've seen people throw up things like

402
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:43,580
we want to improve net promoter score.

403
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:46,290
So there's a calculation called NPS,

404
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:49,349
wonderful calculation of understanding

405
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:53,480
your customer's propensity to
do business with you again,

406
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,900
but if you only measure NPS once a year

407
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,160
understand you're gonna
have to wait a year

408
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:02,300
to see if what you've done has impact.

409
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,669
I've seen companies
that use NPS as a goal,

410
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:07,589
but yet they only measure
it every couple of years.

411
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:12,500
Unless you want to be measure
success in years timeframe,

412
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,770
it's not a great way to
set your presentation

413
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,760
to be able to get investments

414
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,109
to show that meaningful progress.

415
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:22,619
You need to make those measures accessible

416
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:23,729
and readily available,

417
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:26,089
so you can show that progress.

418
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:28,760
And lastly, is actionable, right?

419
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:33,150
So how can you define something to do

420
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:34,640
that it's pretty clear that,

421
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,250
Oh, if I do these things this
metric will get better, right?

422
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,800
So make sure that they're actionable.

423
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:45,460
And so these are the criteria
that I typically look at

424
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,433
when I look at these metrics.

425
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,810
So some examples are on the left

426
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:51,020
of some things that you should measure.

427
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:54,577
The first two are largely
inside of a fraud team

428
00:17:54,577 --> 00:17:57,514
and the second two relate
to the business side.

429
00:17:57,514 --> 00:18:00,870
So the first is net fraud
losses and avoidance.

430
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:02,979
So these are quantifying things

431
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:05,040
like what is the dollar amount associated

432
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,360
with a fraud that we're seeing?

433
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,570
Put it in ways that the
business understands.

434
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:12,750
This is lost revenue, right?

435
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,530
This is how much money was stolen

436
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:18,203
out of our pockets due
to missed fraud, okay?

437
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,570
So it's a very clear number.

438
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:22,659
It's very transparent.

439
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,340
It's accessible.

440
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:26,330
It should be accessible,

441
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:29,540
and everybody understands
this is how much money

442
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:30,993
the bad guys got away with.

443
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:33,169
It's also can be actionable.

444
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:35,070
This is where your action
plan comes into play.

445
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:37,300
It's like, okay, how do we reduce that?

446
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,840
All right, we can put
these controls into place,

447
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:44,030
these processes in the place
to help avoid the circumstances

448
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:46,540
that caused that type of fraud.

449
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:49,100
Operational expenses
is another one, right?

450
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,500
So how can we make it easier

451
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,800
with detected fraud for our fraud centers

452
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,940
to deal with the cases when
a customer calls up and say,

453
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:58,710
Hey, you declined a transaction for me

454
00:18:58,710 --> 00:18:59,930
because of suspected fraud,

455
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,423
but it was actually me?

456
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:03,730
How do you deal with that,

457
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:07,223
and what is the impact to
your customer satisfaction?

458
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:09,250
Revenue generation.

459
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:12,190
So this is one where I
think here's a great example

460
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:15,940
that I don't see a lot
of fraud teams report on

461
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:19,700
is those positive impact
to fraud detection,

462
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,060
which is how many legitimate transactions

463
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:25,510
went through without any sort of friction.

464
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:27,833
We didn't have to step up the user.

465
00:19:29,873 --> 00:19:33,850
We had a good level of
proof that the person

466
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:35,500
is who they claim to be

467
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,840
so we didn't have to challenge them,

468
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,909
and they were able to
complete their transaction

469
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:44,080
without any interruption in their flow.

470
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,360
And lastly, related to that
is the customer impact.

471
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,570
These are probably the most valuable

472
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:52,210
sorts of metrics that you can report on.

473
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:54,303
And there are things like I mentioned,

474
00:19:56,839 --> 00:20:00,360
what's the percentage of
frictionless transactions

475
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,550
that we're allowing our
customers to perform?

476
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:05,470
And again, in very good fraud teams

477
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:10,470
we are seeing 95 to 98%
frictionless experience

478
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:13,679
for their end users.

479
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:17,230
So again, it's just a benchmark

480
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:19,753
that we see in really good fraud teams,

481
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,379
but you can also do that in other ways

482
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,030
if you're dealing with
e-commerce transactions,

483
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:26,300
or if you're on the merchant side, right?

484
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,460
Think about how long it takes for a user

485
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,570
to check out how much friction

486
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:32,500
are we adding to the checkout experiences

487
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,300
as a direct correlation

488
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,540
to how long the checkout experience is.

489
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:39,020
The more that we can reduce that time

490
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,480
the easier the transaction is,

491
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,710
the more apt the customer

492
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:44,020
is gonna do business with us again.

493
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:46,520
And next, card abandonment rates.

494
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:50,073
If they're trouble getting
through the checkout experience,

495
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,340
card abandonment is the worst thing

496
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,620
that you can have on a merchant side.

497
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,969
Even many times money merchants will say

498
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:00,240
card abandonment is worse
than fraud at many times,

499
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,990
because I've just lost a customer,

500
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:03,700
I've lost a sale,

501
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:07,880
and friction can help encourage
card abandonment rates,

502
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:11,660
'cause customers are just like
this is just too hard, okay?

503
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,960
So let's go through a
couple of quick examples

504
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:17,510
here to wrap this up.

505
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:19,080
So the first is around card issuers.

506
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,710
These are credit card issuers,

507
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:23,900
and the shift in focus in fraud team

508
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,810
from fraud detection to reducing friction.

509
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:29,169
So card issuers really now are focused on

510
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:31,500
how do we make sure that customers

511
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:36,370
can transact with us as
easily is as humanly possible.

512
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:38,402
There was a standard called 3D Secure 1.0

513
00:21:38,403 --> 00:21:39,610
that was implemented,

514
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:43,620
and you may have seen this in
things like Verified by Visa,

515
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:46,179
that when you're in a card
not present transaction ID

516
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,530
or you were shopping at Jim's Tackle shop

517
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:49,570
and buying some gear

518
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:51,669
and you go through the checkout experience

519
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:53,010
and these popups would come up

520
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:55,240
asking you to verify
your identity and such,

521
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,250
that was the 3D Secure 1.O protocol.

522
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,040
What we recognized in that protocol

523
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:03,870
was that it was filled
with friction on end users.

524
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:08,870
So there is now a new
standard called 3DS2.x

525
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:11,570
that is aimed at really
reducing losing that friction,

526
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:14,310
but improving fraud
detection rates as well.

527
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:16,760
So with 3DS2, we're shifting our focus

528
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,120
from how much fraud did we detect,

529
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,189
to how do we ensure a
frictionless experience

530
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:25,453
for card not present credit
card transactions, right?

531
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:27,263
In order to get there,

532
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:32,263
we really had to have an understanding

533
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:35,170
of how transaction declines,

534
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:37,460
and even the friction that we experienced

535
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:41,310
in legitimate transaction
impacted our customers NPS?

536
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:42,250
And when I say customers,

537
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:45,290
I mean the credit card issuers customers.

538
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:47,659
So again, we had card issuers

539
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,340
that we're using some of these protocols

540
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:52,040
in high friction and
the checkout experience

541
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:55,020
and they were seeing card usage go down,

542
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:57,270
because there was an
easier card in their wallet

543
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:58,910
that they prefer to use.

544
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:02,100
So many of the card issuers
that we deal with today

545
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:05,179
really when they come to us

546
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:07,450
to help them with their fraud solutions,

547
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:10,130
yes, we have to talk about
fraud detection rates,

548
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:13,460
but more importantly,
we're talking more about

549
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:16,240
how do we help them reduce
friction on their end users

550
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,200
to have a competitive advantage

551
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,360
against other card issuers, okay?

552
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,810
Next, learned false positives.

553
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:28,111
We had to learn that false
positives ruin customer trust.

554
00:23:28,112 --> 00:23:31,830
So for example, when you're
at a checkout experience

555
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:34,240
and it declined your
card for suspected fraud

556
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,630
and then you get a notification

557
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:37,100
from their fraud team that says,

558
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,260
Hey, we think it was fraud.

559
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:40,250
Like, no, that was me.

560
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:41,260
That was actually me.

561
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:43,600
Why did you decline my card?

562
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,520
That erodes your customer's confidence

563
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,379
that your security controls,

564
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:51,070
your fraud controls are effective.

565
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:53,730
So understand that relationship between.

566
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:55,470
Don't just understand

567
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:58,090
this is how many false positives we had,

568
00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:01,070
but translate that into the impact

569
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:04,419
on your end user customers, okay?

570
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:07,430
And lastly, the other thing that we saw

571
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:11,270
in these days with 3DS1.0 and
poor fraud detection rates

572
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:13,030
was that the fraud
analyst see those people

573
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:16,020
that are making the phone calls
to the card holders to say,

574
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:18,100
Hey, we suspected fraud.

575
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:20,730
These fraud teams were
completely overwhelmed

576
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:23,840
by those by calls, by those cases

577
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,480
in dealing with their end customers.

578
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,130
Again, another example

579
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:31,180
where it hurts your
customer's confidence in you

580
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:33,740
as well as reduces your revenue,

581
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:36,390
reduces the chance they're
gonna use your card again,

582
00:24:38,496 --> 00:24:40,730
and it's not helping
you actually fight fraud

583
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:42,870
or increase revenue.

584
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:46,000
So here, when our customers look at this,

585
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,670
the conversation around metrics

586
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:49,870
and reporting up out
of fraud organizations

587
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:51,760
becomes much more about

588
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:56,400
the percentage of transactions
that are frictionless,

589
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,900
and, therefore, resulting

590
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,860
in a positive user experience, okay?

591
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:02,929
And many good fraud organizations

592
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:06,130
work collaboratively with the business

593
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:09,060
to actually quantify
that friction experience

594
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:11,970
into how many card
transactions have we done?

595
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:15,010
What is the revenue associated
with those transactions?

596
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:17,080
How much money are our customers flowing?

597
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,399
And we wanna see the direct correlation

598
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,640
of this technology around
frictionless fraud detection

599
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:27,423
with growing usage of cards
or the banking services, okay?

600
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:34,250
A nice segue to creating
what we call fusion centers.

601
00:25:34,597 --> 00:25:35,820
So as a fraud organization

602
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,669
you've got limited insights to metrics,

603
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:39,900
but the more that you can
reach out beyond the borders

604
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:43,270
of the fraud management team
to lines of the business

605
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:45,560
even to your SOC what have you,

606
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:48,450
you can start to now collaborate with them

607
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:51,790
on the true business impact
of the work that you're doing.

608
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:52,960
Again, like I mentioned,

609
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,730
where we've seen this successful

610
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:59,730
is where our customers in
the fraud management teams

611
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,190
are taking some of their fraud
detection rates, for example,

612
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:05,210
and then working with the line of business

613
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:06,770
to actually associate a dollar amount,

614
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:11,770
or look at the correlation
between fraud detection

615
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,149
or step up authentications
to card abandonment,

616
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:17,993
or to card usage itself.

617
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,760
On average, are we seeing card users

618
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,480
use their card more or less
as we make these changes

619
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:29,240
to our approaches to
fraud management, okay?

620
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,490
Likewise, this can also

621
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:33,050
go into better detection capabilities.

622
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:34,830
What do I mean by that?

623
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:36,689
So many times you have
a fraud management team

624
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:39,800
that might be focused in
one channel of a bank.

625
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,560
So for example, card
not present transactions

626
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,659
is one channel.

627
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:48,000
Another channel might be money transfers

628
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,670
within an online banking portal,

629
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:51,020
or a mobile banking portal,

630
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,523
or even in the branch.

631
00:26:54,457 --> 00:26:56,090
This approach to omni-channel,

632
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:58,949
or what we call
omni-channel fraud detection

633
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,280
is also critical.

634
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,610
What do I mean by that?

635
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:04,020
Taking, if you have these silos

636
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:09,020
of fraud detection within a
card not present, mobile web,

637
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:13,130
or a branch ATM channels in your business,

638
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:15,970
sharing that intelligence
about how fraud is happening,

639
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:19,860
where fraud is happening
is vitally important.

640
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,699
That way there you can actually detect

641
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,660
when a user is being targeted,

642
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,850
or there's a particular
pattern of fraud happening.

643
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:29,030
For example, there may
be calls to a call center

644
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:32,510
doing password resets over the phone,

645
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:33,980
and then immediately followed

646
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:37,120
by large transactions on a web portal.

647
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,409
In isolation, these two events

648
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:43,320
a large transfer of money
and a password reset

649
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,930
by themselves may not look suspicious,

650
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:50,620
but when we see them close together

651
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:52,360
that could be an indicator of fraud,

652
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:56,280
that somebody was able to not
break through the web portal,

653
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:00,430
but they were able to fool
a call center employee

654
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:05,250
into giving a fraudster
access to your web portal.

655
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:07,050
So the more that you
can share intelligence

656
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:09,610
across these different
silos of fraud management

657
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:14,610
or even across information from
things like the call center

658
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:18,020
to events like somebody just called in

659
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:20,120
and changed your password on a web portal,

660
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:22,459
the more that that informs
your fraud management team

661
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:24,420
of your web web channel team

662
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:27,723
to detect fraudulent activities, okay?

663
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:32,820
And then finally, the
better business insights

664
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:36,450
really are those things where
we can correlate these events

665
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:38,450
to changes in business metrics,

666
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,487
I.e. increase usage of cards,

667
00:28:40,487 --> 00:28:45,321
increased usage of our online
portal or the converse, right?

668
00:28:45,321 --> 00:28:47,310
Where we're seeing it go down.

669
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:49,970
How are these controls
helping move our business

670
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:53,513
positively or negatively, okay?

671
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,862
So just to wrap up,

672
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:59,410
what should you do to now take

673
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:00,540
what I've showed you today,

674
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:01,659
and be actionable?

675
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:02,980
So much like my metrics,

676
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:06,190
I want you to walk away
with these CNN headlines

677
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:10,480
and these actions to take when next time

678
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,280
you go to report on your fraud metrics.

679
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,639
So, first of all,

680
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,420
just take inventory of what
you're reporting on today,

681
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:21,050
go through and apply the CNN
headlines approach to it.

682
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:23,560
Like, what do you want
people to get out of that?

683
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:28,080
Apply the so what, now
what, the here's what,

684
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,439
so what, now what, or the
so what, who cares now,

685
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,210
what factor to the metrics.

686
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:36,150
Do people understand is that good or bad?

687
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:37,420
That's the so what.

688
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:40,490
What's the impact to our
customers, or so what?

689
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:42,010
And then, what do we do about it?

690
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:43,970
Do we need to do something?

691
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:46,180
So think about that aspect as well,

692
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:48,040
but just over what you're doing today,

693
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,659
and throw out those things

694
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,640
that either don't help
you with the CNN headline

695
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,100
or really aren't actionable.

696
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,203
They may be important,

697
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,709
but if there's nothing
you wanna do about it

698
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:02,590
or if there's no so what to it,

699
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:04,120
it's not useful, okay?

700
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:07,389
So assess what you're doing today.

701
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:09,780
Next, for the first three months

702
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:10,710
following this presentation,

703
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:14,040
you should start to build
that common language

704
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:16,570
and objectives with the
business and the fraud teams,

705
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:18,439
put your metrics aside for a minute

706
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,800
and go talk to some of the
people that you're presenting to

707
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,240
across the lines of business in the bank.

708
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:28,240
Go talk to the people
that own the online portal

709
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:30,360
for your banking business

710
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:33,639
or your card processing division,

711
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:38,050
and understand from them
what makes them successful.

712
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:39,290
What are their options objectives?

713
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:40,780
And you'll probably hear things

714
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:42,110
like with card not present like,

715
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:44,780
look, when people are shopping online

716
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:46,160
we wanna see that they're using

717
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,530
our card more than competitors.

718
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:49,720
We wanna see growth.

719
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,370
We see card not present

720
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:53,770
or online shopping trends
going in this direction.

721
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:55,430
We want our card not present

722
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:56,900
or our online shopping trends

723
00:30:56,900 --> 00:31:00,710
to outpace that of the industry.

724
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:02,310
Understand now think about,

725
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:05,540
okay, how does my work in the fraud team

726
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:09,923
help align with their
business objectives, okay?

727
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,379
And follow on to that.

728
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:16,310
Develop your reporting metrics
align with that, right?

729
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:19,700
Start with what they
care about as a business,

730
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,760
or again, you may even be looking

731
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,490
across the channel to another fraud team

732
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:26,090
in a different part of the bank,

733
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:29,900
or maybe even to the SOC

734
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,920
that's dealing with security incidents.

735
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,880
Many times the SOC, the
security incident team,

736
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,480
the security operations center,

737
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,210
and our fraud operation
centers go hand in hand

738
00:31:41,442 --> 00:31:43,170
and yet they don't talk enough.

739
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:44,300
So reach across the aisle

740
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,210
and look for those objectives.

741
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:47,730
And then from that,

742
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:50,530
start to evaluate potential cross-channel

743
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:53,230
or what we call
omni-channel fusion centers.

744
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:56,890
Have these groups that get
together to share intelligence.

745
00:31:56,890 --> 00:31:58,530
Bring in the folks that even where

746
00:31:58,530 --> 00:32:00,210
there's less technology involved

747
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:02,940
like maybe in an online call center

748
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:05,160
where it's human talking to human,

749
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:08,630
what sort of interactions
on those call centers

750
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:11,153
is helpful information to a fraud team?

751
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,670
What information is useful

752
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:16,553
from an ATM network perspective,

753
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:20,193
a branch center, et cetera?

754
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,803
Bring the SOC into the table,

755
00:32:23,804 --> 00:32:28,500
and align how we talk
about growing the business

756
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:31,930
and the roles we each have
to play in doing that.

757
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:34,270
And then lastly, this is
more difficult to get,

758
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:35,900
but analysts can help you with this,

759
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:39,090
or even your vendors
should be able to help you

760
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:41,220
with benchmarking against your peers.

761
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:44,250
I have this conversation
with our customers a lot

762
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:47,590
where we share some of their metrics

763
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:49,600
and they don't even know if they're good.

764
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,590
I had one, two weeks
ago where they actually

765
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:54,990
thought their fraud detection
rates were very good,

766
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:57,800
and when I can compare
that to some of what we see

767
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:01,970
as the best in class
fraud detection rates,

768
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:04,570
I can share with them not information

769
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:05,669
about our other customers,

770
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:08,960
but I can say, look, we see better.

771
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,570
You should strive towards

772
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:11,899
you should not accept anything

773
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:14,760
more than 5% in the intervention
rate on your customers

774
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,700
on a card not present transaction.

775
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:19,960
You should expect greater
than 95% fraud detection rates

776
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,960
and low false positive rates.

777
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,400
Those are meaningful
things to your business.

778
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,150
So hopefully, you have
a strategic relationship

779
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:32,150
with your vendors that supply
fraud detection capabilities

780
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,890
to you that can help you
understand how are we doing.

781
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:37,373
So at this point,

782
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:41,650
I hope this was helpful
in helping you understand

783
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:45,440
how to more effectively
align with your business,

784
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,640
and communicate out the
value that you bring

785
00:33:48,729 --> 00:33:50,750
as a fraud management team,

786
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:52,110
and it will help you be more effective

787
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:54,810
in driving growth in your technologies

788
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:56,659
and your capabilities as well.

789
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,230
I hope you found this useful.

790
00:33:58,230 --> 00:33:59,720
I hope it was interactive

791
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,830
and we can continue the
conversation online,

792
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:04,699
and I look forward to
speaking to you again soon.

793
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:05,690
Thank you so much.
