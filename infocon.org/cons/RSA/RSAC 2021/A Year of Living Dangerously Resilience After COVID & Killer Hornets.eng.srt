1
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:03,650
- Hi and welcome to our session called,

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:05,540
A Year of Living Dangerously,

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:09,050
Resilience After COVID and Killer Hornets.

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:13,480
Today, I'm happy to be here
with a panel of experts.

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:17,000
My name is Lisa Lee, I'm
the Chief Security Advisor

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,160
and the Security Compliance

7
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,730
and Identity Business Development Lead

8
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,130
for Vertical Industries at Microsoft.

9
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:27,710
And with me, I have the
amazing Laura Deaner,

10
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:29,820
who's the Chief Information
Security Officer

11
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,479
at Northwestern Mutual.

12
00:00:31,479 --> 00:00:34,280
I have the fantastic Helen Patton,

13
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,940
who's Advisory CISO at Cisco.

14
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,300
And the always wonderful Patty Titus,

15
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,959
who's the Chief Information
Security Officer

16
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,850
and Chief Privacy Officer for Markel.

17
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,120
So we are so happy to be with you.

18
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,470
There is nothing like the year

19
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:52,067
or year and a half now
almost that we've seen

20
00:00:52,067 --> 00:00:56,570
in terms of global
pandemic, raging wildfires,

21
00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:00,570
an active hurricane
season, major cyber attacks

22
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,790
and of course killer hornets

23
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:06,820
that would force CISOs to
really be on their A game.

24
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:10,899
Before we jump into the real
technical aspects of our talk,

25
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,040
I do wanna remind you

26
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,590
that we're going to be
taking questions throughout,

27
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:17,010
and so we hope that you'll
put your questions in the chat

28
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,023
and we'll try to address those for you.

29
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:22,730
And before we jump into the
really technical aspects also,

30
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:27,730
we're going to talk first
about the impact on people,

31
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:30,760
like ourselves, as well as
the teams that we work with.

32
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:35,270
And so we're gonna kick off
there and start there for you.

33
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:40,270
Helen, can you share just a
little bit of your observations

34
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:44,630
or inner reflection on
mental health in general

35
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:46,723
after the year and a half that we've had.

36
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:50,810
- Yeah, it's been a really
tough year for all of us.

37
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:54,500
And I think when COVID first hit,

38
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,300
we jumped in like we do
in security all the time

39
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,440
and we went into firefight
mode and we're good at it

40
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:05,270
and we practice it and so
we were all sort of there,

41
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:08,539
and then month one became month two

42
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:10,769
and month two became month three

43
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,870
and month three added something
whether it was a wildfire

44
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:17,790
or killer hornet, and now here we are.

45
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:20,600
And so I think in the beginning, fine,

46
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,400
I think it dragged and
we all had to regroup

47
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,990
and work out how we were
gonna manage ourselves

48
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,670
but also help our teams manage

49
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:30,320
through the mental health issues.

50
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:34,780
And then I think, we're
hitting this cadence

51
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:38,610
of this has been going on
for so long that we have

52
00:02:40,179 --> 00:02:42,940
to sort of be constantly
monitoring our mental health

53
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,900
because on any given day it could be great

54
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,530
or it could be really bad.

55
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:52,140
So it's really been a tough
journey, but I think hopefully

56
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,589
as a community we've
learned a lot over the time,

57
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:57,933
but yeah, definitely something
for the record books.

58
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:00,269
- It is definitely.

59
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:04,830
Laura, do you think that workload
has had much of an impact

60
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:07,573
on mental health or what
kind of impact did it have?

61
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,470
- Yeah, great question,

62
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:11,730
and just wanna echo my fellow panelists,

63
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:13,773
Helen there great points.

64
00:03:14,985 --> 00:03:18,790
I think what we saw and
what we're continuing to see

65
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:23,790
is just a lack of
preparedness and the pressure

66
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:29,675
of ensuring that we have to
continue business as usual

67
00:03:29,675 --> 00:03:32,128
or even at the beginning
and then of course,

68
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:34,903
when the months kept going
by business as usual.

69
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:39,600
And all of that obviously
has the strain on anyone

70
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,480
but especially folks who are caregivers,

71
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,019
or have family members at home,

72
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:49,390
or children doing double
duty while also working

73
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:51,709
through the weekend on that
change request to make sure

74
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:56,270
that we all can participate
in business as usual

75
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:59,390
whether that's we can
work for remote access

76
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:03,690
or again, something that
perhaps we were not prepared for

77
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:05,510
before the pandemic.

78
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:09,950
And it definitely took a
toll on several members

79
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,910
of the community that I've spoken with,

80
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:15,740
my own team at the time,
you could sense it,

81
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:16,880
you can feel the stress,

82
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,760
you can feel the overworked
newness and I do think that

83
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,610
as a result we saw some
good things coming out of it

84
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:28,530
which is just an appreciation
for that work-life balance.

85
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:31,729
Whether that was through
ergs like most companies have

86
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:34,540
or if it was some of the articles we saw

87
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,780
about how important it is to take the time

88
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,363
for mental mental care.

89
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:43,450
- Yeah, I know it's been a
tremendous strain on people

90
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,810
in a lot of different
ways, and that could be,

91
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:48,220
like you said, from a
matter of health aspects,

92
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,758
physical health aspects,
the mental health,

93
00:04:50,758 --> 00:04:55,750
the emotional impact of maybe
losing someone close to you

94
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,239
either through the pandemic that we saw

95
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,450
or even some other just
normal parts of life,

96
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:04,740
losing people that way.

97
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,293
But Patty, what have you seen in terms of,

98
00:05:07,293 --> 00:05:09,950
what have companies been trying to do

99
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:14,610
to alleviate some of that
impact or to address it?

100
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:17,930
What sorts of things have
you seen companies doing?

101
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:20,960
- Oh, I think there's
been a lot of partnership

102
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,180
with our HR department

103
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,190
on the how we're safeguarding our people

104
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:26,930
as they're coming into the offices

105
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:29,993
for those that have to because
they're critical workers,

106
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:33,700
how are we encouraging
our management people

107
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,630
to reach out to folks that are at home,

108
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:39,400
making sure that people
that might be living alone

109
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:42,548
in Chicago, for example,

110
00:05:42,548 --> 00:05:46,180
have a connection back to
the company if they need it.

111
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:49,550
So we actually allowed people
to come back to the office

112
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,620
for mental health reasons.

113
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:54,090
There were some people, I
know it's hard to believe,

114
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:56,440
but when you get outside
of Richmond, Virginia

115
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,560
which is where I'm at, it gets
pretty rural pretty quickly

116
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,620
and so connectivity is a problem.

117
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:05,610
And everybody was excited that
this new satellite internet

118
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:07,940
is coming into the foray but
it came a little bit late

119
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:10,770
if it were here last year
it would've been better.

120
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:14,044
And I also think that
companies are really investing

121
00:06:14,045 --> 00:06:19,045
in programs like Calm or Headspace,

122
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,969
which are apps that are on your phone

123
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:26,010
and the company is giving
it too as a benefit.

124
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:29,570
And families that have children,

125
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:32,080
we invested in a product called Cratejoy,

126
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,570
where they got a box full of
things for the kids to do.

127
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:38,110
And so really thinking outside the box

128
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:41,489
of how do we keep connected to our people

129
00:06:41,489 --> 00:06:45,119
when we're such a connected company

130
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,453
and we truly believe in the
''stronger together'' motto.

131
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:53,780
- Yeah, and I know even with
Microsoft we've done things

132
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,340
like shortened meetings,
to try to give people

133
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:59,099
a little bit more free time in between

134
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,330
so there's been lots of
little, I think techniques

135
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:04,190
that have been impactful
just in the day-to-day

136
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,469
and then the larger stories
like some that you shared,

137
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:08,330
which is fantastic.

138
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:11,229
What about some of the
unexpected challenges?

139
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:14,850
I think for remote work is
something that comes up a lot,

140
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:16,490
lots of things that have happened there,

141
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:21,490
but, Laura what surprised
you most about remote work

142
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:25,782
or what surprised your team most?

143
00:07:27,587 --> 00:07:29,430
What was the most
challenging for employees,

144
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,983
maybe even for new employees?

145
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:33,720
- Yeah, great question.

146
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,240
I think everybody has a bit
of a different experience

147
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,910
but what I've heard that
has been very similar

148
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:42,460
is just the again, unpreparedness of it.

149
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,609
I know I sound like I'm
beating a dead horse here,

150
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:48,873
but I think even little things
like I don't have a laptop,

151
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:53,810
and how are we going to
commission a fleet of laptops

152
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:56,210
out to a group of employees

153
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:58,520
that are scattered throughout the globe.

154
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,659
That is not an easy
undertaking for the folks

155
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:06,980
that have to ensure that
that is happening safely

156
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:11,870
in a secure manner, but also
just the people themselves

157
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:15,790
really feeling anxious
because they didn't have

158
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:19,083
that capability at home.

159
00:08:19,924 --> 00:08:23,940
And so what was surprising
again was still the preparedness

160
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:27,130
but also just the community
that came together

161
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:28,313
to get it all done.

162
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:32,710
Yes, it was stressful times
but we were still able

163
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:35,960
to make it work for the
better of the business.

164
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:39,220
So it was really, it was
stressful but great to see,

165
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:42,111
it was great to see
everybody coming together.

166
00:08:42,111 --> 00:08:44,640
- Patty anything you would
add about remote work,

167
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,983
anything special that impacted
your team or that you did?

168
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:51,460
- What was interesting is we
had all the tech in place,

169
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,460
we're fully virtualized
all the way to the desktop

170
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:56,370
which is great so we could over a weekend,

171
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,760
the problem was tech adoption.

172
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,930
So people were used to coming
into a building every day,

173
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:05,540
logging into their terminal and getting on

174
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:08,913
they didn't know that what's an RSA token,

175
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:12,460
what's multifactor authentication,

176
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:15,150
what do you mean I can
get on to the network

177
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:17,350
using my home computer?

178
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:19,400
So there were some challenges with that.

179
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,569
And then of course, everybody's
kids are working from home

180
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:24,290
or doing schoolwork from home,

181
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:27,500
so sometimes you had households
that had one computer

182
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,380
for, well, I don't know, Laura
what do you have, four kids.

183
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:33,369
So imagine one computer for six people

184
00:09:33,369 --> 00:09:36,113
and it's like everybody
is gotta pick a time slot.

185
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,800
There were people trying to
work off of a candle fire

186
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,160
and that might get you the
email but that's about it,

187
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:49,319
so it's just the challenges
with technology adoption

188
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,093
I think were a little bit stark to us.

189
00:09:53,323 --> 00:09:57,689
- And Helen, I know you really
saw some striking experiences

190
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:59,920
partly because of the
location that you were in,

191
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,077
you were at Ohio State at the time,

192
00:10:02,077 --> 00:10:05,060
but also partly just being in higher ed

193
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:07,420
and just the impact from
an educational standpoint.

194
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:10,160
Can you talk a little
bit about what you saw?

195
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,010
- Yeah, it was interesting.

196
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:18,010
Higher ed uses WebEx, Zoom,
all of the online platforms

197
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,763
more than all other verticals combined.

198
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:29,740
And when COVID happened we went from,

199
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,840
in the Ohio State experience, we went from

200
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,760
about 10% of our classes
being taught online

201
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,550
to about 75% of our classes having

202
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:41,400
at least some aspect of it
taught online, if not completely.

203
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:45,390
That meant faculty members had
to know how to teach online,

204
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:48,780
we had to recreate classes
in the middle of semesters,

205
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:52,400
recreate syllabi in the
middle of the semester.

206
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,410
We had a hospital on campus

207
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:57,794
so we had patients coming and going.

208
00:10:57,794 --> 00:11:00,930
We were working with
county health officials

209
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:04,410
so contact tracing, all of
those things were happening.

210
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:06,800
And then we had students
who were sent home,

211
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,030
so in the beginning at least,
later we had to then work out

212
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:14,620
how to do constant testing
of said students as well.

213
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,240
But in the beginning we sent them home,

214
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,590
which was all well and good,

215
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:20,680
except our national
infrastructure wasn't there.

216
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,459
So just as Patty was referring to,

217
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:26,010
a lot of rural people
without really good broadband

218
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:27,650
but actually even within the cities,

219
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:29,199
there are sort of internet deserts

220
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,040
that are going on there as well.

221
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,640
So as a university we wanted to make sure

222
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,640
not only could our employees do their jobs

223
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,870
but could our students continue to learn.

224
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:42,530
So in some ways we had
to get really creative,

225
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:44,910
we sent hotspots home
with certain students,

226
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:49,060
we set mobile hotspots up in parking lots

227
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:52,500
so we had students who were
driving to a parking lot

228
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,760
and taking classes, doing
homework from their cars

229
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,990
those kinds of things that were going on.

230
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:01,380
And of course, while
all that was happening,

231
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,630
trying to make sure that,

232
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:08,500
and research can last
for many decades, right,

233
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,380
so making sure that that
research wasn't interrupted

234
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:14,350
and that included taking
care of animals and plants

235
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:17,930
and amoebas and DNA strands and
all of those kinds of things

236
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:20,560
so making sure that they
were protected as well.

237
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,189
So really, trying to work out

238
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:25,120
in this very difficult environment,

239
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,450
what are your crown jewels?

240
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:28,190
Is it the life safety of your students,

241
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:31,820
is it the life safety of your
multi-generational DNA strand,

242
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:34,260
is it, where do we, what?

243
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:37,450
So really complicated
risk management decisions

244
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:39,060
and discussions going on.

245
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:42,260
- Wow, well, let's shift
gears just a little bit

246
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:47,069
and talk about the idea of
when did security matter

247
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:49,566
and what were some of
the real security aspects

248
00:12:49,566 --> 00:12:52,870
and questions and
difficulties that came up?

249
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:57,607
Patty you have probably one
of my favorite stories related

250
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:02,849
to remote work but related
to when does security matter.

251
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:05,460
Tell us about what happened
and kind of the risks

252
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:08,573
that you uncovered in terms of
having people work from home?

253
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:12,980
- There were a couple of
things that we knew about

254
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:15,090
but when you're faced with a crisis

255
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:16,470
and everybody's gotta work from home

256
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:19,493
it's a little bit more in
your face, so to speak.

257
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,580
And we're an insurance company

258
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,640
and we issue checks to people,

259
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,689
and I know that's hard to believe

260
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:27,261
'cause we're all in high tech

261
00:13:27,261 --> 00:13:30,510
that people don't trust
those direct deposits

262
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:33,370
and that some people actually
don't have bank accounts

263
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:37,930
or their bank account is a
bank account in a building

264
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:40,800
not an online bank
account with a debit card.

265
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,760
And so, we had to cut
checks and that's important

266
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:48,300
because people live on those
checks month to month to month

267
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,699
and they rely on those checks.

268
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,010
And you can't just take
a check printing machine

269
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:55,750
and move it home, it's
gotta be in a facility

270
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:58,450
that's vetted by a financial institution

271
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:01,010
and there's all kinds of
regulations around it,

272
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:03,920
and so we had to become much more creative

273
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,790
about how we were allowing those people

274
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:10,880
with critical functions
to get into our facilities

275
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,340
and try to limit exposure
to non-critical people

276
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:15,750
that just wanted to be at work

277
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:18,165
because they didn't wanna
be at home with the dog

278
00:14:18,165 --> 00:14:20,337
and the kids, and all these.

279
00:14:20,337 --> 00:14:24,453
And so finding a way to
balance that was the challenge.

280
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:30,820
And then on the other
interesting part was mail pickup.

281
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,840
So you don't think about that,

282
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:36,700
we just walk out to our
mailboxes and pick up the posts.

283
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:40,220
Some of our business is very
tied to delivery of mail.

284
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,770
There are fines, regulatory fines,

285
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:46,870
if documentation doesn't
get filed in a specific way

286
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:50,280
and one would think the world
should be paperless by now

287
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:55,280
'cause we're a economy but
we are still very paper-based

288
00:14:57,390 --> 00:15:02,030
and it meant people needed to
go and collect those papers,

289
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,230
open those envelopes.

290
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:05,370
And in the beginning, if you recall,

291
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:07,370
we didn't really understand this pandemic,

292
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:09,280
we thought that it stuck to everything

293
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,360
and you could get it by
touching a piece of paper

294
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,460
that somebody might've sneezed on

295
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,250
and we just didn't know anything.

296
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:18,870
So you basically had the
issue hazmat suits to people

297
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:21,310
to be able to just open the mail.

298
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:24,869
It was kind of like
anthrax all over again.

299
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:27,580
And so of course now we've
learned a lot more about it

300
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:31,610
but nevertheless, it was
still a shift in our mentality

301
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:34,070
of how we dealt with critical people

302
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:36,440
who really need to keep
the business functioning,

303
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:40,790
cutting checks, opening mail
and then the essential people

304
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,870
who really wanted the letter

305
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:44,830
in case internet was down they could go in

306
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:46,453
and work from the office.

307
00:15:47,591 --> 00:15:50,320
And it's hard to tell somebody
your job is not critical

308
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,720
'cause everybody's important to a company,

309
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,920
but obviously it became very
apparent there are people

310
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,370
that are less critical and more essential

311
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:01,120
than the critical, critical people.

312
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:04,819
I hope that explained it Lisa (laughs).

313
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,010
- No, that did.

314
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:08,720
And I'm just curious, Laura you're still

315
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,530
in financial services
but you were actually

316
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:11,880
at S&P at the time, I think

317
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:17,340
or from the big part of the
year, was there anything odd

318
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:19,460
about having traders working from home?

319
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:24,120
Did that come up at all
in your part of the world?

320
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,090
- Yeah, well, S&P doesn't have traders

321
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:29,070
but again, in the conversations,

322
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:34,070
I mean, Lisa you've been to
FSISAC so when we talk to other

323
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:37,140
in financial services what I've heard

324
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:40,410
is there were some
flexibility that had to happen

325
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:45,410
but also the securing
of even a home network

326
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:46,500
in certain situations.

327
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,030
So there's critical, critical
to use your words Patty,

328
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:52,150
and there was essential
workers absolutely.

329
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:54,699
Again, where I was at
the time we considered

330
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,600
a lot of the people in IT very critical

331
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,010
and some of the other folks

332
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:00,590
that were doing our core business.

333
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:03,053
So we saw some of that definitely.

334
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:09,210
- Very good, and so Helen
in your role at Ohio State,

335
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:14,130
you perhaps more than anyone
I can think of had some

336
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:15,829
not only big risks on your shoulders

337
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:19,210
but it was the variety
of risks that were there.

338
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:22,089
Can you tell a little bit about the story,

339
00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:25,602
when did security start
to matter at Ohio State?

340
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,080
- Yeah, so when COVID first hit,

341
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:32,210
security didn't really matter,
we weren't focused on it,

342
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:36,310
we were really just trying to get all

343
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:39,639
of our business processes online,

344
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,360
chemistry classes that
was still being done

345
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,040
with chalk on blackboard
had to automatically

346
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,450
sort of make its way online.

347
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:49,993
So there were a number of
task forces that were set up.

348
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:54,760
It wasn't probably until
two or three months in

349
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:58,070
and we were starting
to then work on things,

350
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:01,822
like how do we bring students
back to campus safely?

351
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:05,199
So, yeah, obviously we were making sure

352
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,170
that people could work from
home and we were dealing

353
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:10,150
with VPNs and multi-factor and
all of those kinds of things.

354
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:13,880
But what's the role of security then

355
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,873
in trying to get back to
some kind of normalcy.

356
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:21,040
For example, one of the
things that we were looking at

357
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,080
is could we use some of the logging

358
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,620
that the security team
does on our network,

359
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,399
on our wireless network,

360
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,863
to understand where people
were physically on campus?

361
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,330
We would use that for a couple of things.

362
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:35,669
We would use it to understand

363
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:37,180
where we had a lot of high traffic

364
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:40,053
and maybe we needed to
disperse that traffic.

365
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:44,060
You can imagine we have cafeterias

366
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,889
because our students live on campus,

367
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:49,640
we have about at the time
it was about 50,000 students

368
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,440
who were living on campus,

369
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,630
so whereas the rest of the
state was saying no restaurants

370
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:57,251
we were like, well, someone
is gotta eat some time

371
00:18:57,251 --> 00:18:59,750
so how do we handle that?

372
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,868
So looking at where we had high traffic

373
00:19:01,868 --> 00:19:06,810
but also things like if people
got sick they came to campus

374
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:08,990
because we had a hospital on campus.

375
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:12,730
So being able to say, okay,
we're gonna throw up a red flag

376
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:14,170
if someone shows up where they shouldn't,

377
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:17,250
well, there were very few places
where people shouldn't go.

378
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:18,870
So yeah, we had a hospital,

379
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:21,632
we had people living on
campus that needed food,

380
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,610
we had online learning that was going on

381
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:28,092
so we certainly had to
think about things like,

382
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,100
are we still gonna offer online exams?

383
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,199
Do we have to do then
online proctoring of exams?

384
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,970
What's the security around
the authentication mechanisms

385
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:38,803
that are happening?

386
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:40,470
How do we make that light touch

387
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,583
if they don't have really great broadband?

388
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,740
A lot of those kinds of things.

389
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,677
We have a hotel on campus

390
00:19:46,677 --> 00:19:49,439
that actually had to get
converted into another dorm

391
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,560
because we had to find more bed space

392
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:56,560
and more quarantine for infected
COVID students bed space

393
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:59,023
so we commandeered some hotels.

394
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:02,840
And there's other things that are going on

395
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,760
that needed to be minded.

396
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:10,120
So, yeah, it was a
particularly difficult thing.

397
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:13,069
And to everyone's credit
who's working in higher ed

398
00:20:13,069 --> 00:20:15,710
and people went, how hard can it be you go

399
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:18,240
from on-premise learning
to off premise learning,

400
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,080
well, there's a lot that's involved.

401
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,790
And even now Ohio State
tests 30,000 students a week,

402
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:27,000
they're doing more COVID testing

403
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,850
than seven or eight states combined

404
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:31,899
and the infection rates
are staying quite low.

405
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:35,210
So, yeah, there's a lot to think about.

406
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:38,370
- Goodness, so Laura in your world

407
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,679
or maybe just thinking more broadly,

408
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,980
how long did security matter

409
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:45,140
or in your case when did it matter,

410
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:47,264
but how long did it matter?

411
00:20:47,264 --> 00:20:50,870
- Yeah, I mean, it always mattered, right,

412
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:52,899
I think that's always
the elephant in the room

413
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,040
with us security practitioners is,

414
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,610
of course it matters to us
we're very passionate about it

415
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:58,996
that's why we're here.

416
00:20:58,997 --> 00:21:03,110
But again, if you take it into context of,

417
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:06,733
am I able to do my job,
can business continue?

418
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:12,620
We did see some being
flexible, we saw the need to,

419
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:14,550
and really, you just had to think about it

420
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:17,779
from a risk decision-making perspective

421
00:21:17,779 --> 00:21:21,110
not a, this is my standard
I have to stick with it

422
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:23,719
and no distractions from it.

423
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,410
It can't be that rigorous
during a situation

424
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,810
that you haven't planned for honestly.

425
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:29,960
I don't think anybody thought

426
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,740
that this is where we
were going to be, right.

427
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:36,453
So it always matter but it became more of,

428
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:39,690
how important is it right now

429
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:42,170
and how long can we live with it, right?

430
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:47,170
And so, just a perfect example
is around just patching.

431
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,340
So of course, we have to patch
but we had to think about

432
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:54,739
how we were going to be able to do that

433
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:57,440
while also dealing with the
saturation on the network.

434
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,389
But one thing definitely mattered

435
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:01,980
from a security perspective

436
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:05,360
is that nobody wanted to
fall prey to the BEC fishing

437
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,850
that we saw more and
more during the pandemic.

438
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:10,909
And so on one side we needed to relax

439
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:13,632
but on the other side we wound
up actually increasing a lot

440
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:15,870
and a lot of the technologies
or even the processes

441
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:19,149
that we wanted to put in place
got accelerated as a result.

442
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:21,497
So we really have to use good judgment

443
00:22:21,497 --> 00:22:22,945
in those situations, definitely.

444
00:22:22,945 --> 00:22:27,010
- Right, well, that's a good segue for us

445
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:30,310
to talk about some of the
technology changes that happened

446
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:33,610
as a result of COVID, some
that were driven by COVID

447
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:36,679
and some that just continued
from our normal business

448
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:39,889
but we had to figure
out new ways to do it.

449
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:41,755
Patty I'm guessing most organizations

450
00:22:41,755 --> 00:22:46,755
over the course of a year had
to replace some equipment.

451
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:51,960
What was the experience around
doing that sort of thing,

452
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:55,083
whether it was refresh or other aspects.

453
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,110
- Yeah, so it's really a challenge when

454
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:02,240
if you're a high-tech
company probably have depots

455
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,080
around the globe, right,
I'm thinking Microsoft

456
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:10,080
probably has like depo set
up of their Microsoft stuff.

457
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:16,629
But if you're an insurance
company in Richmond, Virginia,

458
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:20,083
it's how do I get equipment to people

459
00:23:20,083 --> 00:23:22,540
that A, don't wanna leave their house

460
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:25,159
so now I'm gonna ship it, but of course

461
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,280
as the privacy officer I'm
also worried about the fact

462
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,850
now we're collecting
people's privacy information

463
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:33,399
so we can ship equipment to
them in a service ticket.

464
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:37,350
And I'm like, we really
had to get creative.

465
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:41,870
So there's the shipping of
equipment, there is the,

466
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:44,489
hey, by the way you
might be printing at home

467
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:46,360
but you need shred what you're doing,

468
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,969
so it's not like you've got the bins

469
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:50,850
where you can get rid of the paper.

470
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:54,909
And then you've got things
like, I need to make sure that

471
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:59,910
I have redundancies because
I'm in the middle of a pandemic

472
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,169
and then, oh, look,
there's a hurricane coming.

473
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:09,020
And my division in one area

474
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:11,889
that got hit by the
hurricane was out of power

475
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:15,220
and it used to be, well, we'll
just pull in the trailer,

476
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:20,220
the BCP trailer, we lovingly
renamed it the COVID tube,

477
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:24,030
and so nobody was gonna
get in the COVID tube.

478
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:27,629
And so we had to really
pivot and think differently

479
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:28,900
about how we were gonna do this

480
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,960
but making sure that we had redundancies

481
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,200
so that disbursements
were getting paid, right,

482
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,530
companies expect to get paid

483
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:35,760
when they're doing business with you.

484
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,412
So how would we support
our European operations

485
00:24:38,412 --> 00:24:41,120
out of our us operations.

486
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,219
There's an issue with currency,

487
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:45,760
so there's different
currency in these countries,

488
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,870
and how do you change
currencies depending on

489
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:49,703
where you're at?

490
00:24:49,703 --> 00:24:54,703
So it really was watching
humans do what they do best

491
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:59,770
and that is march to the
cause and flex and be agile

492
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:02,449
in their approaches.

493
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:07,450
And the people would just
step up to the plate and say,

494
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,070
I'll take care of it, I
got it, I'm gonna do it

495
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:13,240
and it was just really
kind of an amazing time.

496
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:16,027
But getting technology
to people was really,

497
00:25:16,027 --> 00:25:18,190
really, really a challenge.

498
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:21,270
So we created like a curbside pickup

499
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:25,913
in some of our locations, we
brought in a bunch of laptops

500
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:30,480
and monitors that we were
giving to the critical people

501
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,080
so they could get set up
with dual monitors at home.

502
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:38,570
And so it was definitely,
and I have to openly admit,

503
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:42,649
I bought more tech last year for my house

504
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:46,602
than I even want to admit
but thank you Amazon.

505
00:25:46,602 --> 00:25:49,260
(Lisa chuckles)

506
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,117
- Yeah, definitely.
- That's true (laughs)

507
00:25:50,117 --> 00:25:52,290
And it's funny 'cause
you mentioned shipping

508
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:54,389
and it's amazing how even the shipping was

509
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:56,760
such a big challenge, 'cause I remember,

510
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,960
we wanted to send
something to the customer

511
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,330
who kind of helped us with
a call that we needed to do.

512
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:04,169
And we just wanted to
send a thank you gift

513
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:06,530
but it was going from the U.S. to the UK

514
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:09,950
and first we had to consider,
could we even do that,

515
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:13,470
second, we needed their private
information so to speak,

516
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:17,150
third, they were in complete
lockdown, would the package

517
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:17,983
even get there?

518
00:26:17,983 --> 00:26:21,149
So we finally just gave up,

519
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:23,840
but it's just amazing
some of the challenges

520
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,790
that have happened.

521
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:30,880
Laura, you mentioned a little
bit about patching earlier,

522
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,800
but I'm just curious did anything change

523
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,383
about the approach to patching?

524
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:39,830
- Yeah, I had mentioned
the kind of flexing

525
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:42,710
of some of our rigorous standards.

526
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:44,720
I mean, we still really
want people to patch

527
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,590
critical vulnerabilities,
if they're urgent obviously

528
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:49,760
as fast as possible but the 30 days

529
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,573
is still pretty standard,
I think, in most companies.

530
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,580
But how do you do that,
again, like I said,

531
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:57,889
with the saturation.

532
00:26:57,890 --> 00:27:00,500
I mean, we found people
watching obviously Netflix

533
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,110
for three to eight hours a day

534
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:05,570
which was an easy thing
for us to shut down

535
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:08,290
but shutting down patching it's again,

536
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:12,600
it's that risk versus
reward kind of situation.

537
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:16,379
And so we did have to think
about what was acceptable

538
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,840
for the period of time.

539
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,590
We did have to come up with,

540
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:21,980
let's say the authentication flow

541
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:25,130
if we were instituting
some new technology,

542
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:29,130
there'll be some drift on
the password, is that okay?

543
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:33,090
We are taking some risks but
like how serious are they

544
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:36,851
and how long are we
willing to live with those?

545
00:27:36,852 --> 00:27:39,130
And, I mean, it was almost every day,

546
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:40,080
especially in the beginning,

547
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,534
we were just seeing these different things

548
00:27:41,535 --> 00:27:43,208
and we're just like, you know what,

549
00:27:43,208 --> 00:27:46,450
we just gotta go through
with this and be comfortable.

550
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:47,611
And then we would circle back,

551
00:27:47,611 --> 00:27:49,500
through our risk management framework,

552
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,170
we would circle back and say,

553
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:56,170
okay, we gave you 180
day pass here (laughs)

554
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,892
as the pandemic kept going,

555
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,879
is it good for us to get
back to that standard?

556
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,330
And then again, we saw a
lot of rallying around it

557
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:07,120
and a lot of fixing of it,
but we had to really think

558
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,250
about those technology
changes that we really wanted

559
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:14,350
but how is that actually
going to happen in reality?

560
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:16,639
And then of course,
how can we flex, right,

561
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,690
that was really, really important for us.

562
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,520
- And so Helen, we did
talk about remote access

563
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,960
and I know there were lots
of meetings with customers

564
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:29,775
to help them with that, but
what did we learn from that?

565
00:28:29,775 --> 00:28:31,060
What do you think the big takeaway

566
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:35,020
is from all the work we did
to get people the access

567
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:37,300
that they needed to work remotely?

568
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,901
- Yeah, I think, what you'll start to see

569
00:28:39,901 --> 00:28:44,359
if you haven't already
seen it is security teams

570
00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:46,939
and CISOs really having now to double down

571
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:49,640
to make sure that their
security tech stack

572
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:52,980
is aligned with whatever
the new technology stack

573
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:54,410
is at their companies.

574
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:58,230
I think, for some companies COVID hit

575
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:00,360
and they accelerated all
their security stuff right

576
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,310
along with it.

577
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:03,560
And then there were other
verticals, other companies,

578
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,010
that sort of said, no,
we're putting a hold

579
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:06,860
on any non-essential spending

580
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:10,060
and we're considering security
a non essential spend.

581
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,560
Okay, well, that was 18 months ago

582
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:14,240
now we can't wait any longer for that.

583
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,120
So I do think there's an
opportunity for security folks to,

584
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,739
if they haven't already
done it, to take a step back

585
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:24,550
and say, let's look at where
the tech strategy has gone

586
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:25,649
over the last 18 months

587
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:28,330
and let's make sure
that our security stack

588
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:30,360
is aligned to that, and if it's not,

589
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,979
now, we've gotta really
sort of put it down.

590
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:35,270
I think the other thing is,

591
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:38,670
we're seeing more odd days this year

592
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:40,383
than we saw all of last year.

593
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:44,800
And so this question of how
do you manage your device

594
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,173
and how do you manage
your device remotely?

595
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:50,790
Not only from an it operations perspective

596
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:52,740
but also a security incident response

597
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:55,630
and forensics perspective is another one

598
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:58,070
that we're gonna have to
really keep our eye on.

599
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:02,700
So I think, it's actually
a good thing for security

600
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,340
but we've got to inject ourselves back

601
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,533
into the conversation.

602
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:09,120
- Very good, well, I'm gonna shift us

603
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,260
into kind of the last section
that we're gonna talk about

604
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:13,440
'cause I wanna make sure
we have time to cover that,

605
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,930
and that's about planning

606
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:17,610
and maybe the changes
that came with planning.

607
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:20,122
Patty, I think you
somehow mentioned earlier

608
00:30:20,123 --> 00:30:23,520
the differences in maybe who's critical

609
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,840
or the critical people planning.

610
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,480
Can you talk a little
bit about how that went

611
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,083
or how you've changed your focus on that?

612
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:36,310
- Yeah, so, obviously in the
security program you've got,

613
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:38,173
everybody is important again,
it's hard to tell somebody

614
00:30:38,173 --> 00:30:40,890
that their job is less important,

615
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:44,320
but your security operations is pinnacle

616
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,840
so I gotta monitor
everything that's going on.

617
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:50,530
'Cause we're in a
degraded state as a globe

618
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:53,860
what a better time for the
bad guy to target a company

619
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:56,030
than when they're vulnerable,

620
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:58,860
because they're trying to
get people working from home

621
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:01,540
and maybe they're split
tunneling their VPNs,

622
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:03,520
maybe they're not long hauling people back

623
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,596
into a primary data center

624
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:06,740
before they go out to the internet.

625
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:09,970
It's just everybody was so off balance.

626
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:14,390
And then you saw that
massive rise in ransomware,

627
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:18,580
like I think I saw a
stat of 719% increase,

628
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:20,330
I mean, it's staggering, right.

629
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:24,360
And so, as you're thinking about

630
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:28,919
how do I make sure my
operations are running?

631
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:32,450
What we actually did is, I sat
down with my direct reports

632
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:37,080
and we looked at who's really
critical to our operations,

633
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:40,909
identity and access management
if people can't get access

634
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:42,810
that's kind of a problem.

635
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:46,200
If the security operation center
is down, kind of a problem.

636
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,250
So what we did is we
actually cross-trained

637
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:49,620
within my organization,

638
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:52,090
people and governance, risk and compliance

639
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:54,959
into identity and access
management, engineering,

640
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,350
architects, cross-trained into operations.

641
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:00,730
So we had kind of this way that

642
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:03,590
if a cluster of folks
happened to all get ill

643
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:06,629
at the same time, we had redundancies.

644
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:09,090
So what we actually did is I took that

645
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:13,120
to our safeguarding people and
they actually rolled that out

646
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,399
more or less across the company and said,

647
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,844
who are your critical
people across the business,

648
00:32:17,844 --> 00:32:20,390
who are your redundancies?

649
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:22,890
So each leader then took a look and said,

650
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:24,630
I have this critical function,

651
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:26,680
I have these people who do them.

652
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:29,779
And I also own a business resilience,

653
00:32:29,779 --> 00:32:33,890
so it was kind of nice because
we had the critical controls

654
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:36,110
and we were able to help influence

655
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:39,763
where we needed to make sure
that we had critical people.

656
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:43,820
- And so Laura, and I
know we just got a couple

657
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:46,870
of minutes left here, but I
wanna get a couple of questions

658
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:49,000
in before we end.

659
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,730
Laura, how has this changed
the focus on planning

660
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:57,960
or it changed our approach
to planning overall.

661
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,650
- Yeah, definitely, I think, again,

662
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:02,033
nobody, nobody was ready for this

663
00:33:02,033 --> 00:33:05,590
and so my thoughts are plan, plan, plan

664
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:10,530
even if you think it's outrageous,
it's probably not, right.

665
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:13,440
And never have I seen a solid

666
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,040
and informed asset
inventory more important

667
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:18,260
than during this time.

668
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:21,110
So that, again, to Patty's
point, you have to know

669
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:24,189
where your critical, not just
your staff, but your assets.

670
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:25,270
You have to know where they're at

671
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:27,420
so that you're not surprised.

672
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:31,023
So those are the big takeaways
for me on the planning side.

673
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:32,703
- Helen, how about you?

674
00:33:32,703 --> 00:33:36,770
Like, I mean, we know there's
a lot that we didn't plan for

675
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:39,747
but how do we take that forward?

676
00:33:39,747 --> 00:33:43,878
Like how do we make that
so it's better next time,

677
00:33:43,878 --> 00:33:47,240
this may not be the end
of the big surprises.

678
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:50,190
- Yeah, for me, I think the main thing was

679
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:55,890
we were trying very hard
with my team pre COVID

680
00:33:55,890 --> 00:33:58,490
to leave enough space in their day

681
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:00,890
to handle unexpected events.

682
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:03,330
So not to have them running at a 100%

683
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:08,000
or 110 or 150% capacity, but
maybe to be running at 80%,

684
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,020
and if they really were
running at 80% they could use

685
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,949
that extra time for
innovation or extra learning

686
00:34:13,949 --> 00:34:18,279
or whatever, but it was
also sort of free time

687
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,790
for unexpected events.

688
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:24,790
We've been running our folks
way over a 100% for 18 months,

689
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:30,050
there's no end in sight to
that and there's no guarantee

690
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:32,000
that even after we get back to normal,

691
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,429
that all those other
things, those killer hornets

692
00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:38,389
whatever that is, in 2021,
22 is gonna come back.

693
00:34:38,389 --> 00:34:42,540
So, I think we have to
get better at saying no

694
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:45,210
to some things and I think
we have to get better

695
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:48,620
at planning for the unexpected,
which means planning

696
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:51,469
for space in the team so that
we're not burning them out.

697
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:55,909
- Very good, Patty any
final thoughts on planning?

698
00:34:55,909 --> 00:34:58,310
Anything particular you wanna add now?

699
00:34:58,310 --> 00:34:59,440
- No, I don't think so, thanks.

700
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:04,440
- Okay, good, well, let's
get into our key takeaways.

701
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:08,780
So we'll go to Laura first.

702
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:11,570
Laura, what have you
learned you didn't know?

703
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:13,580
What was your most important lesson?

704
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,790
What would you do different next time?

705
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:18,170
- Yeah, yeah, great questions,

706
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:22,700
really quickly so just create
all those resiliency scenarios

707
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,629
again, even if they
sound a little outrageous

708
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:27,120
still create those, really test them out,

709
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:30,009
I think testing, testing,
testing is super important.

710
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:32,160
So those are the key takeaways for me

711
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,950
and then of course, overlaying that

712
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:37,299
with the business impacts,
understanding the appetites

713
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:40,470
of your business and making
sure those all tie together

714
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:43,359
so that when it happens
again you're ready.

715
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:46,980
- Right, Patty, what
would be your big lessons,

716
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,678
your big takeaways?

717
00:35:48,678 --> 00:35:50,560
- I think it's all about the people.

718
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,220
So you gotta take care of the people

719
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:53,910
and then the people will take care of you,

720
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:56,140
and that's not just in a time of crisis

721
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:58,330
that's even when there isn't a crisis.

722
00:35:58,330 --> 00:35:59,840
And then I think the other thing

723
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,460
that's really important to think about is,

724
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:03,290
equality and equity.

725
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:06,640
This particular pandemic
and all of the other issues

726
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,420
that were going on across the globe,

727
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:10,470
showed it was very in our face.

728
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:12,919
We have an equality and an equity issue

729
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,220
that we need to deal with.

730
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:20,200
- Fantastic, and Helen,
we'll finish with you,

731
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:23,310
what were your big lessons
or your big takeaways?

732
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:27,259
- Yeah, I would tell you if
anyone had all of this stuff

733
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:32,260
on their bingo card
for the last 18 months,

734
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:35,430
they should have taken
out a lottery ticket,

735
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:36,759
no one could have predicted this.

736
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:41,533
And I think the takeaway
for me is not to be shy

737
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:45,893
about asking for what we need
as security professionals.

738
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:50,700
Don't go, ''Well, they just
don't have room to think

739
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,830
about it right now I'm
not gonna ask for it,''

740
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:56,020
ask for it anyway, be assertive

741
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:57,888
about asking for what you need

742
00:36:57,888 --> 00:37:00,940
and continue to really
try and push that envelope

743
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:03,060
because the world is not gonna wait for us

744
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,393
to get our politics right.

745
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:07,120
- Oh, that's fantastic.

746
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,080
What a great way to end the session.

747
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,819
Thank you ladies so much,
this has been fantastic.

748
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:15,190
And we look forward to
addressing all the questions,

749
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:17,520
you can still get a couple
of those in probably.

750
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,489
And thank you again for joining us.

751
00:37:20,489 --> 00:37:21,489
- Thank you.
