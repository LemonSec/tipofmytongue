1
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:03,920
- Welcome everyone, I'm John Pescatore

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,260
from the SANS Institute.

3
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:06,990
Welcome to our panel, Lessons Learned

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,530
from Diverse Paths to Successful
Cybersecurity Careers.

5
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:12,399
I think we're gonna have a fun time here.

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,300
We will be watching the question window.

7
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:15,770
So if you have any questions for us,

8
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:18,570
enter them into the
pigeonhole clients you have

9
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:19,970
and put the name of the speaker

10
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:22,340
you wanna get an answer from
and we'll get back to you.

11
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:24,610
So with that, let's get started.

12
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:27,900
So what we wanna do here
is talk about a fun topic,

13
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,430
how to establish or grow
your career in cybersecurity,

14
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:32,839
it's a very cool area.

15
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,670
We've got four very interesting panelists.

16
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:35,680
I'm the least interesting

17
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,920
so I'm gonna go quickly through my part.

18
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,190
But those of us who've
worked in cybersecurity

19
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:41,690
over the years know there's all kinds

20
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:42,800
of different things you can do

21
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,709
and ways you can grow your careers.

22
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:46,720
And we've all taken very
different paths through there.

23
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,560
We're gonna each of us go through what we,

24
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,370
how we got through our
careers, where we are today.

25
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:54,720
What we thought were some cool
things we learned all the way

26
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,830
and advice we're trying
to pass on to you guys

27
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:59,180
and hopefully generate
some good discussion.

28
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:00,163
So let's get going.

29
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,319
So my career is I've been a
set of random decisions made

30
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:07,289
over the years for no
particularly good reason.

31
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:08,890
I got an electrical engineering degree

32
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:11,080
in college from the
University of Connecticut.

33
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,160
And because NSA did not require you

34
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,979
to wear a tie to interview with them,

35
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,800
I interviewed with them and my girlfriend

36
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,369
thought it'd be cool to
live near Washington DC.

37
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:21,430
So I went to work for
NSA right outta college

38
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:23,550
and doing communications encryption.

39
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:24,616
Till a friend called and said,

40
00:01:24,617 --> 00:01:26,027
"Hey, I work for the secret service.

41
00:01:26,027 --> 00:01:28,350
"And a guy just died in
our office in a car crash,

42
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:29,320
you should come work here."

43
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,119
So I did that and it got
into a whole bunch of things,

44
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:35,290
surveillance systems,
communication security, again

45
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:38,093
that unfortunately almost
40 years ago today,

46
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:40,850
John Hinckley shot President Reagan

47
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:43,089
and my job changed to
doing bulletproof armor

48
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:44,740
and flying all over the world doing that.

49
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,929
Which, did not seem to be taking advantage

50
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:48,960
of my electrical engineering degree.

51
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,660
So I jumped off a big old company,

52
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,619
a telephone company called GTE back then

53
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,160
that for some reason also
made TVs and light bulbs.

54
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,467
But the government
system was worked for NSA

55
00:01:57,467 --> 00:02:01,010
and the CIA and got into
secure computer systems.

56
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:04,110
And I can, GTE also had a
big thing called the labs

57
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,080
which was one of the first internet nodes

58
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,670
and The Morris worm hit.

59
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,500
And I said, "Whoa, that sounds like fun

60
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,580
doing things about that."

61
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,080
So I went to Trusted
Information Systems who was one

62
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,470
of the first firewall companies out there.

63
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,640
And so they got acquired.

64
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,769
And then I went to Entrust

65
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,850
which was the first PKI company out there

66
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:21,480
in the start of encryption.

67
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,170
And then Gartner came calling
and all these moves I made

68
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:26,670
after leaving GTE, all
had to do with people

69
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:29,030
I knew calling me and saying,
"You should come work here."

70
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:31,950
And Gartner came calling
and spent 13 years

71
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,170
as the lead security analyst for Gartner.

72
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:36,359
And then I decided it'd
be a time to work more

73
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,220
on the people's side.

74
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,180
And for the past eight
years I've been with SANS

75
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,620
which was the, if you're not familiar SANS

76
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,360
is biggest training company out there.

77
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,140
So all my careers have random
set of decisions that ended

78
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,910
up in a really fun and
really rewarding career.

79
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,970
And I learned some cool stuff.

80
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,120
What surprised me the
most, this quote from one

81
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,400
of my favorite security
analysts, Helen Keller sort

82
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,310
of captures it is, how
quickly things keep changing.

83
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,040
The internet brought that on board.

84
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,660
The start on my career,
mainframe security.

85
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:05,799
And before the internet, security
didn't change that quickly

86
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,640
but now things change rapidly,
nothing stays still long.

87
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,429
A new technology comes along,
the bad guys say, "cool."

88
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:14,790
The good guy say, "Cool."

89
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:16,880
The business side adopts
it before it's secure.

90
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,600
The bad guys break in.

91
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,220
And then we start to figure
out ways to deal with it.

92
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:24,830
And just about when we think
we've dealt with something,

93
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,190
the bad guys figured out a new way

94
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:28,530
or the business guys
wanna use a new technology

95
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:30,800
and it all starts over again.

96
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,290
And it's just constantly challenging.

97
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:36,070
The other cool thing that
surprised me is it's almost

98
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:39,010
like this is a career and
we make good paychecks.

99
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,040
Well there's good money in this career.

100
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,489
But we're also fighting the good fight.

101
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:46,620
We really are trying to help
people be more safe companies

102
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,560
and their customers and our friends

103
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,100
and everybody we know be more safe using

104
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,090
this really cool thing that started out

105
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:55,320
as a simple network and has really turned

106
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,590
into a critical backbone
for many ways of life.

107
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:00,640
As the pandemic pointed
out, how critical it's been

108
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,410
to trying to do online education
and keep people working.

109
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,100
It's I call, fighting the good fight

110
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,910
is a cool part of this career.

111
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:09,329
So the other thing I
asked everybody to talk

112
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:11,060
about is some lessons to pass along.

113
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,790
So my advice to you starting
out, if you're at the beginning

114
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:16,899
of your career, try to learn
how to build stuff first.

115
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:18,739
These days that mostly means software

116
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:22,250
but certainly a networks and
applications and other things.

117
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,020
And then if you can get
involved in hardware, great.

118
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:26,210
If not, play around with Arduino boards

119
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:29,919
or Raspberry Pi, if you're
later on in your career.

120
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,320
Every move I made was pretty
much for a lateral paycheck.

121
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,580
I don't, I think maybe
once out of all my changes

122
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,609
I've made a big jump in money.

123
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,620
Just make moves based on what you think

124
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,540
you'd enjoy doing or have fun doing

125
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,510
or would be a change

126
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:44,180
or you could help fight the good fight.

127
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:46,270
The money will always follow.

128
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,270
The key thing we learned

129
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,650
in security is to look for patterns.

130
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:52,169
And every year of experience you gain,

131
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:54,470
start building your own
machine learning algorithm,

132
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:56,210
your pattern recognition in your head.

133
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:59,270
Because so often older
solutions can be adapted

134
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:01,570
to deal with these newer problems.

135
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:03,469
Network as much as you can

136
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:07,070
with your fellows,
security people out there

137
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:09,620
and across different
communities and verticals.

138
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,190
The RSA conference obviously when

139
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:13,370
it's been in person has
been great for that.

140
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:15,700
But every conference you can go to

141
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,420
or different training courses interact

142
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,070
with the other students or if you go

143
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:21,010
to InfraGard chapter meetings

144
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:24,210
in your local neighborhood, do that.

145
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:26,200
It's very easy and security to always

146
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,440
be the people who say no.

147
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,510
No, that can't be done.

148
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:30,840
Hackers could break into that.

149
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,989
No, that's not a good enough solution.

150
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:36,040
The real key to this world
is, is making progress,

151
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,760
solving some of the easy problems,

152
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,060
getting good enough security

153
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,670
in place that business
can move on and make money

154
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:44,170
and people can do the
things they need to do.

155
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:47,140
And think locally, act locally.

156
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,500
Get involved locally in schools and things

157
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,450
in your community and make some improve

158
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:53,830
on your vertical, make improvements there.

159
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:56,099
And if you can solve some local problems

160
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,940
and enough of us do
these, they start adding

161
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,210
up to some bigger global solutions.

162
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:02,210
So that's my sort of rapid path through.

163
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:04,656
I wanna turn things over
to here, Londrina Cherne.

164
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:08,100
And we'll ask her for her
viewpoint in these same areas.

165
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,663
Oops, one more fight, the
good fight, last reminder.

166
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:16,060
- I love it, thank you John,
for sharing your story.

167
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:19,300
Let me share mine, so I am somebody

168
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,910
who was lucky enough to grow up

169
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:22,480
in the San Francisco Bay area

170
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,910
as the first dot com boom was happening.

171
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:28,560
So I was a teenager who
was making what I thought

172
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,180
at that time was great
money working for AOL

173
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:36,810
and PluggedIn who was a group
empowering other teenagers

174
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:38,950
and people from low-income communities

175
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:42,039
to come online express their voices.

176
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:45,100
But really what I think is very unique

177
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,190
about my background is that

178
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:49,710
I'm a first generation college student,

179
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:52,450
I'm also a first generation
high school graduate

180
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:54,960
and we can go back beyond that.

181
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,840
But what I want to stress is I'm somebody

182
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,770
whose parents did not have
a white collar career.

183
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:05,760
However, as a child of
immigrants I was always told,

184
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,060
you will go to college.

185
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,800
So whatever happens beyond that, great

186
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,090
but you will go to college.

187
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:17,060
And that seemed like a pretty
straightforward career path

188
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:20,210
for me at the time, go
to college, get a job

189
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:21,870
but it wasn't quite that easy.

190
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:23,670
I was always interested in tech

191
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:26,720
as you can tell from my working

192
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,240
as a teenager in the dot com boom.

193
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,830
But when I went to college,

194
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:35,820
it was to pursue a
Computer Science degree.

195
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:38,219
And I knew one thing
coming out of that degree

196
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:41,220
which is that I did not
wanna be a programmer.

197
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,880
I loved going to school, I loved learning

198
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,030
it is one of the hardest
things I've done in my life

199
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:49,359
and I'm so proud of
having accomplished that.

200
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,440
But I was still searching
for what I wanted

201
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,310
to do as a career.

202
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:56,740
So to make the long story short,

203
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:00,320
I took advantage of
being in the Boston area,

204
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,770
doing some more learning
and going to night school

205
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:07,169
and really it was going
back to night school

206
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:10,610
and taking community college
classes that I found out

207
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:13,280
about the field of Digital Forensics.

208
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,169
And as John mentioned,
everything from there

209
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:20,920
were people who I knew and networked with.

210
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:25,310
One of my last professors in
my Digital Forensics curriculum

211
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:27,230
that I took at community college

212
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:29,650
after getting my bachelor's degree,

213
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:32,329
is somebody who I worked for for a decade,

214
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:34,230
doing intellectual property theft

215
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:36,929
and terrorism related investigations.

216
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:40,902
Really doing a low level
cyber crime technical work.

217
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:46,180
But from there I've moved
on and I decided to join

218
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:48,339
at that time what was still

219
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:52,170
a very small startup
Cybereason where I am now.

220
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:55,040
I've been in different
roles at the company

221
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,069
and now I focus on security value

222
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:00,120
while still keeping my feet wet

223
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,890
in the digital forensics world teaching

224
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:03,689
for SANS Institute.

225
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:07,210
But I'm also exploring
other things like policy

226
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:10,640
and I'm working with a
program at the Aspen Institute

227
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,199
at their Aspen Tech Policy Hub

228
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,150
right now working on policy.

229
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:19,060
So while I don't have
all the arrows pointing

230
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,650
to all these different
experiences across my career,

231
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:23,439
you can see it pivoted quite a bit

232
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,430
from going to school for
Computer Science degree

233
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:29,349
to learning about the forensics field

234
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:33,030
and now what I do working
in standards and policy.

235
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,893
So if we go to the next slide,

236
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,630
I think what surprised me the most

237
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:42,370
about my journey is, today.

238
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:46,360
The thing that I enjoy
doing the most working in

239
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,900
and teaching digital forensics,

240
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:52,110
helping people become more secure,

241
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:55,520
helping defend people against attackers

242
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:59,689
is that I work in a field
that I didn't know existed

243
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:03,060
as a young person that
I didn't know existed

244
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,579
when I was in college.

245
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:08,700
So I happen to be a big fan, by the way

246
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,957
of crime solving shows, so if you told me,

247
00:10:11,957 --> 00:10:15,760
"Oh, maybe you can be a
computer crime investigator."

248
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,290
I wouldn't get what that meant.

249
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:21,240
But the idea of the field
of digital forensics

250
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,270
and working at a really, really low level

251
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:29,270
to solve crimes, to support
lawsuits and investigations,

252
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,079
is something that was never on my radar

253
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,370
as a young person and never on my radar

254
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:38,350
as I graduated with my degree.

255
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:41,200
So that's something that surprised me

256
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,830
and something that I'm really grateful

257
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:45,180
I've been able to pivot to.

258
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,310
By the way, John mentioned it already

259
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:51,949
and I suspect you'll
hear it again, coming up.

260
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:56,180
It's a really small world
and networking is key.

261
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:59,680
I'll give a shout out to
one of my first employers

262
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,290
at PluggedIn, Ian McCarthy
who's been a big supporter

263
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:05,680
of me earlier in my career.

264
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:10,069
Who even today, 20 years
later in my career, today

265
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:13,060
has been an advocate and a mentor for me.

266
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:16,209
So it's a small world-networking is key,

267
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:19,410
that person who you are
in a program with early

268
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:22,110
in your career or meet at a conference,

269
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:25,910
could be pivotable to
a move and really key

270
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:28,949
to something you do later in your career.

271
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,563
So next slide please.

272
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:35,770
So, because I've had
such a winding journey

273
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:38,850
through the industry,
not really knowing where

274
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:42,030
I was going to end up
from where I started.

275
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:44,560
I would say for those of
you who are looking to get

276
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,219
into the industry or who are

277
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,100
not just coming in out of school

278
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,820
but maybe are changing careers.

279
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:56,823
I think everybody out
there has some super power,

280
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,520
for me, it's somebody who has

281
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:03,400
that technical computer
science background,

282
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:07,819
who has a very deep
specialty in forensics.

283
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:12,400
However, I also now, in
my past few years working

284
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,689
at Cybereason, have been exposed heavily

285
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:18,000
to the business side of cybersecurity.

286
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,600
So beyond that, being
technical at different levels,

287
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:27,050
having business experience
and also looking

288
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:30,729
into policy now, as my latest career move.

289
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:32,700
That gives me the super power

290
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:36,860
of being at the intersection
of all of these Venn diagrams

291
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:39,210
that I don't think a
lot of people out there

292
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:41,080
in the world have.

293
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:44,700
And for you, if you are
coming from whatever career

294
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,230
or background it is you're coming from,

295
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:50,930
if you are in customer
service, that is great.

296
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:53,673
If you have a liberal
arts degree, wonderful.

297
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:59,310
You have experience in
some professional area

298
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:01,189
that maybe other people don't have

299
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:04,243
and when you apply your
technical expertise to it,

300
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,830
that's where you're going to shine.

301
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,180
Well, I've said it a few times already,

302
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,689
I'm sure you'll hear it again.

303
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:15,360
Build your network, the
people that you need today

304
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,310
might be the people who
help you find your next role

305
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:23,310
whether it is next year or a
10 or 15 or 20 years from now.

306
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,763
And by the way, keep learning.

307
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:29,510
I think it's important to point out that

308
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:32,490
I went through what I
thought was going to be

309
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:35,450
a very clear career progression for me.

310
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:38,470
Go to college, get your
degree, get your job

311
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:40,630
and it didn't work out that way.

312
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:44,380
I went to school, I went
back for more continuing ed

313
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:49,040
and even today I keep pursuing
continuing education credits

314
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,560
to keep up with the field
because it's ever changing.

315
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,530
So that is my advice
and I'm looking forward

316
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:58,948
to hearing my other panelists stories.

317
00:13:58,948 --> 00:14:02,622
- Okay, thanks Londrina, over to you Inno.

318
00:14:02,623 --> 00:14:06,560
- Very interesting
background, John and Londrina.

319
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,260
My name is, Inno Eroraha, I'm the founder

320
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:11,860
and chief strategist of NetSecurity.

321
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:16,380
My journey, is very different
than John's and Londrina.

322
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:19,670
After graduating from
high school, in Nigeria

323
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:23,333
I came to the United States
seeking to obtain a degree.

324
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:27,199
And because of my interest in math,

325
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,450
in math and computing, I
decided to double major

326
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:32,160
in computer science and math.

327
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,910
So I graduated from Morgan
State University in Baltimore,

328
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:39,610
with dual degrees
graduating top of my class.

329
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:40,980
And right after graduate school,

330
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,860
I went to a school called
George Washington University

331
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,770
in Washington, DC where I also pursued

332
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:48,890
my master's in computer science.

333
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:51,939
At that time security
wasn't really popular

334
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:56,270
but I managed to focus my
master's degree concentration

335
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,550
in security.

336
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:01,130
Then they talk about security policies

337
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:04,407
and cryptography and
communication security

338
00:15:04,407 --> 00:15:05,420
and so on and so forth.

339
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,310
So right after graduate school,

340
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:09,380
I joined a company called RSAC

341
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:13,400
where I was developing C++ codes.

342
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:17,230
And right around 11
months, not quite a year

343
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:19,759
I joined a company called
Trusted Information System

344
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:24,759
and that's how, John
Pescatore our moderator here,

345
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,330
that's how we met.

346
00:15:27,331 --> 00:15:31,230
So Trusted Information
System like, John indicated

347
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,840
was one of a few security companies,

348
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:38,450
we were the one of the
top two firewall vendor

349
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:39,610
at that time.

350
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:43,440
So I had the opportunity to go to SANS,

351
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,880
the second SANS ever and back in 1997,

352
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,689
I also went to RSA.

353
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:53,030
There you network with your
peers, you meet inventors

354
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:56,829
and I met him inventors
and authors and publishers

355
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:59,231
and even the founders of RSA,

356
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:02,860
the cryptography, the Ron Rivest.

357
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,930
And I don't remember the other gentlemen

358
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:08,959
and I actually interacted
with Ron Rivest back in '97.

359
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:13,490
So, my background again,
ranges from working

360
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:18,100
in commercial sectors as
well as the public sectors

361
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:23,100
including Civilian Agencies
and Defense Agencies.

362
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:26,980
One of my most notable
experiences has been

363
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,940
a principal security engineer

364
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:32,700
at Marine Corps Network
Operation And Security Command

365
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,871
which is now MARFORCYBER

366
00:16:34,871 --> 00:16:36,550
and which is part of the U.S. Command.

367
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:40,270
I actually was one of the
lead engineers responsible

368
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:43,360
for developing tools that will automate

369
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,360
a lot of the security operations tasks

370
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,063
that we're faced with, so
it was quite a sighting.

371
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:54,663
Right after MARFORCYBER,
I joined, no, I'm sorry.

372
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,989
Throughout my career, I've actually worked

373
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:59,560
in security companies and
that was one of the things

374
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,569
that really excited me in the beginning.

375
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:04,349
I said, to really be
insecurity, you have to work in,

376
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:06,339
I have to work in a security company

377
00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:08,949
to learn all the skills that I need.

378
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:11,220
Either in consulting or in product support

379
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,520
or product development
and so on and so forth.

380
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:16,849
So, I've worked in three
more security companies

381
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:18,490
throughout my career from Verisign

382
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:22,833
to Trusted Information System,
which became a McAfee now.

383
00:17:24,671 --> 00:17:28,631
And now in 2004, I started NetSecurity.

384
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:31,050
And a friend asked me,
"Inno, don't think you're

385
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,060
gonna get rich providing
security consultant services."

386
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:36,990
So I said, "Really why
wouldn't I get rich,

387
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:39,030
doing security consulting services?"

388
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:40,780
And he said, "You got to have a product."

389
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:44,620
So that word from my very good friend,

390
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:47,879
Blake Turrentine sunk into my memory.

391
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,780
Next slide please.

392
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:57,200
So, since doing security
for this period of time,

393
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,810
I have a lot of surprises.

394
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:03,592
The last or the first
encounter was malware,

395
00:18:05,285 --> 00:18:07,970
I mean a hacking investigation
that I investigated

396
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:11,330
when I walked for Trusted
Information System in '96.

397
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:16,330
And what we saw then,
I mean what companies

398
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:17,649
were doing to protect themselves,

399
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:22,510
were using firewall, antivirus
technologies and ACL's

400
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:24,750
and IDS and so on and so forth.

401
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:29,580
So those were the security
tools or technologies

402
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:33,000
we use to protect our
network a lot of time.

403
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,560
And so we thought that,
oh, our work, our job

404
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,500
was gonna be a stake because technology

405
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,230
was gonna take over and
there won't be a need to do

406
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:44,270
or to have security consultants

407
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:47,840
and little did I know
that I was gonna be wrong.

408
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,129
So if you look at the
threat landscape today,

409
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,410
companies are getting
hacked left, and right.

410
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:56,960
No matter the sophistication
of the security technologies

411
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,190
that are in place.

412
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:00,500
So companies are still getting hacked,

413
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:05,500
leveraging the same type
of the same attack factors

414
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:10,929
on patch system, weak password policies,

415
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:14,010
weak security protocols or
week protocols in general,

416
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:15,730
on you secure services.

417
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:20,030
So and moreover, organizations
aren't leveraging,

418
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:22,250
the technologies they've invested in

419
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:25,000
to the full capability
of those technologies.

420
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,320
So a lot of security vendors

421
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,179
are basically flooding the market

422
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:32,140
with different buzzwords in the industry.

423
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:36,700
So what, but the attack landscape

424
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,410
is still getting escalated.

425
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:41,040
I mean, the attackers are still escalating

426
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:46,040
and so, the company with
the best technologies

427
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,140
may not necessarily win the market

428
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:54,010
when there are risks because
there's a lot of flooding.

429
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:55,520
And one of the things that surprised me

430
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,840
is politics and security
is, it doesn't mix

431
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,570
it's like oil and water.

432
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:04,110
So politics, it's always
getting in the way of security.

433
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,060
Next slide, please.

434
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,360
So I'm often asked the question,

435
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,929
I'm often asked the question,

436
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:13,480
how do I get started in security?

437
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,010
So what I always tell them

438
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:19,000
is forget about certifications,
get your hands-on skill,

439
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,740
learn to break stuff,
learn to build stuff.

440
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:25,340
If you have an idea for
a product or technology,

441
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:28,300
go after it, go after it, seek help

442
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:32,780
make it happen and take on big challenges.

443
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:37,139
Like John and Londrina mentioned,
network, network, network.

444
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,400
And that is going to give
you some ideas on how

445
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,500
to build a better technologies,
that better technology.

446
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,260
And I would also say stop chasing money,

447
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:48,129
like John mentioned, if you
wanna do lateral movement,

448
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:48,963
that's good.

449
00:20:48,963 --> 00:20:52,080
In some cases you may
have to take a salary cut.

450
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,820
So just to be in the right position

451
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,899
and be able to make impact.

452
00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:00,250
Challenge yourself, take
courses, programming,

453
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:04,430
develop codes in C, C++ or
Assembly, the hard stuff.

454
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,430
You may be difficult like Londrina said

455
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:09,120
but at the end of the
day, you will become very,

456
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,770
you will be become indispensable.

457
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,469
So to succeed, you have to have,

458
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:17,810
to succeed in security, you
have to have hands-on skills

459
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:20,850
in program development,
in coding, in scripting,

460
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:22,459
in network administration.

461
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:26,830
I understand that the
knowledge base as required

462
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:30,939
is massive but you can still stay focused

463
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:35,010
and develop the hands-on
skills that you need

464
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:35,960
to be able to succeed.

465
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:39,230
So I thought starting a security company

466
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:41,630
will make me retire at 50,

467
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:43,480
but that's not the case in my case.

468
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,890
So those are some of the advice

469
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:47,180
that I've learned over the years

470
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:50,810
and hopefully you can apply
some of this lesson learned

471
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:52,102
and be able to succeed.

472
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:55,793
- Okay, thanks Inno, over to you Xena.

473
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,730
- Well, these are some
really great lessons,

474
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:04,430
thank you to all the panelists,
sharing your backgrounds.

475
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:07,370
It was really fascinating
hearing everyone's story

476
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:10,739
and I too have a very
different background.

477
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:14,710
So I came from small business

478
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:15,820
and what does that mean?

479
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:20,010
So small business, it
taught me a lot about life

480
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:22,403
and about the real world.

481
00:22:24,955 --> 00:22:28,860
I had to learn how to be
persistent and personable,

482
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:31,379
I had to believe in myself no matter what,

483
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:34,080
regardless of what was going on.

484
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:38,030
I had to be resourceful and
creative and above all else

485
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:40,129
I had to consider the long game

486
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:42,830
for pretty much everything I did.

487
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:47,100
And strive to create win-win
outcomes for everything,

488
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,820
it's very important.

489
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:52,139
I am too, from a family of immigrants,

490
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:55,160
I'm a first generation Mexican American

491
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:59,880
and I am the first one in my
family to pursue a doctorate

492
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,840
and to have a master's degree.

493
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:06,800
Growing up, education was
always extremely important

494
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:10,629
to my family, I honestly
thought I was gonna be a doctor.

495
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:15,630
I was top of my class, I
was studying biochemistry.

496
00:23:15,708 --> 00:23:20,690
All I did was study all
the time and that's when,

497
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:23,670
that's around the time
when the real estate market

498
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:27,200
got really hot and I
decided, you know what?

499
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,520
I'm gonna be a business
owner because I came

500
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,700
from a family of small business owners.

501
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,760
So I had a lot of exposure to it

502
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,250
and I'm like, oh, this will be easy.

503
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:41,250
So I did that for quite a
while, for over a decade

504
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:45,639
it was not as easy as I
anticipated, but I learned a lot.

505
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,510
And so through doing all of that

506
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:51,200
I got to foster my interest

507
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,340
and my love for computers and technology.

508
00:23:55,340 --> 00:24:00,220
And one day someone suggested
that I give it a shot,

509
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:01,610
that it's an actual career.

510
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:05,379
As Londrina said, it was
really shocking to me

511
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:08,210
that the stuff that I
enjoyed doing for my actual,

512
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:10,820
for my small business was an actual career

513
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,710
that people got paid to do.

514
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:16,410
So I decided to sign up for
the SANS Women's Academy

515
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:19,810
and take their test and interview
and just give it a shot.

516
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:22,030
See if I could get in, if not great,

517
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:25,443
if I did, I'll just do it.

518
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:30,940
So luckily SANS saw something
in me and invited me

519
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:34,300
to be a member of the SANS Women's Academy

520
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:37,149
and I ended up graduating in 2017.

521
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:39,630
I got three certifications through that,

522
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:42,751
the GSEC, the GCIH and GCFE

523
00:24:42,751 --> 00:24:46,770
and SANS actually just ignited a fire.

524
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:49,490
And through doing all the certifications

525
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:51,490
and meeting with the
other women in the group

526
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:54,053
and engaging with the SANS staff,

527
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,200
I just knew that cyber security

528
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,130
and information security
was where I belong

529
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:02,470
and where I needed to be.

530
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:06,347
So luckily I got my first
job in the industry in 2018

531
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:12,940
and since then I've managed
to get eight GX certifications

532
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:16,150
and through community involvement

533
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:19,460
I was senior lead at DEF
CON's Blue Team Village.

534
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:24,100
And I also did some VTA,
virtual TA for SANS.

535
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,443
Next slide please.

536
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,460
So what's surprised me over the years,

537
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:32,170
I have all of this experience,

538
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:33,480
I have a lot of small business,

539
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,660
I have a background in biochemistry.

540
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,930
like what could possibly surprise me.

541
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:41,630
And actually a lot, a lot surprised me

542
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:44,453
about Corporate America and cybersecurity.

543
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:49,330
I tend to be a person
that believes in hard work

544
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:52,120
and that if you just work really hard

545
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:55,760
and give it your best and
network and do all of that

546
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,110
that you will succeed and you will rise

547
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:00,719
to the top and all of
that, for the long game.

548
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,660
But in some circumstances,
that's not necessarily true.

549
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:06,447
You need help, you need help

550
00:26:06,447 --> 00:26:08,483
and you need support along the way.

551
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:13,930
And a good person that
is either in your corner

552
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:16,650
or not in your corner is your manager.

553
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:20,680
And your manager is very, very important.

554
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,640
Here, I'll just read a quote
here from Emily Freeman

555
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,490
she's the author of "DevOps For Dummies"

556
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:28,960
and the other day, she had a great tweet.

557
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,880
So I'm not gonna try to paraphrase it,

558
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,690
I'm just gonna read it, "Once
a manager makes it clear

559
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:39,570
they don't value you
believe them and move on."

560
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:43,683
And I didn't quite
understand what that meant,

561
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:48,370
go back a couple years, but now I do.

562
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:50,689
Now, I completely understand what it means

563
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:54,530
and I completely appreciate
how important your manager is.

564
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:59,003
They can either make or break
your career at a company.

565
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:04,000
They can be supportive, uplifting
and they can inspire you

566
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,330
to be the best version of yourself

567
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:09,100
or they can make you hate

568
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,980
and dread coming to work every day

569
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:13,653
even though, you love
your job and what you do.

570
00:27:14,651 --> 00:27:18,620
There are all kinds of managers,
there are inspiring leaders

571
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:23,280
that set good examples based
on their words and actions.

572
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,930
And then there are others,

573
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:26,970
I won't get into those ones.

574
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:30,060
And just like the general population

575
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:33,190
even if you're working for a fortune 500,

576
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:36,410
managers are not immune to all the things

577
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:40,520
that impact the average
person, they're human too.

578
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:44,370
So, some general advice that I learned

579
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:46,429
over the past couple of years

580
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:50,130
is that setting your
personal ethical lines.

581
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:53,760
And if they're crossed, have an idea

582
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,800
of what you will do and
how you will respond.

583
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,500
Taking, you might not necessarily

584
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,280
have control of the situation

585
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:05,270
but you have control of how you respond

586
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:08,370
and how you act and what you do.

587
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:10,310
So I highly recommend that.

588
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:12,919
The second one, so
diversity and inclusion.

589
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,260
There's a lot of diversity

590
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:16,900
and inclusion initiatives out there.

591
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:21,900
Some of them are really great
and some of them not so much.

592
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,060
So just be aware of that

593
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:28,540
there are also a ton
of resources available

594
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:33,540
to minorities and people that aren't,

595
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:37,190
the general information
security professional.

596
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:39,020
So definitely take advantage of those,

597
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:41,550
SANS has a lot of resources.

598
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:44,409
When I first got into cybersecurity too,

599
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:48,210
I thought I was gonna be
red team, total red team

600
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:50,710
but after being on the blue side,

601
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:54,720
it dawned on me that my interest in red

602
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,270
is more so from a blue perspective

603
00:28:57,270 --> 00:29:00,210
to be able to provide to red

604
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:02,010
what it is that they need in order

605
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:04,690
to be more valuable to blue, essentially.

606
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:09,690
So part of what I do in the community too

607
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:11,730
is cyber threat intelligence

608
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:16,220
and attempting to provide
practical solutions

609
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:19,050
for cyber threat intelligence
that helps other teams

610
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:21,000
and red is included.

611
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,380
And I believe other people
may have mentioned networking

612
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,630
and all of that and the way that I do that

613
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:29,390
is through community involvement.

614
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:31,730
And so I highly recommend that as well,

615
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:34,540
everyone said that please
get involved in the community

616
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:37,770
if you can, even if it's just random,

617
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:41,690
just interacting with people
because you'll see them later.

618
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:43,850
And experienced folks are great.

619
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:48,730
So just like Londrina, they
are a wealth of information

620
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:52,810
and Inno and John they're
all, everyone on this panel

621
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:54,710
is a wealth of information.

622
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,610
So definitely take advantage of people

623
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:58,360
that are willing to speak with you.

624
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:03,620
So some advice, I highly
recommend prioritizing

625
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:05,239
your learning.

626
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,500
There'll be a lot of
people that want your time

627
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,460
and want you to do things

628
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:13,980
and I suggest prioritizing
your learning and what you do

629
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:16,510
because at the end of
the day, it's just you

630
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:17,760
that you have to rely upon.

631
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:22,760
The people that want you to
do all these other things,

632
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:25,560
aren't gonna be there with
you at 3:00 AM in the morning

633
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,270
when you're up late doing a project.

634
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:31,230
So keep that in mind, stay curious,

635
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:35,670
ask a ton of questions and
cultivate your creativity.

636
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:40,280
And that involves like doing
projects and getting involved

637
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:44,350
in coding or machine learning
or anything that sparks

638
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:47,770
that curiosity and makes
you wanna find out more

639
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:52,510
do that, network and
build a support system.

640
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:56,840
I can't stress enough, the
importance and the value of that

641
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,439
and you wanna build it before you need it

642
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,550
and you'll always need it.

643
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:03,669
So just work on it, that's all I'm saying.

644
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:06,770
And finally develop a
leadership philosophy.

645
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:11,540
So with that, it gives you an idea

646
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:14,990
of how you'll behave in certain situations

647
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:18,120
and it defines the type of
leader that you want to be.

648
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,909
And I think that that's very important,

649
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:22,880
so thank you very much.

650
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,380
- Okay, thanks to all three.

651
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:27,370
We've got a few minutes left
before I explained this slide.

652
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:29,879
Monitor toss a question
out to everybody here,

653
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,603
we all mentioned networking.

654
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:35,210
Let's leave aside the
RSA conference we got,

655
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:37,280
obviously we'd be pushing that.

656
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:40,320
What have you guys found is
good ways to network people,

657
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,723
both in-person and virtually, Londrina?

658
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:49,500
- Yeah, so with networking,
I would say right now

659
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:52,730
as we're all working from home

660
00:31:52,730 --> 00:31:54,840
there's the opportunity to attend lots

661
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,050
of other virtual events.

662
00:31:57,050 --> 00:32:00,889
And particularly I've had
luck with attending events

663
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:02,660
that are in a specialty

664
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:04,680
that you'd like to get involved in

665
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:07,180
or events that are local.

666
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:11,020
So that once we get back to
seeing each other in person,

667
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:14,040
you'll have local contacts
especially as you're thinking

668
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:18,050
about careers that might
be in your local area.

669
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:21,120
And staying in touch
with people on LinkedIn.

670
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,842
So making sure that you
get that connection.

671
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,973
- Inno or Xena, any thoughts of yours?

672
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:32,680
- Yeah, so, my suggestion would be

673
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:36,060
to join different association and groups,

674
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:41,060
like I know in the DC area,
we have ISACA, we have RSSA.

675
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:43,960
So it's always good
to, if you starting out

676
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:46,970
or if you're already an industry veteran,

677
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:50,040
join those kinds of groups and volunteer

678
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,409
in some of the communities.

679
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:56,330
That's one of the ways
to basically contribute

680
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:59,050
to the industry and also get recognized

681
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:01,183
and hopefully, land your next gig.

682
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:06,750
- So, from my perspective,
having done a lot

683
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:09,373
of networking in my life.

684
00:33:10,467 --> 00:33:13,340
I, right now, currently, I like to lead

685
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:15,159
with providing value.

686
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:18,800
So I find different
networks like for instance,

687
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,950
I really love cyber threat intelligence

688
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:22,640
and I love Purple Teaming.

689
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:27,220
So with those two, I try to
attend conferences or summits

690
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:30,560
for instance, SANS has a free
Purple Team Summit coming up.

691
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:34,919
SANS usually has the annual
CTI Summit in January,

692
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:38,720
so I attend those and then I
try to give either resources

693
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,340
or information and I
interact with the people

694
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:45,520
or I volunteer or reserve
on the CFP Review Board.

695
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:48,810
I really love being on
the CFP Review Board

696
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:50,610
for a lot of different conferences.

697
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:54,240
And I do that just because
personally I enjoy it

698
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,700
and I learn a lot and I can provide value

699
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:01,700
to the speakers and just
get involved offer value

700
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:03,590
where you can.

701
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:07,010
And narrow it down to a niche or an area

702
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:09,270
that you're interested in that you feel

703
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:11,679
you have something valuable to offer.

704
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:14,520
I know that sometimes I get people asking

705
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:18,239
for coffee dates or coffee meetings.

706
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:20,500
And when you add that up over our time,

707
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,949
that's like a full-time job.

708
00:34:21,949 --> 00:34:26,100
So instead of asking people
for time immediately,

709
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:29,210
I try to find out what
they're interested in

710
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:31,340
through either casual conversation

711
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:33,739
or seeing what they're
posting in the group chats.

712
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:37,199
And then I find whatever
it is related to that

713
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:41,730
like threat reports or
research or something or ideas

714
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:42,969
and then I present it to them.

715
00:34:42,969 --> 00:34:46,520
Like I get very creative
and out of the box

716
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,330
and then I build the relationship

717
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:52,299
before I'm asked for
anything from someone else.

718
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,840
So that's my suggestion.

719
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,626
- Okay, all right, thanks.

720
00:34:55,626 --> 00:34:58,420
I mean, one quick thing from each of you

721
00:34:58,420 --> 00:34:59,773
before we close out here.

722
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:02,990
What online, not SANS, not RSA,

723
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:06,060
what online place do you
go to, what online place

724
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:08,420
would you say, go to for good information

725
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,720
that's important stuff
about cybersecurity.

726
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,600
And again not SANS and not RSA,

727
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,572
let's start with, Inno, this time.

728
00:35:14,572 --> 00:35:18,330
- LinkedIn is very valuable to me,

729
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:20,781
you have, there you have
a lot of people posting

730
00:35:20,781 --> 00:35:22,203
and publishing things.

731
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:28,210
And so you can learn a
lot of stuff from that.

732
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:30,510
For the forensics, for example,

733
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:34,120
I also leverage, forensics
full course is one of them.

734
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:38,150
So they talk about incident response,

735
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:40,430
digital forensics and incident response

736
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:42,770
and so they discussed tools, techniques

737
00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:43,890
and so on and so forth.

738
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:47,803
And also GitHub, so GitHub
has a lot of arsenal

739
00:35:47,803 --> 00:35:49,529
of lots of software security technologies,

740
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:53,130
so people tend to publish
that, projects or codes.

741
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:55,350
So when you go down there,
you can actually find

742
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:56,880
a lot of interesting projects

743
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,720
that you may be interested in.

744
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,890
To either contribute, tests or just

745
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:04,410
again volunteering just to support.

746
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:07,660
- Okay, Xena any one online
site you'd recommend?

747
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:11,410
- Sure, Twitter, I have
a curated following

748
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:14,960
and curated lists that
I leverage on Twitter

749
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,300
and hashtags and it's this
whole elaborate system.

750
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,120
And I highly recommend it

751
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,740
that's how I do a lot of my,

752
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:25,779
that's how I get a lot of
information or heads up

753
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:28,230
about certain things going on.

754
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:32,135
So I highly recommend Twitter
and curating your experience.

755
00:36:32,135 --> 00:36:34,690
- Okay, Londrina, what about you?

756
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:38,293
- Quickly, I'm going to echo
what both Inno and Xena said.

757
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,689
I use LinkedIn for staying
in touch with people

758
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:43,290
who I've done business with.

759
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:47,450
However, I use Twitter
daily for interacting

760
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:50,680
with people who maybe are
on the fringes of my network

761
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,710
and expanding my network.

762
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:55,740
And I think joining
Twitter is probably one

763
00:36:55,740 --> 00:37:00,709
of the things that has
helped my career the most.

764
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:02,960
- Okay, the one I'll throw in

765
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,490
is either The Wall Street Journal

766
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:06,060
or the New York times online.

767
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:08,700
Because the real world is what impacts us,

768
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:11,020
the business things, new
technology, business things,

769
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:14,240
political things changing are
what causes security to change

770
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,160
and threats to change.

771
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:18,470
So, we tend to get so focused on our being

772
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:19,669
in the inside the industry,

773
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:21,940
getting that outside
exposure, I think is key.

774
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,370
So with that, we're
just about out of time.

775
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:27,029
On the screen here, see the
message, pass it forward.

776
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:29,320
We're all talking about
networking, help other people

777
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,550
when they come to you to network.

778
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:33,960
Be a mentor to other people,
volunteer for local efforts

779
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:37,270
to help at schools and colleges
and elementary schools.

780
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:39,330
SANS has a thing we've invested in here,

781
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:42,910
CyberStart America, it's for,
we give our online courses

782
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:45,920
for free to the high school
and early college kids.

783
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,420
If they pass the test
and it's kind of like

784
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:49,680
a game they play, if they
can score high at the game

785
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,450
they get free online education.

786
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:54,220
They go to their community
college, win free scholarships

787
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,669
to four year places.

788
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:58,210
Or get a two-year
bachelor's applied degree

789
00:37:58,210 --> 00:38:00,160
in applied cybersecurity and go out

790
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,319
and get a job right away
with a two year degree.

791
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,640
So it's a way that you can
get your kids involved,

792
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,700
your neighbor's kids, your
grandkids, your nephews

793
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:09,830
