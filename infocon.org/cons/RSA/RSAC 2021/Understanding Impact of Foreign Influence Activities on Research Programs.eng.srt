1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:02,080
- My name is Allen Phelps.

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,583
Thanks for joining my session.

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:08,210
This session is entitled,
"Understanding the Impact

4
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:10,810
of Foreign Influence Activities
on Research Programs."

5
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:12,920
And as I said, my name is Allen Phelps.

6
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,820
I'm the CEO of Trust Farm, LLC.

7
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:18,950
We're an advisory firm on insider
threat management programs

8
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:20,740
and insider threat
management as a service,

9
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,380
and wanted to walk through
a very important topic,

10
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:25,080
known as the foreign influence

11
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,080
and how that impacts research programs.

12
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:31,060
And honestly it infects
any company organization

13
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,370
than it has proprietary information.

14
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:34,400
It's applicable to

15
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:40,080
all organizations that
may have information

16
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,793
that they would like to
protect from outsiders.

17
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:44,613
As I start off

18
00:00:44,613 --> 00:00:48,370
I wanted to share with you
a really important metric

19
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:52,343
which is the 5%, we call it the 5% rule.

20
00:00:53,385 --> 00:00:56,449
And that means based on our experience

21
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:59,760
of 2,500 insider threat investigations

22
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,540
where foreign influence was involved,

23
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:04,260
5% of the employee population

24
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,840
of that organization was
working for the best interest

25
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,700
of themselves or in the best
interest of someone else.

26
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,940
And what that means is not that 5%

27
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,009
of your employee population is bad.

28
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:17,720
It just means that based
on the other metrics

29
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,640
if you're trying to
identify the scope and scale

30
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:24,300
of your insider threat
problem, 5% is a good number.

31
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:28,009
Now, there are different
levels of insider threat

32
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:29,240
insider risk.

33
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,670
To that 5%, it ranges from individuals

34
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:35,270
just looking naturally for another job

35
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:38,262
and then may be looking
to join a competitor.

36
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,313
And in that case,

37
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,660
that is less severe or risky

38
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,090
than someone that's actually working

39
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:46,910
for a foreign adversary, for example

40
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:50,420
to actively steal proprietary information

41
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:52,770
including your trade secrets.

42
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,700
But 5% is a good number.

43
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:58,550
We always here and we asked what,

44
00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:59,950
how big is this problem?

45
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:03,020
And in our estimate,
based on our experience

46
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:07,690
in investigations is
that 5% of the population

47
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:11,290
in any organization is thinking about

48
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:13,400
the best interest of someone else.

49
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,480
So today we'll talk about

50
00:02:16,777 --> 00:02:17,609
some three,

51
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,130
basically three major objectives

52
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:21,910
that we want to accomplish
and leave with you.

53
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:24,359
The first one being, as
you can see on the screen.

54
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,000
What are foreign influence activities?

55
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,960
It's always good to
understand the definition of,

56
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,610
and have a level

57
00:02:32,154 --> 00:02:32,987
a level set on

58
00:02:32,987 --> 00:02:36,150
what foreign influences and how we use it

59
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:41,140
in our work and how you
can reference it in yours

60
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,480
and why you should consider it as part

61
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:47,720
of your threat landscape
for your organization.

62
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,060
The second key lesson in objective

63
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:52,860
that we'll discuss is really understanding

64
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:56,900
how the Global Talent
Recruitment Programs such as

65
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:01,220
the Chinese, Thousand
Talents Programs that you've

66
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:03,223
probably have already heard about.

67
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:07,170
We'll talk about how Global
Talent Recruitment Programs

68
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:09,269
as an example of a foreign
influence threat activity

69
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:13,670
can impact research integrity
in research security

70
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:16,459
and generally information security

71
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,293
as

72
00:03:17,293 --> 00:03:19,140
in general

73
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,080
terms.

74
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,140
And then we'll talk about
how you actually apply

75
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,887
that threat information,
that understanding of

76
00:03:26,887 --> 00:03:29,010
the foreign influence
threat and what are some

77
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:33,079
of the best practices that
your individual organization

78
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,820
can put into place in order to
mitigate those types of risks

79
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,620
including the foreign influence risk

80
00:03:40,084 --> 00:03:43,270
and what you can do to
reduce your overall risk

81
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:44,470
at the organizational level.

82
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:47,800
So there's some things that
you could do from a policy

83
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,530
and procedure standpoint
and just employee,

84
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:54,170
employee contractor education to help

85
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,380
mitigate that risk.

86
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:01,180
So I always like to start
off with a definition

87
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,510
of foreign influence activities is

88
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:06,380
as you know foreign influence
has been bantered around

89
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:09,970
the news media and others
almost always related

90
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:11,920
recently to elections

91
00:04:13,074 --> 00:04:14,790
and other political issues around

92
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:18,649
in the United States.

93
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:21,299
But foreign influence is really any formal

94
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:25,480
or informal program a
project or initiative

95
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,140
that's either sponsored openly

96
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,550
or overtly

97
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:34,350
or covertly or secretly by a
government backed institutions.

98
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,870
And what makes them,

99
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:38,410
the reason they're
called foreign influence

100
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:39,423
from our perspective is that

101
00:04:39,423 --> 00:04:43,240
they're designed to target
assess, recruit and exploits

102
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,237
insiders, right?

103
00:04:44,237 --> 00:04:46,780
These programs are designed
and these activities

104
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:49,340
are designed to compromise
security controls

105
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:53,099
and compliance controls in order
to gain unauthorized access

106
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:57,190
to proprietary or classified
or even trade secrets

107
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:59,740
or intellectual property
research materials

108
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:04,100
and most often other personnel
within the organization.

109
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,640
So foreign influence activities

110
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:09,490
is any formal or informal initiative

111
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:10,323
or attack

112
00:05:10,323 --> 00:05:14,140
on your organization in order
to compromise the human being.

113
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,010
And that's how we define it

114
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:18,590
so there are I'm sure government agencies

115
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:21,609
around the world that can
have their own definitions

116
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:23,770
but just so that we're
all on the same page

117
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:25,150
foreign influence activities

118
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:29,159
when we refer to them as an organized

119
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:34,483
approach or initiative to
compromise your research.

120
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:38,350
And it's the human element that

121
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:41,510
makes it a little different,
obviously in cybersecurity

122
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:45,450
and information security,
all have some sort of

123
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:49,200
insider threat component to their programs

124
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:53,493
but they may not actually have
the foreign influence threat

125
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:58,060
or risk on their assessments.

126
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:03,010
And the reason we think it's
an incredible important area

127
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:06,440
and not to ignore is that
foreign influence focuses

128
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,930
on the integrity of the
individual or the human being.

129
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:12,830
So you can have the best
malware and the firewalls

130
00:06:14,965 --> 00:06:19,400
and all the cybersecurity
and IT infrastructure

131
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,169
to prevent things like malware.

132
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:25,020
But the risk of course is
if you have an individual

133
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,669
that has authorized
access to your systems,

134
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:30,360
you can actually be defeated

135
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,724
and be compromised via
those employee actions.

136
00:06:34,724 --> 00:06:36,300
And so,

137
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,360
we would, part of the takeaway here

138
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:43,360
is to make sure that you have
considered foreign influence

139
00:06:43,464 --> 00:06:48,420
and appreciate and understand
how individual employees

140
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,200
and contractors and supply chain partners

141
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,920
external partners can impact
your overall readiness

142
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,953
to protect your information assets.

143
00:06:58,410 --> 00:06:59,860
So,

144
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:02,360
one of the top examples

145
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,520
or most prolific examples

146
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,270
of a foreign influence activity

147
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:09,010
that we can talk about

148
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:10,170
in your,

149
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:11,950
I'm sure in your work

150
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:13,909
that you've have at least heard about

151
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:16,190
Talent Programs or Talents Programs

152
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,640
as they're often referred to.

153
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,300
We use the phrase, Global
Talents Recruitment Program

154
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,480
as to

155
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,280
to encompass all those areas

156
00:07:25,731 --> 00:07:27,390
around this idea

157
00:07:28,269 --> 00:07:32,350
of recruiting the
individual to do another job

158
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:34,750
outside of their current employment.

159
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:37,770
And so from a definition standpoint

160
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:41,770
you'll hear the words, talents.

161
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:43,570
And it refers to those
foreign influence activities

162
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:46,800
that promote the recruitment
of researchers or employees,

163
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,200
contractors or external partners

164
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,479
working in academic corporate

165
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,680
and government sectors to
gain unauthorized access

166
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,023
to innovative research
programs and projects.

167
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,020
And again, talents

168
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:00,140
is a sort of a shortened form

169
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,750
for Global Talent Recruitment Programs.

170
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,840
And so, as you think about this risk

171
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,200
and this threat

172
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,630
if you hear the term
talents, it basically refers

173
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:11,920
to that foreign influence program

174
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,943
that related to a Global
Talent Recruitment Program.

175
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:21,770
Talent programs are of interest
in and should be on your

176
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:26,020
risk radar primarily because
of the invisible hand

177
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,599
often the invisible
hand that sponsors them.

178
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,800
And so through our analysis of hundreds

179
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,640
of talent recruitment incidents

180
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,130
where an individual

181
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:40,760
a trusted individual with
access to research assets

182
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,049
or information assets

183
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:45,010
get involved,

184
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:47,350
they get involved with an initiative,

185
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:50,210
a foreign influence activity.

186
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:53,290
And when we dissect that
and understand really

187
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:57,380
what had occurred is almost
always sponsored by a government

188
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,110
or a military organization

189
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:01,070
interested in leapfrogging technologies

190
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:02,830
through IP theft and misappropriation.

191
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:04,270
So

192
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:06,870
as you've probably seen in the headlines

193
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:09,640
around the world that the
talent recruitment programs

194
00:09:11,837 --> 00:09:14,920
will lead to a theft of a research asset

195
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,150
or an information asset
with the underlying goal

196
00:09:19,288 --> 00:09:22,010
from the sponsoring insider

197
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:25,270
threat or the foreign
influence threat actor.

198
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:28,023
The ultimate goal is to
leapfrog in that technology.

199
00:09:29,147 --> 00:09:32,423
And that's an important
key takeaway because it's,

200
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:36,589
understanding the motivation
behind certain programs

201
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:37,850
will help you identify

202
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:40,783
what's behind it.

203
00:09:40,783 --> 00:09:43,660
And so you're not, it's a little different

204
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:45,790
from a typical insider threat

205
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,630
where you're worried about sabotage

206
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,760
or something at the local level.

207
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,887
If you have a government

208
00:09:51,887 --> 00:09:54,729
and where a military organization coaching

209
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:57,440
and directing those
activities of the insider

210
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,310
you are really up
against the nation state.

211
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:03,119
And that requires some additional help

212
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,823
and expertise and resources.

213
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,300
But I wanted to walk you
through because our analysis,

214
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,640
and again, we've done, excuse me.

215
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,110
We've done hundreds of
these investigations

216
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:17,860
related to foreign influence
activities specifically related

217
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,270
to the

218
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:21,699
talent recruitment programs.

219
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,980
And we've come to the conclusion

220
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:26,940
that there is a predictable life cycle

221
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:31,380
or process related to the Global
Talent Recruitment Program.

222
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:35,070
And as a recruitment
process, as you can see

223
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:37,910
there is a step-by-step sort of playbook

224
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:41,689
that we've identified and oftentimes

225
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,463
the tactics can change.

226
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,662
But for the most part,

227
00:10:49,581 --> 00:10:52,130
there's a predictable pattern

228
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:54,580
of behavior that we've uncovered

229
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:57,640
and through our
investigations and analysis

230
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,930
of managing these
incidents for organizations

231
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:04,290
across research platforms,

232
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:05,189
corporate academic

233
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:07,530
and federal government.

234
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:11,180
And just kinda walk you
through what that looks like.

235
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,189
So

236
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:15,240
if we consider the nation state interest

237
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,930
in leapfrogging technology,
it starts with understanding

238
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:19,829
how the intelligence cycle works

239
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,240
and the intelligence cycle starts

240
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,500
with an understanding of gaps.

241
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,450
And so the nation state
or the foreign government

242
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:29,960
or foreign military
organization identifies gaps

243
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,110
in their own capabilities

244
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:32,810
whether it's a military modernization

245
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:34,699
or some sort of economic interests

246
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:38,090
that they're trying to advance.

247
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:39,698
And when you identify those gaps,

248
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:43,350
what the nation state or the
government is trying to do is

249
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:44,870
determine what they're missing

250
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,230
in order to meet the strategic goals

251
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:49,470
of their other country
or their politicians

252
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:52,670
or whoever is actually
making the decisions

253
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,750
on where they wanna go as a nation state.

254
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:59,720
And so that initial first step
is to identify the technology

255
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,860
that needs to be identified

256
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:07,935
and determine what technologies
will fill those gaps

257
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:10,979
in their own domestic programs.

258
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,860
And then what makes the talent
recruitment programs work

259
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,970
and so effective is that
these foreign governments

260
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:21,410
these nation states will
put incentives attached to

261
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:22,630
the targeted technology.

262
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:25,830
And so what that means
is you'll see governments

263
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:28,477
like China and Russia and others

264
00:12:28,477 --> 00:12:32,800
that know that they
have gaps in technology.

265
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,800
And then they incentivize

266
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,829
basically the collection
of information or details

267
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:42,120
or information in order
to close those gaps.

268
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,990
And so they'll put usually dollar figures

269
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:49,960
associated with the
bounty to collect those

270
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,483
the targeted technology,

271
00:12:52,849 --> 00:12:57,210
and that allows multiple
groups from a nation state.

272
00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:00,940
So when you think of a
foreign influence activity

273
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:04,110
you can see different types of
threat actors coming at you.

274
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:06,050
So you can have academics coming at you.

275
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:07,430
You can have

276
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:08,410
corporations

277
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:10,890
working on behalf

278
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:15,890
of a nation state, including
even military organizations

279
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,420
as we saw in the United States

280
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:22,310
targeting technology sectors
in order to gain access

281
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:25,099
to that information that
they need to fill their gaps.

282
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:28,020
Once the incentives have been identified

283
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:31,370
the nation state typically
then pushes that out

284
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:34,270
to their constituents as it were.

285
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:36,079
And the call goes out to say

286
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,860
if you are in a position
to collect this technology,

287
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,710
we would encourage you to do so.

288
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:43,795
And if you're successful in doing that

289
00:13:43,795 --> 00:13:48,740
we will then reward you with
a financial incentive package

290
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:51,480
and benefits and we'll talk about that.

291
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,230
Once the incentives have been broadcasted

292
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:59,070
and test out to the various
information collection teams

293
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:00,463
formerly and informally,

294
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:04,620
then the hunt for who
actually has a technology

295
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,950
in the United States and Western Europe

296
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:09,320
and wherever in the world actually occurs.

297
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,030
And so there's an analysis that's done

298
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:14,790
at the nation state level
and those organizations

299
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:17,310
that are tasked to
collect the information,

300
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:19,300
to start looking at
corporations, universities,

301
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,500
government sector, military sector,

302
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,670
look for the supply chain,
partners in the supply chain

303
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:27,610
companies that are
involved in supply chains

304
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:29,360
the universities that
are involved in research

305
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,593
both basic and fundamental
and applied research.

306
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,520
And the idea there is to,

307
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,250
to identify organizations
that actually have

308
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,440
the technology to be researched.

309
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,500
Once they identify the organization

310
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,940
that owns that technology or
has access to a supply chain

311
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:49,410
that ultimately leads to
the targeted technology

312
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:50,959
then they'll start looking
at the individuals.

313
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:54,590
Again the talent recruitment
program it only works

314
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:57,870
if you can find an individual
willing to participate

315
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:59,270
in the information collection platform.

316
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:01,100
And so the idea is

317
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,710
once you understand
what organization has it

318
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:06,160
then you use social media and other ways

319
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,990
and other open source and
the alumni associations

320
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:13,270
and other ways to identify
who's actually working

321
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:14,360
at those organizations.

322
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,650
And so we see a lot of
attack and approaches

323
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:21,750
to targeted organizations
through the social media accounts

324
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,620
of individuals working
for that organization.

325
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:26,100
So as you think about
your information security

326
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,650
or your cybersecurity
policies and procedures,

327
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:32,000
one of the things to consider
is to make sure that you

328
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,230
that you train your employees
and your contractors

329
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:35,470
and your supply chain partners,

330
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:38,490
not to put too much information
out on their social media

331
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:42,862
related to the proprietary or
protected information at work.

332
00:15:42,862 --> 00:15:47,719
And so oftentimes we find good
old fashioned trade secrets

333
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,330
and intellectual property sitting

334
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:50,730
in the social media accounts

335
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:53,940
and postings of employees who ultimately

336
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:56,450
should have known better not to do that.

337
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:58,720
The reason you wanna prevent that is

338
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,970
we know that nation states

339
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:01,560
and foreign influence activities actually

340
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,160
look at those social media accounts.

341
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,040
And try to identify those
individuals that have access

342
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,500
and of course, social media allows them

343
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,640
direct access and
communication opportunities

344
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:14,363
to reach out and start the
recruitment process in earnest.

345
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:19,260
And once an individual gets
recruited into a talent program

346
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:23,510
often they're tasked
with and rewarded with

347
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,480
identifying others
within their organization

348
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,780
or parallel organizations
that can provide similar

349
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:30,870
or compliment the information
collection process.

350
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:33,830
And so we begin to see if you analyze

351
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:34,730
enough of these incidents

352
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:37,370
you start seeing one
talent recruitment members

353
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:39,590
start recruiting other
talent recruitment members

354
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:40,423
or

355
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:44,127
they start hiring folks to join them

356
00:16:44,127 --> 00:16:47,420
in their lab, in the US
or wherever it may be

357
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:50,099
in order to expand the
number of individuals

358
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,410
with access to the targeted information.

359
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:56,770
And so it really becomes a
network recruitment process.

360
00:16:56,770 --> 00:17:00,478
And so our guidance is if
you actually do find someone

361
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:04,636
that has been recruited by a
talent recruitment program,

362
00:17:04,636 --> 00:17:06,490
that's usually a good indication

363
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:08,680
that there's gonna be others
within your organization.

364
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,970
So that 5% rule

365
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:12,782
kinda comes into play

366
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:15,800
because if you have a
single talent recruit

367
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,500
that probably means you have one

368
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,333
or more

369
00:17:20,905 --> 00:17:23,510
that are working against you.

370
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:26,730
And of course, the
reason we all care about

371
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:27,970
or as risk managers

372
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:30,740
you should care about a talent
recruitment program is that

373
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,550
it almost always leads to

374
00:17:34,002 --> 00:17:35,750
the trade secret theft

375
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:38,690
or an intellectual
property misappropriation.

376
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,500
And we'll talk about that in a second.

377
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,650
So the talents, when you
interview enough of these,

378
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:46,840
and I've been in a position

379
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,500
both of my corporate career

380
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,640
and my advisory and consulting career

381
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,650
to do a lot of these investigations

382
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:56,860
to include actual interviews
of subjects of interest

383
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:57,693
in individuals

384
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:01,280
that have been alleged to have been

385
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,560
recruited by a foreign influence activity

386
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,810
including the global talents.

387
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:07,510
And it's always a mixed

388
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:11,760
a mix of personalities
as far as did that person

389
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,923
was that person witting that relationship.

390
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,560
Certainly, they knew that
they had a part-time job

391
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,720
or a co-employment, but oftentimes

392
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,380
they are the subject of
interests or the person

393
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,530
that has been recruited

394
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:26,070
is kind of shocked when
you have to explain to them

395
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:28,943
that they've been exploited
by a foreign talent program.

396
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,310
Now

397
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,750
looking for, designing your cybersecurity

398
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,380
your information security program

399
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:40,580
to look for talent programs is important,

400
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:43,240
but identifying somebody that has a talent

401
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:46,863
recruitment platform affiliation
is just the beginning.

402
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,760
We care about

403
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,290
participation in the talents program,

404
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:55,420
because of what our
experience has taught us

405
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:58,960
is that if you have a global
talent recruits working for you

406
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,820
that typically means that they have

407
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,110
mishandled the proprietary information

408
00:19:10,307 --> 00:19:11,900
that the organization has invested in.

409
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,530
And so out of the 2,500 investigations

410
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:16,180
that we've been involved
with either directly

411
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:18,830
or in a consulting role

412
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:21,110
every single time we've
seen a talent recruit

413
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:25,620
we see them see those individuals
uploading, downloading

414
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:28,729
printing out, basically mishandling

415
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:31,580
the proprietary and protected information

416
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:34,470
from their employers.

417
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:37,290
And again, I'll reiterate
the reason you care about

418
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:39,296
the global talent program is not because

419
00:19:39,296 --> 00:19:41,490
you don't wanna lose your employees,

420
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:44,010
which is obviously something very few

421
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:45,830
organizations wanted to.

422
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:47,060
But most importantly

423
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,838
it's an indicator that
they're probably misbehaving

424
00:19:49,838 --> 00:19:53,580
there's some misbehavior
related to how they're handling

425
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,112
your proprietary information.

426
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:58,840
So how many talent programs are there?

427
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:02,949
We estimate there are roughly
3,000, primarily because of,

428
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:04,110
if you recall

429
00:20:05,061 --> 00:20:07,382
the diagram on the lifecycle,

430
00:20:09,941 --> 00:20:13,290
every time we'll see an incentive

431
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:15,990
put out by a nation state.

432
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:19,470
We see many organizations
coming after that same target.

433
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:21,720
And so the global talent recruitment

434
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:26,040
it's a very large, it's
not just a single entity

435
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,970
that's coming after your organization.

436
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:29,430
There were literally hundreds of thousands

437
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:30,870
of organizations that are trying to

438
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:32,879
or individuals trying to get access

439
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,050
to your proprietary information.

440
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:38,000
We have analyzed

441
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,060
what type of technologies

442
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:40,893
that they're looking for.

443
00:20:40,893 --> 00:20:44,680
So if you look at the
US critical technology

444
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:48,540
or critical infrastructure
functions, and you look at what

445
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,373
what is being targeted

446
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:51,730
by the Global Talent Recruitment Programs,

447
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:53,750
it's almost identical match.

448
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:54,583
And so,

449
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:59,400
defense in national
security, banking and finance

450
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,774
the food supply chain, utilities, water

451
00:21:03,774 --> 00:21:07,199
the classic critical
infrastructure are almost

452
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,330
always involved

453
00:21:09,656 --> 00:21:10,960
in being targeted by

454
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:15,800
the foreign influence activities.

455
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,633
And

456
00:21:16,633 --> 00:21:17,466
if you're wondering,

457
00:21:17,466 --> 00:21:18,806
if you're a part of an organization

458
00:21:18,807 --> 00:21:20,730
and you're trying to figure
out if you're actually

459
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:23,550
being targeted by such a
foreign influence program

460
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:26,399
like the talents program,
if you happen to work

461
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,280
or are involved in the supply chain

462
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,960
of any of those critical
infrastructure sectors

463
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,520
there's a good chance

464
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,690
that you are being targeted
or will be targeted.

465
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:36,650
And so you have to assume then

466
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:38,640
from a risk management perspective

467
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,860
that there's a likelihood

468
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:45,122
that you would be a target of
a foreign influence attack.

469
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,533
And,

470
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:52,600
we have found it in almost all the sectors

471
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,469
listed there on the screen.

472
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:56,040
And so,

473
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,840
and again, one of the, as a risk manager

474
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:02,740
one of your jobs is trying
to keep it, keep an eye on

475
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:05,309
things that might surprise
you and make sure that

476
00:22:05,309 --> 00:22:07,740
your security controls and
your compliance controls

477
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:11,840
are such that you can
identify issues that pop up

478
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,379
sooner rather than later,
so that you can remediate

479
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:16,653
and manage that risk of properly.

480
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:20,050
I always like to share tactics,
techniques and procedures

481
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:23,870
because I think it's a
really important thing to do.

482
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:26,949
And we do see a difference
between the China

483
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:29,110
or the Chinese talent recruitment programs

484
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:32,189
versus say the Russians or the Iranian

485
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:35,267
talent recruitment programs.

486
00:22:35,267 --> 00:22:37,800
The main difference and
there are other countries

487
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,669
that come after advanced technologies.

488
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:41,814
I just highlight those three countries

489
00:22:41,814 --> 00:22:44,100
because they seem to
be the dominant players

490
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,919
that we run across.

491
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:50,920
And I would estimate 85 to
95% of all talent recruitment

492
00:22:51,029 --> 00:22:54,313
recruitment activities
seem to benefit China.

493
00:22:56,402 --> 00:22:59,260
That's not an assessment
against the country.

494
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:03,720
It's just the fact is that
I think it's a numbers game.

495
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,770
There's so many talent
recruitment programs

496
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:09,764
coming out of China
that it only makes sense

497
00:23:09,765 --> 00:23:13,220
that the number of recruits
that are participating

498
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:17,810
would be benefiting the
government of the PRC.

499
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:19,530
The main difference that we see

500
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:21,250
from an analytical perspective

501
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:22,967
between the Chinese talent programs

502
00:23:22,967 --> 00:23:24,760
and the Russian and Iranians

503
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:28,070
is that the Russian and
Iranians act more like spies.

504
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:30,870
And so what I mean by that is
when they identify somebody

505
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:33,479
with access to information of interest,

506
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:38,060
we see them moving off when
more to a covert relationship,

507
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:40,840
so that the relationship is protected

508
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,639
from outside observers.

509
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,793
We don't see that on the Chinese behavior,

510
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,920
the China talent programs

511
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,900
that behavior seems to
be a numbers game, again

512
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,449
where there's so many people involved

513
00:23:52,449 --> 00:23:55,080
that they're really from
a risk security standpoint

514
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,139
and an operational security standpoint.

515
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:00,190
There doesn't seem to be a
fear of being discovered.

516
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:02,780
Certainly, you don't
wanna anyone to get in,

517
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:06,110
I assume that they don't
want their talent recruits

518
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:07,490
to get

519
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:09,844
indicted or prosecuted.

520
00:24:09,844 --> 00:24:12,300
But the reality is that
there's so many people involved

521
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,810
in these talent programs is that

522
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:16,099
if you lose one, you probably have,

523
00:24:16,099 --> 00:24:19,110
I don't know if there's
ever been an estimate

524
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:20,540
but there are many more that have access

525
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:21,490
to the same information.

526
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:25,210
So there's this idea that
there's a power in numbers.

527
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:29,290
And so really understanding where to look

528
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:33,129
and identifying where
to put your resources

529
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:36,303
is pretty critical to
them to match that risk.

530
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,379
There is a Wolf pack.

531
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:41,970
What I call the Wolf
pack nature to talents

532
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:45,113
and the talent recruitment
programs in that,

533
00:24:46,091 --> 00:24:48,610
and this is just a graphic
that I'll share with you.

534
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:49,510
This is

535
00:24:51,643 --> 00:24:54,270
an investigative charts relationship

536
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:55,103
based in

537
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:59,919
visualizer that allows
you to help visualize

538
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,170
how big this problem is.

539
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:04,620
And so the target in the
center of this graphic

540
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,652
represents a targeted company.

541
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,469
Outside there are smaller targets

542
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:12,380
those are professional associations.

543
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:16,630
Those are university alumni associations

544
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:19,190
professional groups and
the little dots around

545
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:23,053
all of those are individual
insiders, if you will.

546
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:27,810
And so if you happen to
be the center of attention

547
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:29,460
so if you have a really great technology

548
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,830
or if you're involved in an
advanced technology field

549
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:34,822
that is of great interest
to nation states,

550
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,840
you will see multiple people

551
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,560
multiple entities trying to gain access

552
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,230
to your networks, into your information.

553
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:44,710
And so when you think about the,

554
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:47,250
how big the insider threat program is

555
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:48,670
based on foreign influence,

556
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:51,060
I hope that you recall this because

557
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:54,440
this is a really typical
graph that we come up with.

558
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:57,333
Once you start identifying
individuals involved.

559
00:25:58,490 --> 00:25:59,340
And so,

560
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:02,010
like I mentioned previously is that

561
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:04,570
if you have one global
talent program member

562
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:08,080
that had been someone
insider that you trusted

563
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,460
that got recruited by a global
talent recruitment program

564
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:15,100
you probably have many
more that you haven't seen.

565
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:18,270
So it's a bit of a, it's
kind of a lead indicator.

566
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:21,700
So if you do discover this
risk within your organization,

567
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:24,600
it's really important
that you take a look at,

568
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,050
take a look left and right

569
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:29,810
and to see who else may be involved.

570
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:31,860
So some of those other examples

571
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:34,419
of foreign influence activities,

572
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:38,070
most is just a massive
volume of activities.

573
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:39,919
If you can just imagine how many folks

574
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,493
are coming after your information,

575
00:26:43,883 --> 00:26:44,716
there's just

576
00:26:45,577 --> 00:26:49,560
so many ways to lose
intellectual property these days.

577
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,379
But one of the things
that they have in common

578
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:54,110
are the goals to advance
political, military

579
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:57,175
or commercial objectives
at the expense of others.

580
00:26:57,175 --> 00:26:59,700
It's always cheaper to steal a technology

581
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,330
than it is to innovate it from scratch.

582
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:04,860
And so we see that activity all the time.

583
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:07,439
As I mentioned, social engineering,

584
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,360
the LinkedIn hunting, if you will,

585
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,899
of your insiders is occurring daily.

586
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,260
There are more formal

587
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,250
social outreach programs,
cultural outreach programs

588
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:22,190
that are authentic and legitimate,

589
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:26,270
but oftentimes can have
a secondary purpose,

590
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:30,070
which in most cases,
advances the belief system

591
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:33,110
of a foreign power.

592
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:35,320
We see lots of foreign
influence activities related

593
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,330
to mergers and acquisitions,
venture capital funding

594
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:40,590
and other financial investments.

595
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:41,423
And so,

596
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:44,060
if you're a great researcher

597
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:46,690
or you're working on
something really important

598
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:49,590
and you have trouble
finding capital funding

599
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:51,470
to commercialize your idea

600
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:55,420
or just seek good old
fashioned research funding

601
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:59,340
we see researchers that are highly capable

602
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,990
reaching out to go find the money

603
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:05,110
that they're looking to go get.

604
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:08,250
And then another type of
foreign influence activity

605
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:11,590
that we see is what we refer
to as innovation competitions,

606
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:12,540
where

607
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:14,139
there is a open

608
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:16,550
basically an open casting call

609
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:18,930
for anybody that has a good idea

610
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:21,370
or has access to proprietary information.

611
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:25,750
You bring that idea to
these competitive platforms.

612
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:28,800
You basically make a pitch for the capital

613
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,180
or for the investment during
that process, of course

614
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:33,740
you have to share your secret
sauce or your trade secrets.

615
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:36,113
And so it's a risky behavior.

616
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,879
Sometimes they get the
investment, sometimes they don't

617
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:42,238
but in all those cases, you have to share

618
00:28:42,238 --> 00:28:47,238
your proprietary information
sometimes without any return.

619
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:48,763
So what's the impact?

620
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:51,129
As you can imagine,

621
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:53,250
the misuse loss, theft
and misappropriation

622
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:54,870
of

623
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:56,852
IP assets can be harmful,

624
00:28:58,370 --> 00:28:59,479
primarily because

625
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:02,730
most organizations rely
on information assets

626
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:07,430
to be competitive or to
remain as an on-point entity.

627
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:11,480
So it's important that we
understand that if you lose,

628
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:14,040
if you have a foreign
influence activity occurs

629
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,420
and you have someone

630
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,580
that misuses or steals
your intellectual property

631
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:20,510
there's always a problem with that

632
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:23,653
and consequences that go along with that.

633
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:26,620
The coercion of trusted researchers,

634
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:31,409
that's once you lose,
once you lose the ability

635
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:34,603
to trust your particular employee,

636
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,510
unfortunately,

637
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:38,220
it's hard to get them back on track.

638
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:40,430
It's not impossible but we often see

639
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:44,070
human resources get involved.

640
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,679
Once somebody has been compromised

641
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,403
by a foreign influence activity.

642
00:29:49,364 --> 00:29:52,310
The compromise of your controls

643
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:57,280
is probably the biggest thing
for the attendees in this.

644
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,410
And so you can work really hard

645
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:04,050
and have a great security
controls and integrity standards.

646
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:06,629
But if an individual
decides to participate

647
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:07,860
in a foreign influence activity

648
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:10,879
all that can go out the window
and there are consequences

649
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,460
not only for that individual
but also the employer, right?

650
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:15,710
So your organization can actually

651
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:20,100
if you have research agreements
and complaints agreements,

652
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,669
and with the government

653
00:30:23,392 --> 00:30:24,710
or partners,

654
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:26,906
if you have an insider that breaches

655
00:30:26,906 --> 00:30:29,517
those terms and conditions,

656
00:30:29,517 --> 00:30:31,970
the organization itself can actually be

657
00:30:34,105 --> 00:30:35,003
in jeopardy.

658
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:39,760
We almost always see a violation
of complainants policies.

659
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,900
And of course, some
non-disclosure of foreign research

660
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:46,970
relationships or the funding
is an issue related around

661
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,350
this idea of conflict of interest

662
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:49,820
and conflict of commitment.

663
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,434
And so,

664
00:30:51,434 --> 00:30:53,730
if you do have somebody involved

665
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:55,950
either an employee or a
contractor that gets involved

666
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:57,720
in one of these foreign
influence activities

667
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:01,810
then it almost always results
in a compliance investigation.

668
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:05,159
And there's things that
happen after you get

669
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,814
when you go into the
remediation mode, excuse me

670
00:31:09,814 --> 00:31:10,853
you'll have to,

671
00:31:11,894 --> 00:31:15,428
there are decisions that
related to what to do about

672
00:31:15,428 --> 00:31:20,170
once you find it and you
assess how bad the impact was.

673
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:21,840
So how do you, how would you apply this?

674
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:26,840
How do you apply this
mitigation effort, if you will

675
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,180
and apply some best practices
to your organization?

676
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:33,480
We recommend because we focus
on research organizations

677
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,000
we recommend implementing

678
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,680
a research security management program.

679
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:41,460
Of course, even if you don't have

680
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:44,490
a hardcore research capability

681
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:47,310
you can call your program

682
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:49,639
insider threat management
program, IP protection

683
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:52,080
intellectual property protection program,

684
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,429
and

685
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:56,550
whatever that formal
name is, the idea is that

686
00:31:56,550 --> 00:32:00,050
you have a dedicated formal program

687
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:03,950
to assess that risk, apply controls

688
00:32:06,574 --> 00:32:10,370
and remediation capability
to take a look at

689
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:12,649
how to reduce the compliance risk

690
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:14,680
and how to improve

691
00:32:16,115 --> 00:32:17,860
and to change risky employee behaviors.

692
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:20,199
That's probably the key there

693
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,170
and establish the governance
framework in order to

694
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:27,050
ensure that that risk
management process is there.

695
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:30,010
And it integrates with
all the other controls

696
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:32,480
and complaints, policies and
procedures that you have.

697
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:37,480
And so it does take a dedicated
effort in order to plug in

698
00:32:38,182 --> 00:32:40,240
a research security management program

699
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,850
or insider threat management program.

700
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:46,179
'Cause it runs across all
functions within a business.

701
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:49,290
And you wanna make sure
that your program enhances

702
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:50,123
the policies.

703
00:32:50,123 --> 00:32:54,480
So having a policy without
training for example,

704
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,600
is sort of certainly not a best practice

705
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:00,650
because you have to prepare

706
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:03,030
your employees and your contractors

707
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:06,163
and your supply chain partners
or your external partners.

708
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:10,200
You wanna prepare them to
actually identify when a risk

709
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,330
or a threat comes into their world

710
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:14,040
and take the appropriate action

711
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,280
so that they do not compromise themselves

712
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:19,260
or most importantly the organization

713
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,547
for which they they work for.

714
00:33:20,547 --> 00:33:23,850
And you can accomplish that by training.

715
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:25,590
Training and building awareness

716
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:27,129
around educating the workforce

717
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:31,290
on foreign influence
and how to avoid that.

718
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:33,659
I often say when we get involved

719
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:36,085
in these incidents is that

720
00:33:36,085 --> 00:33:37,970
this was completely avoidable.

721
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:42,290
If you had an employee
that was aware of the risk

722
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:43,389
if they were aware of the risk

723
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:46,950
and they still did the
behavior that was compromising

724
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:49,330
as an investigator that
is called an intent.

725
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:50,530
And so that changes

726
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:54,060
the conversation moving forward.

727
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:56,840
So if you have someone that intentionally

728
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:59,820
harmed your organization or
took advantage of their position

729
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:03,100
that's a much different, a
much different conversation

730
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,270
than somebody that excellently

731
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:07,643
went to work for a foreign power.

732
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,830
There were some internal
and external drivers

733
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:13,860
of organizations have to pay attention to,

734
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:16,683
certainly, if you get federal
or State research grants,

735
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:21,139
those granting agencies
are put in more scrutiny

736
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:23,009
and rigor around

737
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:27,730
how they expect the
receiving grant organization

738
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:32,170
to behave and by extension
what the expectation

739
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:33,370
of the user behavior is.

740
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:37,270
And so understanding what
your requirements are

741
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:40,820
to comply with those compliance

742
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:43,860
monitoring enforcement
standards are pretty critical.

743
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:47,120
There is an increasing
interest in State quarter,

744
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:50,330
an increase in State quarter
interest in research integrity

745
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:54,360
from a financial and reputational
stewardship standpoint.

746
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:57,450
And of course the public for those of us

747
00:34:57,450 --> 00:35:00,970
in the United States, is this idea of

748
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:03,620
ensuring that our tax dollars
are not being exploited

749
00:35:04,683 --> 00:35:06,940
by another outside country

750
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:09,130
at the benefit

751
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:10,650
of the taxpayer.

752
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:13,130
And of course, there's
been lots of headlines

753
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:15,670
related to research or misbehaviors

754
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:18,120
that are driving some of the changes.

755
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,770
So there are some internal drivers

756
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:22,900
in addition to the external drivers

757
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:26,950
of why an organization needs
to apply some best practices

758
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:28,330
and they differ by

759
00:35:29,811 --> 00:35:32,110
the industry or a sector

760
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:34,990
that your organization might be in.

761
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:37,200
But in academia, for
example, having an unfunded

762
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:41,160
and tenure tracked researcher
is always a bad thing.

763
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,899
And from a corporate

764
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:45,740
or government organizational standpoint,

765
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:49,120
this idea of having an
internal researcher pressure

766
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,980
to have a fair and balanced approach

767
00:35:53,197 --> 00:35:56,320
to risk mitigation is critical.

768
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,950
The reason you wanna apply
some of these best practices

769
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:03,950
kinda follows the risk mitigation practice

770
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:05,899
in that you wanna reduce
the likelihood and impact

771
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,350
of an intellectual property, trade secret

772
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:10,000
and proprietary information loss, theft

773
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,780
and misappropriation

774
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:12,850
and you wanna shorten the time

775
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:16,210
between identifying the
incident and then assessing it

776
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:18,930
responding to it and remediating it.

777
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:20,250
And for those of you that are involved

778
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:23,150
in information security or
cybersecurity, that is very

779
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:26,820
that tracks with the normal
threat identification

780
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:31,504
and assessment and then
responding to that incident.

781
00:36:31,504 --> 00:36:32,890
And of course, the goal is to make sure

782
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:35,350
that you reduce the
risk to the organization

783
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:37,080
so that it doesn't become a victim

784
00:36:40,781 --> 00:36:43,970
of foreign influence threat activity.

785
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:45,049
So that's what I have today.

786
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:46,682
I appreciate

787
00:36:46,682 --> 00:36:48,290
your attendance.

788
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:53,050
Again, the key takeaways
for influences are real.

789
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:54,240
The threat actors are out there

790
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,520
and it should be managed

791
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,710
both at the organizational
and individual level.

792
00:36:57,710 --> 00:37:01,650
There are responsibilities
for both is the best practice

793
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:03,790
implemented research
security management program

794
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:05,980
or something similar to reduce that risk

795
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:08,940
and identify it and
respond to it effectively.

796
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:13,410
And the idea is that if you
improve your risk controls

797
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:17,069
and your security controls,
this is a manageable threat.

798
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:20,300
Understanding how your
employees, contractors

799
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:23,680
and others involved in your organization

800
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:28,560
can participate in
foreign influenced attacks

801
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,650
educating them to not
get involved in things

802
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:34,470
like the Global Talent
Recruitment Programs is critical.

803
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:36,419
So thank you very much for your time.

804
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,310
I appreciate your attention

805
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:40,340
enjoy the rest of the RSA conference.

806
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:41,420
And,

807
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,770
thanks for calling.
