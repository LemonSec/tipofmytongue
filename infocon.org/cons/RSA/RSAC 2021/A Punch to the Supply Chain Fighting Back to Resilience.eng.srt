1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:02,520
- Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:06,020
I'm Jennifer Bisceglie,
CEO and founder of Interos

3
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:10,290
and I'm pleased to be joined
by Edna Conway, Phil Venables,

4
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:11,690
and Bob Brese.

5
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:15,059
Our panelists are leaders
of security and resilience

6
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,910
at public companies and
government institutions,

7
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,240
builders or operators of arguably

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,689
the world's most complex infrastructure,

9
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:25,810
essential to national
defense, public safety

10
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:27,709
and economic growth.

11
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:29,780
We're gonna spend the
next 20 minutes or so,

12
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,180
asking our guests to talk

13
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:34,200
about their experiences,
managing resilience,

14
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,480
short and longterm.

15
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,930
We'll dig into the
complexities of cyber risk

16
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:41,670
as a conduit for other kinds of risks

17
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,920
and disruption in global supply chains

18
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,040
and end with their vision of
outcomes, downside protection

19
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,740
to improve enterprise's ability

20
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:53,103
to handle the next inevitable
punch to the supply chain

21
00:00:53,103 --> 00:00:56,083
and, or serve as a source
of competitive advantage.

22
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:59,580
Panelists, let's start
off with some questions

23
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:03,059
about the relationship between
resiliency and security.

24
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:06,360
So Edna, let's start
with you, why resilience?

25
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,429
You've moved from managing the
security of the supply chain

26
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:12,550
of one of the world's largest
providers of information

27
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:14,700
and communications technology,

28
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,140
to the responsibility for
the security and resilience

29
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:20,700
of Azure, Microsoft's
Intelligent Cloud platform.

30
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,710
A couple of questions to get started,

31
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:25,470
one, what were some of the challenges

32
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:28,980
that you've lived through in
the supply chain along the way

33
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:32,280
and two, how have they shaped
your view of the relationship

34
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,440
between resilience and security?

35
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,039
- So first let's recognize that we operate

36
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,210
really in a hyper-connected
world and third-party ecosystems

37
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:43,240
as you know so well continue to expand

38
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:48,240
but I think I'll, I'll ask you
to think about this with me,

39
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:52,370
I believe that we're
increasingly relying on platforms

40
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:55,820
and that in and of itself
adds additional opacity

41
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,369
to our third-party ecosystems.

42
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:00,560
To make that real we should ask ourselves,

43
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,500
what does ensuring a cloud
platform is secure and resilient,

44
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,380
actually require?

45
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,130
So to start, I think we have to agree

46
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:10,940
on what the words mean, for
me secure means to ensure

47
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:14,720
the integrity of every operation,
transaction and workflow

48
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,420
across that platform

49
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:19,809
and deliver that productivity,
free of compromise.

50
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:23,330
For me resiliency equals
proactively monitoring

51
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:25,910
and preparing for the wonderfulness

52
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:29,180
that the world brings
to our doorstep everyday

53
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:32,890
as we're doing this together,
not live in the same room

54
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:35,869
due to a global pandemic but do that

55
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:40,040
while seamlessly delivering
continuous quality and service.

56
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,140
So you asked about some
challenges that I faced

57
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:46,899
over the many decades
of, of work in this area

58
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,453
and I think I'll give you just three.

59
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,910
First, ITOT convergence in the
proliferation of IoT and IIoT

60
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,820
really require us to think
about the most effective ways

61
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:04,299
to drive security, to achieve
that continuous integrity

62
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,333
is the device used.

63
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:11,300
Look at the device, who is
involved in that device?

64
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,930
Here's an answer,

65
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:15,030
build security into
the integrated circuits

66
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:18,160
that go into those IoT and IIoT devices

67
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,140
and ensure continuous
integrity in allot monitoring.

68
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:23,130
One aspect of a real challenge

69
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:25,680
that we're all dealing with today.

70
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,890
I think the second one

71
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:31,239
is the challenge to develop
an architectural approach

72
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,210
to ensure that that richness

73
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:36,110
of that diverse third-party ecosystem

74
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:40,580
can really fully understand
what your desires are

75
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:44,200
and what the best controls
are to drive the outcome

76
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,350
of your goals and make
sure they're aligned with

77
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:50,170
and are actually addressing
your key security

78
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:51,623
and risk requirements.

79
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,470
And then I think the last
challenge is ensuring

80
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:59,870
that that same market
textual approach is flexible.

81
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:02,170
It can't be applied monolithically,

82
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:06,369
you know every day of the
week, we have new developers,

83
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:10,940
new technology, new
geographies, new opportunities,

84
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:13,720
so you cannot look at
it other than in a way

85
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,940
to have the elbow room is
what I like to call it,

86
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:20,440
so despite that ever
changing member and nature

87
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:24,810
of our third-party ecosystem,
we have to address changes

88
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:26,910
and those new service offerings,

89
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:31,530
despite the fact that we have
an architectural approach

90
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:32,969
and you know how I built that,

91
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:34,670
I built it in a variety of ways

92
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:37,060
but it's chapters that are flexible

93
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,853
and allow us to move quickly.

94
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:43,120
I think as a result where
we get to two, is this

95
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,950
because we're talking about resilience,

96
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,930
we talked for years about security

97
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:50,400
as if it operated in isolation.

98
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,039
We've moved now to a way of thinking

99
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,930
about physical security,
logical operational security

100
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:57,020
and all the other aspects

101
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,320
we'll talk a little bit about more,

102
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:03,409
I think this is our time to
make operational resilience

103
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:04,480
our new imperative.

104
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,940
It'll determine not only who will survive

105
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:11,110
but who's really gonna thrive
in this platform and economy

106
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:15,140
and to thrive, I've shifted
our messaging, our focus

107
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:19,370
and our efforts to make
operational resilience the goal,

108
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:21,560
sustaining business operations

109
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,613
during any major kind of event.

110
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:27,080
- Yeah, thank you for
that, I'm just taking notes

111
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,109
as I'm looking away

112
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:30,100
but you've talked about
operational resilience

113
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,380
being the new imperative
and I really like your point

114
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:35,420
about building integrity
and from the beginning.

115
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:38,960
I mean, that, that, the
proactive approach, reduces costs

116
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,430
I would have to think overall,

117
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:42,050
from the cleanup that needs to occur

118
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,420
but it's really thinking through that.

119
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:48,010
Bob as former CIO of Department of Energy

120
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:51,849
and the interim chief
information security officer,

121
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:53,400
an organization spanning academic

122
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,299
open research institutions,
as well as the responsibility

123
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:00,320
for nukes where Edna talks
about building in flexibility,

124
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,510
maybe you might not
have as much flexibility

125
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:05,659
when you talk about the
nuclear aspect of what we do.

126
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:06,810
Now, is there a difference

127
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:10,100
between the day-to-day
of operational resilience

128
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,900
when you're talking about
that industry, if you will

129
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,200
or focus and what it
takes to ensure resilience

130
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,210
on a longer timeframe

131
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:21,060
that you may be thinking about
quarterly versus annually?

132
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:26,100
- Yeah, thanks Jennifer and
I think Edna teed that up

133
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,300
really well about the complexity

134
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,130
and the ever-changing environment

135
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:33,140
and we know not all
challenges to resilience

136
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,640
are created equal

137
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,770
and those challenges come
from inside your organization

138
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:40,750
and they come from
outside your organization.

139
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:44,240
And on a day-to-day basis,
your teams are dealing

140
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,810
with small and large tactical
resilience issues every day,

141
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:51,640
whether it's responding to
vulnerability scan results,

142
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:55,700
the need to patch, responding
to brand challenges

143
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:58,099
and a myriad of other things.

144
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:01,830
But those actions usually
only address or resolve one

145
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:04,099
or a few specific tie points or threads

146
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:09,100
in this mesh of risks that
when viewed more holistically,

147
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:11,810
can really provide a much
more complete picture

148
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:14,053
of the company's overall resilience.

149
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:18,700
And strategic resilience really
requires a unity of effort

150
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:22,150
across the lines of business
and the supporting functions

151
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,789
rather than just these individual actions.

152
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:28,550
I mean, whether it's legal
or HR, finance, marketing,

153
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,490
IT and cybersecurity and more

154
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:35,180
and it's not synonymous with
just IT disaster recovery

155
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:38,410
or routine business continuity management

156
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:42,530
and more so it can't just
emerge from one department

157
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:46,590
and not emerge from another,
they've got to come together

158
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:50,340
but most of all as, as Edna articulated,

159
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:53,119
it is not independent of your position

160
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,683
in a multi-tiered ecosystem.

161
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:59,110
Now when it comes to strategic approaches

162
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:01,010
to operational resilience,

163
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:04,370
again, just like when you do
corporate strategic planning,

164
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:06,400
you don't really address only one

165
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,429
or limited set of lines
of business or functions

166
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:12,690
and you don't base your forward planning

167
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:15,020
on a single point in time.

168
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:17,260
You look at trends across multiple factors

169
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,450
and you might do scenario planning

170
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:22,170
and the same really goes with
your third-party relationships

171
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:26,090
and the impact of their third-party
relationships and so on.

172
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:28,500
I mean, you have to find
business capabilities

173
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,020
and you have to find business processes

174
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,579
and you have those things mapped
and it makes perfect sense

175
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,413
that you'd wanna have

176
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:37,212
your multi-tier supply
chain relationships mapped.

177
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:40,880
Likewise, you monitor those
processes for effectiveness

178
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,722
and efficiency.

179
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,770
On the IT side, we monitor
our cyber systems to make sure

180
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:50,020
that we're re remaining
secure and operationally safe.

181
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,400
And likewise, you should
be continuously monitoring

182
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,140
or as continuously as possible,

183
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,877
monitor your multi-tiered relationships

184
00:08:55,877 --> 00:09:00,877
and evaluate that data
longitudinally to identify trends.

185
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,520
And then finally, you can use that

186
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,430
to start to do some modeling

187
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:08,550
and model those
multi-tiered relationships,

188
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:11,670
evaluate the impact of
those potential scenarios

189
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:13,920
and develop some potential outcomes

190
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,189
as a result of that analysis

191
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:19,310
and then as a result of
that mapping, monitoring

192
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:22,689
and modeling, you can start to come up

193
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:25,060
with some, some preemptive

194
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:25,892
or

195
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,560
proactive steps that you
can take to mitigate risk

196
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,170
but also pre-stage some reactive responses

197
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:35,002
that you might take

198
00:09:35,003 --> 00:09:37,170
when some of those scenarios are realized.

199
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:39,760
- Yeah, I think really good
points and one of the things

200
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,630
that just struck me,
Phil as we look to you,

201
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:48,010
Bob talked about a lot of things
from a strategic standpoint

202
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:51,439
and we also tease him up to
talk about Department of Energy

203
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,190
in the nuclear side,
which is a very physical,

204
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:57,610
a lot of Edna's background is
a very physical supply chain,

205
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:59,460
having spent 20 years at one

206
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:02,140
of the world's premier
financial services organizations

207
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,000
responsible for cyber and corporate risk

208
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,170
and now security at Google Cloud,

209
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:07,910
a lot of what you've
actually had to focus on

210
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:09,360
is more of a digital supply chain

211
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,830
versus a physical supply chain.

212
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:14,810
So let's kinda shift from
being more the strategic

213
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:19,500
that Bob went through and talk
a little bit cross-industry,

214
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:24,100
what is your Goldman Sachs
past self, if you will,

215
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,910
asking your Google self to
do a little bit differently

216
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:30,242
in effort to helping achieve
and maintain resilience?

217
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:32,949
- I think it's interesting,

218
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:35,540
I mean, I think just stepping
aside for kind of a minute,

219
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:40,540
just thinking generally, most
major organizations now have

220
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:43,709
or are realizing that the cloud

221
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:47,300
or at least the hyperscale
of cloud providers like us

222
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:50,420
are less of a risk to be
managed and more of a means

223
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:53,010
of managing their security
and resiliency risk,

224
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:55,689
I mean, to, to the point
that Edna and Bob, and Bob

225
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:57,810
have made as, as well
is that when you think

226
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:00,030
about the innate resilience

227
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:02,510
of some of the global cloud platforms

228
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:05,080
from all but the largest of businesses

229
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,500
and even arguably, even the
very largest of businesses,

230
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,500
you'd be hard pressed to be able to tap in

231
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:16,490
to the degree of geographic, as physical,

232
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:19,330
as well as logical
resilience that you can get

233
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:22,750
in building on the cloud
platform in that way.

234
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:26,350
So I think, in my former role
and I think the same is true

235
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:29,960
for a lot of enterprise CISOs
and chief risk officers,

236
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:33,110
I think everybody's thought
is how to safely migrate

237
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:35,330
more things to the cloud to take advantage

238
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:38,800
of that, that inherent
security and resiliency

239
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,910
that comes with the economy
of scale as a cloud provider

240
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,770
but one of the things I, I...

241
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:48,699
my past role talking to my
current role is kind of exactly

242
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,270
the thing I've taken with me into Google,

243
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:55,079
which is this, this
constant focus every day

244
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,330
about how do we keep moving

245
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:01,350
from the shared responsibility
model of cloud customer

246
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:03,070
to cloud, or more to something

247
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:06,060
that we're increasingly
calling and having a mindset

248
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,780
of a shared fate approach

249
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:10,370
whereby we're reaching across that line

250
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:14,050
of shared responsibility and
providing better tooling,

251
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:18,689
better secure and resilient
defaults, blueprints and secured

252
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:22,670
and resilient landing zones
for customers to build on

253
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:23,650
and then increasingly,

254
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:26,900
not just to run operations in Google Cloud

255
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:29,329
but a lot more of our
products and capabilities

256
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:31,430
are about helping customers in any cloud,

257
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:35,219
as well as on-premise because
I think the ultimate challenge

258
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,440
again, in this world of thinking

259
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,140
about end-to-end operational resilience

260
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:43,390
for all customers business services,

261
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:45,569
has to recognize that
they're not just running

262
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:46,730
on one platform,

263
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:49,460
they're running on this
combination of platforms

264
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,850
plus their on-premise environment

265
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:55,800
and that's gonna change month
by month if not day by day

266
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,569
and overlaying operational
resilience on that

267
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:01,740
with more sophisticated
tooling and risk transparency

268
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,320
is gonna be a key thing
I think for all customers

269
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,340
and that's certainly what I
was driving for in my past role

270
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:10,140
and I'm certainly still
driving for in my current role.

271
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:10,973
- Yeah, I love that

272
00:13:10,973 --> 00:13:13,060
and I wanna stick with you for a second,

273
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,650
so we've kinda talked about
the platform perspective

274
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:16,520
and the laid out

275
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,949
and we talked more of
the strategic with Bob,

276
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:20,260
kinda pulling the thread a little bit

277
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,960
on some thing that you just talked about,

278
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,120
let's get the next
layer down, if you will,

279
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,510
as far as some of the supply
chain risks and complexity,

280
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:30,430
as actually Edna and Bob laid out as well,

281
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:34,609
they're multi-party,
multi-tier, most of the accounts

282
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:37,320
and I think Edna actually
said this, are pretty opaque

283
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:40,120
and they're beset by
multiple kinds of risks

284
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,410
where downstream supply chain exposure

285
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:46,319
could be just as devastating
as the direct risk

286
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,240
you feel yourselves.

287
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,230
We did a study a few months ago

288
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,063
and I don't know about you guys

289
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:53,400
but this whole year has
kind of run together for me,

290
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:57,130
so maybe six months ago,
where we got the response

291
00:13:57,130 --> 00:14:00,950
from 450 executives that
said only 2% of them

292
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:03,730
were really asking about
their, their second

293
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:06,350
or third tier supplier
in the financial world

294
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:08,720
that's your fourth and fifth party

295
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,440
and which was really surprising to me.

296
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:14,470
So I guess Phil continue
to pull that thread

297
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:16,770
on how do you think
organizations should think

298
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:20,390
about what risks come from
their fourth and fifth parties

299
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:23,020
and what other risks are you focused on

300
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:25,660
besides kinda just the cyber resilience

301
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:28,573
that can really manifest in
and disrupt what you're doing?

302
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:34,110
- Yeah, I mean the, when you
look at a digital supply chain

303
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:37,897
in particular, I mean, a
lot of organizations now,

304
00:14:37,897 --> 00:14:40,080
it's probably less for us as a platform

305
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:43,180
but for certainly for
a lot of our customers,

306
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:46,560
whether they're the so-called
digital native businesses

307
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,619
or major enterprises, are
increasingly a collection

308
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:54,100
of service providers, vendors
and software providers

309
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:58,290
and platforms inter-connected through APIs

310
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:02,810
and those vendors, to your
point, have their own vendors

311
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:05,050
that are your fourth parties and so on,

312
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:08,810
down to fifth and even
sixth parties and beyond.

313
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:11,000
And one of the things that's
increasingly challenging

314
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,640
for a lot of companies is,
is to get that visibility

315
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,960
and that's not just the
digital supply chain

316
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,947
but especially in the
physical supply chain

317
00:15:19,947 --> 00:15:23,120
for companies that are in
manufacturing, shipments

318
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:23,953
and other businesses

319
00:15:23,953 --> 00:15:26,800
where they have that physical
supply chain dependency,

320
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,650
understanding what's lurking out there

321
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:32,579
in those fourth and fifth
parties, again, not just for cyber

322
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:35,210
and resiliency in general,
but it could be other things

323
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:38,890
like legal and compliance
risks, related risks,

324
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:40,640
such as sanctions risk

325
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,470
and really understanding what's out there

326
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:46,310
in the supply chain and
continuously looking

327
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:51,099
at the scenarios that could
affect that supply chain

328
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:54,770
and making sure that the
organization is comfortable

329
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:56,500
from a risk tolerance perspective

330
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,840
with what scenarios could
impact the supply chain

331
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,330
and in fact, what
adjustments they need to do

332
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:04,240
to make that supply chain risk decrease

333
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,160
under a different range of scenarios

334
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,959
but fundamentally the, the,
the real kind of blocker

335
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:13,230
for a lot of this that I
think a lot of companies find

336
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:15,630
is just the insufficient transparency

337
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:18,200
beyond their immediate third parties,

338
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,420
especially for fourth
parties, where they otherwise

339
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,693
have a direct relationship with.

340
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:27,110
- I couldn't agree more and
Edna, I'm gonna come back to you

341
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:29,510
in a second but just to kind of tee it up,

342
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:31,840
you talked about the platforms

343
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,250
and we've been talking
about the multiple tiers,

344
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:37,090
so how do we start building agility

345
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:39,100
into what used to be more of a platform

346
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:42,070
and as Phil said, starting
to take into consideration

347
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:43,480
what adjustments need to be made,

348
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,523
so I'm coming to you in a second
but before I do that, Bob,

349
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:48,960
Phil just talked about the fact

350
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,660
that you're with multiple
service providers.

351
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,492
So

352
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:54,720
could you talk a minute

353
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,550
to, as hybrid or multi-cloud
ecosystems evolve

354
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,349
and direct visibility of the threats

355
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:02,040
like Phil was just going through

356
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,800
and vulnerabilities that protect,

357
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:07,450
potentially impact your
business is problematic

358
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:08,970
because you really can't see it,

359
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:11,060
how do you test for
that type of resilience?

360
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:14,280
And Phil just talked about scenarios,

361
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,619
we'd love for, to get
your perspective as well

362
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:19,399
about that whole "what ifs" perspective

363
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,670
that's needed to manage
risk in the multi-tiered,

364
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:24,140
multiparty relationships
that you outlined.

365
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,700
- Yeah, well, thanks, I didn't,

366
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:29,070
I was gonna jump on what Phil
was saying about scenarios

367
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:31,870
and as I had mentioned
scenario planning earlier,

368
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:36,580
is just that, you can build on techniques

369
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:41,199
that we've used in a number
of different operational areas

370
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,940
and I think you can do
detailed tabletop wargaming

371
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,100
or ultimately operational testing

372
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,870
of the decisions that you've made,

373
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:54,062
regarding your strategic
supply chain risks.

374
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:57,840
Now the amount of time and
effort that you spend in that,

375
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,179
should be commensurate
with the potential impact

376
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:03,880
on the business but we
conduct tabletop scenarios

377
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:08,120
for cyber security
risks on a routine basis

378
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:12,510
and probably most of the people
listening to this discussion

379
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:14,530
probably already do that.

380
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:17,010
Likewise, you probably periodically test

381
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:19,370
your business continuity management plans

382
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:21,729
and if you're not, you probably should be.

383
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:23,920
And the same thing goes with
supply chain resilience,

384
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:27,330
I mean, why wouldn't you
say, "Hey, what if I tabletop

385
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:28,449
some of these scenarios?"

386
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:31,640
And granted I may not
have deep understanding

387
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:35,320
of what's going on in my
fourth and fifth tier parties,

388
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,970
but I can make some assumptions

389
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:39,710
of, "Hey, well, what if this happened?"

390
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:42,710
And then we can, can walk through that

391
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:47,450
and make some assumptions
about how that might play out

392
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:49,670
and what responses we might wanna take

393
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:53,580
in the realization of that.

394
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:56,020
Now when it comes to operational testing,

395
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:58,320
I think that becomes much more complex

396
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,362
and a lot more detailed planning.

397
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:05,670
It requires you to identify,
pre-identify exercise halts

398
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:07,230
to prevent actual harm

399
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,810
and you might have to coordinate directly

400
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:11,760
with one or more of your third parties.

401
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:15,899
But if you have a supply chain
risk that is so critical,

402
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,680
that you feel you need
to operationally test it,

403
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,810
then that may be something
where you have to go outside

404
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:23,899
and get some additional
support in expertise

405
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:24,733
or,

406
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:29,290
I kinda jokingly say but go
hire a bunch of ex-military men

407
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:32,030
and women who had to do these
operational tests all the time

408
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:33,706
and see if they can help you.

409
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:36,290
But I think you can tabletop
and if ultimately necessary,

410
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:38,860
you could actually operationally test.

411
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,270
- Yeah, I think really good points.

412
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:44,410
I do think that there's not a lot of folks

413
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:46,870
that were actually, went to
school for supply chain risk

414
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:48,489
but to your point,
there's a lot of pulling

415
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:49,510
from other industries

416
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:52,280
because these aren't
necessarily new skillsets,

417
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,660
it's just a new way of thinking,

418
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:56,693
which I do think takes us back
to Edna where you started us,

419
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:01,933
can you tell us a little bit
about how to, as I mentioned,

420
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:05,300
Phil talked about adjustments
that need to be made,

421
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,330
the way even all the
years that we started,

422
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:09,290
people kinda had, you
need a model to follow

423
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:11,139
and it was, became a compliance activity

424
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,870
versus an operational resilience.

425
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:16,879
So talk to us a little bit about
how to organize for agility

426
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:19,860
and then how have you
actually built, aligned

427
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:22,729
and driven risk management
security initiatives

428
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:24,890
and evolve the, the organization's ability

429
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,500
'cause this isn't a silo anymore,

430
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,210
the enterprise needs to care,

431
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:33,070
so the organization's ability
to adapt and, and get ahead

432
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:35,760
of any sort of disruptions
that are just going to happen

433
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,960
and we know they're gonna happen,

434
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,390
even if we just pay attention

435
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:40,950
to the last 14 months of our lives.

436
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:44,370
- Absolutely, so look at,
I love threes and fours

437
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:49,370
so I think I'll leave you
four fundamental things

438
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:53,000
that we must do to get to secure and agile

439
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,370
because we require both of them

440
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:58,280
and one might be somewhat surprising

441
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:03,139
but I believe that we all have
to recognize that we must,

442
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:05,730
not we should, we must participate

443
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:07,440
in public private partnership

444
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,730
and international standard setting.

445
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:12,480
Without having a voice, the
nature of what can be posed

446
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:17,290
on the private sector can
effectively eliminate agility

447
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:20,920
and actually lead to a
suboptimal compliance culture

448
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,770
as we were just describing.

449
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:26,610
So get yourself at the table,
whether it's individually

450
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:28,830
or through an industry group

451
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:31,173
or at least be aware of what's going on.

452
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:37,180
I think the second thing is to
drive across your enterprise

453
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:40,360
and across your third-party ecosystem,

454
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:43,959
a culture of relentless
awareness and monitoring

455
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:47,040
of global events using
open-source intelligence,

456
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,860
information sharing
networks, heck use Bloomberg,

457
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:53,610
use business news because
playing catch-up three days late,

458
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:57,303
puts you squarely in the
deficit column on resilience.

459
00:21:58,404 --> 00:22:01,030
I think the other thing I'd
offer is, I'm gonna go back

460
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:03,310
to something that you know, Jennifer

461
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:05,649
is near and dear to my heart,

462
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:09,060
a comprehensive architectural approach.

463
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:11,210
And you have to do that
both on the security

464
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:13,030
and the operational resilience side,

465
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:16,850
so I started to talk about
this, let me refresh,

466
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:19,870
when I say a comprehensive
approach to security,

467
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:22,280
I think you have to
include physical security,

468
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:25,680
logical operational security,
behavioral security,

469
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:30,350
information security, IP
protection and privacy.

470
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:32,860
And those have to flow together

471
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:36,062
along with an approach to
risk management and resilience

472
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:37,610
that allows you to focus

473
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:41,350
on what is essential to
continuing your operations

474
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:45,449
for your enterprise or government
in a world-class manner.

475
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:49,070
And for us, I've evaluated that
after a short period of time

476
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:52,040
here at Microsoft and
that includes for us,

477
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,870
business continuity and disaster recovery

478
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:58,510
but it also includes world-class
programs like anti-bribery

479
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:01,410
and anti-corruption, human
rights and labor rights,

480
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:04,400
health and safety,
environmental sustainability

481
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,150
and intriguingly important,
trade and export controls

482
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:10,707
that tells you what you can
and can't do with technology

483
00:23:10,707 --> 00:23:13,103
in a variety of limited ways.

484
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:17,040
But I'll leave, leave us with something

485
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,500
that I think is, for
those of us who grew up

486
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:23,733
in operations particularly
and know supply chain so well,

487
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,570
I've sort of lifted and
shifted into security,

488
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:30,399
something that is a
concept from supply chain.

489
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:35,400
So it was done by Professor
Hau L. Lee back in 2004 or so,

490
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:37,530
the Triple-A Supply Chain

491
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:39,850
and let me share what those three A's are;

492
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:44,199
an agile, an adaptable,
an aligned supply chain.

493
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,430
I think we need to take that

494
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:46,450
and actually weave it
(pet growling)

495
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:49,420
into our approach to
operational resilience

496
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:52,020
and I apologize there's
a four-legged creature

497
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:55,010
who is now letting me
know that he also believes

498
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:57,129
that we need to be
operational and resilient

499
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:59,150
and apparently at the
moment we are not engaging

500
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:01,760
into his level of satisfaction.

501
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,500
So how that plays out

502
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,820
is operational resilience
is built on action;

503
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,649
going and listening to
(murmurs), find out everything

504
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:12,500
they all, all does, find
out what the third parties

505
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,820
and the fourth parties
do to the extent you can

506
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,740
and keep going across your enterprise

507
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:21,080
then narrow that down to a
set of what I call activities.

508
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:26,080
Your controls should be based,
not on who, not on where

509
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:30,100
but on what and what is
defined by a set of parameters

510
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,260
that then include who and where.

511
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:35,530
Don't be monolithic, build
your architecture flexibly

512
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:37,330
around those activities,

513
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:39,939
so that not every one of your controls

514
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:42,830
or requirements applies to
everything and everyone,

515
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:44,889
regardless of what they're doing.

516
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:47,040
Come up with a well mapped
alignment of activity

517
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,720
to risk to control, it'll serve you well

518
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:53,470
when you need to swiftly
change and it allow you

519
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:55,960
to engage in that flexibility
we've all talked about

520
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,980
as change happens.

521
00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:00,370
I mean, how many of us had
AI controls 30 years ago?

522
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:02,879
Let's be honest, we didn't.

523
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:07,080
And then also align holistically,
apply your model flexibly

524
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,350
but ensure that you're applying it,

525
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:13,010
not only to your third parties
and your fourth parties

526
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:16,620
and your fifth parties but look inside.

527
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:19,796
I'm really a big fan of
the opposite of the mantra,

528
00:25:19,797 --> 00:25:21,600
"Do what I say, not what I do",

529
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,610
I want you to do what I do

530
00:25:24,781 --> 00:25:28,210
in a way that achieves
the goal for your business

531
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:32,630
and each of the subsequent
suppliers downstream

532
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:35,780
so that we can come to realize

533
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:39,030
an approach that allows us to
live in the world we live in.

534
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:43,370
It's a platform, but let's be
clear, it's a world of "we",

535
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:45,600
the whole concept of an "us and them",

536
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,530
it doesn't work anymore.

537
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:50,570
So that's where I'd like to
get us to as work together

538
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:54,560
to achieve the ultimate goal
of operational resilience.

539
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,690
- I love that, thank you

540
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:57,660
and no worry about the four-legged person,

541
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:00,010
that's kind of the world we live in.

542
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:02,720
Before we leave this multiple party,

543
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,770
multiple tier conversation,
Phil, we've talked a lot

544
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:09,570
about the individual businesses themselves

545
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:12,830
and the direct risks and one
of the provocative statements

546
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:14,730
or conversations I've had recently

547
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:18,600
is around the fact that we've
all had this aha moment,

548
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,120
that we're all somebody's,
somebody else's third-party.

549
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,709
So as much as we're talking
about having these frameworks

550
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:25,150
and looking outside of ourselves,

551
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:27,630
we're actually a third-party
to somebody else,

552
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:30,520
so real quick as we close this out,

553
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,030
can you give us a couple of thoughts

554
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:33,730
about just how folks should be thinking

555
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:36,650
about their third parties or themselves

556
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:39,460
as a conduit of risk that you actually

557
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:42,290
don't have to have compromised
technology installed

558
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:44,700
in your environment to be the victim

559
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,440
or the, the enabler of the attack,

560
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,493
you could actually be almost
like a pawn in what's going on?

561
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:55,070
- Yeah, so I think all companies need

562
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:58,580
to, exactly to your
point, not just look down

563
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:00,080
into their supply chain

564
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,790
but recognize they've,
they've got an upstream

565
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,210
as well as a downstream

566
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:08,620
and you have to manage, manage upstream

567
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:10,929
and support your customers

568
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:14,270
and provide the right
degree of risk transparency

569
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:15,530
so that they can fill

570
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:19,283
their own supply chain risk
responsibilities as well.

571
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:23,149
I think there's a lot of compliance

572
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:28,030
and industry certification
frameworks that are useful

573
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:30,520
and usable for that respect

574
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:33,280
but arguably, they don't go far enough

575
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,050
and I think there's a big part

576
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:38,750
of various parts of the
industry are working on ways

577
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:41,260
to bring more risk transparency into that

578
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:45,480
and also not just around
physical supply chains

579
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:49,280
and the vendor ecosystem
but even in, in so far

580
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:52,260
as the, the open-source community as well.

581
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:55,493
When we talk about software
supply chain risks,

582
00:27:55,493 --> 00:27:56,810
I think we've been focused,

583
00:27:56,810 --> 00:27:58,700
the industry's been
focused on other things,

584
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:03,220
given recent events but
we also need to remember

585
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:05,350
that before that one of the bigger risks

586
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,750
was how do we think about
open-source software

587
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:10,880
in everybody's environments
and so one of the reasons

588
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,620
that we and other companies,

589
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:15,320
for example founded the
open-source security foundation,

590
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:18,312
was to keep addressing that
and actually bring mechanisms

591
00:28:18,313 --> 00:28:23,313
for scoring and risk scoring
various open-source projects,

592
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:25,290
I think as well, there's a lot of work

593
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:28,120
that can still be done and
we're certainly looking forward

594
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,669
to partnering with all the other vendors

595
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:32,880
on how do we provide
transparency in scoring

596
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,940
onto all of the software supply chain

597
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:38,910
and I think that's gonna be
a big emphasis in the future

598
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:39,790
but generally speaking,

599
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:42,810
I think everybody has a
responsibility to be a better vendor

600
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:45,399
to their customers to help
them manage their risk

601
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,700
and not just in transparency

602
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:49,720
but also adhering to open standards,

603
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:52,770
adhering to supporting their
operational resilience goals

604
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:55,627
of substitutability, of, of resiliency

605
00:28:55,627 --> 00:28:57,040
and the ability to migrate

606
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,550
to different products and services,

607
00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:01,370
not just within that provider
but other providers as well.

608
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:03,689
So I think as everybody figures out

609
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:05,740
how to do operational resilience,

610
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,560
it's not just about, as we talked about,

611
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:11,159
not just about disaster
recovery and redundancy,

612
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:15,440
it's also about taking a
business service view end-to-end

613
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,030
across the supply chain and
thinking about substitutability

614
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:21,240
as well as innate resilience.

615
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,050
- Yeah, I couldn't agree
more and I do think

616
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:26,399
that this sudden immersion
into work from home,

617
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,760
we just all realized how
connected and reliant we all were

618
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,629
on each other and I
think that that's where

619
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:33,690
some of these conversations come from.

620
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:35,360
I think we're almost up against time,

621
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,010
so I'm just gonna ask
everybody if they could keep it

622
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:40,254
to 60 seconds or so, last question and...

623
00:29:40,255 --> 00:29:41,310
(Jennifer clearing throat)
excuse me, sorry,

624
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:42,790
I'm just gonna just open it up

625
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:43,953
to all three of you,

626
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:47,760
given the hyper, and actually
kind of a little bit of a rip

627
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,120
from the headlines based on, Phil

628
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,360
what you were just talking about

629
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,699
but given the
hyper-connectivity of business

630
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:57,220
in the world we live
in, what are we learning

631
00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:01,470
about resilience from Sunburst
that has kept all of us,

632
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:02,900
well, we all got asked about it

633
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,880
and I know it's definitely
kept us here at Interos

634
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,690
pretty busy over the months.

635
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:08,880
So what have we learned about resilience

636
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,920
and how just connected we all are

637
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:14,070
and how one business
event and our partners

638
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:16,669
can be used as a conduit to each one of us

639
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:18,310
and then a little bit provocative

640
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:21,926
but what do you think
the government's role is

641
00:30:21,926 --> 00:30:23,730
in enforcing resilience

642
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:26,200
for the largest too-big-to-fail providers?

643
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,410
And Bob, I'm actually gonna start with you

644
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:31,560
and then go to Phil and we'll
let Edna have the last word

645
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,633
'cause I really enjoy Edna's last word.

646
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:38,080
- Excellent, well, I think
we've covered a number of things

647
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,280
and I think Sunburst really shows

648
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:44,200
that these things about what
risks do we need to think about

649
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,370
in our supply chain

650
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:48,179
and for overall organizational resilience

651
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,570
and the scenario planning
and things like that.

652
00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:55,570
And so really digging hard and
thinking hard about finance

653
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:58,740
and cybersecurity and
regulatory and geopolitical

654
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,660
or business and operational risk

655
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:04,640
and ethical sourcing and
governance, Edna raised that,

656
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,520
really thinking hard about those things

657
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,830
with respect to your supply chain.

658
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:10,361
I mean,

659
00:31:10,362 --> 00:31:13,750
in the end, critical infrastructure

660
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:16,730
and the defense industrial
base have a number of laws

661
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:20,010
and regulations that
are already being used

662
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:25,010
to try to shore up any potential
gaps in the supply chain

663
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:27,560
for those, those critical areas.

664
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,500
But I think that Sunburst

665
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,450
while it's the most recent wake-up call,

666
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:32,950
is hardly our first experience

667
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:34,910
in what you might call
a supply chain attack

668
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:37,250
and it, it's not gonna be the last.

669
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:41,710
And so I think again, kinda
to riff off of what Edna said

670
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:43,130
and what Phil has said,

671
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:45,840
that it's going to take a unity of effort

672
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:49,080
between individual governments,

673
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:52,159
global government
organizations and industry

674
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:56,660
to identify methodologies
and acceptable means

675
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:59,290
to share information so
that we can join together

676
00:32:00,321 --> 00:32:02,360
to manage this risk.

677
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,959
- Perfect, Phil, 60 seconds.

678
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,840
- Yeah, I mean, so just focusing
in on this specific piece

679
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:11,879
about the role of government
in enforcing resilience

680
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:15,130
and then I think the cloud
providers have a responsibility

681
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:17,780
to provide the resilience
required by their customers

682
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:20,879
and government is, is one of many,

683
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,500
albeit a very significant
customer for, for these services,

684
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:27,810
so they, they can and do
stipulate requirements

685
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:28,950
in that way today

686
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:31,410
and it's not just the
requirements to do contracts,

687
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:33,679
it's the various rules and regulations

688
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:36,190
that we already have to abide by,

689
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:39,450
so I think there's already
been quite a high degree

690
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:43,010
of kinda forceful requirements
in, in a good way,

691
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:45,100
it's also the responsibility of customers

692
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:47,399
to take advantage of the resilience

693
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,830
that comes out of the cloud

694
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:51,210
and take advantage of
particularly the geographic

695
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:54,100
and other service diversity
but I think the other thing

696
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:56,760
that's also gonna be interesting to see

697
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,970
and again, I touched on this earlier,

698
00:32:57,970 --> 00:33:00,840
when you think about operational
resilience in general,

699
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:03,280
what does it mean for customers,

700
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,670
including government
customers to take advantage

701
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:08,510
of multiple cloud services
based on open standards

702
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:12,580
so that we have an overall
reduction in concentration risk,

703
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:17,330
literally taking advantage of
the high number of platforms

704
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:20,240
that have significant levels of resilience

705
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,980
that together can, can generally reduce

706
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,990
concentration risk overall.

707
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:28,270
And I would say it's, I'll
close in the same way I opened,

708
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:30,612
I think people as a result of all of this

709
00:33:30,612 --> 00:33:34,430
are realizing quite
significantly that the cloud

710
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:37,600
is less of a risk to be
managed like it used to be

711
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:41,510
and now a key part of how organizations

712
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:43,770
are going to keep
mitigating their security

713
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:44,780
and resiliency risk.

714
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:46,889
- Well, it's active engagement, right?

715
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:48,280
It's leaning into it like you said,

716
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,730
taking an advantage of what's available

717
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:51,470
versus just doing a checklist.

718
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:53,290
Edna, bring us home.

719
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:56,220
- So I'm gonna spin us positively.

720
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:58,210
I'm gonna say the answer to your question

721
00:33:58,210 --> 00:33:59,500
is that we have an opportunity

722
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,970
to actually drive the power of the cloud

723
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:04,130
and the power of innovation
in what we're learning

724
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:06,150
in connected supply chains,

725
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:08,320
to equate with competitive advantage.

726
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,960
Speed to market, earning customer trust,

727
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,730
retaining customer loyalty and stickiness,

728
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:16,210
fast and more thorough
response to incidents

729
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:19,429
with minimal to no
customer service impact,

730
00:34:19,429 --> 00:34:22,949
heck, even impactless updates
to the cloud infrastructure

731
00:34:22,949 --> 00:34:26,139
and a holistic lens across that ecosystem

732
00:34:26,139 --> 00:34:29,889
provides a more united approach,
it allows the enterprise

733
00:34:29,889 --> 00:34:33,469
and the government together,
to avoid the gotchas,

734
00:34:33,469 --> 00:34:36,719
arising from the lack
of cross-organizational,

735
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:40,332
cross-supply chain,
cross-agency visibility.

736
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:43,120
- I love it, just thinking about it,

737
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,239
could we have had this
conversation 10 years ago

738
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:47,520
and could we have ended that
active in that positive.

739
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:51,270
So Edna, Bob and Phil,
I wanna thank all of you

740
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:53,130
for sharing your insights with us today

741
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:56,440
and honestly being so candid,
especially on that last one.

742
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,540
Everyone, I'm hoping you enjoyed

743
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:00,020
the perspectives you heard today

744
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:02,990
and that you have tangible
actions to implement,

745
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:05,750
if not, you definitely have
three luminaries in front of you

746
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:09,500
to follow up on and we'll
actually be participating

747
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:12,420
in a live and interactive
Q&A right after this session,

748
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:14,340
so if you'd like to talk
more about the themes,

749
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:17,380
ask any questions, have any
conversation about the topics

750
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:19,330
you've just heard, please come join us.
