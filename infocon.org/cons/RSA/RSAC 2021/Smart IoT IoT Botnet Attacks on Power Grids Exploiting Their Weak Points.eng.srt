00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:04,750
- Hello everyone, welcome to our talk

2
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:07,740
which is entitled Smart IoT,

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,230
IoT Botnet Attacks on Power Grids

4
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:13,213
Exploiting Their Weak Points.

5
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:18,380
So let's start with the Smart IoT team.

6
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:23,380
I'm Tohid Shekari, a PhD
candidate at ECE Georgia Tech.

7
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,220
And this is a joint work

8
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,990
with my PhD advisor, Dr. Raheem Beyah

9
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:31,540
who is leading the communication assurance

10
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:34,323
and performance group in Georgia Tech.

11
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:39,750
Now before explaining
the attack and the issue,

12
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,194
I would like to start
with a brief background

13
00:00:43,194 --> 00:00:46,660
on the power grid structure.

14
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:50,269
Generally, every power
grid has three main sectors

15
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:52,650
which are called the generation sector,

16
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:55,193
transmission sector and
distribution sector.

17
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:57,760
In the generation sector,

18
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,360
we generate a major portion
of the energy required

19
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,930
by the customers and the end users,

20
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,910
by big power plants such
as nuclear power plants

21
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:11,560
or wind farms or the solar farms.

22
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,510
And then we transmit the power

23
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:18,510
and energy over long distances
using the transmission lines.

24
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:22,182
And finally, in the distribution section,

25
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:26,403
we distribute the energy
among the end users.

26
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:34,050
Like any other industrial
control system and big system,

27
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:37,160
power grid has its own monitoring

28
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:40,360
and control network which is called

29
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:44,730
the supervisory control and
data acquisition system.

30
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:47,870
So basically, in this computer network

31
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:52,540
or monitoring and control
network for the power grid,

32
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:54,750
we have multiple substations

33
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:58,320
in which we have the monitoring devices

34
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,130
and also the control devices.

35
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:04,399
So the monitoring devices
such as the measurements,

36
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,330
such as voltage sensors
and current sensors

37
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:10,940
are polling the measurements
in these substations

38
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:14,650
and they are returning back the readings

39
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:16,780
to the control center,

40
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:21,320
and the control center
processes those information

41
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:27,570
and they have some automated
tools or human operators

42
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,010
to decide about the control actions

43
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:32,739
to be implemented in the substations.

44
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:37,740
The control actions could be
switching some circuit switches

45
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:42,210
or even changing the
configuration of the system,

46
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:46,270
or increasing or decreasing
the power generated

47
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:48,470
by different power plants

48
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:51,283
to meet the new requirements of the grid.

49
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:59,130
So, with the explosion of the computation

50
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:02,600
and communication
technologies in recent years,

51
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:06,440
the concept of smart
grid has been introduced.

52
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,079
Smart grid is the old grid

53
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:14,080
in which we have the integration
of the recent advances

54
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,530
in the computation and communication.

55
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,660
This obviously leaded

56
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:24,660
to a better management of
the system, cheaper energy,

57
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,160
but at the same time,

58
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,740
because we digitalized everything

59
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:32,530
and we made everything smart,

60
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:34,940
we increased the attack vector

61
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,773
to cybercriminals around the world.

62
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,697
Now let's talk about the IoT botnets.

63
00:03:44,996 --> 00:03:48,840
So IoT botnets were seriously introduced

64
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,840
by the discovery of the
Mirai botnet in August 2016

65
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:59,359
and it included more than
600,000 compromised devices.

66
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,010
And this botnet was mainly
used to indirectly attack

67
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:08,170
the other domains, such as
the Brian Krebs' website.

68
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:11,880
And in this website the Mirai botnet

69
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:16,106
was used to do the
distributed denial-of-service

70
00:04:16,107 --> 00:04:19,990
just to make it out of the reach of the,

71
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:22,343
like users in the web.

72
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:27,719
And after this Mirai botnet,

73
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,240
there were some modern variants of it

74
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,490
that were introduced in recent years,

75
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:35,803
such as LuaBot, Hajime, and BrickerBot.

76
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,419
Now let's talk about
the power grid attacks.

77
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,600
So generally for the power grid,

78
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,250
we have three main types of attacks.

79
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,820
In the first type of the attack,

80
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:52,310
the attacker might target
the local controllers

81
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:54,470
of the standalone devices.

82
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:56,290
The local controllers could be

83
00:04:56,290 --> 00:05:00,070
programmable logic controllers or PLCs,

84
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:03,380
or the remote terminal units or RTUs.

85
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:06,330
And these devices are embedded devices

86
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:11,219
to control the operation of
standalone devices in power grid

87
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:14,110
such as generators, transformers,

88
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:16,423
circuit breakers or switches.

89
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,960
In another type of attack,

90
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,659
the attacker might target the SCADA system

91
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,700
or the computer network

92
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:28,700
that is used for monitoring
and controlling the power grid.

93
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:33,790
And finally, we have the indirect
attacks on the power grid.

94
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,200
For example, the attacker might try

95
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:40,753
to do the load altering
attacks using the botnet,

96
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:43,420
and we're gonna explain it

97
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:46,773
in the next few slides what it means.

98
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,200
Now for each of the attacks,

99
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:56,920
let's bring up some
examples to see what we had,

100
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:00,093
what historical cases we had so far.

101
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,423
Regarding the first type of attack,

102
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:07,902
attacking the controllers
of standalone devices,

103
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,280
we have the Aurora attack

104
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:15,280
which was introduced in 2007
by Idaho National Laboratory.

105
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:17,543
And in this attack,

106
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:20,910
there's a computer worm

107
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:24,240
that is infecting the
controller of the generator.

108
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,260
It is opening the circuit
breaker of the generator

109
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:30,409
and then closing it at the right moment,

110
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:33,060
to cause a huge mechanical tension

111
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,160
in the rotor of the generator.

112
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,960
And this finally leads to the
explosion of the generator

113
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,270
and the destruction of
this piece of equipment.

114
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,530
So it was a serious threat,

115
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:48,032
which was discovered
and introduced in 2007.

116
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:52,420
From the second type of attacks

117
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:56,130
that the attackers
target the SCADA system.

118
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:58,920
We have many historical cases.

119
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:03,350
Some of the notable ones
are Dragonfly version 2

120
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:05,223
and BlackEnergy version 3.

121
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:07,979
In Dragonfly version 2,

122
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:11,580
the attackers targeted
several utility companies

123
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:15,980
in the United States,
Turkey and Switzerland

124
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:19,380
and caused regional blackouts.

125
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:23,659
So there were many people
who lost power for many hours

126
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,690
because of these attacks.

127
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:28,800
And in BlackEnergy 3 is,

128
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,800
the most famous actually malware
targeted the SCADA system,

129
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:37,070
it was used to target and took the,

130
00:07:37,071 --> 00:07:41,400
for targeting and taking
down the Ukrainian power grid

131
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,370
in December 2015 and December 2016.

132
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:50,370
And these two attacks were
the most notable attacks

133
00:07:51,933 --> 00:07:53,409
on the power grid so far.

134
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:55,330
And it was after these attacks

135
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:59,099
that the power grid security
started to gain attention

136
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:04,022
from the researchers
and the practitioners.

137
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:09,123
Regarding the indirect
attacks on the power grid,

138
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,150
it was before thought that
we don't have any control

139
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:18,349
to the end users and the power
consumption of the end users.

140
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:22,460
But after the introduction
of the IoT botnets,

141
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:27,060
we noticed that the attacker
might try to compromise

142
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,790
a bunch of high-wattage IoT devices,

143
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:34,330
such as electric ovens,
HVAC systems, water heaters

144
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:38,780
and then turn them on or off
maliciously at the same time,

145
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:41,589
to cause technical problems in the grid.

146
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:43,559
So this attack is called

147
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:47,719
a manipulation of demand IoT or MadIoT.

148
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,300
And it was first introduced

149
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:52,413
in USENIX Security Symposium in 2018.

150
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,610
So basically, in this case the attacker

151
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:59,010
targets the bulk power grid

152
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:03,250
and it tries to turn on
the compromised devices

153
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:07,680
at the same time from random
nodes or location in the grid,

154
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,300
to cause technical problems

155
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,589
such as frequency instability
and voltage instability,

156
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:17,590
and finally lead the
grid towards instability

157
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:20,060
and blackout.

158
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,652
Actually in this research,

159
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:27,890
in the research that was
presented in USENIX security,

160
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:32,060
the authors showed that
how this attack can cause

161
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,640
larger scale problems

162
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:38,563
and long-term outages in the power grid.

163
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:45,189
But one year later, another
group of researchers came in,

164
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:49,340
in the same symposium,
USENIX symposium 2019

165
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:53,280
and presented not everything
is dark and gloomy.

166
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,390
Basically they claimed
that it's not as dark

167
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:58,703
as it was presented before.

168
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,569
Because some of the existing

169
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:04,380
and embedded power
system protection schemes

170
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,620
such as under frequency load shedding,

171
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:09,833
under voltage load shedding
or other controllers,

172
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:13,240
were ignored in the previous research,

173
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,780
and if we model them properly

174
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:19,030
and include them properly in the grid,

175
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:23,459
it can withstand against
the MadIoT attacks

176
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,670
and prevent the system

177
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:27,293
from larger scale collapse or blackout.

178
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:31,300
So if we launched the attack randomly,

179
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,870
from random nodes on location,

180
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:36,370
it was shown that it's not as effective

181
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:39,650
as it was shown in most of the cases.

182
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:44,063
So we won't see that much of
serious problems in the grid.

183
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,510
Now let's take a look

184
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:51,160
at the some of the
recent natural blackouts

185
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:54,380
that happened in different
countries around the world.

186
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:58,040
Obviously we have so many blackouts

187
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,973
happening in recent years,

188
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:04,850
but the point is that they happen,

189
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:06,970
although they are
affecting a lot of people

190
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:09,020
but they happen quite rarely

191
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:11,410
like in every year or every two year,

192
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:14,880
every three year we
have a serious blackout

193
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,900
and largest scale blackout.

194
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,860
The reason that these are rarely happening

195
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:24,230
is that the natural events
usually do not happen

196
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:27,970
in the weak nodes, from
the stability perspective.

197
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:30,310
For example, if we have hundred nodes

198
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:33,582
or hundred locations in the entire grid,

199
00:11:33,582 --> 00:11:37,310
if the event happens in vulnerable node,

200
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:39,089
it might lead to instability,

201
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:42,930
but from a probabilistic point of view,

202
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:44,823
this usually doesn't happen.

203
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,459
But if we think about it,

204
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:51,262
if we know the weak nodes of a power grid

205
00:11:51,262 --> 00:11:53,479
of a given power grid,

206
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:57,140
can we somehow mimic these primary causes

207
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:01,910
to cause blackout in
the grid intentionally?

208
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:05,900
Like, can an attacker
create this intentionally

209
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,939
and target the weak nodes?

210
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:12,870
In this case, we can cause
blackout in any given grid

211
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:15,393
more frequently and more maliciously.

212
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:22,830
So let's talk about the
threat model of our research

213
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,250
which is Smart IoT.

214
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:28,040
So we're claiming that
instead of launching

215
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:32,082
the MadIoT attack from random nodes

216
00:12:32,082 --> 00:12:34,439
that was previously proposed

217
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:39,060
in the two previous
USENIX security papers.

218
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:43,839
We can change the load in
specific nodes or locations,

219
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:47,351
and we showed that if we do this,

220
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:50,453
it turns out to be more catastrophic.

221
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:54,890
Because we can choose this specific nodes

222
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:56,860
from the stability perspective,

223
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,380
we can choose the nodes

224
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:04,660
that have weaker or
lower stability margins

225
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:07,762
from the frequency stability
and voltage stabilities,

226
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:11,810
and target the grid
from those perspective,

227
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:15,520
but obviously we need
some more information.

228
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,810
So instead of the previous works

229
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:21,150
that they randomly just
turned down the devices

230
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:23,390
without looking at the grid data,

231
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:27,210
here we need detailed information
about the grid operation

232
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:30,790
to find out about those
specific weak nodes.

233
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:33,900
And also, our botnet should be distributed

234
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:38,180
among all the nodes in the
geographical area in the grid

235
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:41,140
so that we, if we identified

236
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:44,760
or when we identified the
weak nodes in the grid,

237
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,300
we can target those points.

238
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:50,069
So these are the two main requirements

239
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:52,893
of our attack to be successful.

240
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,200
So Smart IoT has two main stage,

241
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,850
in the first stage,

242
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:02,980
we need to obtain the topology of the grid

243
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:06,860
which can be represented
by roughly by graph.

244
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:10,960
In this topology, we have
some vertices and edges.

245
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:15,280
Each vertex actually represents a node,

246
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,120
and in the bulk power grid,

247
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,610
each node represents a big city

248
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:24,830
or a big power plant
or anything like that.

249
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:29,351
So we can obviously estimate
the graph of the grid

250
00:14:29,351 --> 00:14:33,320
by using reconnaissance tools or,

251
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,980
and this can be done offline

252
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,130
because the graph of the grid

253
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:39,520
needs to be obtained for only one type.

254
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,793
It doesn't change.

255
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:45,550
Because you cannot like change
the big transmission lines

256
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:48,699
or power plants or anything like that.

257
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:52,280
And this can be done
with semi-automatic ways.

258
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:56,060
For example, you can use
the satellite pictures

259
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:02,700
and use the computer vision
approaches to obtain this graph.

260
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:06,270
And there are some of
existing open source tools

261
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:08,773
to obtain this with very high accuracy.

262
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:13,190
And the reason that this is feasible

263
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:17,390
is because that in the bulk power grid,

264
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:18,740
everything is outdoor.

265
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:21,540
Like, you cannot hide the power plant,

266
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,882
you cannot hide a big transmission line.

267
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:31,030
So, the second thing in the first stage

268
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:35,750
is that we need to obtain
the power grid operation data

269
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:39,430
and map this operation
data to the obtained graph

270
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:42,040
to see in which node of the system

271
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,599
or in which node of the graph

272
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,363
we have how much of power
generation and consumption.

273
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:51,459
So this can be easily done by
crawling the ISO's websites

274
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:54,140
or independent system operators website,

275
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:58,853
or using a trading tool
called Bloomberg terminal.

276
00:16:00,216 --> 00:16:04,550
And for example, this graph
here shows the snapshot

277
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:06,790
of the New York ISO website.

278
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:10,150
You can see from different locations,

279
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:13,010
we know how much power is generated

280
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:14,810
and how much power is consumed.

281
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:18,670
So you can map this data
to the obtained graph

282
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:22,300
and then you have the entire model

283
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:25,733
or real-time operation
data of the power grid.

284
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:29,250
Once you obtain this data,

285
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:32,980
you can then do your system analysis stage

286
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:35,560
and move on to the second stage.

287
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,810
And with some mathematical calculations,

288
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:39,489
you can rank the system nodes

289
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:42,160
from the stability perspective.

290
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,949
So during this ranking,

291
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:47,260
the system nodes is very hard to do

292
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:49,530
in real-time with exact way,

293
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:53,120
because we have high
dimensional nonlinear equations.

294
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,070
But there are some approximation
methods in the literature

295
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:59,240
which helps you to do that very fast.

296
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,480
For example, we use two well-known indexes

297
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,910
called voltage magnitude
and modal analysis

298
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:07,440
to rank the system nodes

299
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,329
and obtain the weakest nodes of the grid

300
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:14,403
to launch the MadIoT
attack from those nodes.

301
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,190
Now let's talk about
the attack feasibility

302
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:24,190
and see if this attack is
feasible or it's not realistic.

303
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:29,260
So the first point that
we should talk about

304
00:17:31,662 --> 00:17:33,613
is from the IoT botnet perspective.

305
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:37,150
The historical botnet such as Mirai botnet

306
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:40,800
and its variants had over 600,000 bots

307
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:45,250
and also IoT botnets
are available for rent

308
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:48,540
and also their renting and building cost

309
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:51,230
is very low and negligible.

310
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:54,120
So these, according to these points

311
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:58,423
we know that IoT botnets can
be easily generated or rented.

312
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:03,320
Also about the second assumption,

313
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:07,620
do we have a geographical
distributed IoT botnet?

314
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,139
So if you look at this figure

315
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:11,630
which shows the geographical distribution

316
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:12,943
of the Mirai botnet,

317
00:18:12,943 --> 00:18:15,800
we can see that it's been distributed

318
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:19,540
among all the geographical
areas around the world.

319
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:23,899
So we can target almost
any power grid that we want

320
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:27,770
in the United States and in
the European Union countries

321
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:29,473
and even in Asian countries.

322
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:34,360
And how we can geolocate
the bots as an attacker.

323
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:38,179
So this can be trivially done
by using the IP addresses

324
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:40,640
because there are some tools,

325
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,573
available tools that
with very high accuracy,

326
00:18:44,573 --> 00:18:49,573
you can geolocate a given
bot with the IP address.

327
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:56,840
The second consideration
is about the end user.

328
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,463
Like if we use this kind of attack,

329
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:02,950
what would be the effect of this

330
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:06,060
on the billing statement of the houses,

331
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:11,060
smart houses that have some
compromised devices in them.

332
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:13,610
We claim that this is quite negligible,

333
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:18,179
according to our analysis the
additional billing statement

334
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:21,990
would be something between 0.1% to 0.3%

335
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,110
in the United States,

336
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,629
which is quite unnoticeable,

337
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:27,980
like imagine that you're
paying hundred dollars

338
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:32,590
to your electricity bill.

339
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:35,870
And in case that you have
some compromised devices

340
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:38,860
and the attacker uses them
to attack the power grid,

341
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:41,909
in the next month it's
gonna be something like

342
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:46,490
hundred dollars and like 10
cents or something like that,

343
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:48,603
which is quite unnoticeable.

344
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:51,310
And in the worst case scenario,

345
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:55,440
if you notice about the
attack in your smart home,

346
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,610
if you notice that there are
some devices in your home

347
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:01,439
that are showing like weird behaviors,

348
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,503
a short-term period behaviors,

349
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:08,260
you might like, detect
them, but it's very hard.

350
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:11,120
Because the attack duty
cycle is very small,

351
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,030
like 10 seconds, it usually
takes like 10 seconds.

352
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:16,470
If you have HVAC system

353
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:20,120
and it turns out suddenly for 10 seconds,

354
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,590
and then it turns off,

355
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:25,230
it's very unlikely that you consider this

356
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:27,570
as a compromise of your own device.

357
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:29,610
And you know, in the worst case scenario

358
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:31,550
if you notice about them,

359
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:34,629
individual bot detection
and losing few bots

360
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:38,480
would not thwart the entire attack

361
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,863
because like, this is a
distributed large attack.

362
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:47,730
Now let's take a look at the verification

363
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:50,490
and some evaluation results

364
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:54,050
to see how effective this is in practice.

365
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:57,169
So obviously we used
only simulation results

366
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:59,930
because real-world implementation

367
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:04,070
has devastating effects
and it's not possible.

368
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,730
We use two standard test cases

369
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:07,890
to compare with the previous works.

370
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:11,833
IEEE 9 node system and
IEEE 39 node system.

371
00:21:12,744 --> 00:21:15,790
And we did comprehensive system modeling

372
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:18,550
to minimize the simulation error.

373
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:20,980
And in this comprehensive system modeling

374
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:24,080
we use the detailed
component and controllers

375
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,090
and protective devices modeling,

376
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:30,562
and also the system controllers
and protective devices.

377
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:36,469
For example, this table
summarizes some of the things

378
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:40,040
that were overlooked in the
modeling of the previous works

379
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,223
that we model in our work,

380
00:21:44,374 --> 00:21:46,530
to have the most realistic results

381
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:48,403
from the practical perspective.

382
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,080
We did this comprehensive modeling

383
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,730
and simulated the test grids

384
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:59,270
using a commercial tool
used by system operators

385
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:02,440
called DIgSILENT PowerFactory.

386
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:05,570
It's a pretty powerful
software that is used

387
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:08,822
to realistically simulate the power grids.

388
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:12,091
So we simulated the grid,

389
00:22:12,092 --> 00:22:15,480
for both of the grids for 24 hours,

390
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:19,423
and we periodically collected
measurements every 5 minutes.

391
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,840
But obviously we can
extrapolate this 24 hours

392
00:22:25,256 --> 00:22:27,330
to any long-term simulation,

393
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:30,600
because if every 24 hours
we have similar pattern

394
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,173
for the system operation and system loads,

395
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:36,940
and despite the previous works,

396
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:41,070
because they only simulated
the grid for 5 minutes,

397
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:43,149
we simulated for 24 hours

398
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:46,050
just to have a comprehensive analysis.

399
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:50,750
For example, these two graphs
are showing the load profile

400
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:53,080
of the two test systems.

401
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,570
This is the 39 node,

402
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:56,973
and this is the 9 node test systems.

403
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,530
And these two figures are showing

404
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:03,720
the system graphs for their test systems,

405
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,400
39 nodes and 9 node test systems.

406
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,460
For example, here we have 10 generators,

407
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:13,180
a bunch of transmission lines
and loads in different nodes.

408
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:15,720
And here we only have 3 generators

409
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,950
and like some loads in the system.

410
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:20,870
So this is a smaller test system,

411
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:23,520
but since it's a standard test system,

412
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,763
we used it in our simulations.

413
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:30,770
Now let's consider that we as an attacker,

414
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:34,660
we have access to a
botnet with 150,000 bots,

415
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:37,363
which is quite realistic.

416
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:42,430
What would be the attack
success rate in this case?

417
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:44,623
So if you look at this graph,

418
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:48,890
we can see that using
the index 1 and index 2

419
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:53,030
and we simulated like two previous works,

420
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:55,160
we can see that the attacks success rate

421
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:58,900
using our indexes is quite high.

422
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:01,657
Like in index 1 it's
around like 60 3, 4 percent

423
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:07,395
and in index 2 it's
around 90% success rate

424
00:24:07,395 --> 00:24:12,120
compared to the like 0 and 1% success rate

425
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,520
of the previous works.

426
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:17,400
The reason that this is
happening is that as I mentioned,

427
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,790
we're finding,

428
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:22,090
instead of launching the
attack from random nodes,

429
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:24,580
we're finding the weak
nodes of the system,

430
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:27,189
and we are targeting those points

431
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:28,713
to take down the power grid.

432
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:33,750
Now let's take a look at the result

433
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:37,750
that is associated with the
effect of the botnet size

434
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,190
on the attack success rate.

435
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:41,180
As we can see here,

436
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,660
as the botnet size increases,

437
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:46,160
the attack success rate increases.

438
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,700
But after some point, it saturates.

439
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:53,700
For example, after 150,000
bots in the grid it saturates,

440
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:58,470
because with this amount of botnet power,

441
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:01,268
we can take down the power grid

442
00:25:01,268 --> 00:25:03,623
at any location that we want.

443
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:08,899
But what is happening in the
grid during a typical attack?

444
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:12,250
So these figures are showing the frequency

445
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:15,870
and voltage profiles of the grid

446
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:19,340
simulating three different methods.

447
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:23,080
The first paper, the second
paper in the literature

448
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,240
and our own Smart IoT attack.

449
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:28,870
As we can see if we launch
the attack from random nodes,

450
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:31,919
the existing system protection
schemes and controllers

451
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,580
are able to recover the grid

452
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:37,070
to the normal operating condition.

453
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:39,050
Like attack is happening here,

454
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:41,210
the controllers and protection schemes

455
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:42,860
are getting involved in here,

456
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:45,870
and they are recovering the grid to here.

457
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:49,000
The same happens for
the voltage magnitudes.

458
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,280
In the second simulated case,

459
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:54,389
a similar thing is happening.

460
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:55,640
But in our attack,

461
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,460
because we're targeting the
weak points of the grid,

462
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:02,560
the frequency is getting
recovered to some extent,

463
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,500
but the voltage collapse
happens in the grid

464
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:09,033
and a larger scale blackout
happens eventually.

465
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:14,790
But what is the effect
of the botnet time delay

466
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:17,030
on the attack performance?

467
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:19,410
Like, we know that we cannot turn on

468
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:22,000
all the compromised
devices at the same time,

469
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,219
there might be a slight
delay between them.

470
00:26:25,219 --> 00:26:28,538
So we considered mean time delay

471
00:26:28,538 --> 00:26:33,180
for the activation of the
bots in different nodes.

472
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:35,890
And we know, we increase this number

473
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:37,720
and as we can see,

474
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,060
like even with two seconds of delay,

475
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:44,250
which is a very huge delay in
the activation of the bots,

476
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:46,770
we don't have that much
of significant effect

477
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:48,160
on the attack success rate

478
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:51,653
and we still have a
pretty high success rate.

479
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:57,010
But now we know that
it's an effective attack

480
00:26:57,010 --> 00:26:59,923
and it's a serious threat,

481
00:27:00,979 --> 00:27:01,947
so one might ask,

482
00:27:01,947 --> 00:27:06,137
"So what? Like who
cares, is it a big deal?"

483
00:27:06,137 --> 00:27:11,137
Our answer to this question
is yes, it is a big deal.

484
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:13,800
It is a big deal for power grid operators,

485
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,540
because this attack is obviously

486
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:18,889
threatening the reliability of the grid

487
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:21,770
and the power grid operators main goal

488
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:25,510
is to keep the reliability of
the grid as high as possible.

489
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:29,226
It is a big deal for the
utilities and end users

490
00:27:29,226 --> 00:27:34,010
because such attacks can cause
like huge economic damage

491
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:37,610
and inconvenience to the end users.

492
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:40,199
Just recall the recent events

493
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:44,623
that happened in Texas
following the weather events.

494
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:49,590
The people lost power for like 24 hours

495
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:52,110
and if you recall the news,

496
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:57,110
you know what kind of like
chaos it caused in Texas.

497
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:00,580
And also it's a big
deal for the governments

498
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:03,040
because it's a national security concern.

499
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,070
And every power grid in every country

500
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:10,070
is considered among the most
critical infrastructure.

501
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,560
And such attacks could be used

502
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,429
as a part of trade or cold war.

503
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:16,833
So it is a big deal for
governments as well.

504
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:21,910
But what we can do to
defend against such attacks?

505
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:25,673
Like is there anything
we can do to defend,

506
00:28:25,673 --> 00:28:30,163
to mitigate or at least reduce
the damaging consequences?

507
00:28:31,536 --> 00:28:35,610
So the first thing that we can do about it

508
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:37,560
is that the government agencies

509
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:40,929
such as FERC or federal
electric regulatory commission

510
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:45,930
could be involved in this
countermeasures or defenses.

511
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,210
Because the main thing

512
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:49,870
that gives the ability to the attacker

513
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:53,939
to launch this targeted
attack is that we're somehow

514
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:57,645
getting the access to
the real-time operation

515
00:28:57,645 --> 00:28:59,830
data of the power grid.

516
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:03,080
And this is clearly a data privacy issue.

517
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:06,659
So we need some new
regulations and policies here

518
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:10,400
to not to share the real-time data

519
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,383
of the power grid with anyone.

520
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:15,480
So we shouldn't share those information

521
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:20,010
like in these online websites,

522
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:22,740
or we can do some delayed data sharing

523
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:27,350
or sharing the redacted data
to reduce the possibility

524
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:29,382
and increase the estimation,

525
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:34,290
estimation error of the attacker

526
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:36,322
getting the access to that data.

527
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:42,940
The second countermeasure can
be taken by the IoT vendors.

528
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,670
Obviously they can form
a big giant IoT database

529
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:51,670
to register a small portion
of their IoT devices there,

530
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:55,200
and they can monitor them synchronously.

531
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:00,200
So obviously, if there is any
like synchronous activation

532
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:03,403
or deactivation of these
devices in a larger scale,

533
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:06,340
we can call it as an attack

534
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:08,899
and we can like locate those devices,

535
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:11,900
try to make them secure or patch them

536
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:17,800
to like reduce the possibility
of this attack in the future.

537
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:22,900
Also, the utility companies
can collaborate with each other

538
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:25,220
and implement a strategy called

539
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:27,163
non-intrusive load monitoring.

540
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:33,570
And it's basically estimating

541
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:37,040
what devices are being used in every home

542
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:42,040
by only looking at the power
usage of the smart meter

543
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:46,360
that is measuring the power
usage of the home owner.

544
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:49,510
So obviously if there's any unwanted usage

545
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:51,557
of a specific device,

546
00:30:51,557 --> 00:30:55,890
this non-intrusive load monitoring

547
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:59,557
can issue a warning to the
home owners saying that,

548
00:30:59,557 --> 00:31:03,500
"Okay you have like three
or four devices in your home

549
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,880
that are showing suspicious behavior."

550
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,520
Obviously this can be done by using

551
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:12,129
the machine learning based
anomaly detection approaches

552
00:31:18,402 --> 00:31:19,830
which have been discovered

553
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:23,513
and like researched in
recent years tremendously.

554
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:29,740
Also we have some protection
relays in the grid,

555
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:34,128
that if we revise their
like protection algorithms

556
00:31:34,128 --> 00:31:37,939
like the UFLS and UVLS relays,

557
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:41,110
they can withstand against
these attacks significantly.

558
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:45,850
For example, we revise the
UFLS algorithm in the grid

559
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:48,969
and implemented some of
these successful scenarios,

560
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:52,311
and this figure shows what
happens after the revision

561
00:31:52,311 --> 00:31:56,740
that was done on the grid protection.

562
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:58,980
We can see that even after launching

563
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:01,630
the optimum attack from the weak points,

564
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:06,020
if we have the optimum or
the best protection scheme,

565
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:09,450
or the built-in protection schemes,

566
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:12,310
our system or the protection schemes

567
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:14,679
can like, protect this grid

568
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:18,240
and can recover it to the
normal operating conditions.

569
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,470
So this is another research path

570
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:24,343
or that can defend against
these kinds of attacks.

571
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,510
So as a summary,

572
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:29,840
we presented a high-wattage IoT botnet

573
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,649
and we showed that how it can
cause power grid blackout.

574
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:37,630
And we showed some short-term
and long-term countermeasures

575
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:41,010
that could be implemented to
lower the risk of the attack.

576
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:44,870
And we showed that the attack vector

577
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:47,489
should be studied in other domains.

578
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:48,440
For example,

579
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:52,790
the same attacker having
the access to the IoT botnet

580
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:54,680
can try to target other domains

581
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,593
such as the electricity markets.

582
00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:01,670
So this was the end of my presentation.

583
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:03,000
Thank you for listening

584
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,900
and I'm here for any questions.

585
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:07,733
Thank you.
