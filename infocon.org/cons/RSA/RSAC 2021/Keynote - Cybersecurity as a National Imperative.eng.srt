00:00:02,035 --> 00:00:04,618
(music)

2
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,930
- Hello, it's my pleasure
to have the opportunity

3
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:15,910
to address so many practitioners,

4
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:19,050
doers on the front lines of cyber defense.

5
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:20,250
I've been invited to speak about

6
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,360
the administration's
approach to safeguarding

7
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,740
and modernizing our cybersecurity defenses

8
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:26,610
while we confront threats from persistent

9
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:29,320
nation state threat actors and criminals.

10
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,670
I know RSA attracts an expert audience.

11
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:34,690
So this is an audience that
can give chapter and verse

12
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:37,699
on how the security of our
technology remains a challenge,

13
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:41,040
even as it's a bigger and
bigger part of our lives.

14
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,380
Governments and companies are under

15
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:45,210
constant sophisticated
and malicious attack

16
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,830
from nation state
adversaries, and criminals.

17
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:51,739
So today more than ever as
each person here would say,

18
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:54,880
cybersecurity is a national
security imperative.

19
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,760
Cybersecurity also has
geopolitical dimensions.

20
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,910
Technology can be leveraged
to facilitate participation

21
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:03,529
in democratic processes
and advanced human rights

22
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:05,170
and rules-based order.

23
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:08,010
But can also be used by
authoritarian regimes

24
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,630
to advance mass surveillance,

25
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:14,050
facilitate arbitrary detention
and systematize oppression,

26
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:16,100
and to write new rules and standards

27
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,850
that are counter to democratic values.

28
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:21,080
I don't think anyone here would contest

29
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,970
that cybersecurity is a
matter of national security.

30
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:26,870
So I won't spend any more
time stating the obvious.

31
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:30,300
Instead, I'll turn to
the urgency of the moment

32
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:33,700
and the need for us to renew
our commitment to partnership

33
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,713
because the stakes couldn't be higher.

34
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,100
The administration has navigated

35
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,929
two major cybersecurity incidents

36
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:42,000
inside of our first 100 days.

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,690
One we inherited, and another
that broke during our tenure.

38
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:47,890
The SolarWinds and
Microsoft Exchange incidents

39
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:50,490
reinforced several lessons.

40
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:54,669
First, adversaries will look
for any opening to attack,

41
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,130
whether they're hunting for coding errors

42
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:59,482
or compromising supply chains
to create an attack vector.

43
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:02,600
Second, partnerships are critical

44
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,020
to the safety of our nation in cyberspace.

45
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,800
The government needs the private sector

46
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,949
and the private sector needs
the government's partnership.

47
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:12,200
Third, the government urgently needs

48
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,630
to modernize cybersecurity
defenses to protect its own data

49
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:18,763
and ensure it can deliver
services to the American people.

50
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,570
And we have to shift our mindset

51
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:24,290
from incident response to prevention,

52
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:27,459
and prioritize our investments
to get ahead of threats

53
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,653
and facilitate early detection.

54
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:32,930
I'll take a few moments
to reflect with you

55
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:36,223
on this last point, shifting our mindset.

56
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,980
Like so many here, I've been in this field

57
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:42,489
at the ground level and I've
observed that as a community,

58
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:43,980
we've accepted that we'll move

59
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,630
from one incident response to the next.

60
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:48,310
And while we must acknowledge breaches

61
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:50,460
will happen and prepare for them,

62
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:53,650
we simply cannot let waiting
for the next shoe to drop

63
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:56,460
to be the status quo
under which we operate.

64
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,810
The national security implications

65
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:00,160
of doing so are too grave.

66
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,570
Breaches are costly.

67
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:03,780
Simply put, cybersecurity is not only

68
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,580
a national security imperative

69
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:09,000
but an economic security
imperative as well.

70
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,530
Estimates vary, but in 2019,

71
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:13,740
Accenture and Ponemon study estimates

72
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:17,880
the average company incurs a
cost of $13 million per breach.

73
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,090
A joint CSIS and McAfee report estimates

74
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:25,320
cybercrime costs 1% of global GDP in 2018.

75
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,959
I could go on.

76
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,290
The point is that today the cost

77
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:31,480
of insecure technology is staggering,

78
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,769
and that cost is borne
at the end by the victims

79
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:37,320
in incident response and cleanup.

80
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:41,730
Small businesses, schools,
hospitals, and local governments

81
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:45,619
who often have fewer resources
particularly struggle.

82
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:48,680
These costs aren't new,
and they're well-known.

83
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,580
And we can take steps

84
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:52,190
to modernize defenses to mitigate them.

85
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:55,970
That alone should be incentive
enough to change our ways.

86
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:57,313
And yet, have we?

87
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,730
What does it take?

88
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:03,453
This is the community
who can drive the change.

89
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:08,740
This administration is committed
to changing the calculus

90
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,840
and the president has
elevated cybersecurity

91
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,990
in a way that no other has.

92
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:15,830
Our approach can be summarized
by three complimentary

93
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:18,709
and mutually reinforcing lines of effort.

94
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:21,609
First, modernized cyber defenses.

95
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:24,490
Second, return to a more active role

96
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:26,370
on cyber internationally.

97
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:30,050
And finally, ensure America's
better posture to compete.

98
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:32,610
I'll briefly touch on
each of these efforts.

99
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:35,680
First, we're modernizing cyber defenses.

100
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,590
Following SolarWinds incident response,

101
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:39,810
we were confronted by the hard truth

102
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:41,050
that some of the most basic

103
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:43,140
cybersecurity prevention measures

104
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:46,409
weren't systemically rolled
out across federal agencies.

105
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:49,440
Tools like MFA, encryption,
constant logging

106
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,180
and endpoint detection pull
back to an effective sock.

107
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,690
We've taken immediate
action to roll these out

108
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:57,500
but we have much more to do.

109
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,023
And we're starting with
the software that we buy.

110
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:03,480
Software supply chain security is an area

111
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,390
of particular concern.

112
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:07,150
The current model of build, sell,

113
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:11,159
maybe patch means the products
the federal government buys

114
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,530
often include defects and vulnerabilities.

115
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:15,210
These are defects and vulnerabilities

116
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:17,690
that the developers are
accepting as the norm

117
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:20,150
with the expectation they can patch later.

118
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:22,280
Or perhaps developers
decide to ship software

119
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,190
with defects and vulnerabilities
they decide to ignore.

120
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:27,150
If they, the vendor deems those defects

121
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:28,330
and vulnerabilities are not

122
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:30,303
sufficiently serious to merit fixing.

123
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:32,940
That's not acceptable.

124
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,790
It's knowingly introducing

125
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,900
unknown and potentially grave risks

126
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,870
that adversaries and
criminals then exploit.

127
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:43,440
Security has to be a basic
design consideration.

128
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,330
We'd never buy a car or rush to market

129
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:47,950
knowing it could have
potentially fatal defects

130
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,890
that the manufacturer
may or may not choose

131
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:52,190
to issue a recall and fix.

132
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,920
You wouldn't buy that car and decide later

133
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,480
whether you want to install
seat belts or airbags.

134
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,910
But that's analogous to how

135
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:01,470
today's software development model works.

136
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:03,660
Coding securely takes work,

137
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,610
but we can take pride in that work.

138
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:09,170
Knowing the cost and time,
we're saving thousands.

139
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,450
And knowing that the best hackers

140
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:12,683
around the world won't find a hole.

141
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,000
On the government side,

142
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,010
we want to begin taking
aggressive steps to do our part

143
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,349
to ensure that the software
the government buys is built

144
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:22,430
more securely from the start

145
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:25,570
by potentially requiring federal
vendors to build software

146
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:27,940
in a secure development environment.

147
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,310
Our efforts will pay dividends

148
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:30,960
outside of the federal government

149
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,960
because much of the software

150
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,810
the government buys is the
same software that schools,

151
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:38,400
small businesses, big
businesses and individuals buy.

152
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,659
The starting point for building

153
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,490
more securely is where
you build your software,

154
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:45,700
which should be separate and
a secure build environment.

155
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:48,810
This includes things like
using strong authentication,

156
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:52,320
limiting privileges, and
of course, encryption.

157
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,930
It also includes knowing the provenance

158
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:55,780
of the code you include in your builds

159
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:57,919
and using modern tools to check for known

160
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,340
and potential vulnerabilities.

161
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:03,130
This is hard, but it also
may seem basic to you,

162
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:04,590
maybe even obvious.

163
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,469
But we all know that

164
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:08,760
these basic practices are not universal.

165
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,460
For those of you already
following these practices,

166
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:14,210
thank you, and thank
you for your leadership.

167
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:15,870
Thank you for investing in security

168
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,550
at the beginning of the process

169
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:21,350
and by extension, investing
in national security.

170
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:23,700
And thank you for setting
the tone for the community

171
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,510
by leading by example.

172
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:28,130
You deserve recognition for
your commitment to security

173
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:29,940
and you deserve more than that.

174
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,870
You deserve credit in the marketplace.

175
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:35,180
But today, that's hard.

176
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:38,950
Today, there's no way to gain
that in today's marketplace.

177
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:40,479
Why?

178
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,070
Because the government
and indeed all consumers,

179
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:44,219
we don't have visibility

180
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:48,100
into what software is developed
securely, and what's not.

181
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,880
So while visibility and
accountability are key drivers

182
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,490
of software security,

183
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:54,870
we literally are unable to
factor them economically

184
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:57,000
into our buying decisions.

185
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,140
In order to make the market
to put money on this issue,

186
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,560
to give developers the economic credit

187
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,150
they deserve for secure code,

188
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:07,799
and to empower consumers to
make informed buying decisions,

189
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,210
we need to integrate that visibility

190
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:12,620
into the security of our software.

191
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,920
Visibility engenders trust.

192
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,450
And today we place our trust in vendors

193
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:19,969
but we largely do it
blindly for the most part

194
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:22,510
because we don't have a
way to measure that trust.

195
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:24,349
And I want to talk more about that.

196
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:27,330
I'll turn out to our
critical infrastructure.

197
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:29,760
Many of the systems that run
our critical infrastructure,

198
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,270
the systems that deliver the
gas that heats your homes

199
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:34,840
and the electricity
that powers our schools

200
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,730
was built before anyone
had heard of an internet.

201
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:40,450
We simply didn't plan
for the interconnectivity

202
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:42,943
and related cybersecurity
risk we see today.

203
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:47,120
And most of this infrastructure
is in private sector hands.

204
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,860
In April, the administration
announced a pilot program

205
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,440
in which we're working with
electric sector leaders

206
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,510
to modernize cyber defenses,

207
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:57,530
a program that will facilitate
private sector efforts

208
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:59,220
to install new technologies

209
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:02,720
that provide timely visibility detection,

210
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,010
response and blocking capabilities

211
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:06,240
to protect the technologies

212
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,450
on which our critical services depend.

213
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:10,170
This will take time,

214
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:12,300
but it's the first step
of a series of efforts

215
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,680
we'll be working on to ensure we can trust

216
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,640
the systems underpinning
our critical infrastructure.

217
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,520
And that trust is relying
on having the level

218
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:24,240
of visibility needed to
match the consequences

219
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,280
if a system is degraded or disrupted.

220
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,329
Let's think about that for a moment.

221
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:32,460
The level of visibility we need is built

222
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,330
on the trust we need,

223
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:37,290
and the trust and visibility
we need is based on

224
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:40,760
the consequences if a system fails.

225
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,540
That's an important point to think about,

226
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,783
particularly as we build systems here.

227
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,660
Our second line of effort is revitalizing

228
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,709
America's global leadership role.

229
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:51,670
While we modernize our cyber defenses

230
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:53,689
and safeguard existing infrastructure,

231
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:55,670
we're also strengthening
our global partnerships

232
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:57,810
to counter adversaries
that leverage technology

233
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:59,983
to undermine national and global security.

234
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:02,920
The administration is
coordinating with allies

235
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,140
and like-minded and international partners

236
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,920
through initiatives like
The Quad Security Dialogue

237
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,810
to develop, promote and
safeguard our cybersecurity

238
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:13,589
and counter adversaries and competitors

239
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:15,970
that may seek to use
technologies to undermine

240
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:19,490
our economic prosperity
and national security.

241
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:21,920
We're also collaborating
with our allies and partners

242
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,729
on efforts to counter cyber threats

243
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:26,370
and hold malicious actors accountable.

244
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:28,860
As one example, we built
a coalition of dozens

245
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,610
of countries to support our attribution

246
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,840
of the SolarWinds intrusion to the SVR,

247
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,950
and bolster the US government's actions

248
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:36,550
to hold Russia accountable

249
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:38,943
for its malign actions in cyberspace.

250
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:41,850
One of our first global initiatives

251
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:45,070
will be a cooperative effort
to counter ransomware.

252
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:47,190
Criminals use ransomware
to target everything

253
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:52,010
from individuals, utilities,
hospitals, and large companies.

254
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:53,770
Extortion through ransomware presents

255
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:56,890
a national security threat
for countries around the world

256
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:58,939
because it can disrupt
schools and hospitals

257
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:02,210
and governments and companies
abilities to deliver services.

258
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:05,010
And because of the huge financial cost,

259
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:06,890
it's concerning that ransomware

260
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:09,310
often exploits known weaknesses

261
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:12,670
such as targeting endpoint
and software vulnerabilities.

262
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:15,729
Proactive prevention through
effective cyber hygiene,

263
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:18,860
cybersecurity controls and
business continuity resiliency

264
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,770
is often the best defense
against these criminals.

265
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:23,439
However, we're also concerned

266
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,660
about growing sophistication
of these groups,

267
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,110
both in their exploits,

268
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:29,290
such as the use of fileless ransomware

269
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:31,030
and in their operational models,

270
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:33,500
including the evolution
to big game hunting,

271
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,130
the growth of ransomware cartels

272
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:38,840
and the increasing prevalence
of double extortion schemes.

273
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,690
International cooperation
to address ransomware

274
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:43,180
is critically important

275
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:45,400
because transnational
criminals are most often

276
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,280
the perpetrators of these crimes.

277
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,230
And they often leverage
global infrastructure

278
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:51,180
and money laundering networks to do it.

279
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:54,839
Finally, the administration will ensure

280
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,680
America's better posture to compete

281
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:00,209
in cybersecurity, technology, and beyond.

282
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:02,490
While we take steps to
bolster cybersecurity

283
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:05,640
and secure the technology
and infrastructure of today,

284
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,210
we must also invest in and facilitate

285
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:10,290
the innovation of tomorrow.

286
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:13,439
As the president said, we're
at an inflection point.

287
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,890
Federal investment in research

288
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:17,250
and development is at
its lowest in decades

289
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,390
as a percentage of our GDP.

290
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,850
And the president's committed

291
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:23,030
to reversing this trend
to ensure America remains

292
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:25,470
a global leader in emerging technology.

293
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:27,570
The American Jobs Plan includes a proposal

294
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:30,740
to invest $180 billion in R&D

295
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,730
of new and emerging technologies,

296
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:34,370
technologies like quantum computing,

297
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:36,680
AI, and microelectronics.

298
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,609
This investment is a
significant down payment

299
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:41,220
on the future of American innovation.

300
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,610
The American Jobs Plan
also includes proposals

301
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:45,660
to secure critical supply chains

302
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,790
on which our technologies rely,

303
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,260
including investing $50 billion

304
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:52,603
in domestic semiconductor,
manufacturing and research.

305
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:56,180
Before closing, let me speak
to why ensuring America remains

306
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:58,829
a leader in emerging
technology is so crucial

307
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:00,770
to our national security.

308
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:02,449
Take quantum computing.

309
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:04,890
Quantum computing
promises to revolutionize

310
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:07,290
certain unsolvable computing problems

311
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:10,480
across a variety of military
and civilian applications,

312
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,480
from pharmaceuticals
discovery and healthcare

313
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,620
to advanced materials and
batteries, to machine learning.

314
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:17,580
But quantum computing
will also be disruptive

315
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,990
in other ways too.

316
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:21,270
It will fundamentally
disrupt cybersecurity

317
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:23,720
and the technology platforms
on which it's built

318
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,920
while offering new vectors

319
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,060
to compromise critical information systems

320
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:30,030
and networks with potentially
devastating impacts

321
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:32,850
on certain encryption methods
like asymmetric encryption,

322
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:34,190
the foundation of our economic

323
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:36,460
and national security communications.

324
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:39,290
The president's American Jobs
Plan reflects a commitment

325
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:41,510
to accelerate US leadership
in quantum computing

326
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:43,939
and quantum information
science more broadly,

327
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:44,910
while protecting the country

328
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:47,850
from the adversarial use
of these technologies.

329
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:49,930
Bolstering the nation's cybersecurity,

330
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:51,829
safeguarding our critical infrastructure,

331
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:55,030
and renewing America's advantages
broadly are fundamental

332
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:57,140
to the Biden Administration's commitment

333
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:59,220
to our national security strategy.

334
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:02,030
Continued partnership with
you, the private sector,

335
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:04,530
is critical to achieving these objectives.

336
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:07,170
In closing, thank you for your role

337
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:08,990
in building more secure systems.

338
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:11,370
That role's become evermore critical.

339
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:13,950
At your keyboard, you're
saving the users of your code

340
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:16,740
time, money, and sharing the innovation

341
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:17,785
we're all so proud of.

342
00:14:17,785 --> 00:14:21,310
It's also secure against the
sophisticated threats we face.

343
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:23,707
Be well, do well, and thank you.
