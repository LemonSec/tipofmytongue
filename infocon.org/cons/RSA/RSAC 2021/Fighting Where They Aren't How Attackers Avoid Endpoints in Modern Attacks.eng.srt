00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:03,110
- Hi everybody, my name is Brian Vecci,

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:04,859
I am the Field CTO at Varonis.

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,090
And today we're gonna be talking about,

4
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:08,340
Fighting Where They Aren't:

5
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,010
How Attackers Avoid
Endpoints in Modern Attacks.

6
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,100
And with me is one of
the smartest guys I know,

7
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,370
Snir Ben Shimol, hi Snir?

8
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:18,390
- Hey Brian, thank you.

9
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:20,710
So everyone, my name is Snir Ben Shimol

10
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:25,490
I'm overseeing the cyber
security practice in Varonis,

11
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:29,169
managing the data science,
research, forensics

12
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:30,983
and security operations team,

13
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:33,830
and pleasure to be with you.

14
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:36,543
So Brian, thank you, let's get started.

15
00:00:36,543 --> 00:00:37,810
- Of course, so here's
what we're gonna do,

16
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:39,230
we're gonna need a
little bit of background

17
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:41,269
on kind of what we're talking about

18
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:44,448
and a little bit of context
the kinds of attacks

19
00:00:44,448 --> 00:00:47,327
that totally avoid endpoints,

20
00:00:47,327 --> 00:00:48,629
and so many of us are focused

21
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:50,230
on endpoint protection these days.

22
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:52,449
We're gonna go through four specific

23
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:53,770
kill chain specific attacks

24
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:55,170
and we'll give some examples of those.

25
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:58,270
A gateway compromise, a
supply chain compromise,

26
00:00:58,270 --> 00:00:59,490
compromise in the cloud,

27
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:03,030
as well as we'll cover some
insider threats as well.

28
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,269
And then right at the end,

29
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:06,899
we'll give you a little
taste of some bonus content

30
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,280
that we've got,

31
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,030
where an attack technique
that doesn't bypass

32
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,060
or avoid the endpoints

33
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,160
but goes right through
them using Office Macros.

34
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,160
So with that, what are we talking about?

35
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,759
Why are we talking about
attacks that avoid endpoints?

36
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:24,590
And the key thing here is we tend to focus

37
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:25,690
from a security perspective,

38
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:27,899
and by we I mean, enterprises
in general, at the perimeter,

39
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,190
building big strong fences.

40
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:30,830
And one of the primary
perimeters these days

41
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:33,510
especially in a world
where everybody is remote

42
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:38,240
and you know, expected to
access data from anywhere,

43
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,179
from any device at any time,

44
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,850
we tend to focus on endpoint protection.

45
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:44,520
But what a lot of attackers
are doing these days

46
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,850
especially sophisticated ones,

47
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:48,410
is totally avoiding those endpoints.

48
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:51,440
Why worry about bypassing the EDR

49
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,690
when you can just use the technique

50
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:56,080
that never even touches
the endpoint at all.

51
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,890
And this quote from Sun Tsu

52
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:59,690
from "The Art of War" illustrates that,

53
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:02,270
if you attack where they're unprepared,

54
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,630
then you'll attack where
they're not expected.

55
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,710
Many of us are prepared for attacks

56
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:08,699
on endpoints and devices just
like we are at the perimeter.

57
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:10,579
So if an attacker can avoid those,

58
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,240
then they're much better off

59
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,313
and they're often much more successful.

60
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:17,230
Let's start with the first example

61
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:21,630
of these kinds of attacks,
which is a gateway compromise.

62
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,700
So a gateway is any way into the network,

63
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,320
like a firewall, a VPN

64
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:29,070
or some sort of device or
service that is by definition

65
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:31,250
and by design exposed to the internet

66
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,810
and designed to let people in and out.

67
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:35,850
When a gateway is vulnerable,

68
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:39,700
whether it's a VPN, a
remote access server,

69
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,410
a firewall specifically,

70
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:42,880
when a gateway is vulnerable,

71
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,200
you basically you give an attacker

72
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,390
a beachhead onto your environment.

73
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:48,640
So what are some examples
of gateway compromises

74
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,239
that you guys have seen?

75
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,200
- Yeah, so to be honest many threat actors

76
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,489
initial access is an exposed server

77
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:59,350
or an exposed application.

78
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:03,910
Not like directly into one
of the users and devices

79
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,655
and this is a great example.

80
00:03:05,655 --> 00:03:10,260
The Fortinet vulnerability
that was disclosed,

81
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,929
actually this is a great story,

82
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:14,930
this vulnerability was
disclosed two years ago,

83
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,770
and like three years ago even,

84
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:18,670
but you have like thousands of customers

85
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:20,000
that were still vulnerable.

86
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,090
The vulnerability include
like a direct access

87
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,610
to your one of your Fortinet gateways,

88
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:27,350
and that direct access
expose a specific file

89
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:31,019
with tons of clear picks
credentials of the users

90
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,140
and sometimes the services

91
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:34,600
that using this specific take A gateway.

92
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,019
So in this case the
attacker can compromise

93
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:40,950
one or several of those credentials

94
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:44,549
and access your organization
directly through the gateway.

95
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:45,780
So you don't need any phishing,

96
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,410
you don't need any to compromise

97
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:50,420
any specific account social engineering.

98
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,280
You don't need to go into the endpoint,

99
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,270
you just access through the gateway

100
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:57,610
using different types of vulnerability.

101
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:00,410
The cool thing about this
vulnerabilities just like,

102
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:02,400
you know you exposed credentials

103
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,410
and we have those types of
vulnerabilities all the time.

104
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:10,410
This is a great metrics that Kela,

105
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,450
a research group just published this year,

106
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:16,890
and they showed that
initial access for sale

107
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:20,709
in the deep web was increased.

108
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:21,810
And as you can see,

109
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:25,570
almost half of the in initial access

110
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:29,290
is RDP, open RDP, VPN access.

111
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:32,640
Any type of remote code
execution or vulnerabilities

112
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,590
from different types of network compliance

113
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:36,719
was application servers.

114
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,500
So what those threat actors are doing

115
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,240
is they're scanning the network,

116
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,610
they're looking for any
type of known vulnerability

117
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,530
that you didn't patch one of your servers,

118
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:47,849
or some organization that
have opened RDP access.

119
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:51,430
And they just maintain the foot hold,

120
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:53,870
exploiting this vulnerability and just,

121
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:56,410
they don't want to go and move forward

122
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:59,213
with full compromise and full APT,

123
00:04:59,213 --> 00:05:01,660
to just sell it to a
specific threat actors

124
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:05,680
that care about, okay,
I have this company,

125
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,900
I have this like several companies.

126
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,169
I want to implement the ransomware,

127
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:11,600
I want to extort them.

128
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,360
If you've heard about,
like the dark side group,

129
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,520
that using initial access
as the main tactics,

130
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,080
or this is something we just discuss about

131
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,120
in one of our blog posts
lately, last month.

132
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,990
Or if we're seeing things like REL

133
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:27,920
or those type of threat actors

134
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,170
that using gland summer
after the end game,

135
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:32,370
which is extra trading information,

136
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:34,440
they using initial access

137
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,550
as the first foothold
within the organization.

138
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:40,480
And again, it's so easy

139
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,370
because let's talk a little
bit about patching Brian.

140
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:46,130
We have so many vulnerabilities

141
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:48,020
and we have so many investigations.

142
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:51,799
So many customers that we
help them doing attack,

143
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,840
our incident response and
forensics team jumping in.

144
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,239
And then we identify that patient zero

145
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,760
in the first initial access

146
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,670
of the threat actor was
through an open RDP server

147
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:06,370
or a, those type of
vulnerability I just listed here

148
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:09,930
are very common for a
specific threat actors.

149
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:12,550
Most of the threat actors
to scan your network

150
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:14,920
and identify those initial access.

151
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:18,370
Most of the time and I
do want to talk about,

152
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:19,427
for example, their Proxylogon,

153
00:06:19,427 --> 00:06:21,810
if you have an on-prem exchange server

154
00:06:24,118 --> 00:06:27,020
and Microsoft and Atheneum,

155
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,032
Microsoft Atheneum exploited,

156
00:06:32,498 --> 00:06:34,137
Atheneum exploited
Microsoft vulnerabilities

157
00:06:34,137 --> 00:06:36,350
of the on-prem exchange servers,

158
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:40,940
and we're able to remotely
run execution of code.

159
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,790
From that extent server,

160
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:45,360
a few investigation we did on victims,

161
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,500
we saw from those specific server,

162
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,290
the attacker went all the way
into the domain controllers

163
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:52,850
and all the way into additional servers,

164
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:55,230
because the exchange server was like

165
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:56,580
you have so many permissions.

166
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:59,043
Those service accounts, those
accounts that you compromise

167
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:01,180
have so many permission already,

168
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,820
and you can just lock it all moving to

169
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:07,550
the best and the like the interesting

170
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:09,680
most secure assets within the network.

171
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,080
- Yeah, we often think it was the gateway

172
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,620
as a really hard outer shell,

173
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,410
but if there some sort
of gateway compromise

174
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:17,410
either through an unpatched
server or other exploits,

175
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:18,870
the attackers can have free reign.

176
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:19,960
Here's generally how it works,

177
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:23,039
is an attacker is gonna come
through one of these gateways,

178
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,990
either through using an exploit
that hasn't been patched

179
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:27,950
or by brute forcing a VPN account.

180
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:30,880
Once inside though, there's
a few different techniques

181
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,713
that they're gonna use.

182
00:07:31,713 --> 00:07:34,130
They're generally going to
jump to another on-prem server,

183
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:36,370
they will use DNS for reconnaissance,

184
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:38,680
they'll use DNS for command and control.

185
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,010
They'll also use active directory

186
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:42,250
to escalate their
privileges, move laterally.

187
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,490
The goal of course is to
get access to exfiltrate,

188
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:46,870
sometimes encrypt data.

189
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,920
So the gateway becomes a beachhead,

190
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,330
but at no point during this kill chain,

191
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:51,770
did an attacker have to worry about

192
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:55,000
any end point protection
that you might have.

193
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,080
- Brian I can't see any
end point in this diagram.

194
00:07:59,080 --> 00:07:59,962
- No end point in the diagram.

195
00:07:59,963 --> 00:08:00,840
- It's like the diagram here.

196
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,392
And I do want to,

197
00:08:02,392 --> 00:08:06,850
I do want to just share
one insight, patching.

198
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:09,720
Patching is you always
have lagging in patching.

199
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,110
So even if you try to patch

200
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:15,900
right before the critical
LC is like being published,

201
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,640
these LC already exists few
weeks or sometimes months,

202
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,760
before the vendor released the patch.

203
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:26,537
So you need to assume that
your external facing servers

204
00:08:26,537 --> 00:08:29,020
and application can be compromised.

205
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,979
And we do see a lot of
companies that cannot patch

206
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,620
the day after when you have
a massive infrastructure,

207
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:37,220
it's always a challenge.

208
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:39,559
And this is like one of the factors

209
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:41,669
that allow those threat actors

210
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:45,370
to get a hold of one or few
externally facing servers.

211
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:47,420
- All right, so what happens when patching

212
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,770
is not just a fix of the problem,

213
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:50,790
but maybe a cause of the problem

214
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,040
with supply chain compromise?

215
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,199
let's talk about sunburst and solar winds.

216
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,750
So what happened is the way
solar winds normally works,

217
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,700
and the idea of a supply
chain compromise is

218
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,340
a compromise someway
your in an infrastructure

219
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,990
that gets compromised
outside of your control.

220
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:07,980
So you've got solar winds
to help manage your network.

221
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,970
Solar winds talks to the
broader internet to get patches

222
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:14,090
through the Orion Protocol.

223
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:17,060
These attackers got a hold of

224
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:19,959
or got access to the patching server

225
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,003
and we're able to compromise these a DLL

226
00:09:23,003 --> 00:09:24,670
that was sent down to,

227
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:27,645
how many solar winds
environments was it Snir?

228
00:09:27,645 --> 00:09:29,350
Something like 30,000?

229
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:32,910
- A lot, a lot, like everyone
that pretty much update

230
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,930
his Orion software was vulnerable

231
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:38,020
and actually had that malicious DLL.

232
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:40,340
So if you want to talk a
little bit more in depth

233
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,880
about the attack Brian,
which if you asked me

234
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,770
I'm so fascinated about this
specific attack is insane.

235
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:49,413
The thing is the thing is like,

236
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:53,010
they actually were able
to hack solar winds

237
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,689
and from solar wind,

238
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:58,040
it was like the spread around the entire,

239
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,750
it's like instead of attacking
your organization directly,

240
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,030
they just need to attack one supply chain,

241
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:06,100
and then your malicious
code can be distributed

242
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,830
for all the customers.

243
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:10,160
The cool thing about here
is the command and control

244
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,670
and the stealthy operation.

245
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:15,189
They use DNS mainly in order to be confirm

246
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:18,710
all those victims outside
to their external service,

247
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:23,440
and that DNS was so stealthy
because they waited a few weeks

248
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,950
and then they send some beckoning outside

249
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:27,970
using their own code from
the solar wind server,

250
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:30,880
which is, the beckoning is very noisy.

251
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,010
And once they identify one of the victims

252
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:35,230
they needed to attack

253
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:37,000
and they want to get information,

254
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,830
a great example is like Microsoft

255
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:43,483
and additional example
is some of the defense,

256
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,170
like the National Treasury
Departments of United States

257
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:51,209
and so on, something very juicy.

258
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:55,070
So they communicate from the DNS protocol

259
00:10:55,070 --> 00:11:00,070
to be able to operate the
entire operation through the DNS

260
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,959
and laterally move established futal

261
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,160
for many many weeks and months.

262
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,459
And I identify sensitive information

263
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,400
using the solar wind server,

264
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,620
they identify sensitive information

265
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:15,560
and the extra treat
that information slowly

266
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:20,372
outside of the network,
it was like really genius.

267
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:24,240
- Yeah, so we've gone
through two attack techniques

268
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,730
that involve attackers
coming in from the outside.

269
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:29,090
Totally and as you see still no end points

270
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:30,900
that are involved in this attack flow.

271
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,610
Coming in from the outside
either through a gateway

272
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:34,680
or through some sort of
supply chain compromise,

273
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,560
but there's another way
to get access to data

274
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,800
that can potentially bypass the end point.

275
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,729
And that's going through

276
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:45,280
not just it's going through
this infrastructure.

277
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,490
So we've got an internal server,

278
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:47,890
the solar winds infrastructure

279
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:49,640
that talks to the broader internet,

280
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,819
and it talks to the
internet to get updates.

281
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,480
The way the supply chain
compromise works is,

282
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,610
the supply chain update server,

283
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:59,240
sends down a compromised update,

284
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,650
in the solar winds case, it was a DLL

285
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:02,500
that had been compromised.

286
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,800
From there, as you say,

287
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,060
DNS for reconnaissance
and command and control

288
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,329
or command control over HTTPS,

289
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:10,120
those protocols are always there.

290
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,810
From there, our attackers
might use active directory

291
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:14,859
for privilege escalation

292
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,520
or to move laterally around the network.

293
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,020
You might be sensing a theme here

294
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:22,180
and then get access to
exfiltrate and or encrypt data.

295
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:24,260
This is another beachhead,
another foothold

296
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,180
than an attacker can get,

297
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:28,280
and as you said, no end
point in this diagram.

298
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,829
Both of these, the gateway compromise

299
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:31,040
and the supply chain compromise,

300
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,010
involved attackers coming
in from the outside

301
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:33,970
to your data center,

302
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:36,090
to some infrastructure that you control.

303
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:38,090
But what about just
going to infrastructure

304
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,430
that you have less control of,

305
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:40,939
like a cloud application?

306
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:43,130
So another way to get access to data

307
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:46,520
is to go into a cloud data
store and access it that way.

308
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,360
And one of the ways we've seen
attackers do that recently,

309
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,750
is by building a malicious
cloud application.

310
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,840
So the idea is, if I'm an attacker,

311
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,760
I build an application
in Azure and I publish it

312
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,600
and then send it to your users.

313
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,730
Your users install the application,

314
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:03,830
grant that application permissions

315
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:06,100
to access data or other systems.

316
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,340
And then as an attacker,

317
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:10,170
I leveraged those application permissions

318
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:13,860
to get access to and potentially
exfiltrate your data.

319
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,730
So in this case, the specific technique

320
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:17,563
that we're talking about

321
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:20,000
is building a malicious Azure application,

322
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,460
and then using that Azure application

323
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:26,390
to get access to Office
365 or Microsoft 365 data.

324
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,760
So Snir, how does this actually work?

325
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,689
- So even in continuation
to solar wind act,

326
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:33,810
we also saw some evidence

327
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:37,280
disclosed by Malwarebytes and Microsoft

328
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,605
because there were like
also some of the victims,

329
00:13:39,605 --> 00:13:42,090
that the attacker
actually tried to leverage

330
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:44,180
those types of malicious
application techniques

331
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:47,500
in order to remain inside and
get some additional foothold.

332
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,170
So the idea is exactly like mobile app.

333
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:51,469
When you install a mobile app

334
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:53,060
and if you remember back in the days,

335
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:56,410
the Flashlight that would asked
you permission and consent

336
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:59,280
to access your contacts
and your graphic location

337
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,319
from your mobile device.

338
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,980
Why this specific Flashlight application

339
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,410
needs all those permission,

340
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:08,290
exactly the same way malicious application

341
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:09,439
and as well as walking.

342
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,170
So when you install this application,

343
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:13,370
what we're seeing in the field,

344
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:14,710
as we're seeing threat actors

345
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:16,690
having their own Microsoft tenant,

346
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,000
building their own application.

347
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,740
And the idea of the application,

348
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:22,350
some of them is to harvest information

349
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:24,830
from different type of
organizational tenant

350
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:29,070
by luring a users to
install those applications.

351
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:32,040
And Microsoft best practices
is to allow your user

352
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,670
to use the Microsoft Azure
application and to install them.

353
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:37,810
Once the user installed application,

354
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:41,550
he's been requested to provide permission

355
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:44,250
to the application, to do
specific type of things.

356
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:49,250
Those things normally use
the Microsoft Graph API.

357
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:53,210
And this is a great example
of some of the POC we build

358
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:55,800
based on some of the incident we saw.

359
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,800
When you have Microsoft Graph API,

360
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:01,740
you mainly use the
permission of the victim

361
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,770
that installed the application

362
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:07,819
and you can run those API
on behalf of the permission

363
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,290
of that specific user.

364
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:11,430
So you create a service principle

365
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:14,189
in the victim organizational tenant,

366
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:15,510
and that service principle

367
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:18,420
have the rights of the victim user.

368
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:21,479
So remotely it's exactly like a malware,

369
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:26,480
from remote you can just
run a graph API call,

370
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:29,440
a collect information
about additional username

371
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,490
and tenant information.

372
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:34,960
You can get some data
information from one drive,

373
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,350
from SharePoint online.

374
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:39,370
You can extract email addresses

375
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:42,940
and in some cases,
unfortunately we saw that

376
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:47,940
the user had permission to run
graph API to perform changes.

377
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,210
Some of the, some of the incidents we saw

378
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:53,740
when you install that
malicious application,

379
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:56,920
the attackers were able to execute

380
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:01,920
a commands like deleting
or sharing or downloading,

381
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:07,590
or even a tempering
information in your Office 365.

382
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:12,680
So we actually use graph
API to access specific files

383
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,160
and change the content of the files.

384
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:18,740
And it's just like, it's insane,

385
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:22,800
one user in your organization
can do just by approving

386
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,319
and downloading an application.

387
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,780
Again, the best practices specifically

388
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,660
in Azure and Microsoft is like, yeah,

389
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,500
we support the collaboration,

390
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:34,290
we want a user to download any
type of application you want.

391
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:37,520
So you have some best practices about

392
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:41,090
how can you reduce the impact?

393
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:42,730
And you have a lot of information

394
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:44,720
about how can you track down

395
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,520
the installation of those
type of application?

396
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,199
So we build a full POC
with full explanation

397
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:55,200
and in-depth, information
about how everything work

398
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,410
and what should you do in
order to protect yourself?

399
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:00,459
You can go to our Varonis blog

400
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:03,140
and you have all the
information over there.

401
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:05,160
And again if you have any
questions, right Brian

402
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,170
this is live session.

403
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:08,490
- I was just gonna say
the exact same thing,

404
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:10,079
if you've got questions, while
we're going through this,

405
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:10,913
please ask them in the Q&A

406
00:17:10,913 --> 00:17:13,440
and we're gonna be here answering them.

407
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,150
So you thought, listen our minds

408
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:16,609
went to the exact same
place at the same time,

409
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:18,379
forgot to mention that up front.

410
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,690
So yeah, if you'd like more information

411
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:21,920
varinis.com/blog, search Azure apps

412
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,380
and we built a proof of concept.

413
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:26,109
Also, you may have read
the news Malwarebytes

414
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:29,350
got hit by something
similar a little while back.

415
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:33,756
So we've got cloud
techniques to access data

416
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:37,790
through the cloud, bypass
all your end points,

417
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,460
because we're going
straight to cloud data,

418
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,670
coming through a gateway or
a supply chain compromise,

419
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:43,360
infrastructure that you've already got,

420
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,149
either unpatched or gets
hit by a malicious patch.

421
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,580
But what's another way
to bypass the controls

422
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,889
that you have on an end point?

423
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:53,180
Well, what if somebody's
already logged in,

424
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,410
completely authenticated,

425
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:57,190
and it's supposed to
be using that endpoint?

426
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:59,020
Insider threats and insiders

427
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,430
bypassing your end point controls,

428
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:01,950
is something that we've
seen a lot of as well.

429
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:05,360
And you may have read back in December,

430
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,840
Tesla hired an employee

431
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,929
and within a couple of days
of that employee starting,

432
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:13,560
they detected that a large
amount of intellectual property

433
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,649
and other proprietary information

434
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:17,670
was being uploaded to
this Dropbox account.

435
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:19,010
I'm not trying to pick on Tesla here,

436
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:21,500
this kind of thing happens all the time.

437
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,040
We do risk assessments
as a matter of course,

438
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:23,873
yeah every week.

439
00:18:23,873 --> 00:18:26,070
We do risk assessments on average,

440
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:28,230
a given organization about 20% of the data

441
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:30,510
is open to every single
employee and service account.

442
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,570
Meaning you hire a new employee on day one

443
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,970
they have access to 20% of
the data in the company.

444
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:37,290
And every once in a while,
you're gonna hire someone

445
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:39,909
who either breaks bad or
is there by designing.

446
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:44,510
And in this case, this attacker
got himself hired at Tesla

447
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:45,940
and then used that access

448
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:48,840
to start exfiltrating data right away.

449
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:52,260
In this case, it illustrates that code

450
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,590
and intellectual property of
course have a lot of value.

451
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:56,500
There's also other really
sensitive information

452
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:00,830
inside files, like PII
and PHI and related data.

453
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:04,060
Employees often have
access to way more data

454
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,590
than they need in order to do their jobs.

455
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:08,050
We talk a lot about
enforcing these privilege

456
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:09,700
and we also know that most organizations

457
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,380
really really struggle to do that.

458
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:15,750
And humans can become
vulnerable to compromise,

459
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:18,910
so patch frequently and
make sure that you're

460
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:21,330
not just monitoring perimeter behavior

461
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:22,899
but you're also monitoring user behavior

462
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,770
in a way that's gonna let you detect

463
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:26,303
when something goes wrong.

464
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,240
Go ahead.

465
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,890
- I do want to mention another thing

466
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:35,050
is like you just said like
every user in the organization

467
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:38,450
can access to like 20% of
the data is open to everyone.

468
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:41,280
And the ID is like you don't need to do

469
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,250
any type of privilege escalation.

470
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:47,120
I want to take it for
two different concepts.

471
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,409
Think about the ransomware,

472
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:52,330
when you compromise one
generic domain accounts,

473
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:55,639
and you want to unleash ransomware,

474
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:00,000
that domain account of over
usually 20% of your entire data

475
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,990
within your organization

476
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:05,020
is available to the entire organization.

477
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:07,430
So as a minimum 20% of the data

478
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:10,450
will be encrypted without any
type of privilege escalation.

479
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:14,230
The second thing is the
not too smart employee,

480
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:16,350
employees that sniffing around,

481
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:17,399
employees that thinks like,

482
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,020
Hey, I don't need to use X, Y and Z,

483
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,460
I just going to take all that data

484
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,720
because I want to work faster.

485
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,800
I want to work from home,

486
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,669
I want to use my own
device and my own computer.

487
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:31,720
And you have so many ways for
those not so smart employees

488
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:35,910
to take the data without
running an extra trading

489
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:40,880
in a successful way during DNS standing.

490
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,500
And just taking that data
out, it's so easy today.

491
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:48,500
So insider trade is for me,
one of the largest risks factor

492
00:20:50,662 --> 00:20:52,040
for trade detection and response

493
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,700
and for organizations today.

494
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:58,460
So how it looks like if you
just hire an attacker, Brian.

495
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,450
- Yeah, the has already got
access to your end point,

496
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:03,670
has access to the data that
you're suppose to have access to

497
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:06,080
and probably a whole bunch of data

498
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,480
that they're not supposed
to have access to,

499
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,990
or at least do not have a need to access.

500
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:14,460
Oftentimes we also see that
once an endpoint is compromised,

501
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,580
or once an employee is compromised,

502
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,020
they can use they can live off the line

503
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:20,480
and use techniques like
are outside attackers,

504
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,700
leveraging DNS for reconnaissance
and command and control

505
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,840
to the outside,

506
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,800
active directory to
escalate their privileges

507
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,399
and then get access to both on premises

508
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,130
and data in the cloud.

509
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:33,453
So if we were to put all of this together,

510
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,540
let's think about the anatomy
of all of these attacks

511
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:40,360
and what you would need
to do to properly detect

512
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,469
and better prevent them.

513
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:44,630
So we've got our attacker
who's either inside or outside,

514
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:46,470
or is a piece of malware like ransomware.

515
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:50,500
This person or this code
is after or this group,

516
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,100
a lot of these are being
driven by large organizations

517
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,530
at this point, are after data,

518
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:57,899
either on premises or in the cloud.

519
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,090
Nobody breaks into a
bank to steal the pens,

520
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:01,459
thereafter data, how do they get there?

521
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:04,060
Well, they might come through a gateway,

522
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:06,200
either an unpatched gateway,
a compromised gateway,

523
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,870
something that is exposed,
not necessarily by design.

524
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,540
We saw a lot of exposed RDP

525
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,670
during the beginning of COVID

526
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:14,350
because companies were
just trying to get people

527
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:15,500
to work remotely.

528
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,430
From there though, once
they're through the gateway,

529
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:19,170
they'll use DNS for command and control,

530
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:20,730
active directory for previous escalation

531
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:21,600
and lateral movement,

532
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,340
get access to on premises

533
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,540
data for exfiltration or encryption.

534
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:28,720
Or they might come through
your supply chain somehow

535
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,040
and compromise a server,

536
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,170
and then use all the same techniques.

537
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:34,800
Or they might go directly
to your cloud data,

538
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,399
through a cloud directory,

539
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,770
or they might hop from on premises

540
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:40,540
to the cloud or vice versa.

541
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:42,670
They might go from authenticating

542
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:44,260
to Azure active directory for instance,

543
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:46,980
and then using those credentials
to get themselves active

544
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:49,090
access to on-prem data.

545
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:50,439
Snir's team runs a great attack lab

546
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,823
that shows exactly how that can work.

547
00:22:51,823 --> 00:22:53,590
Well they already have
access to the endpoint

548
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:55,500
because you hired them and they're inside.

549
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,340
This also highlights what can happen

550
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:00,360
when your endpoint
actually is compromised.

551
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,939
It doesn't mean that you
shouldn't have endpoint protection

552
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:05,280
or EDR or other defenses on the endpoint,

553
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,379
it is a perimeter that
you do need to protect,

554
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:10,593
but it's not a be all end all
and it can be compromised.

555
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:14,629
So what do you need to consider

556
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:17,650
if you want to up your
detective capabilities?

557
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:18,870
What do you need to have in place

558
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:21,100
in order to detect this
kind of thing quickly?

559
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:24,290
Time to detection and time
to response are critical,

560
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:25,760
because the longer it
takes you to figure out

561
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,710
that something is going on

562
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:28,210
and the longer it takes
you to investigate it

563
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:29,950
and come to conclusion
about what happened,

564
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:32,260
the more vulnerable you
are the more risk you are.

565
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,730
Start with telemetry.

566
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:35,850
So what are you actually monitoring?

567
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:37,679
You need to monitor the data itself.

568
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,860
It's very difficult or
in some cases impossible

569
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:43,219
to determine when these kinds
of attacks are happening

570
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:46,860
by just inferring data access
network or other telemetry.

571
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:50,100
Watch the data itself,
watch connections to the VPN

572
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,560
and to the cloud.

573
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,000
Look at authentication traffic

574
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,600
since that's going to
indicate both device usage

575
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,719
and lateral movement and
privilege escalation.

576
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,680
Watch DNS for command and control,

577
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,090
potentially for exfiltration too.

578
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:04,100
You can use a DNS tunnel to get data out

579
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,219
and of course web connections

580
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:08,390
to see how users, which
websites users are accessing

581
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:11,240
and whether it's following
any unnecessary data access.

582
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,830
It's important to clean the data up,

583
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:16,840
because if you just dump all
of these logs into a repository

584
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,659
and hope that you can
connect them together,

585
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:19,620
that's incredibly difficult,

586
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:20,669
but if you clean up the data

587
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:23,450
and link various entities
together like users,

588
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:24,770
what they're accessing, where they are,

589
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:26,860
the internal and external IP addresses,

590
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,429
it makes it much easier to use.

591
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:31,240
But a big key here is it's
not just about cleaning up

592
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,680
all of this telemetry,
it's about enriching.

593
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,160
It's really difficult to detect

594
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,060
inappropriate access to data,

595
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,710
if the telemetry that you're looking at

596
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:40,890
doesn't include things
like the account role.

597
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:42,980
Is this an user an
executive, a service account

598
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:44,070
or an administrator?

599
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:47,083
Is the data that's being
accessed sensitive in any way?

600
00:24:47,084 --> 00:24:48,920
What device are they using and
where are they coming from?

601
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,130
And this is just some examples,

602
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:52,340
there's lots of ways to enrich data

603
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:54,060
if you've got the right kind of metadata.

604
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:57,389
And if you've got enough of
this kind of enriched telemetry,

605
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:59,470
you can then build really useful profiles.

606
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:01,140
You know that this person is an executive,

607
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:02,070
you know where they come from,

608
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:03,020
the device that they use,

609
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:05,190
you know what data they have access to.

610
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:06,040
What they normally touch,

611
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,200
who their peers are.

612
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,410
Whether any of that is sensitive

613
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:10,870
so that when something goes
wrong, you know about it.

614
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:12,510
And the key thing here is,

615
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:14,530
when something really does go wrong,

616
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:16,760
it's gonna go wrong along
a variety of factors.

617
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,200
It's not just that somebody is logging in

618
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,060
from a new location,

619
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:19,929
that happens all the time

620
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:22,100
because it's, we're all
working remote now, right?

621
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,959
But if somebody is logging
in from a new location

622
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,440
using somebody else's device,

623
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,770
touching data that
they've never looked at,

624
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:28,370
that's also highly sensitive.

625
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:29,590
You put all that together

626
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:31,669
and there's enough risk
factors to tell you

627
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:33,720
that there's abnormal
access to sensitive data.

628
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,320
And Snir what are the
kinds of threat models,

629
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,560
what are the kinds of analytics

630
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,120
that you'd want to have in place

631
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,090
in order to catch the kinds of attacks

632
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:42,990
that we just went through?

633
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:44,110
- That's a great question, Brian.

634
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:45,379
So some of the attacks

635
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:48,147
you don't need to explore
anything, like insider.

636
00:25:48,147 --> 00:25:50,139
And some of the things that we need to do

637
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:53,070
is to enforce machine learning AI

638
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:55,470
and historical knowledge
about my organization,

639
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:57,810
my user's application and services.

640
00:25:57,810 --> 00:25:58,990
This is a great example,

641
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:00,410
so let's start with,

642
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:02,920
like the first thing is like
you need to get initial access,

643
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,310
something you can detect
at sometimes, not bad,

644
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:08,669
for example potential malicious
file download was detected.

645
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:11,460
If you know which type of websites,

646
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:13,493
if you know how your users,

647
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:17,370
which devices they coming from
and how they're downloading

648
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:19,479
and interacting with websites,

649
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:22,260
you can identify things like droppers.

650
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:24,800
Moving forward, like things about DNS,

651
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,350
DNS is the blood in the
vein of the organization,

652
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:29,250
it's always open, it's open externally,

653
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:30,870
it's open internally.

654
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:34,530
If you understand how DNS
behave in between end points,

655
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:36,110
in between servers,

656
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:38,620
what's your upstream DNS, downstream DNS,

657
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:40,189
you can identify things like,

658
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:42,377
hey I'm using my DNS server for reconduct

659
00:26:42,377 --> 00:26:43,860
but we're seeing a lot.

660
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:46,790
Instead of going to
AED, threat actors today

661
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:48,110
asking the DNS server,

662
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,046
hey, give me all the information

663
00:26:49,047 --> 00:26:51,530
about the devices in this segmentation.

664
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:54,830
You can see here abnormal
DNS lookup requests

665
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:56,419
to create different IPS,

666
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:58,860
even internally within the organization.

667
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:02,176
You, like the idea is
that the threat actors

668
00:27:02,176 --> 00:27:04,500
are always going after the data.

669
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,840
And here you can see like
active directory attack,

670
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,342
like previous escalation.

671
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,620
We see like potentially
a ticket out this thing

672
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:14,179
that can lead to a Kerberos thing

673
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:16,060
and compromise over a service account.

674
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:17,440
And now you ask yourself a question,

675
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,940
how can you tell if a service account

676
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,750
has been compromised
if the service account

677
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,360
is operating as usual?

678
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,320
Here I consider the service account access

679
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,929
for the first time to a personal device.

680
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:30,370
And Brian, again, I want
people to ask questions.

681
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:32,979
So how do you know that this is a server,

682
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:35,180
it's a personal device, or it's a server?

683
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,338
How you can detect it?

684
00:27:36,338 --> 00:27:38,205
How do you know automatically
that this account

685
00:27:38,205 --> 00:27:40,169
is a service account
and executive accounts?

686
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:42,270
Those are great questions
you need to answer

687
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:44,740
before you can provide
those types of detection.

688
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:46,320
And again, data is the key,

689
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,352
that service account
access a typical folders,

690
00:27:48,353 --> 00:27:52,070
and the typical files contain
sensitive information.

691
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:55,750
The last but not least
what the CSO always asked,

692
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:57,710
so what's happened to the data?

693
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:59,810
And this is why again we need web traffic,

694
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:01,200
we need DNS to tell you,

695
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,650
hey, during the time
or during the timeframe

696
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:05,370
you access that sensitive data,

697
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:09,090
we saw a DNS start, and go
we a typical upload activity

698
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:10,110
from this device,

699
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:14,159
or by these service accounts
to those specific domains.

700
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:17,030
And this is like a
great example of a flow,

701
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:20,920
both insiders threat and
both of threat actors

702
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,340
that we're seeing in
many of our incidents.

703
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:25,419
- And how do you respond
to the CSO that says,

704
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:26,690
this all sounds great

705
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:28,980
but I'm already suffering
from alert fatigue,

706
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,810
I've got so many alerts
I can't chase them.

707
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:33,010
And what you're saying
is I need more alerting.

708
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:34,910
So how do we make sure that
the alerts that we're getting

709
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:35,973
are actually useful?

710
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:40,070
- So I will divide this
type of question into two.

711
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:43,700
The first one is again,
the machine learning,

712
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,730
and the behavioral analytics.

713
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:48,120
So we, you have specific pattern detection

714
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,260
but you need to have context.

715
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:53,450
So if you will alert every user

716
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:55,370
that access any type of data,

717
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:58,129
you will be blasting your
sim and your sock theme

718
00:28:58,130 --> 00:28:59,400
with tons of alerts.

719
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,640
But if you know whats within that data,

720
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,840
you can avoid alerting
about people that just like,

721
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:09,040
you know, a back, doing some
backup of their mobile devices,

722
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:13,659
or uploading the latest Christmas
party pictures to Dropbox.

723
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:16,250
You need to understand
whats within those files

724
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:19,330
and you need to understand if
that user created those files,

725
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:21,169
if the user and the user crew

726
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:23,940
normally access those
files from which devices.

727
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:26,220
By having this context,

728
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:30,800
you will be able to
filter out so much noise,

729
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,440
so your alerts that you will provide

730
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,440
to your security analyst,

731
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,530
will have all the information they need,

732
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:38,500
first of all to decide

733
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,830
if they need to investigate right now.

734
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:43,439
They're ready going to
reduce all the false positive

735
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,960
you can even imagine.

736
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,230
And the second thing is like,

737
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:48,590
I don't need to build so many correlation

738
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:52,600
to determine if this is
like a critical incident

739
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,659
or it's something I can resolve by myself

740
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:58,290
because I have the context
about the incident.

741
00:29:58,290 --> 00:29:59,570
- What about the alerts themselves?

742
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:00,850
So you mentioned context,

743
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:02,270
when something like this happens

744
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:04,860
and here's an example of an alert

745
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:07,510
for an abnormal service behavior,

746
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:09,840
a service account accessing
data that they don't touch.

747
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,740
That's a really useful
alert and for instance

748
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,690
you mentioned proxy log on, for exchange,

749
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:16,960
or exchange service accounts
were used to access data

750
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:17,793
on the network.

751
00:30:17,793 --> 00:30:19,709
Sunburst where the sunburst solar accounts

752
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:22,210
and the system accounts
on those on those servers

753
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:23,830
were used to access the network.

754
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:24,879
You mentioned context,

755
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,830
because when you get an
alert of something like that,

756
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:28,879
a service account accessing
data that it never touches,

757
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,780
there's a lot of questions
that are gonna come up.

758
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:31,810
Why is this happening?

759
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:33,169
Is this something real?

760
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:34,200
Was any data stolen?

761
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,170
Was any data touched?

762
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:39,090
So describe the importance
of a lot of this context,

763
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:41,800
and how it helps lower the
time to resolution here

764
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,980
not just the time to detection?

765
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:46,780
- Yeah, so my goal when I getting an alert

766
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:48,833
is I need to understand first of all,

767
00:30:50,006 --> 00:30:52,520
who would involve in
this specific incident.

768
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:55,209
If you look here, we already identified

769
00:30:55,209 --> 00:30:57,900
this account as a service account

770
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:00,610
and we've already identified
that this is a typical behavior

771
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:02,240
for this specific service account,

772
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,510
and these a typical
behavior resides with files,

773
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:09,210
but not only files, it's
also resides with devices.

774
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:11,860
So we want to have a context

775
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,620
about who is the service account?

776
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,120
This is the backup service account.

777
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,129
What was so different about it?

778
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:20,260
You open a Microsoft
documents for the first time

779
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:22,210
in this specific location.

780
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:25,060
And then you ask yourself,
okay, from where he's operate,

781
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:26,780
who is running the service account.

782
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:28,476
You can go to the device information

783
00:31:28,477 --> 00:31:30,750
and you can clearly see that he's running

784
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:34,710
from a laptop that we learn
and baseline that this laptop

785
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,929
is belong, is the primary
device that being used

786
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:40,980
by the username engineer.

787
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:43,000
And this is a personal device,

788
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,400
this device contains additional alerts

789
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,570
that related to different type of threats

790
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:50,480
on the same time timeframe.

791
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,390
And this specific backup service accounts

792
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:54,670
also related to different alerts,

793
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:56,710
related to the same timeframe.

794
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:58,830
Something that I always asked myself

795
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:01,139
when it's related to
administrative accounts

796
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:01,973
or service account,

797
00:32:01,973 --> 00:32:03,639
if the accounts have been changed,

798
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,200
if it's a new service account

799
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,550
if it's a disabled accounts
that become enabled.

800
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:11,240
This is additional context
that we're adding here

801
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,640
because today in security,

802
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,870
you have so many options
for false-positives

803
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:19,090
and sometimes you waste so much time,

804
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:21,100
just to reduce those options.

805
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:24,560
We need to get to a point
that we enforce automation

806
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,550
by providing the context.

807
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:29,600
It's, I call it automated forensics.

808
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,620
If I will provide you

809
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:33,439
all the answers you need on the alerts,

810
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,200
everything you need to know about the data

811
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,640
that have been compromised.

812
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,700
Everything you need to know about the user

813
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:42,080
or the service that
involve in the incident.

814
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,320
Everything you need to
know about the device

815
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,230
that was involved in this incident.

816
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:51,023
Think about how much time
you saved to take action,

817
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:53,610
it does make sense, right?

818
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:55,490
- I think it does, by the
way if you got any questions,

819
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:58,130
keep asking them, but here's
a little bonus thought.

820
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:01,420
So we've talked about how
attackers can avoid end points,

821
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:03,020
all of the kill chains and techniques

822
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:04,360
that we just described,

823
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,240
your end point protection

824
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,390
really isn't going to do
all that much to help you,

825
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:08,530
there's lots of ways that attackers

826
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:11,500
can completely avoid those protections.

827
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,960
But what if they wanna blow
right through your end point?

828
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,380
Well, we've got some content,

829
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:18,000
you can go to our SecurityFWD
channel on YouTube,

830
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,470
that'll show you how to
weaponize Office macros.

831
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:22,950
Office macros are an
incredibly powerful tool

832
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:25,240
that can be used in very productive ways.

833
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,820
In a very long ago past life,

834
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:31,189
I used to build lots of Office
macros for Excel analysis.

835
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:33,140
But you can also use Office macros

836
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:35,710
in really malicious ways,

837
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:38,580
to get control of an
endpoint and leverage them

838
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:39,620
to your benefit.

839
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:42,959
And if you'd like to see how
some of our practitioners

840
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,420
can do that and teach you,

841
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:46,230
you know, learn a little
bit how that works,

842
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:47,920
check out weaponizing Office macros

843
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,390
on our SecurityFWD YouTube channel.

844
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:51,460
It's a really cool session

845
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:53,730
and we've done some live
workshops with it too.

846
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:55,700
So what can you,

847
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,760
how can you apply what
you've learned today?

848
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,070
Well, it's really important to identify

849
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:01,300
where you might be vulnerable.

850
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:02,700
Patch your servers,

851
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,220
do regular risk assessments,

852
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,930
not just at your perimeters
and on your end points,

853
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:08,690
but on the data and infrastructure itself.

854
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:12,010
Evaluate whether you can
detect these attacks.

855
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:13,690
One of the things that Snir's team does

856
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:15,460
are purple team exercises,

857
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:16,909
where we'll break into your network

858
00:34:16,909 --> 00:34:18,540
and then show you how you could have

859
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,790
or where you might have gaps in detection,

860
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:23,040
whether you leverage us
to do that kind of thing

861
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,429
or somebody else, it's
certainly worth doing.

862
00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:28,799
And again, consider
performing a specific exercise

863
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,270
by either a red team,
or a red team blue team,

864
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:33,600
where you will, or what
we call it a purple team,

865
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:37,339
where you'll look at your both
your detective capabilities,

866
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:40,873
as well as any protection
gaps that you might have.

867
00:34:40,873 --> 00:34:43,989
Snir what else would you
recommend people do if anything?

868
00:34:43,989 --> 00:34:46,429
- Do not trust your permitter.

869
00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:49,456
I've been in so many like
strategic conversation

870
00:34:49,456 --> 00:34:52,629
with CSOs and CIOs and we're talking about

871
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:55,159
like those type of attacks.

872
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:57,680
And sometimes I getting experience,

873
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,980
I'm getting very frustrated

874
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:02,240
because those executives
sometimes can tell you,

875
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,060
yeah but we have MFA.

876
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,830
We're immune, we have MFA.

877
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:08,819
We have MFA enabled for our cloud users,

878
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:11,460
we have MFA for VPN access.

879
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:14,290
You know how many incidents we're seeing,

880
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:16,860
like all those accounts
with very strong MFA?

881
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:19,650
You always going to have
this like one account

882
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:21,590
that MFA was disabled,

883
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:23,480
or someone that using a service account

884
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,000
to connect from the VPN.

885
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,410
Or some sync proprietary accounts

886
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:30,089
that you use to sync your
on prem and cloud data,

887
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:33,410
but not require MFA even as
part of the best practices.

888
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:34,990
But even if you have MFA today,

889
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:37,669
you have a challenge
response phishing attacks,

890
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:40,830
that can bypass or even avoid the MFA.

891
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:43,160
So with things like, hey, we have EDR,

892
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,180
we can identify ransomware.

893
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:47,410
But what about all those threat actors

894
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:48,899
that using the supply chain

895
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:52,140
or using your web server mobility

896
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:54,359
without even accessing your end point,

897
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:57,200
to deploy ransomware and
to exfiltrate information?

898
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:01,210
The end point is not even part
of the attack yield chain.

899
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:04,540
So how can you even see
those type of behaviors?

900
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:08,000
Again, endpoint protection
is a very important key

901
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,130
in your security stack,

902
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:12,743
but do not trust your perimeter.

903
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,650
A build security by layers,

904
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:18,810
think about what the
attackers are looking for.

905
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:20,330
At the end of the day,

906
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:24,100
each and every attacker,
insider, threat actor,

907
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,830
will go after the data.

908
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:27,900
They want to encrypt your data

909
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,770
or they want to steal your data,

910
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:32,850
or they want to view or temper your data.

911
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:36,430
If you have the right detection in place,

912
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:38,500
you can detect those type of attacks

913
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,270
from the data standpoint,

914
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:42,213
way before something bad can happen.

915
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:46,100
- Exactly, nobody breaks into
a bank to steal the pens,

916
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,020
make sure that your data

917
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:49,120
is properly monitored and protected.

918
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,440
And with that, we'll close it up,

919
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,880
answer any more questions
that have come through.

920
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,540
Snir as always, thank you.

921
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:57,300
I hope everybody out there is staying safe

922
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,510
and you're enjoying our RSA.

923
00:36:58,510 --> 00:36:59,590
This has been a pleasure for us,

924
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:00,780
and we'd love to talk to you some more,

925
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:01,650
if you'd like to know anything else.

926
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:04,320
I'm Brian Vecci, Snir, thanks so much.

927
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,690
- Thanks you so much Brian.

928
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:08,240
Thank you everyone for your
time it was a pleasure.
