1
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:02,410
- Buongiorno everybody.

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:03,890
And welcome.

3
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:06,430
Thank you for taking the
time to join us today

4
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:09,270
for a brief discussion
about what it takes to

5
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:13,350
develop a direct to
consumer identity strategy.

6
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:15,180
My name is Vittorio Bertocci,

7
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,540
I work as a principal architect at Auth0

8
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,413
and I'm joined today by Sarah Cecchetti.

9
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:24,680
- Hello everyone I'm a
principal product manager

10
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:25,512
at AWS identity.

11
00:00:25,513 --> 00:00:29,070
I'm so happy to be here at RSA today

12
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,010
and we are both in the
chat answering questions.

13
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:31,910
If you have any questions

14
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:33,583
while the presentation is going on.

15
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:36,869
- Wonderful, alright,

16
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:41,313
so without further ado,

17
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:47,520
direct to consumer is an
extraordinarily powerful strategy,

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,430
really really pays off.

19
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:53,608
And so so many companies
today are considering

20
00:00:53,608 --> 00:00:58,500
approaching these and actually
having their own services

21
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,450
directly exposed to
their intended audience,

22
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:04,140
their customers, any particular consumers.

23
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,430
However, this is a tricky,

24
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:10,350
it actually has a number
of attention points

25
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:13,350
that there perhaps you should consider

26
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:17,660
as you devise your strategy
and your plan, your rollout.

27
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,670
And so that's what we are going to talk

28
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:22,970
about today in our very
short presentation.

29
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:25,880
And most of our advice can be summarized

30
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,603
in a few key takeaways.

31
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,080
The first one is vector,

32
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,520
although it's always the case

33
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,200
that you need to find a balance

34
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,040
between security and usability.

35
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,450
This is especially true

36
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:42,680
in the direct to consumer scenarios,

37
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,513
mostly because

38
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:48,350
if you have a system which
is too difficult to use

39
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:51,770
then people will not sign up
and you'll have to close shop.

40
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:54,377
This is not a matter of having
your employees disgruntled

41
00:01:54,377 --> 00:01:57,800
because they cannot use
the system efficient.

42
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,320
It's literally, you want to make money.

43
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,979
And on the other side
you are doing everything

44
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,860
in the open in very public settings.

45
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,300
And so if something goes
wrong and you might end

46
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:12,010
up as bad news in the first
page of the New York Times

47
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:14,790
and so your security people
would be very nervous.

48
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:18,130
So finding the right balance
between those two things

49
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:22,713
is a truly an critical aspect
in this particular case.

50
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,830
The other part of this vector,

51
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:29,690
you rarely get everything
right at the first take

52
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:32,710
because there are just
so many factors out there

53
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,700
that you can do your best shot

54
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:38,810
but then you need to be prepared
to measure how things work

55
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:42,840
how your audience is
dealing with your system

56
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,280
and be prepared to adapt your strategy and

57
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,550
especially with the
respond to security issues.

58
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:53,730
And then finally don't
believe the marketing

59
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:55,519
from our company is saying

60
00:02:56,404 --> 00:02:59,220
it's just point and
click and you'll be done.

61
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,970
Technologies today are
extraordinarily powerful.

62
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:06,280
And if you are the one of
a few lucky people that are

63
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,130
in the canonical
quintessential scenario, yes,

64
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:11,299
you might be able to adopt the technology

65
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,980
and just use it as is out of the box.

66
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:17,315
However, it's just going
to be pretty hard to do,

67
00:03:17,315 --> 00:03:20,430
if you wanted to customize it,

68
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,990
if you truly wanted to extract the value

69
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:26,520
that is you are expected
to get from your own

70
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,233
taking control of your own strategy.

71
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,230
So without further ado,

72
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:35,197
let me go a bit more into
the details in particular

73
00:03:35,197 --> 00:03:37,890
the idea is that you
need to find a balance

74
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:41,220
between usability and
security, as you mentioned.

75
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,570
And so I expect your head of growth

76
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:47,820
to try to get your funnel
as slippery as possible

77
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:51,700
so that user can just find
themselves in the system,

78
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,579
they sign up very easily and for them,

79
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:57,080
the growth is the most important factor,

80
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,930
but of course on the other side,

81
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:03,000
expect your security people
to be extraordinarily nervous

82
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,440
and try to have everyone to
do their modern equivalent

83
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,910
of going to do groceries in a tank.

84
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:11,030
Mostly because everything is so public.

85
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:12,990
And so if something goes wrong

86
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:14,960
not only is really bad because of course

87
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:18,440
you are the custodian of
important data, but also,

88
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:22,450
this can be an extinction
level event for your company.

89
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:26,090
So you love a visa very
strong forces pulling you

90
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:28,500
in two different directions.

91
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,187
And how can you find this balance?

92
00:04:32,187 --> 00:04:33,810
And Sarah will go into the details

93
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:37,260
but just to give you a high level of views

94
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,219
probably a good point to start is

95
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,500
with the data that you are trying to use

96
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,110
because mostly the data will determine

97
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:46,470
the value of the things
that you need to protect

98
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:49,860
and the effort that you
are expected to support.

99
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:54,602
And here you might be surprised
by how wide the category

100
00:04:54,602 --> 00:04:57,770
of personally identifiable information is.

101
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:00,359
It's pretty much like almost everything.

102
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,810
So if you sell clubs and if
you are memorizing the size

103
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:07,370
of your customers, that's PII,

104
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:08,817
of course that's not the PII

105
00:05:08,817 --> 00:05:12,800
at the same level as a payment
instruments, for example,

106
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,753
on genetic information of your customers.

107
00:05:15,753 --> 00:05:18,010
Personally I never understood how

108
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:21,430
those companies vector
deal with genetic testing.

109
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,330
They don't force their customers to have

110
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:25,320
a multifactor authentication system

111
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,640
but that's just one example
of the kind of disagreement.

112
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:32,610
You might find when you make
this kind of evaluations.

113
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:34,630
The other thing that is specific

114
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:38,909
for the consumer scenario is the fact that

115
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:41,050
you don't really choose your audience.

116
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:44,210
If you are a user to do identity
systems for your employees

117
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:45,680
you might adapt to having things

118
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,680
to the effect of my employees
are digitally competent.

119
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:54,020
I hired them because of
that kind of a competency

120
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,630
but for customers you don't truly

121
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:58,770
have control over the devices they have

122
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:01,370
the digital you can expect

123
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,350
the level of patience that they have

124
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:08,350
the bandwidth, the, any
disability that they might have.

125
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:13,380
So the ability to understand
what your audience can do

126
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:14,910
and what is their level

127
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:17,340
of tolerance is another
factor that will play

128
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:20,169
out really in a strong way

129
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:22,373
as you devise your strategy in general.

130
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:27,010
And then finally the
thing is that you don't

131
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:29,620
necessarily need it to
have a monolithic strategy.

132
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,915
Let's say

133
00:06:30,915 --> 00:06:34,180
that you can have different
circumstances calling

134
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,770
for different strategies.

135
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:39,238
So you might decide with
only certain operations

136
00:06:39,238 --> 00:06:41,880
required multifactor
authentication or only

137
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,659
certain circumstances like
the classic user accessing

138
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:49,190
from a machine that is
you have never seen.

139
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:54,010
So in general, you need to
factor in some flexibility,

140
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:58,820
so that when you do prompt
you prompt because you know

141
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:03,820
that the counter value of
not prompting prompting wins

142
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:08,910
against the security that
civic experience sacrifice

143
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:13,670
but you're asking to your users
and it might sound difficult

144
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:16,040
and overwhelming but in fact luckily

145
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,503
today's technologies are designed to

146
00:07:18,503 --> 00:07:20,750
help you make these kinds of choices.

147
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,410
And now I'd like to leave the floor

148
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:25,343
to Sarah who will dig
deeper in this aspect.

149
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,460
- Thanks Vittorio.

150
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:28,387
So I'm here to talk about some

151
00:07:28,387 --> 00:07:30,420
of the authentication
tools that we can use

152
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:33,120
in a direct to consumer identity strategy.

153
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,360
I'm really passionate
about authentication tools.

154
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,570
This is actually my car.

155
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:37,760
I think it's very important

156
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,240
that people use
multi-factor authentication.

157
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,200
Yes, my car is dirty.

158
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,680
I'm aware but I put this picture in here

159
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,520
because I wanted to talk

160
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,120
about the F in multi-factor
authentication.

161
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,490
The specific factors that
you use are really important.

162
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:51,340
And when we say factors what we mean is

163
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,950
that usually we want to
see two different things

164
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:56,030
from three different categories.

165
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:58,440
And those three categories
are something you are

166
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,219
like a fingerprint or an Iris
scan, something you know,

167
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,760
like a password or something you have,

168
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,219
like a phone or a YubiKey.

169
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,630
When I log in, I use a YubiKey.

170
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:08,380
I use YubiKey Nano fives.

171
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:11,693
I keep mine on my earrings
so that I don't lose them.

172
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:15,640
And so one of the things that people ask

173
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,419
about consumer identity
when we mentioned this idea

174
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,920
of multi-factor authentication is

175
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,940
well two of those aren't passwords.

176
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,620
So is it possible that I can get away

177
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:27,310
from passwords because I
hate them and it's true.

178
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:31,280
Consumers hate memorizing
passwords and attackers love them.

179
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,270
In fact Alex Simon says
the only people who love

180
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,449
who love passwords are

181
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:38,169
in fact attackers because
they're easy to brute force.

182
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:39,299
They're much easier to get around

183
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:41,669
than a security key or a biometric.

184
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:43,439
So the answer to the question

185
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,540
do we even need to have
passwords is complicated.

186
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,050
It's true that local biometric

187
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:51,579
and app based authentication
are easy and secure.

188
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:52,780
The question is,

189
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:55,510
does everyone have a
smartphone with biometrics

190
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:58,740
and at least an app, is
that assumption true?

191
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:01,080
Let's dig into that data a little bit.

192
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,790
Smartphone penetration by
age is really interesting.

193
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:06,069
If you're dealing with the 18 to 29 market

194
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:07,470
about four percent of them

195
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:09,660
don't actually have a smartphone.

196
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,030
When you get up to 30 to 49 year olds

197
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:13,459
a full eight percent of the market

198
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,450
doesn't have a smartphone.

199
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:16,720
So if your authentication is predicated

200
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,320
on smartphone ownership,

201
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,340
you're missing out on fully
eight percent of that market.

202
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:25,260
If you go up to 50 to 64
year olds, it goes up to 21%.

203
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,810
And if you're dealing
with the over 65 market

204
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:31,260
it's a full 47% that
don't have smartphones.

205
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,319
So keep that in mind

206
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,950
as you are structuring your
authentication strategy

207
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,270
you want to segment your market

208
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:39,140
because some markets are more capable

209
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:42,490
of having a secure and usable
authentication strategy.

210
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:43,940
Some of them you're
going to have to go more

211
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:45,220
toward the password area.

212
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:47,620
So how do we, if we have to do passwords,

213
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,830
how do we make them
more secure and usable?

214
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,800
How do we create a password policy that is

215
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,142
both user-friendly and hard
for attackers to guess?

216
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,380
So the first thing we want to do

217
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,220
is allow special characters.

218
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,050
We want this password to be as complex

219
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:02,880
as possible to have a lot of entropy

220
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,840
so that it has lots of different
kinds of characters in it.

221
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,330
It's not all lowercase characters
that would be very easy

222
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:10,700
for an attacker to brute force.

223
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:13,360
However, we don't want to
require special characters,

224
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,940
and specific types of complexity.

225
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,370
Here's what happens when we do that

226
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:19,760
if I'm an attacker and I'm
trying to guess your password

227
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,110
here's all the things that I have to try.

228
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:24,670
If I know that there's a capital
letter in there somewhere

229
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:26,030
then I only have to try this many.

230
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,890
And if I know that there's a number

231
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:30,110
in there somewhere, then I
only have to try this many.

232
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:32,750
And so it actually reduces the
space that they have to try

233
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:35,517
in order to brute force or
reverse a hash of a password.

234
00:10:35,517 --> 00:10:38,410
So while we do want to
allow special characters

235
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:41,193
we don't want to require
specific types of complexity.

236
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,710
We do want to allow
ridiculously long passwords.

237
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:47,200
So a password like,

238
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,390
but soft what light through
yonder window breaks

239
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:51,480
it is the East and Juliet is the sun.

240
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,528
That's a Shakespeare line that a lot

241
00:10:52,528 --> 00:10:55,620
of people have memorized
that would make a very long

242
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:58,470
complex password that
has a ton more entropy

243
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:03,470
than nine ampersand,
eight n capital O right?

244
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,900
Having very very long
passwords is actually

245
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,680
the most secure way to make sure

246
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,859
that you have a lot of entropy.

247
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,330
And that they're memorizable.

248
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:12,310
And what that means is

249
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:14,250
that you have to have
spaces in there as well

250
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,760
and you should be storing those passwords

251
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,340
in a way that's not plain text.

252
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:22,340
So just in case you as an RSA
attendee did not already know

253
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,057
that I hope you do now.

254
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,400
Storage shouldn't be an issue

255
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,890
for ridiculously long passwords.

256
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:30,560
You should not force password rotation.

257
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,170
This is guidance that
has actually changed.

258
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:34,089
Previously we have said
you should make people

259
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:36,700
change their passwords
about once a quarter in case

260
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,450
that password gets compromised.

261
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:41,010
But what we found since
then is research shows

262
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:43,010
that when you force people
to change their password

263
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:46,110
on a regular basis they
create passwords that are

264
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:47,710
predictable and easy to guess.

265
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:50,830
So they pick things like
spring 2015, exclamation point,

266
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:52,924
summer 2015 exclamation point.

267
00:11:52,924 --> 00:11:55,600
And those are very easy
for attackers to guess.

268
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,850
And so if a, if a user can
remember a long complex password,

269
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:02,880
for God's sake, let them
keep it and let them use it.

270
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,590
So what do we do to prevent
against attackers getting access

271
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:07,850
to that password?

272
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:10,610
We compare it to a breach
corpus and a breach corpus

273
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:13,080
is a list of username and password sets

274
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,320
that we know to have been compromised.

275
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,330
So if a user attempts to
set a username and password

276
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:20,692
that have already been
compromised, we can say,

277
00:12:20,692 --> 00:12:22,790
you need to pick something else.

278
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,770
That's a really bad idea.

279
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:26,390
If you use that username and password,

280
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:28,040
we know this account is
going to get compromised.

281
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,270
You'll have to go through
an account recovery process

282
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:33,170
and that's going to be painful
and expensive for everyone.

283
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:37,819
And then what do we layer
on top of a password?

284
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:40,900
Well most companies have MFA as optional

285
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:44,250
but they provide a lot of MFA options.

286
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:48,430
So the most common one by far
is SMS, it's not very secure.

287
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:50,359
There are known vulnerabilities with SMS

288
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:55,130
including SIM swapping, but
it is very easy to deploy.

289
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:57,210
Even people who don't have
smartphones can receive

290
00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:00,303
an SMS message and input a short code.

291
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:04,240
We also see hardware keys,
software applications,

292
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,750
and platform biometrics.

293
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,540
And obviously you only want
to use these MFA options

294
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:09,372
or allow them

295
00:13:09,373 --> 00:13:11,150
if they're not already
set as the first factor

296
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:13,833
we don't want two factors
that are the same category.

297
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,970
Another concern that a lot of people have

298
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:20,210
about consumer identity is
adaptive authentication.

299
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:22,540
This is an interesting
technology that lets us raise

300
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:25,790
both the usability and the
security bar at the same time.

301
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:28,900
So the common implementation
of adaptive authentication is

302
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,870
that we're looking at the
context of the authentication.

303
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:34,510
So are, is the user coming
in from a new IP address?

304
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:36,162
Are they coming in from a new device?

305
00:13:36,162 --> 00:13:39,170
And we're using that to set
the authentication ceremony

306
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:42,219
and how complicated the
authentication ceremony has to be.

307
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,010
So just like Vittorio had that street

308
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:45,930
with a lot of lines earlier.

309
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:47,339
If somebody is coming in from a risk

310
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:50,710
really risky IP address
or a really risky device

311
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:53,020
we can say okay we're going
to put you through a lot

312
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:55,670
of hoops before we let
you log into this system.

313
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,610
And on the other hand,

314
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:59,790
if you're coming in from
a device we recognize,

315
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,160
an IP address we recognize,

316
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,670
in a context we recognize,
we might say, okay,

317
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,140
we're just requiring your password

318
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,819
or we're just letting
you into the application

319
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,253
because you're probably you.

320
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:10,103
In the future,

321
00:14:10,103 --> 00:14:12,650
there are interesting applications

322
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:14,530
of adaptive authentication
that I wanted to talk

323
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:15,890
about as well.

324
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:18,040
One of those is behavioral analytics.

325
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,670
So some people obsessively
check their email

326
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:22,000
check their Twitter,

327
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,030
and they do so at the
same times every day.

328
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,360
And so we can get some read

329
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,190
on whether this is the actual person

330
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:29,250
or an attacker based on their activity.

331
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,480
And this doesn't mean big brother.

332
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,920
It doesn't mean we're
sending all this activity

333
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,752
up to the cloud.

334
00:14:32,753 --> 00:14:34,430
It means locally on the
device we can look at

335
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:36,030
is this person waking
up at the normal time

336
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:36,863
they wake up?

337
00:14:36,863 --> 00:14:38,510
Are they doing the normal
things that they do

338
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,860
and use that as a factor to say, okay,

339
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,560
do we need to re authenticate do we not?

340
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,178
Should we be using two
factors or one factor?

341
00:14:45,178 --> 00:14:47,870
We can also look at passive biometrics,

342
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:49,460
things like the
accelerometer on the phone.

343
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:52,000
Am I holding my phone
the way I normally do,

344
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,173
is my voice the way it normally sounds?

345
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:57,430
And we can also look at
the sensitivity of the

346
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:58,829
of what I'm trying to do.

347
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:01,010
If I'm just checking
a personal email inbox

348
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:04,040
maybe that's a lower, lower security bar.

349
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,930
Versus if I'm making a
change to a production system

350
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:08,670
that's a high security bar.

351
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:09,860
And we may want to look at all

352
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,700
of that authentication
context and say, okay,

353
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,190
if anything in there is risky,

354
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:15,353
we really want two factors on this.

355
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:20,870
But all of this is predicated on the idea

356
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:22,870
that you are in control
of the user's account

357
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:25,600
that the user actually has
a row in your directory.

358
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,330
And a lot of people say

359
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:30,540
well my users already have
accounts somewhere else.

360
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,900
They have accounts at
Apple or at Facebook.

361
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,100
And how complicated is it to log

362
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,620
in from their social identity?

363
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,330
It turns out it's really complicated

364
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:41,813
and Vittorio is going to
explain it all to you.

365
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:45,810
- Thank you, Sarah.

366
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:49,199
Indeed working with social
connections is a one

367
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,780
of a classic things that look easy

368
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:55,280
and it is technically easy to set up

369
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:59,020
but it has some interesting
implications that can come back

370
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:02,449
come back to bite you if
you didn't plan for them.

371
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:04,500
One thing in particular is vector.

372
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,020
When you have like,

373
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:09,370
it's very easy to have these wall,

374
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:10,720
these NASCAR pages,

375
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,360
we like to call it of the providers

376
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,810
but having many of them
is actually complicated.

377
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:17,642
Like you might think

378
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,240
that you are offering to
your user the opportunity to

379
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,300
choose their own, their favorite one.

380
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:25,189
But the thing is each of those providers

381
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:28,650
will typically have its own
interpretation of the standards.

382
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:31,579
A lot of them actually
don't support standards

383
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:33,660
like Facebook, everyone likes to save it.

384
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,910
They support the penalty.

385
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,280
They don't, they don't
use a penalty connect,

386
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,480
they use something that smells like

387
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,810
but isn't exactly quite.

388
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:44,010
And also very often they want
you to use their own STK.

389
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:46,460
So one thing to consider is

390
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:50,470
if you want to work with many
different social providers

391
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:52,590
you might want to use an intermediary

392
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:55,290
both architecturally or as a service so

393
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:57,760
that you have at least
a one single place where

394
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,460
you can handle the relationships

395
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,170
and that you can handle change

396
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:04,194
without impacting all of your apps.

397
00:17:04,194 --> 00:17:07,069
The other part security of course

398
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:07,903
is very tricky.

399
00:17:07,903 --> 00:17:11,400
Like all the things that
Sarah described are predicated

400
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,579
on the ability for you
to control the account.

401
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:16,069
And instead in here

402
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:18,669
at this part of the
authentication occurs elsewhere.

403
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:21,020
And so the bar is set by someone else.

404
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:24,050
Once again, if you have the intermediary,

405
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:25,700
you can wave a things that are

406
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:28,850
in common across multiple
providers, like for example,

407
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:31,439
a multifactor authentication step

408
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,320
after they come back from their provider.

409
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,240
Another thing that happens all the time

410
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,593
and people don't think
about is a Signup Amnesia.

411
00:17:39,593 --> 00:17:42,560
As in if you have a multiple choices

412
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:47,090
when you sign up for a
service, you might, of course,

413
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:50,330
all of us have multiple social accounts

414
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:53,710
as you might not remember which
one you use for signing up.

415
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:56,860
And so the outcome is
that you sign up again

416
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:59,590
and when you sign up again,
what happens is vector.

417
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:01,310
Now you might have multiple records.

418
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:05,360
And so you, as the developer,
you need to devise ways,

419
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,631
of potentially consolidating accounts

420
00:18:07,632 --> 00:18:09,640
without violating privacy.

421
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,610
So that's another attention point that you

422
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:13,409
might want to consider.

423
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:16,270
And also when you make signup too easy

424
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:20,420
we'll see in a second that you
might have other challenges.

425
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:23,430
And then finally, one thing
that you might want to consider,

426
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:26,550
which really does happen, I promise you,

427
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:30,870
if the ability for one user
to access your application

428
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:32,159
is predicated

429
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,020
on their ability to access
their social provider,

430
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:37,300
now you are vulnerable to problems

431
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,870
with that social provider.

432
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:42,169
Let's say that if your user
does something questionable

433
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:46,060
that gets them banned from
that identity provider.

434
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:49,230
And if that identity provider
is the only route you have

435
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:52,350
for that user to reach your service,

436
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:53,719
then you are in trouble

437
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,720
because now you cannot
provide a service and so

438
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,140
you are probably not
going to be paid as well.

439
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,420
And that is a good segway
for the next thing that

440
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,670
I'd like to talk about,

441
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:05,660
which is the account recovery aspect

442
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:08,180
of a direct to consumer strategies.

443
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:11,060
I'm sure you have seen is a funny meme

444
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:12,690
on the internet in which you have

445
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:14,710
this truck that tries to retrieve a car

446
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:16,350
that fell into the bay

447
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:20,870
but then unexpectedly the
truck itself falls in the bay

448
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:24,189
and then they send a second
truck to retrieve it.

449
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:25,720
But for some reason

450
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:29,730
this truck also goes in the bay as well.

451
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:33,700
So of course we don't want to do a plan

452
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,610
for that many level of failers.

453
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:38,357
Although that's not necessarily bad.

454
00:19:38,357 --> 00:19:43,190
But the point here is whenever
you have a strategy for

455
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:44,680
signup, sign in, and similar,

456
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:49,060
make sure that you have a
viable fallback, which is,

457
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:52,070
you might think it's
obvious, but it isn't.

458
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:53,669
Let's say that, for example,

459
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:57,940
here I have a flow that is a classic flow

460
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:02,730
of a system that allow people
to sign in using their device.

461
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:05,900
So classic in device biometrics,

462
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:06,733
in this flow

463
00:20:06,733 --> 00:20:10,360
you can see in the first
step that the first thing

464
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:14,110
that the flow does is to ask the user

465
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:16,830
to sign up, to enroll,

466
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:19,610
using a different factor
when their own device

467
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:22,510
so that we can now rely on that factor

468
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:25,340
in case the device
malfunctions, is stolen,

469
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,830
is lost, and similar.

470
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:29,669
You'll be surprised by how
many people are enthusiastic

471
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:33,670
about the ability to have people
to just look at their phone

472
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:37,250
and be signed in and then basic hygiene

473
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:41,390
like making sure that you
have a fallback actually

474
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,030
don't get enough attention.

475
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,320
The other thing you might think
about is that things change

476
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:53,030
like people might tell a
certain email address available

477
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:54,180
at signup time.

478
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:57,560
And then that email might
no longer be accessible

479
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:00,300
to them at the moment which is needed.

480
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,300
When are the account goes south.

481
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,629
And this is exactly my own personal case.

482
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:05,868
I was working for one company.

483
00:21:05,868 --> 00:21:09,439
And during that time I
signed up for a number

484
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,550
of personal websites,
services, and similar,

485
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:16,950
and then once I left the
company that email was gone

486
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:19,080
of course I have no
longer have access to it.

487
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:22,340
And now years later I
still find the places

488
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:26,429
in which occasionally I
have to reset my account.

489
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:29,750
And it turns out that my
email is still the old one.

490
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:30,760
And so I need to call them.

491
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,910
So it's a pain.

492
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:35,304
So make sure whenever you have
an opportunity to interact

493
00:21:35,304 --> 00:21:38,310
with your user, to poke them,

494
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:41,120
and ask them is this email still current,

495
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,655
is this phone number still current?

496
00:21:43,655 --> 00:21:46,840
And then finally the one
thing that you might want to

497
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:51,399
consider is to have your
security, the effort,

498
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:55,850
that someone needs to go through
when they want to recover

499
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:59,350
an account to be higher
than doing sign in.

500
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:02,411
I'm sure that you have
already experienced as a user

501
00:22:02,412 --> 00:22:06,050
the occasional application
that you use once a year

502
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:08,409
the typical I'm filing my taxes.

503
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,220
And so in that scenario

504
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:12,380
it's reasonable for people to just go

505
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:15,210
and every time say I
don't have a password.

506
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:16,043
Would be ideal if they wouldn't

507
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:19,979
if they are using a password
manager but it happens.

508
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,930
But if your app is an
app which is used often

509
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:26,690
then asking people to do a bit more effort

510
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:30,020
for the account recovery is justified

511
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:32,110
because the account recovery is a moment

512
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:35,540
in which an attacker
potentially can legitimately cut

513
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:38,500
out a illegitimate user from its service.

514
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,370
And so adding a higher bar so

515
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:44,510
that you discourage people
from using the forgot password

516
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:48,433
as a route for logging in
is actually a good idea.

517
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,240
And then biometrics

518
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,336
as I just hinted at the fact that the

519
00:22:53,336 --> 00:22:57,630
you need the special attention
when it comes to recovery.

520
00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:01,470
Because of course if
the biometric on there

521
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:02,760
is on the device,

522
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,600
if the device is gone,

523
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,850
then you have a hard time retrieving it.

524
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:10,189
But the other aspect is
back there, the alternative,

525
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:11,810
which is to have the
biometric on the server

526
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:16,810
is it bad idea because the
biometrics cannot be revoked.

527
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:20,972
And so the liability of
keeping a biometrics on

528
00:23:20,972 --> 00:23:23,790
the server side is pretty tough.

529
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:25,980
But in order for you to make some

530
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:28,280
of the decisions that
are mentioning in here

531
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,530
you do need to measure how
people are using the system

532
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:33,030
with what level of tolerance,

533
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:34,510
what other routes that may follow.

534
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:36,210
And so I'd like it to once again

535
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:39,400
give back to the floor to
Sarah who will dig deeper

536
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:43,160
into the measure and
alarm aspect of solutions.

537
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,380
Sarah.

538
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,220
- Thanks.

539
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:47,760
So one of the most
complicated questions we get

540
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,140
in consumer identity is
what should I measure?

541
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:53,250
And first you want to take a step back

542
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:55,290
and think about why should I measure?

543
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:58,889
It's actually expensive to
instrument a lot of logging

544
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:02,940
and make that all that logging
into graphs and dashboards

545
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:05,500
in order to figure out
what you should measure

546
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,250
you have to figure out
why you should measure.

547
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:10,150
So public facing identity
systems are the most

548
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:11,540
common target of attackers.

549
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:13,379
This is the front door to your company.

550
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:16,370
You want to make sure
you're watching it closely

551
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:17,699
and real life usability

552
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,720
is very unpredictable where you think

553
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,460
that text fields and buttons
make complete sense to you,

554
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,420
they make complete sense
to your developers,

555
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:27,070
I guarantee they're not
going to make complete sense

556
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,750
to all of your users.

557
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,460
And the problem with that is not just

558
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:33,351
that you're going to lose people
during your signup process.

559
00:24:33,351 --> 00:24:34,550
The other problem is

560
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:36,930
that people are going to have
an incorrect mental model

561
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:38,940
of what to put in those boxes.

562
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,180
And this is very important

563
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:42,350
in a consumer identity
system because people are

564
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:44,990
putting personally identifiable
information in those boxes.

565
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:47,400
They're creating passwords in those boxes.

566
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,600
And so there is no security

567
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,250
for those things without usability.

568
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:55,210
If you don't have a good
usability that has the

569
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:57,700
the correct mental
model in the user's mind

570
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:58,820
there's a good chance
that they're going to

571
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:00,740
put the wrong thing in the wrong box.

572
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:01,573
And you're going to end

573
00:25:01,573 --> 00:25:03,680
up with a situation
where they're insecure.

574
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,940
So instrumenting collection for
these things is not trivial.

575
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,800
And you have to think
quite a bit about it.

576
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,500
First of all you're collecting personally

577
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:15,226
identifiable information and
shared secrets like passwords

578
00:25:15,226 --> 00:25:16,493
and you have to encrypt those things so

579
00:25:16,493 --> 00:25:18,230
that they don't end up in your logs

580
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:20,290
because your logs are looked
at by your developers.

581
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:21,730
Lots of people have access to them.

582
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:22,563
You want to make sure

583
00:25:22,563 --> 00:25:25,183
that you are not divulging
customer information there.

584
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,220
You have to pay attention to
who's going to look at it.

585
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:30,470
A dashboard for a developer is
going to look very different

586
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:32,440
from a dashboard for an executive

587
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,750
who's looking after the fact that,

588
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:34,740
hey there was an incident.

589
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:35,670
What time did it start?

590
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:36,708
What time did it end?

591
00:25:36,708 --> 00:25:38,730
How many people were affected?

592
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:42,280
Those are two different
methods of instrumentation.

593
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,383
So it matters who your audience is.

594
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:47,129
And what's the best way to visualize this.

595
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:48,380
Sometimes it's a histogram.

596
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,970
Sometimes it's a line graph.

597
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:53,410
Oftentimes it's a map of
where things are happening.

598
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:55,770
So you have to consider that as well.

599
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:58,950
And ultimately what you're
trying to get is taking things

600
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:01,410
from information from a row

601
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:06,380
of just lines and numbers
and letters into knowledge.

602
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:09,300
What happened in the system into wisdom.

603
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,810
What can we do about it?

604
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:12,129
Who's attacking us?

605
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:13,523
What do we do next?

606
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,710
And this being a security conference.

607
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:18,140
The main thing that we want to focus

608
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:20,320
on instrumenting is finding

609
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,810
out who attacks consumer
identity systems and why.

610
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:24,643
And the fact is

611
00:26:24,643 --> 00:26:26,420
that most people who
attack consumer identity

612
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,420
systems are very unsophisticated.

613
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,730
They're looking for airline miles

614
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:31,000
they're looking for gift cards

615
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,400
and they do so in very,
in very predictable ways,

616
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,730
for the most part, with
off the shelf tools.

617
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:40,980
So we can do some instrumentation
to find these people

618
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:44,528
in order to attach these in
order detect these attacks

619
00:26:44,528 --> 00:26:47,530
we're going to look for specific patterns.

620
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:49,649
So during a password sprang attack

621
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:51,860
you're going to see a high
volume of authentications

622
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:54,943
with correct username
and incorrect password.

623
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:57,310
During a credential stuffing attack

624
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:59,960
you'll see a high volume
of authentications again

625
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,970
but this time you'll see
an incorrect username

626
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:03,653
and an incorrect password.

627
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,440
During a password phishing attack

628
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,890
you will see a correct username

629
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:10,220
and password because the
user has been fished.

630
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:12,290
But what you're going to
see is unusual behavior.

631
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:13,190
So things like selling

632
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:15,723
off airline miles or buying gift cards.

633
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:19,690
And lastly some vendors
will aggregate insights

634
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:21,810
from other companies and alert you

635
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:23,669
if they see those same IP addresses

636
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:26,480
or that same activity
happening in your account.

637
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,170
So if you have a vendor with
multi-tenant capabilities

638
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:31,863
they may have a capacity
to can do this for you.

639
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,280
You need to alarm your
identity flow funnels.

640
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,700
When I say identity flow funnels

641
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,180
what I mean is that not all

642
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:42,050
of the people who start
registration, finish registration,

643
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:44,060
not all the people who
start account recovery

644
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,520
finished account recovery.

645
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,490
However there should
be a predictable number

646
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:49,150
of people falling off.

647
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:51,900
And if you see that suddenly change

648
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,670
then you have a big problem.

649
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:55,140
If you see a sudden drop off

650
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,500
and people who try to
recover their accounts

651
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,090
and are successful at
recovering their accounts

652
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:01,540
you may have a security issue.

653
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:02,940
You may have a usability issue.

654
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,770
You may have a technology issue.

655
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:06,040
And so you need to page someone

656
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,350
in to take a look at it immediately.

657
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:09,800
You want to do this with
your registration flows

658
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,790
your account recovery flows,
your user editing flows.

659
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:15,930
Anything that involves
editing directory information

660
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:18,113
or signing up or deleting users.

661
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:22,010
You also want an alarm
on your API responses.

662
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:22,905
So this is an example of a latency graph,

663
00:28:22,905 --> 00:28:25,970
and there's a red line here that says,

664
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:26,840
okay, things are fine.

665
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:27,673
Things are fine.

666
00:28:27,673 --> 00:28:28,506
Things are fine.

667
00:28:28,506 --> 00:28:30,150
This is where we want to page someone

668
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:32,850
and make sure that they are
looking at the system to find

669
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:36,189
out what went wrong, because
something is taking too long,

670
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:38,740
and where to put this line
is very tricky, right?

671
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:39,670
If you put it too high

672
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:41,140
you're going to have a lot of pager pain.

673
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:44,912
And the people who are on
call for you are going to be

674
00:28:44,912 --> 00:28:47,300
in the office a lot for, for no reason.

675
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,240
And they're going to be complaining.

676
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,360
Whereas if you put it too low

677
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,750
you're not going to
catch a lot of the really

678
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:54,690
severe incidents that are
happening at, in your system.

679
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:57,610
So there's a fine art as
to where to put this line

680
00:28:57,610 --> 00:28:59,080
but you do need to have it there.

681
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,600
You need to have a paging

682
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,290
on your system to make sure
you know if your API is

683
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:05,909
aren't responding in the
way that you expect them to

684
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:08,740
but there is no substitute
for a good identity team.

685
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:11,432
If you take a look at that graph again

686
00:29:11,432 --> 00:29:14,680
what would have happened
if we had had small bits

687
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,080
of latency that had never
crossed that red line

688
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,399
it would be very obvious to a
human that something's wrong

689
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,200
with the system something's going on

690
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:25,090
but unless someone is looking
at it, no one will get paged.

691
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:26,760
And so no one will know.

692
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,980
The other thing to consider
about a good identity team is

693
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:32,230
that making one person look
at that graph is not enough.

694
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:33,580
It is human nature to look

695
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:36,960
at a graph 99 times that
has no problem with it.

696
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,440
And then the hundredth time say, yeah,

697
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,870
I'm just not gonna look at it today

698
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:41,699
because it's probably fine,

699
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,750
you need to have a mechanism

700
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:44,330
where multiple people are looking at it.

701
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:46,822
So bring it up at the
beginning of your team meeting

702
00:29:46,823 --> 00:29:50,620
look at the dashboard for your service

703
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:52,209
keep it up on a wall in a hallway

704
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:54,520
make sure that people are
looking at it on a regular basis.

705
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,353
That it's not just one

706
00:29:55,353 --> 00:29:57,850
person's responsibility to
open it and take a look.

707
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:02,550
So with that here's a few
things we want you to remember

708
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,250
from the talk today.

709
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:07,180
Security and usability must be balanced.

710
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,490
You should measure and alarm

711
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:10,310
and expect the unexpected,

712
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:12,169
identity systems are very unpredictable

713
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:14,700
as Vittoria and I can both attest

714
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:18,310
and expect and fund process
and not magic checkboxes.

715
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:19,210
You get what you pay for

716
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:22,620
both in terms of software
and in terms of people.

717
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:25,379
And we put together a list
for you of action items.

718
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:28,130
You can take after our
talk today to apply what

719
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:30,230
you've learned in your workplace.

720
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:32,970
So next week you should identify
stakeholders that can help

721
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:35,670
with customer and data inquiries.

722
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:37,650
In the first three months,
following this presentation,

723
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:40,900
you should track down the kind
of data you need to capture

724
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:43,820
and through which life cycle
segment your target customers

725
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:45,740
according to digital literacy, tolerance,

726
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:48,570
how you can authenticate
them, things like that.

727
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:49,679
And then within six months

728
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,520
you should establish a data protection

729
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,550
authentication experience strategy

730
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:55,899
and start staging the
work in release planning.

731
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,770
So with that, thank you very much.

732
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:00,280
You can find us both on Twitter.

733
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,120
Please stay to fill out
the speaker evaluations.

734
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:04,370
We're also available for questions.

735
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:06,090
We really appreciate being here today.

736
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:07,379
Thank you.

737
00:31:07,379 --> 00:31:09,129
- Thank you everyone.
