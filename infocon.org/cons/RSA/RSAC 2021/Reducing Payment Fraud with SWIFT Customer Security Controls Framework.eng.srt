1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:03,630
- Hello. My name is Cheri McGuire

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:06,520
and I am a non-resident
scholar in Cybersecurity

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,530
at the Carnegie Endowment
for International Peace.

4
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:11,360
I'm also the Former Group CISO

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,730
at Standard Chartered Bank in London.

6
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:17,340
I'd like to welcome all of
you today and our panelists,

7
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,390
and thank you in the
audience for joining us

8
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,060
at the Annual RSA Conference

9
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:22,570
for this important session

10
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:26,060
on how the SWIFT Customer
Security Controls Framework

11
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:28,830
is reducing payment fraud worldwide

12
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,810
and keeping our payment
networks more secure.

13
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:34,800
For those in our audience who
are not familiar with SWIFT,

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,440
it is a global member owned cooperative

15
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,860
of more than 13,000 customers

16
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:43,710
across approximately 220 countries.

17
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,250
And it is the leading provider

18
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,880
of secure financial messaging services

19
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,150
that includes payment
processing at its core.

20
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:52,930
While there is still more to be done,

21
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:55,610
SWIFT and its member
financial institutions

22
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:58,830
have made a real difference in
raising the bar for security

23
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:00,900
by developing and driving adoption

24
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,610
of the SWIFT Customer
Security Controls Framework

25
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:05,980
that we're going to discuss today.

26
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:08,770
I'm pleased to say that we have
three great experts with us

27
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:10,520
who are going to share their insights

28
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,520
and deep dive into the
topic of what it is,

29
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,770
how it is evolving,

30
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:16,450
and what are the things we can do

31
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:20,540
to proactively and more
effectively improve the security

32
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:23,010
of payment networks that
are critically important

33
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:25,830
to our national and global economies.

34
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:26,760
In the past year,

35
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,510
we've seen continued
growth in online fraud,

36
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:31,510
much of it driven by the pandemic.

37
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:34,180
And we've also seen significant growth in,

38
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:37,070
and the sophistication
of traditional attacks,

39
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:39,270
including ransomware, phishing,

40
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:43,830
and credential theft to perpetrate
fraudulent transactions.

41
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:46,000
But the journey to improve
security of the global

42
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,950
and interconnected payment infrastructure

43
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:50,060
in a holistic manner,

44
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,520
didn't start just in the past year,

45
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,420
it really started more than 20 years ago.

46
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,780
However, it was just five years ago

47
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,420
that a major breach occurred,

48
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,730
and that was the catalyst for change

49
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:04,010
that brought together
the financial industry,

50
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:06,830
central banks, regulatory authorities

51
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:09,789
and payment technology
infrastructure providers

52
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:11,870
to improve how payment security

53
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:14,400
would be standardized and evaluated

54
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,100
to provide the levels
of security assurance

55
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:20,780
that customers and
governments worldwide expect.

56
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:23,540
So let's get started
with our three panelists.

57
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:26,220
First, we have Bill
Hoffman at Deutsche Bank,

58
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,830
who is the regional
CISO for UK and Ireland

59
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:32,100
in the Technology, Data
and Innovation division,

60
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,900
Chief Security office,

61
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:38,540
and the Head of the CISO
Governance and Control function.

62
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:42,310
Next, we have JF Legault
at JP Morgan Chase,

63
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,810
who is the Managing Director

64
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:46,310
and Business Information security officer

65
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:49,420
for the Corporate and
Investment Banking Division,

66
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:54,000
as well as Global Head of
Cybersecurity Operations.

67
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,070
And third, we have Brett
Lancaster at SWIFT,

68
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:58,480
who is Managing Director

69
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,100
and Global Head of Customer Security,

70
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:04,239
and the Director of the
Customer Security Program

71
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,633
or the CSP.

72
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:07,890
I'm really looking forward to hearing

73
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:09,309
what you all have to say.

74
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:12,860
So without any further
delay, let's get started.

75
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,090
Brett, let's start with you first.

76
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:17,360
If you could provide us
with a short overview

77
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,020
of the SWIFT CSP,

78
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,620
and then we'll get into
the panel discussion

79
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,450
with you JF and Bill.

80
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:23,662
Brett, over to you.

81
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,640
- Cheri, thank you very much indeed.

82
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,903
If you can pick up the
first line, that'd be great.

83
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:34,010
So you're totally right,

84
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:36,750
so SWIFT, just to give
a one second background,

85
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,410
we are industry owned,

86
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:40,770
we are a financial services cooperative,

87
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:42,360
we don't seek to maximize profit

88
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,910
and indeed we are not a bank.

89
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:44,743
You're absolutely right,

90
00:03:44,743 --> 00:03:46,049
we don't hold accounts.

91
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:48,580
But what we do do is
connect those little dots

92
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,910
that you see on the graphics.

93
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:53,690
So essentially we are
a messaging provider,

94
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:55,510
and the difference
between that and the bank

95
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:58,980
is that we will tell you
a financial instructions

96
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,390
as to when you went to make a payment.

97
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:04,440
So we're talking about large institutional

98
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,790
bank to bank transfers,

99
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:08,600
rather than retail or consumer,

100
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,989
yes, 13,000 customers,

101
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:13,150
all the big banks on a
global basis, 220 countries.

102
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,714
You're totally right.

103
00:04:14,714 --> 00:04:17,219
And we do a fair few of these messages,

104
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,810
some 8 billion in 2020.

105
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:23,280
The real kicker here is
that we have big uptime,

106
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,869
so 99.999% in terms of
overall availability,

107
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,470
or in terms of resilience.

108
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,030
All the major banks use SWIFT,

109
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:34,039
and indeed that is our raison d'etre.

110
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,030
However, you're totally right.

111
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:38,270
In 2016, bit of a wake-up call,

112
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:40,590
it was ground zero for SWIFT

113
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:43,560
in terms of cyber
attacks on our customers,

114
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,660
and indeed the bank of Bangladesh

115
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,690
was subject to a well documented

116
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:51,780
advanced persistent threat cyber attack,

117
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,119
conducted, we believe by Lazarus

118
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,950
or more accurately,
the Bluenoroff Subgroup

119
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:59,400
of Lazarus out of North Korea.

120
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,409
Now, the aim of the compromise

121
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:05,190
was to inject a number of
fraudulent payment messages

122
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:07,280
being sent from the Bank of Bangladesh

123
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,669
to a number of various beneficiary banks.

124
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:13,280
So yes, Bank of Bangladesh
was the first attack,

125
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,690
that's true, but certainly not the last.

126
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:18,270
And even though the number of attacks

127
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,740
have continued since 2016,

128
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,950
the overall modus operandi
of how these things work

129
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,120
hasn't really changed,

130
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,440
and I think it's worth
spending maybe 30 seconds

131
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,290
on how these guys get in and what they do.

132
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:30,860
So the first mile they get in,

133
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:33,023
classic usual way of getting in,

134
00:05:34,607 --> 00:05:36,380
one of the usuals is that somebody

135
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:37,969
will click on the link,

136
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:41,650
typically on reaching
employee of the bank.

137
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:43,359
Once they got into the email service

138
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,880
then they will laterally pivot over

139
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,320
and find their way to the back office

140
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,650
and where the SWIFT infrastructure sits in

141
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:53,370
and then connects to the SWIFT network.

142
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:55,080
Once they gain a foothold,

143
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,556
then first thing you usually
do is conduct themselves

144
00:05:58,557 --> 00:06:00,860
and put a command control line in

145
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:04,000
so they can talk to their base
pump back wherever they live.

146
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,270
After that, the progression

147
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,219
laterally over towards
the SWIFT infrastructure

148
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,860
that sits in the back office

149
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,070
is somewhat described
as being low and slow,

150
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:14,270
they do not want to be found out.

151
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,103
And as they go,

152
00:06:15,103 --> 00:06:16,320
as they find out more things

153
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,349
about the infrastructure and the networks,

154
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:22,110
then there are load all sorts
of wonderful zero-day malware.

155
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:26,310
So keyloggers and screenshot
software, et cetera, et cetera.

156
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:28,280
The key once they find
this SWIFT infrastructure

157
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,099
is to gain valid user credentials.

158
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,680
So if I'm an operator of
the SWIFT infrastructure,

159
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,420
and I want to enter a payment for,

160
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:38,450
let's say 10 million Euros
from my bank to your bank,

161
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:40,490
they're looking for the valid ID

162
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:42,420
and password of those users,

163
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:45,230
using either keylogging
and/or screenshots.

164
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:46,250
Once they get that,

165
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,460
then the whole hell will break loose

166
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:51,700
and they will inject a number
of fraudulent messages,

167
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,680
could be one, could be two,

168
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,230
could be five, could
be 10, maybe up to 100.

169
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:58,890
And the kicker here is that each message

170
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:02,440
could be somewhere between
250,000 equivalent Dollars

171
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,610
up to say 10 or 20 million US Dollars.

172
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:06,510
That is the kind of order of magnitude

173
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:08,291
that we're talking about.

174
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:09,780
This is not retail,

175
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:12,063
this is not end to end customers.

176
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:16,150
The typical aim of where these guys are,

177
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:18,340
there are stories at small banks,

178
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,840
and they're typically
in a high risk country,

179
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,659
so where the Basel AML
country corruption risk index

180
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:25,720
is under eight or a
nine or a 10 out of 10.

181
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,300
It's the same modus operandi that is true,

182
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:31,860
but the individual IOCs and
the TTPs are always different.

183
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:32,750
And for us,

184
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:36,000
it was a bit of a wake-up
call in terms of SWIFT.

185
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,780
Cheri, next slide, please.

186
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,359
Thank you very much.

187
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,090
So in response,

188
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:46,210
SWIFT launched the Customer
Security Program or CSP.

189
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:50,039
Now CSP is a multi-year,
multi-faceted initiative

190
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,270
which aims essentially to raise the bar

191
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,500
of cybersecurity hygiene

192
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,980
for all of our costumers, all 13,000.

193
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:58,630
Very easy to say, much more
difficult to actually do,

194
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:02,120
and thereby try and reduce the
risk of these cyber attacks

195
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,130
and also minimize the impact

196
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:08,010
of these fraudulent
transactions if they occur.

197
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:11,090
SWIFT oriented the whole CSP program

198
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:14,429
around these three blobs.

199
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:16,100
First of all, it's around you,

200
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,960
you being the end point institution

201
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,520
such as in this case the bank.

202
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,419
These things could be hard,

203
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:26,350
and interfaces making sure
that the encryption is going

204
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:30,730
or maybe making sure that we
can respond to the incident.

205
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:31,563
And at the heart,

206
00:08:31,563 --> 00:08:33,650
there are a bunch of security controls

207
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:35,470
as well as how the customer

208
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:36,600
then attests and complies

209
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,580
against that I'll get to in a second.

210
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:39,850
We also have independent assurance

211
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:41,120
and also supervisory reporting,

212
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,330
those are core.

213
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:44,320
I'll get to those in a second.

214
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,920
The second blob is
around your counterparty,

215
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,040
so we realized that the
end point institution

216
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,730
the bank in this case does
not operate in the vacuum

217
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:54,860
and they send these transactions
from one party to other.

218
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,930
So do we do counterparty risk management?

219
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:00,280
How do you know whether the
counterparty you're dealing with

220
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,970
indeed is cyber secure or not?

221
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:05,100
And then the third of the other blobs

222
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,380
is around the community as a whole.

223
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,990
So intelligence sharing,

224
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:09,990
how we engage with the market,

225
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:13,870
and how we engage upon
industry initiatives.

226
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:16,630
Now at the very core of CSP

227
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:20,070
are the set of cybersecurity controls,

228
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:22,710
which are really aimed to
protect the SWIFT infrastructure

229
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:24,710
that then connects to the SWIFT network

230
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:27,030
that you saw on the previous graphic.

231
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:32,030
These are all based on NIST
ISO 27,000 and PCI DSS,

232
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,640
a few tweaks to make them
specific for around SWIFT,

233
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:39,710
but essentially all of our
controls map back to those three,

234
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:42,350
and you can do those on
a one-to-one mapping.

235
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:44,290
So the controls are split into ones

236
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:45,870
that we define as being mandatory,

237
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,940
either the customer has to not only a test

238
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,340
but also comply with
the mandatory control,

239
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,430
and also ones that are advisory,

240
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:54,760
and they're all oriented around

241
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,080
seven different themes insecurity.

242
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,730
So network segregation,

243
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:01,080
reducing the attack service,

244
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,880
physical security, protecting credentials,

245
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,110
managing identities, detecting anomalies

246
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:07,920
and instant response.

247
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,360
I know over each year,

248
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,200
every customer has to attest
the level of compliance

249
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,560
against these controls.

250
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,709
And as time goes by,

251
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:18,160
we look to raise the bar

252
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,480
by either adding new advisory controls

253
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,593
or by promoting ones that
were advisory into mandatory.

254
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:29,433
Next slide please, Cheri.
Thank you very much.

255
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,900
So this is a simple graphic

256
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:38,860
that tries to show the evolution
of how we have compliance

257
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:41,310
across all of our 13,000 customers.

258
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:44,829
So back in 2017, where it's all in red,

259
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:45,727
we had 27 controls,

260
00:10:45,727 --> 00:10:47,930
and we asked all our
customers simply a test

261
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:51,739
but not necessarily
comply by the end of 2017.

262
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:54,210
Now across all our customer citations,

263
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:57,110
the result was a compliance
level per control

264
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:58,650
of just under 77%.

265
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:00,810
And that then increased year by year

266
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:02,430
to over to the right-hand side

267
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:06,000
where we have in January
of this year, 2021,

268
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,440
an overall compliance of 97% per control.

269
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,460
It gives you a very simple
depiction of those categories

270
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,100
as to where compliance lies.

271
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:17,870
So for me, these colored hexes try to show

272
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:20,200
that we have an engaged community,

273
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,840
and indeed we're trying to show

274
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:26,610
that the community has got an uplift

275
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:29,380
and indeed they are starting
to comply with the controls

276
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:32,090
and hopefully starting
to make a difference.

277
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:33,420
That's a very quick intro.

278
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,459
I don't know whether I'm in,

279
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,394
or out of my 10 minutes,

280
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:37,073
Cheri, but back to you.

281
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,660
- Perfect. Well, thank you so much Brett

282
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,410
for that excellent overview.

283
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:44,520
I think it really demonstrates

284
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,730
the starting point of the program

285
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:49,210
and to where it is today

286
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:53,550
and the way that it is
raising that bar as you said.

287
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:58,250
So let's get into the
discussion part of this session

288
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:01,390
which I think really hopefully bring out

289
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:05,370
some points around both the challenges

290
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:07,670
and the opportunities that have emerged

291
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:12,219
and are continuing to emerge
as this program continues on

292
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:16,000
in its overall longer-term
strategic journey.

293
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Let's start with the first question,

294
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,040
is the SWIFT CSP making a difference?

295
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,640
And if so, how?

296
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,860
And really, can any of you talk at all

297
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:31,860
about how it's impacted
or reduced payment fraud

298
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:34,740
against financial institutions
or the sector as a whole?

299
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,380
What are some of the
indicators that you're seeing

300
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,973
that it's really doing the trick?

301
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,670
- Well, you know, maybe if I start,

302
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,790
when you look at Brett's diagram,

303
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,550
like we're seeing adoption,

304
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:48,089
we're seeing organizations

305
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:50,560
demonstrate compliance the controls,

306
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,790
but a lot of organizations
were already doing this.

307
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:55,130
And I think a lot of the value here

308
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:58,400
has been the engagement

309
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,900
between cybersecurity
organizations and the business.

310
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,220
For me, like I've been
having conversations

311
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:06,870
with our clients over the years,

312
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,700
it used to be that I'd walk into a session

313
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,300
with my colleagues and wholesale payments

314
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,459
that handle financial messaging

315
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,233
and they would only be the counterparties,

316
00:13:16,233 --> 00:13:18,380
they would only be the treasury leaders.

317
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:22,490
And now what we're actually
seeing is participation

318
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:24,400
from the cybersecurity organization.

319
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,040
And it's actually created this crossover

320
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,219
where we have some
wholesale payments for teams

321
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:33,210
that are extremely well
versed in cybersecurity.

322
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:36,590
They're extremely,
well-versed in fraud, right?

323
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:40,310
And this is just another aspect of fraud.

324
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:41,760
I don't want to minimize it,

325
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,180
but, you know we were
dealing with business email,

326
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,699
compromised malware,

327
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,230
and then you throw on compromise

328
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:51,610
of SWIFT end points of
financial institutions,

329
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:55,740
and it was how do you bring together

330
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:59,640
cybersecurity controls and
payment controls, right?

331
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:03,130
Historically you had one side of the house

332
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:04,780
in many many organizations

333
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,870
that were solely focused
on the cyber controls

334
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:09,090
and the other side that
were solely focused

335
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:11,110
on the transactional controls.

336
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:12,450
And now what you're actually doing

337
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:15,190
is you're using cybersecurity information

338
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:19,530
and coupling that with mitigation controls

339
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:21,819
that exist in the business and vice versa.

340
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,470
So when you become aware

341
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:25,930
of a potentially compromised counterparty,

342
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:28,660
well, it's not about
shutting down circuits,

343
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,469
it's not about anything like that, right?

344
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:33,420
It's using circuit breakers
like the sibling RAMs

345
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,229
to prevent money from moving

346
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:38,000
until the organization's
actually had an opportunity

347
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,760
to attest or confirm

348
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,510
that they've done that
kind of validation. Right?

349
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:44,740
So for me, a lot of the help here

350
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:47,877
has been bringing together
the business side of the house

351
00:14:47,877 --> 00:14:49,689
and the technology side of the house

352
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:51,790
and the cybersecurity side of house

353
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:54,079
into a common baseline set of terms

354
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,313
and language that we can all work towards.

355
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,250
- Yeah, I would agree with that JF.

356
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,700
It's interesting we didn't
compare notes on that before,

357
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,700
but I think that's certainly
our headline topic.

358
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:07,340
Anytime security gets a
chance to sit around the table

359
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,330
with the business and with technology,

360
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:12,480
helps drive that cultural
shift in our organizations

361
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,120
that kind of raises the bar

362
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,803
to use Brett's term from his presentation.

363
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:21,020
I'm thinking about not
just the internal view

364
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,319
but also outside of our
organizations, right?

365
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,870
I think the large banks

366
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:29,140
are used to collaborating with
each other on cyber topics.

367
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:30,730
What the framework does though

368
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,180
is it creates an environment

369
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,420
where we have banks of
different levels of maturity

370
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:36,469
that are spending more time collaborating

371
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:37,687
with each other as well.

372
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:40,380
And we're all working
toward a common standard,

373
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,000
there's mechanisms that allow us

374
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,730
to share information with each other,

375
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:46,810
and it opens the door
for more of the community

376
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:49,829
to collaborate on reducing
cybersecurity risk

377
00:15:51,292 --> 00:15:53,043
across the entire ecosystem.

378
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:57,300
- Thank Cheri, just one thing to add

379
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,380
in terms of making a difference

380
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:01,470
and a kind of overall effectiveness.

381
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:05,150
We've seen that we've been
now going for five years,

382
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:09,060
we have seen a drop in the amount of funds

383
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:11,119
that these bad guys get away with.

384
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,435
So year by year,

385
00:16:12,435 --> 00:16:13,670
you know, from the funds attempted,

386
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:16,770
which they'll always
start to knock on the door

387
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:17,949
and you can't really stop that,

388
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:19,630
but we've definitely seen a reduction

389
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:23,990
as car customers having
implemented these controls.

390
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:26,430
We've definitely seen the amount of money

391
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:28,180
that has gone out the door,

392
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,160
gone down dramatically.

393
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,829
And it's a testament to as you say,

394
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:33,170
engagement from the community,

395
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:35,050
but we're not done.

396
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:36,430
We are by no means done.

397
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:38,579
There's always gonna be more stuff to do.

398
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,970
And these guys are pretty smart,

399
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:41,327
they learn and they evolve,

400
00:16:41,327 --> 00:16:42,960
and we need to kind of keep,

401
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,653
kind of half a step ahead
in this sort of arms race.

402
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:47,892
- That's a great point Brett,

403
00:16:47,893 --> 00:16:50,030
like the learning from the attacks

404
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:53,260
continuing to monitor adversary TTPs,

405
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:55,010
and you know, not skipping ahead,

406
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:57,360
I think it becomes even more important

407
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,400
to keep the controls up to date

408
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,497
with the activity that we're seeing,

409
00:17:01,497 --> 00:17:02,329
and you were talking about

410
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:03,710
the advisory controls--
- Yes.

411
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:04,940
- And adding them,

412
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,880
but a lot of that comes through dialogue

413
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,343
and the exchange that results from CSP

414
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:16,290
- Maybe we could pivot
off of that comment JF

415
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:20,180
around keeping the controls up to date.

416
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:22,490
I think this is a particular challenge

417
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:23,980
that organizations face

418
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:28,460
especially with the rapid
digital transformations

419
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:32,110
that all financial industry and beyond

420
00:17:33,151 --> 00:17:36,990
are experiencing in
particular this past year

421
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:40,800
with that acceleration
due to do the pandemic.

422
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,360
Can any of you talk at all

423
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,139
about some of the challenges

424
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:49,090
making that shift with the business

425
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:51,270
both from a cultural standpoint

426
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:54,560
as well as from a technology perspective,

427
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,800
making that shift from being

428
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,250
that focused on the transaction controls

429
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:02,520
to now having to shift
to be more inclusive

430
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,440
of other cybersecurity, fraud prevention,

431
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,120
other risk controls
that we would implement

432
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,662
inside large organizations.

433
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:11,800
What are some of the tips

434
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,409
you might give to others

435
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:14,470
who are trying to manage

436
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:18,680
through that challenging
sometimes business culture

437
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,110
of making those kinds of changes?

438
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:24,070
Anyone who wanna comment on that?

439
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,629
- Yeah, I can share some thoughts on that.

440
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:28,810
I think number one, as
security practitioners,

441
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:30,950
obviously we've got an obligation

442
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:33,060
to protect our organizations,

443
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:35,460
but we also have an obligation
to our business, right?

444
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,360
We're there to protect the business

445
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,189
but we also need to recognize

446
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:41,430
that we have a role to play
in preserving the velocity

447
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:43,220
at which our businesses are moving, right?

448
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,550
And I think historically,

449
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:45,730
there's always been this tension

450
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:47,740
between business and security,

451
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,610
you know, the security
office is going to say no,

452
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:52,490
so the business is not going
to tell them what's going on.

453
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:54,780
And I think over the
years we've realized that,

454
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:57,620
in certainly building off
of the experience of CSP

455
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:59,239
and some other examples,

456
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:02,120
when we work together on an
initiative from the beginning,

457
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,870
and I don't mean, you know, pre go live.

458
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:06,899
I mean, when we're talking
about the earliest conception

459
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,160
of a new business priority,

460
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,890
a new business product,
a new business flow,

461
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:14,600
it allows us to better
design and integrate security

462
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,010
from the very early stages
of that project. Right?

463
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:18,640
The worst thing that we can do

464
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,390
is try and retrofit a
security architecture

465
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:24,260
around a product right before
it's supposed to go live.

466
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,300
And so, you know,

467
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:28,040
the more we have these
opportunities to work together

468
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,139
and increase the level of trust

469
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:33,050
between security practitioners
and the business,

470
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:34,580
the more context we have,

471
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:37,340
the more likely we are
to hear from each other,

472
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,669
you know, when we're
working on something new

473
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:40,200
that could have an impact.

474
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,840
At the same time,

475
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,110
we are also innovating in
the security space, right?

476
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:46,010
And that gives us opportunities,

477
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:48,760
especially the better we know
the business to figure out,

478
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,480
hey, how is it that
something that we're doing

479
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,550
maybe in the case of digital identity

480
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:55,070
can actually facilitate the
business and solve a problem

481
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,639
that they've been kind of struggling with

482
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,350
or been creating friction

483
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:00,010
in terms of the business environment.

484
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:03,570
So again, having that open relationship

485
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:05,510
and that existing network

486
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:07,400
allows us to better support the business

487
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,540
and protect them as well.
- Okay.

488
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,980
- Yeah. I think you hit the
nail on the head, right?

489
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,780
The enablement component of cybersecurity

490
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,120
has become critical,

491
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,340
it's no longer about saying no,

492
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,570
it's about saying how,

493
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:20,399
it's about anticipating business needs,

494
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:25,340
but it's also about exposing
the threat landscape, right?

495
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:27,720
I spent a lot of time
with business leaders

496
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,250
talking about the threat landscape,

497
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:34,250
sharing examples of what
happens when there are issues.

498
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:38,000
And we have a whole slew of examples

499
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,440
since the pandemic began

500
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,070
of organizations that made the shift

501
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:44,120
way too quickly to work from home,

502
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:48,580
exposing RDP servers,
exposing single-factor VPNs.

503
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,790
And what's become important

504
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:53,649
is that shift from what I would say

505
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:57,270
like cybersecurity
incidents to resiliency,

506
00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:01,639
meaning how do we look at this
end to end to ensure, right?

507
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:05,010
Like the five nines as
Brett was mentioning

508
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:07,210
for money movement,

509
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:08,850
how do we ensure the availability,

510
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:12,439
the resilience of the entire sector?

511
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:15,480
And that includes the
financial institutions,

512
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,100
includes a service provider

513
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:21,620
that provides services to
other financial institutions,

514
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:26,560
ensuring that there is a lens
on that availability aspect.

515
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:29,460
You know, he's mentioned
ransomware as an example,

516
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,490
ransomware isn't what we're gonna see

517
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:35,240
that directly affects payments,

518
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,590
but you know, it's part of
the scorched earth strategy

519
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:42,220
that's often employed by an
adversary to hide their trails,

520
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:45,030
or some of these remote access,

521
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:47,610
and we're seeing adversary
selling credentials

522
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:49,030
on the underground

523
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:52,139
that are subsequently
used to breach networks.

524
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:54,550
Well, you know, it's a lot
easier to get a foothold,

525
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:57,149
but you don't need to
breach the perimeter first,

526
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:59,440
and you actually have remote access.

527
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,440
So it's thinking of how we take away

528
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,840
that first step,

529
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:08,409
that first aspect in the attack path

530
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,380
that an adversary would use

531
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:11,240
to breach a network

532
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,700
and ensure the availability
of the sector, right?

533
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,480
Because our job is to make sure

534
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,470
that your payment are confidential,

535
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:18,640
that there's integrity

536
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,740
but there's also availability.

537
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:23,520
And it feels like the A was forgotten

538
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,550
for a lot of years by
cyber security, right?

539
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:28,230
And now we're bringing back

540
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:30,500
that concept of operational resilience,

541
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,490
looking at the end to end

542
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:35,880
and making sure that organizations
can continue to operate.

543
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:40,350
So as we evolve with considering
that threat landscape

544
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:43,699
and seeing how we have that communication

545
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,050
with our business partners,

546
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:49,129
with industry around the availability.

547
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:52,180
- And indeed even
designing the CSP controls

548
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:54,130
as they are now and how they evolve,

549
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:56,840
we could not do a fully
grown up conversation

550
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,850
with the business,

551
00:22:57,850 --> 00:22:59,149
so they wanna get down API,

552
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:00,140
they wanna go down real-time,

553
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,150
they wanna get down cloud,

554
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:02,140
they wanna get down,

555
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:04,280
and all these things you
have to kind of make sure

556
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,620
that whatever controls you have

557
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,669
it's going to make sure
that you're intimated

558
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:09,740
from whatever the crazy business things

559
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:10,940
that they're gonna go and dream up,

560
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:13,350
and whatever you have,
you're gonna fit the bill.

561
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:16,419
Easy to say again very
few would actually do.

562
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:19,980
- But I think that was one
of the good things about CSP,

563
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:24,000
is it was driven by outcomes
and not prescriptive controls.

564
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,950
So it's a lot easier to
evolve with an outcome

565
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:29,420
than a prescriptive control.

566
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:31,600
So as platforms change,

567
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,629
as you mentioned like APIs--
- Exactly.

568
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:37,350
- The cloud, the outcome
is still the same,

569
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:39,740
you don't need to dictate
the prescriptive control,

570
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:42,950
and I think that was one
of the successes of CSP,

571
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:45,840
was the language that was used,

572
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,550
because every financial
institution is different,

573
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:52,200
and we've seen other frameworks
being incredibly challenging

574
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,770
because they're so prescriptive, right?

575
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:59,770
That's what made it adoptable
in a short period of time.

576
00:24:01,689 --> 00:24:06,370
- Well, let's talk about
that outcome based resilience

577
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:07,820
or risk reduction,

578
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,480
how do you all see,

579
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,780
and maybe Brett we can start with you.

580
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:14,840
How has SWIFT changed the landscape

581
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:19,350
for counterparty risk and resilience

582
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:21,092
and intelligent sharing?

583
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:24,810
Those counterparty risks...

584
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:27,909
we take those on as large
institutions oftentimes

585
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:30,730
and don't oftentimes have a clear view

586
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:33,360
into what their levels of
risk or resilience are.

587
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,350
Maybe you can talk about
how this has helped

588
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:39,740
create more trust in
the overall ecosystem.

589
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,157
- Well, I don't think we're there

590
00:24:41,157 --> 00:24:43,120
yet totally with
counterparty risk management

591
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,719
in terms of change the landscape.

592
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,100
I think changing the landscape,

593
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,679
this is a bit of a conversation,
a bit of a journey.

594
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:51,110
I think the first thing
we realized as SWIFT,

595
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:53,610
look, we're not the policemen here,

596
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:56,439
all we can do is give the tools to our...

597
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,940
Our counterpart is now our community,

598
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,430
and let them decide.

599
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:03,380
So first decision was to give them

600
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:06,050
not just the facility that they
can actually go look this up

601
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:08,557
but then the ability
to ask a counterparty,

602
00:25:08,557 --> 00:25:09,977
"Hey, I need to see,

603
00:25:09,977 --> 00:25:10,893
"how are you doing against those controls?

604
00:25:10,893 --> 00:25:12,767
"Are you compliant or not compliant,

605
00:25:12,767 --> 00:25:15,080
"or are you still kind
of working on them?"

606
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,790
And that suddenly changed
the whole conversation

607
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:20,720
because then you have all
the information in the world,

608
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,490
very, very granular,

609
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:24,140
the information around whether these guys

610
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:26,060
meet those controls or
don't meet these controls,

611
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:28,659
and then they can make
a risk based decision,

612
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,427
combine it with their REM systems,

613
00:25:30,427 --> 00:25:31,469
and then off they go

614
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:34,880
in terms of whatever remediation
measures they want to take

615
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,300
but it's their decision.

616
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,220
It's not SWIFT's decision,

617
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:38,690
it was not the supervisors decisions,

618
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:39,523
it's their decision

619
00:25:39,523 --> 00:25:41,639
as to how they're gonna manage
their counterparty risk.

620
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,530
It's a conversation
which has not yet ended.

621
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:46,420
I think some are very, very mature,

622
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,940
I would say Deutsche
Bank and JP Morgan Chase

623
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,590
very, very mature in
terms of their outlook

624
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,530
and with that we have a whole long tail

625
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:55,740
that can only just managed
to attest and comply

626
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,767
let alone then get to
counterparty risk management,

627
00:25:57,767 --> 00:25:59,973
and I think that's the
next chapter for us.

628
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,229
- Yeah, definitely--
- Yeah.

629
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:04,063
- Sorry, JF.

630
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:05,613
I think that is the hardest
part of the program, right?

631
00:26:05,613 --> 00:26:09,200
Is that we have access to information

632
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,330
that we've never had before,

633
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:13,159
large volumes of information
about our counterparties

634
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,460
about their control environment,

635
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:16,660
and now what do we do with it? Right?

636
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,010
It's like the--
- Exactly.

637
00:26:19,313 --> 00:26:20,380
- You know, and it's interesting

638
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:23,950
'cause we compare this
to other types of risks

639
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:26,270
that we're used to managing
with our counterparts, right?

640
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:27,103
So credit risks,

641
00:26:27,103 --> 00:26:29,330
were banks were very
used to kind of evaluate

642
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:32,000
credit risk in making
decisions of of those,

643
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,120
and although it doesn't work perfectly,

644
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,610
I think there's a model there that says,

645
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:37,909
okay, we've got very specific data points,

646
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:39,360
we can use that to benchmark

647
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,949
against different classes of counterparts

648
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:41,810
that we deal with,

649
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:43,200
we can benchmark ourselves

650
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,670
'cause we know where that kind of fits in,

651
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:47,590
but there's definitely
room to grow in that space,

652
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:49,300
and I think that clearly is the focus

653
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,300
for the evolution of the framework

654
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,790
in addition to kind of
the continuous improvement

655
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:55,610
on the controls.

656
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:59,520
- Yeah, and it's considering all aspects

657
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,830
of counterparty risk, right?

658
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:04,990
So looking at multiple facets, credit risk

659
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:08,940
or country risk or the likes
as part of decision-making.

660
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:11,890
So it's not relying on a
single set of factors, right?

661
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:13,100
So it's not a binary,

662
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,209
yes, no decision.

663
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:16,500
It's looking at all of
the elements of data

664
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,250
that are available to us,

665
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:22,540
but it's also, you know, one
little or less spoken about

666
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,010
like the SWIFT ISAC, right?

667
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:25,420
It's the intelligent sharing,

668
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:27,633
it's the communication
between the organizations

669
00:27:27,633 --> 00:27:29,700
that has stemmed for this,

670
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:32,620
whereby if there's an ongoing issue

671
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:36,629
there is communication across
the sector around that,

672
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:39,543
there is an element of
information sharing.

673
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,530
There is information
available to SWIFT members

674
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:45,330
if there is such an issue,

675
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:50,010
so that organizations can
take the mitigation steps

676
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:51,200
to reduce the risk.

677
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,750
So I'm always thinking like,

678
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:54,180
how do you prevent it from happening,

679
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:57,250
but also like how do
you mitigate that risk

680
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:59,310
once it materializes.

681
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:02,620
And the SWIFT ISAC has helped
with that aspect as well?

682
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:04,610
- I think information
sharing is totally key,

683
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:06,860
and even back on the
counterparty risk management,

684
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:09,629
I know that Bill we're
working with you guys

685
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:11,770
on an eBook white paper,

686
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:13,850
just to answer that question
so you have all this data,

687
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:14,790
what the hell did you do with it?

688
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:15,860
How do you then crunch it

689
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,229
and work out where your
remediation steps are?

690
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:21,250
So I think this is a constant evolution

691
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:22,480
not just in terms of the control

692
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,000
but also in terms of people's awareness,

693
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,300
make sure the education is there,

694
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:28,490
make sure we as SWIFT are
engaging with the community,

695
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:29,520
and if there is,

696
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,040
you know, the beginning
of a learning curve there,

697
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,300
then we'll hopefully we're out there

698
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,870
with white papers and so forth

699
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:36,850
to help their education.

700
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:38,740
I know Bill, you're very
very keen on this stuff

701
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:41,000
'cause you're quite mature.

702
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,290
- Yeah. I think the important thing here

703
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:45,899
is that the ability to do

704
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,860
that type of counterparty risk assessment,

705
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:50,080
shouldn't be limited to the very mature,

706
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,770
various sophisticated banks, right?

707
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:53,590
We need to find a way to kind of drive

708
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:56,500
this rising type concept
with this so that,

709
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:59,460
you know, the methodologies that are used,

710
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,060
and I'm not implying
that they need to come

711
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:02,240
from the large banks, right?

712
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,090
Any methodologies that can be
used to help improve outcomes,

713
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:07,919
help address counterparty risk,

714
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,000
again, to JF's point,

715
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,280
we've got great opportunities
to share them with each other,

716
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,050
and I think the eBook
that you've described

717
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:14,500
is one example of that,

718
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,670
but we're keen to hear any innovation

719
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:18,710
across the space to understand

720
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:20,650
how better to use this information

721
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:22,600
to address the risk in
our own environment,

722
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,362
and across the sector as well.

723
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,310
- Yeah. So this is a really great point

724
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:31,750
I wanna dry out here because this is...

725
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:33,130
When we get to the core of it

726
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:37,170
really standard third party
security risk management,

727
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:41,770
and we've seen a big push recently,

728
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:44,820
given the recent solar winds breach

729
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:48,139
and a few other big name ones in the media

730
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:51,980
especially a big push now by boards

731
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:56,720
and executive teams around
third-party security risk.

732
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,570
And certainly that's
not a new topic for us

733
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:03,830
in the cybersecurity field
or in the financial industry.

734
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:05,600
I wonder if you can talk at all

735
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,590
about maybe some of the lessons

736
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:10,389
that can be applied from the CSP

737
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:14,020
that have worked around that
transparency and visibility

738
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:19,020
of being able to see the control
posture of counterparties,

739
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:21,760
maybe how those might be
transferable to other types

740
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,883
of third-party security
risk management functions.

741
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:31,420
- Thinking about that one a little bit,

742
00:30:33,604 --> 00:30:35,470
it's overused term about ecosystem, right?

743
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:38,440
So one part of the ecosystem goes down,

744
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:43,440
has ripple effects on a number
of organizations, right?

745
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:45,980
It could be an organization,

746
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:50,720
a service bureau that's
providing SWIFT connectivity

747
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,920
to smaller financial institutions.

748
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,130
It could be an outsourced technology shop,

749
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:56,580
it could be telecomm links,

750
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:57,899
it could be a number of things.

751
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:00,830
So managing that third party risk,

752
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:04,649
whether it be for payments, markets,

753
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:07,550
or any other area in retail banking,

754
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:09,490
has become more and more essential.

755
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:12,280
I talked about availability
and resiliency.

756
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:16,450
I think, 2020 was probably
the year of the ransomware.

757
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:18,190
We saw so many of these events,

758
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:22,850
a lot of organizations being
held hostage for ransom.

759
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:26,409
And that has a downstream impact

760
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:29,300
when these organizations
are service providers.

761
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:32,129
And there are a number
of frameworks out there

762
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:35,000
for assessing third-party risks.

763
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,560
There's a number of organizations

764
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:39,070
that specialize in that area.

765
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:40,159
But again, it comes back

766
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,300
to how are you managing your own risks?

767
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,960
How do you build your counterparty,

768
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,320
your third party risk framework?

769
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:51,230
But it's also about learning
and evolving, right?

770
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:53,550
What are the key factors

771
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:56,899
that contribute to these attacks
on third parties right now?

772
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:59,720
How are we risk rating our third parties

773
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,220
based on the services
that they provide to us?

774
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:06,010
And how do we feed that
into a feedback loop? Right?

775
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:09,140
So as the threat landscape evolves,

776
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:11,480
what questions do we ask?

777
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,810
What questions change?

778
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:15,879
And how do we analyze the information

779
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,600
and scope these vendors, right?

780
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,139
I think you mentioned,

781
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:21,210
you know, an attack on the supply chain,

782
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:24,477
so how do you go back to vendors and go,

783
00:32:24,477 --> 00:32:26,727
"Well, what are your controls around SDLC,

784
00:32:26,727 --> 00:32:29,900
"what are your controls around
your software pipeline?"

785
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:32,570
So that if you suffer a compromise,

786
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:35,439
I know I'm not ingesting malicious code,

787
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,700
but also it's up to organizations

788
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,950
to build controls around that,

789
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:41,950
and scanning code as it comes in

790
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:44,020
and doing those types of validations.

791
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:47,920
So there is a continued evolution

792
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,710
based on that threat landscape,

793
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:52,370
based on the controls
you need to implement.

794
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:54,659
And, you know, sometimes
I'll go into conversations.

795
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:56,307
It's like, "Okay, well,
can you give me a list

796
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:58,180
"of the controls I need to implement?"

797
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:00,900
I'm like, "It's gonna be good today."

798
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:04,100
But you know, we're tracking adversaries

799
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,562
and it's gonna change,

800
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,480
there will be something new.

801
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,670
But you know, a lot of
this is good hygiene

802
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:15,040
for many, many organizations, right?

803
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,409
Like single-factor VPN

804
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:19,300
that was set up as a result of COVID

805
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:22,620
because the organizations
didn't have enough secure ideas

806
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:24,419
to hand out to everybody.

807
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:27,950
And then all of a sudden
somebody forgets that it's there

808
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:31,670
and it hasn't been moved to
MFA once they have enough.

809
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:35,600
So it's also about good risk management

810
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,040
and ensuring that our third parties

811
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,210
have those processes in place

812
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:42,770
where they know how
they're managing for us.

813
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:45,129
- So let's talk a little bit further

814
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:47,520
about how do we ensure,

815
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,110
what does that look like,

816
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:52,784
that community compliance, the assurance,

817
00:33:52,785 --> 00:33:54,650
and of course what follows on that always

818
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:57,060
which is at least in
the financial industry,

819
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:58,923
supervisory enforcement.

820
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:04,940
What do you think that
security and IT vendors

821
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,600
should think about all of this?

822
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,770
And they often have a different lens

823
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:12,882
being mostly on the unregulated side,

824
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:18,400
and how do they factor
into the overall CSP model?

825
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:21,557
Maybe Brett, you could
kick us off on that one.

826
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:27,000
- I think you've hit a number of points

827
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,880
but I think regulatory
supervisory superintendents

828
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:33,300
having them in the mix

829
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,120
at the beginning of the equation for CSP

830
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,976
was one of the big decisions we made.

831
00:34:36,976 --> 00:34:37,809
You know what?

832
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:38,909
We can't be the policemen,

833
00:34:38,909 --> 00:34:40,620
if these guys don't comply,

834
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,529
then we have to give
them to a jurisdiction

835
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:44,550
that then can can sort it out.

836
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:47,699
And I think that was
one of the big decisions

837
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:51,109
to have a stick, to have enforcement,

838
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:55,190
suddenly lubricated the
wheels and the cogs here.

839
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:56,350
And you can see,

840
00:34:56,350 --> 00:34:58,160
and actually we have a lot now,

841
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:01,129
a lot of classes you saw from
the hexagon diagrams earlier.

842
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:04,020
And I think that was the
one of the pivotal decisions

843
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:04,853
that we had.

844
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:07,730
How that translates to
third-party vendors and suppliers,

845
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:09,627
that's a challenging one
as you quite rightly say,

846
00:35:09,627 --> 00:35:12,450
you know, we are regulated
for good or for bad

847
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:13,919
in financial services,

848
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,470
but those guys aren't,

849
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:17,540
and how to have that level of stick

850
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:20,872
but without the governance
structure around it,

851
00:35:20,872 --> 00:35:21,990
that's a challenging one.

852
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:26,990
- Yeah. Well, let's go to our
last question of the panel

853
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,370
which is, how should the CSP evolve?

854
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:33,700
What direction do you
all think it should move

855
00:35:34,749 --> 00:35:35,640
in the future?

856
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:38,200
And should it be expanded

857
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:42,540
to other critical systemic functions

858
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:45,509
within financial institutions beyond?

859
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:48,650
Could other organizations adopt the CSP

860
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:51,190
for different critical
functions that they provide?

861
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,900
What are some of your thoughts about that?

862
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,050
Who'd like to go first?

863
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:56,493
- Maybe I'll start with that.

864
00:35:56,493 --> 00:35:58,830
So I think in terms of
the evolution of it,

865
00:35:58,830 --> 00:35:59,987
there's a real opportunity,

866
00:35:59,987 --> 00:36:02,100
and we kind of talk a little
bit about this, right?

867
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,900
There's a lot of frameworks
out there, right?

868
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,150
Brett already described that,

869
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:07,760
you know, it's traced to
NIST, it's traced to ISO,

870
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,740
it's traced to PCI, right?

871
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:12,529
So I think there is an opportunity

872
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:14,470
to start to look at these frameworks

873
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:15,580
and figure out how do we start

874
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:17,650
to bring these closer together, right?

875
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:20,360
Across the financial industry,

876
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:23,400
there's an initiative called
the cybersecurity profile

877
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:27,710
which is looking at the various
kind of compliance controls

878
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:31,730
and indicators that we would
expect organizations of,

879
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:35,812
again various maturities to
have in place and comply with.

880
00:36:35,812 --> 00:36:37,330
And I think the more we can look at,

881
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:39,210
either whether they're
regulatory frameworks,

882
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:40,520
whether they're industry frameworks,

883
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:43,000
whether there's something like the CSP,

884
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,630
if we can start to bring these together,

885
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:47,370
the cost of compliance,

886
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:49,750
and in fact, the cost of
demonstrating compliance

887
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:51,047
goes down significantly, right?

888
00:36:51,047 --> 00:36:53,200
And the less that we're spending on

889
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,040
that compliance demonstration is more

890
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:59,110
that we can put into security
and cyber risk management.

891
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:00,820
I think the second opportunity,

892
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:03,660
and this is picking up on
a point JF talked about.

893
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:06,950
So JF talked about was around threat,

894
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:08,359
talking about threat, right?

895
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:11,160
The more we can use frameworks like this

896
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,770
to talk not just from a
compliance perspective

897
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:15,940
but from a threat perspective

898
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:19,080
in plain language that
non-security practitioners

899
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,440
can understand,

900
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,910
again, that facilitates the advantage

901
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:25,500
that we get from leveraging
a framework like this,

902
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,160
and particularly leveraging SWIFT,

903
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,250
who sits at the center

904
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:30,433
of so much of the financial ecosystem.

905
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:36,870
- I think you've covered it--
- Yeah.

906
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:39,170
- I don't really have
anything to add to that.

907
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:42,670
You know, the alignment is
going to be critical, right?

908
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:46,260
There's so many different
frameworks out there.

909
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:49,460
You mentioned the
financial sector profile,

910
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:53,960
I think bringing it all
into one common lens

911
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:56,710
is much more effective for organizations,

912
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:58,130
especially organizations

913
00:37:58,130 --> 00:38:00,730
that have a large international presence,

914
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:02,350
and that are seeing,

915
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:07,350
you know, various requirements
placed out to them

916
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:10,110
that slightly differ,

917
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:15,080
that are little bit more
challenging to meet at times.

918
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:18,080
So if we bring it all back to one thing,

919
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:21,140
the evidencing becomes much more effective

920
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:24,650
and we get to spend more time
on control design, right?

921
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:28,810
So the more alignment we
have across the frameworks

922
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:31,580
the more investment we
can put in control design,

923
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:34,900
but also in continuous control monitoring.

924
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:39,090
So demonstrating that the control efficacy

925
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:40,890
is working as planned.

926
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:44,029
So it becomes much more
effective to evidence this

927
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:47,770
and validate that we are aligned

928
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:50,089
to the controls that are being proposed.

929
00:38:50,089 --> 00:38:50,922
- Yeah.

930
00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:55,840
- Great. Well, I wanna thank all of you

931
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,780
for the great discussion today,

932
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:00,160
and just say that this concludes

933
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,670
the recorded portion of our discussion,

934
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:03,640
but I hope all of you in the
audience will stick around

935
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,480
for the next 30 minutes,

936
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:08,690
immediately following
where we will join you live

937
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:11,890
to continue the conversation
and answer your question.

938
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:14,740
So thanks for joining us and
see you in the next session.
