00:00:02,177 --> 00:00:03,230
- Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:04,317
My name is Crane Hassold,

3
00:00:04,317 --> 00:00:07,660
I'm the senior director of
threat research at Agari.

4
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:09,500
Today, I'm gonna be talking to you about

5
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,250
the BEC Threat Landscape,

6
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,350
sort of how it's evolved
over the past year or so,

7
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:16,640
and how we can use different types

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,500
of intelligence techniques
to better combat

9
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,293
this emerging and growing threat.

10
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,150
Now, because this is a virtual session

11
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,159
and I'm recording this in advance.

12
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,130
If anyone has any
questions about the content

13
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:31,933
that I'm covering today, please feel free

14
00:00:31,934 --> 00:00:33,660
to ask it at any time,

15
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,989
I'll be there in person with you guys,

16
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:38,970
so I'll be able to answer any questions

17
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:40,769
throughout this entire presentation.

18
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,020
So with that, let's get started.

19
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:45,420
So let's...

20
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,290
Before we really dive into this,

21
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:48,900
let's level set a little bit

22
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,350
about what we're talking about

23
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,840
when we're talking about
Business Email Compromise.

24
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:56,190
So BEC, as it's commonly referred to,

25
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,110
could mean a lot of different things

26
00:00:58,110 --> 00:00:59,842
to a lot of different people.

27
00:00:59,842 --> 00:01:03,740
The context I'll be using it in today

28
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:05,930
is essentially Business Email Compromise

29
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:07,560
is a spear phishing attack

30
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,946
that involves the impersonation
of a trusted individual,

31
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:13,009
or other organization

32
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:16,430
to trick a person into making
a financial transaction

33
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:19,870
or sending other types
of sensitive materials.

34
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:21,410
So when we're talking about BEC,

35
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:24,083
that's really what we're
gonna be talking about today.

36
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:27,330
So how big of a problem is BEC?

37
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,850
So essentially at this
interactive presentation,

38
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:32,149
I'm assuming probably know how big

39
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:34,990
of an issue Business Email
Compromise has become

40
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:36,440
over the past few years.

41
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,993
And just to sort of demonstrate that,

42
00:01:38,993 --> 00:01:42,660
from the FBI Internet Crime
Complaint Center Alert,

43
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:47,548
IC3 Alert, from the end of
2019, and on that alert,

44
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:52,130
they said that BEC had
caused more than $26 billion

45
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:53,530
of financial loss

46
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:58,240
between the middle of
2016 and October of 2019.

47
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,360
And when you look at that
on a per month basis,

48
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,530
that essentially equates to
about $708 million of loss

49
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:05,813
every single month.

50
00:02:06,685 --> 00:02:08,600
Put that another perspective,

51
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:12,290
in the IC3 report that
came out earlier this year

52
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:15,679
that looked at all of the
cyber crime losses from 2020.

53
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,850
In that report, about 41%

54
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:22,180
of all cyber crime losses was attributed

55
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:26,000
to some form BEC, of
Business Email Compromise.

56
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,860
So it just shows you how much

57
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:30,870
of a problem BEC has
become over the past couple

58
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:33,020
of years and how much
it continues to grow.

59
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,550
So why is BEC and why has BEC
become such a big problem?

60
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:42,140
Well, the three primary reasons for this,

61
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:45,459
one is traditional defenses
that have been around

62
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:48,880
for decades at this point
have primarily focused

63
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:52,079
on more technically
sophisticated types of attacks,

64
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,920
things like malware,
ransomware, things like that.

65
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,239
Those are the types of
cyber attacks that a lot

66
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,070
of email defenses have gotten really good

67
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,670
at defending against,

68
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:05,489
what they haven't gotten very
good at defending against,

69
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,640
or more, less technically sophisticated,

70
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,809
more pure social engineering attacks,

71
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:14,563
which is where a lot of cyber
attackers are going in today.

72
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:16,739
So that's the reason number one

73
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:19,770
why BEC has become such a bigger problem.

74
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:21,870
Reason number two is when you would look

75
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,600
at Business Email Compromise,

76
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,930
and from a business perspective,
the return on investment,

77
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:30,489
the ROI for these types of
attacks is significantly greater

78
00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:32,620
than other types of cyber attacks.

79
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,210
You know, one of the things
that we had been talking

80
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:36,660
about for a long time, and we'll talk

81
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,780
about this a little bit
later on in the presentation

82
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:42,200
is at some point we expected
the Eastern European

83
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,519
and the Russian cyber
criminals to start thinking

84
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,651
to themselves, why am I
spending all of this time

85
00:03:47,651 --> 00:03:51,670
and money on hiring developers
for my malware and setting

86
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:54,638
up infrastructure when I can
just send someone an email,

87
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:57,760
tell them to send me
money and they'll do it.

88
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,140
The return is so much better there.

89
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,649
And as we've seen over
the past couple of years,

90
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:03,670
we're starting to see more

91
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:07,161
of those sophisticated actors
get into the beast in space.

92
00:04:07,161 --> 00:04:10,690
And the third reason that BEC
has become such a big problem

93
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:15,410
is at its core social engineering
is extremely effective.

94
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:17,329
As long as human beings have been

95
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:20,000
on this earth for thousands
and thousands of years now.

96
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,900
And as long as we've been
interacting with one another,

97
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,469
we've been social engineering each other,

98
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:26,850
the only difference is now the tools

99
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:30,560
that we're using to con
each other are the internet,

100
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,870
our computers, instead
of doing it face to face,

101
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,550
instead of doing it over the phone,

102
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:36,330
instead of doing it through the mail,

103
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:38,700
we now have a digital capability

104
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,630
to social engineer each other,

105
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:43,490
the same concepts that have
been used for thousands of years

106
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:45,260
are still being used today.

107
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,980
The only difference is the medium

108
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,153
by which those attacks are taking place.

109
00:04:50,824 --> 00:04:55,824
So let's also look at the BEC
ecosystem and how it's really

110
00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:00,195
a much bigger than what
we've become accustomed to.

111
00:05:00,196 --> 00:05:02,470
You know, a lot of the
research that my team has done

112
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:03,760
at Agari has been looking

113
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,740
at the actors behind these BEC attacks.

114
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:10,070
And what we found is that the same actors

115
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:13,310
that are running BEC scams
are also running dozens

116
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:15,500
of other types of fraudulent activities.

117
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,990
Things like credential
fishing, unemployment fraud,

118
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:21,660
real estate fraud, the
classic Nigerian Prince scams,

119
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:25,910
romance scams, lottery scams,
all of these types of attacks

120
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:28,925
and scams and fraudulent
activity can all be traced back

121
00:05:28,925 --> 00:05:33,207
to the same relative group of actors

122
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:35,253
in places like West Africa.

123
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,290
To put it into some additional context,

124
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:40,950
let's look as for some of the
numbers that came out earlier

125
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:43,830
this year in the FBI's IC3 report.

126
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:46,539
Now all of the different
types of fraudulent activity

127
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:49,130
that I have highlighted here in purple,

128
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:51,719
based on all of the research
that my team has done,

129
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,980
we can confidently say
that a lot of this activity

130
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,580
and all of these losses can be attributed

131
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,750
to similar types of actors,

132
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,190
primarily coming from
places like West Africa.

133
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:05,677
And while BEC was
associated with $1.9 billion

134
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,950
of financial loss in 2020,

135
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:13,190
when we calculate all
of the different types

136
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:15,010
of fraudulent activities
that are associated

137
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:17,500
with similar actors,
then you start getting

138
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,393
into more than $4 billion or 70% of all

139
00:06:21,393 --> 00:06:25,750
of the cyber crime
losses can all be linked

140
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,570
to a relatively small population

141
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:32,870
of actors in a quite
small place in the world.

142
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:35,508
This also, you know, in a different way

143
00:06:35,508 --> 00:06:38,070
we released a report a
few years ago when a group

144
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,823
that we called Scattered Canary.

145
00:06:39,823 --> 00:06:42,700
Now Scattered Canary report
was very interesting in

146
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,890
that it gave us a really
good look at how one

147
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:48,880
of these West African BEC groups evolves

148
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,080
into a essentially a sole proprietorship

149
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,510
from a business perspective

150
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:56,133
into a larger cyber crime enterprise

151
00:06:56,133 --> 00:07:00,440
with numerous dozens of actors helping out

152
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,120
with day-to-day activities.

153
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,660
And as you can see, as
it evolved over time,

154
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:09,300
the group got into more
and more types of scams.

155
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,780
And at the end, they were
running dozens of different types

156
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,549
of scams concurrently to one another.

157
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:18,680
So while we may say that
these groups are BEC groups,

158
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,810
we know that while
they're running BEC scams,

159
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:23,440
they're also running romance scams.

160
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,063
They're also running
advanced fee fraud scams.

161
00:07:26,063 --> 00:07:30,039
They are also running SBA loan
fraud scams and other types

162
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,590
of fraudulent activity
concurrently at one another.

163
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:36,770
Now this really came into
the forefront last year

164
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:41,039
when COVID-19 hit all
of us and the especially

165
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:45,160
the U.S. government started
passing different types

166
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,610
of support to help out with a lot

167
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:49,700
of the impact from COVID-19.

168
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,330
Unemployment fraud was one of
the big components to that.

169
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:55,909
And we can see that Scattered
Canary as we just discussed,

170
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:59,030
was doing a lot of BEC activity.

171
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:00,659
We also saw that they were also one

172
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,750
of the primary groups that
were associated with a lot

173
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:07,660
of the early COVID-19 unemployment
fraud that was going on.

174
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:10,200
And looking at some statistics
from earlier this year,

175
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,409
now at this point we're looking
at more than $36 billion

176
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:16,100
has been lost to unemployment fraud

177
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,170
on an estimated capacity.

178
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:22,410
I've even heard numbers going
up to almost $200 billion

179
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:25,740
being lost to unemployment
fraud over the past year.

180
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,270
So this same groups that
are associated with BEC

181
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,363
are also being associated with things

182
00:08:29,363 --> 00:08:30,870
like unemployment fraud

183
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:34,373
and making a massive impact
on a financial scale.

184
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,150
So that's a little background

185
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:39,270
about Business Email Compromise.

186
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:42,449
Let's look about the
financial components of BEC

187
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:45,560
'cause you know, like most
other types of cyber crime,

188
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,209
BEC is financially motivated.

189
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:51,541
And because it's financially
motivated, the money side

190
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:55,740
of these attacks is very
important to understand.

191
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,092
And then you can understand how

192
00:08:57,092 --> 00:08:59,449
the entire attack chain works

193
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:02,470
and then how to prevent
it at the end of the day.

194
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:05,410
So there are three primary
cashout methods for BEC attacks.

195
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:08,339
And the one that probably
most people are familiar

196
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:11,060
with are freight wire transfers.

197
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:16,060
You know, take a BEC actor
who is impersonating the CEO

198
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:20,084
of a company asking an
employee to make a payment

199
00:09:20,084 --> 00:09:24,290
to a supposed vendor who
needs where the money is due,

200
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:26,530
see some examples of that
on the right-hand side

201
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:28,170
of the screen here.

202
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:32,189
And this is really where CEO
fraud, CEO impersonation scams,

203
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:35,283
BEC really took root around 2014, 2015.

204
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:39,829
Now the upsides of Wire Transfer Attacks

205
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:42,620
are no significantly higher payouts.

206
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:45,810
When we look at the average
amount being requested

207
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:47,790
and a wire transfer BEC attack,

208
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:51,980
it's range anywhere between
about $50,000 on average

209
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:55,610
to upwards of $100,000 on
average in any given month,

210
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:57,840
over the past year, year and a half.

211
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,310
So they can make a lot of money

212
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:00,969
for any of these successful attacks.

213
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:04,190
They can also develop a
very sophisticated pre-tax

214
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:06,560
you know, reasons why
this money is being due.

215
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,122
And we'll look about look at
some of those pre-tax here

216
00:10:09,122 --> 00:10:11,286
over the next few slides.

217
00:10:11,287 --> 00:10:13,830
The downsides to Wire Transfer Attacks

218
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:16,500
and why there aren't as common
really as they used to be.

219
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,610
And we'll see what sort
of taken their place here

220
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:21,230
in a little bit, are the payouts,

221
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:23,900
the amount of time it
takes to receive the money

222
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,740
once it goes through the
entire laundering chain,

223
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:29,710
takes a long time and there
are a lot of possibilities

224
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:33,750
of money flow getting interrupted
somewhere along the way.

225
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,600
And then it also requires money mules

226
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,610
in order to receive the funds.

227
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:40,310
You know, a lot of these actors are coming

228
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:42,079
from places like West Africa

229
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,370
and they aren't going to be
receiving the money directly.

230
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:46,310
So they need to have an intermediary

231
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:48,890
in the locations where the targets are.

232
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:52,790
And they're gonna be the ones
who then receive the funds,

233
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,310
pass it on to another actor,

234
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:56,329
who then passes it on to another actor.

235
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:59,370
So on down the line until it
finally makes its way back

236
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:00,680
to the scammer.

237
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,670
And there's a lot, again,
you have to sort of rely

238
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:06,463
on a another actor in order to do that.

239
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,680
So some of the things that
we've seen over the past year

240
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:15,260
and especially more recently
in the wire transfer BEC space,

241
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:17,830
are some interesting
pre-tax that are being used

242
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:19,660
by actors that we haven't seen before.

243
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,730
And this example where
we started seeing this

244
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:23,320
at the end of 2020

245
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,970
and this is essentially
using a capital call payment

246
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:30,249
as a pre-tax for a payment
that's supposed to be due

247
00:11:30,249 --> 00:11:32,710
for someone to send a wire transfer.

248
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:33,760
So for those of you who don't know,

249
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,040
a capital call payment is
a payment that is supposed

250
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,199
to be due for some sort of investment.

251
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,090
And in those investments,
once they are ready to close

252
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:47,080
that the investor will then request money

253
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,990
from the other investors.

254
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:51,840
And that all goes into a fund
or a real estate investment

255
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,890
or something like that.

256
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:55,030
In this case, they're
using those similar types

257
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:59,557
of pre-tax here asking for about $42,000

258
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:03,940
for a foreign investment
that's supposed to be due.

259
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:06,070
We've seen these types of payments go

260
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:08,120
up to upwards of $1 million.

261
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,475
And so you can see that
because they are, you know,

262
00:12:10,475 --> 00:12:13,630
investment themed that
they would be, you know,

263
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:16,120
be able to ask for more money
than they might from other

264
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,891
some other types of wire transfers tax.

265
00:12:18,891 --> 00:12:23,004
Other pre-tax we've seen that
are interesting more recently

266
00:12:23,004 --> 00:12:25,460
in this case, it's meant to look

267
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:28,360
like an acquisition is taking place.

268
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,940
And the attacker is initially
impersonating the CEO

269
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:34,650
of a company and asking the target

270
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:36,220
and this is gonna need
someone on the finance team

271
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:39,380
and accounts payable
specialist to get in touch

272
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:43,400
with another persona who
is actually impersonating

273
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:48,000
a legitimate attorney
with at someone like KPMG.

274
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,140
And as you can see

275
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:51,573
from the different samples
we have here on the screen,

276
00:12:51,573 --> 00:12:54,160
you can see that there's a
handoff that happens there.

277
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,819
Who's in asking the target employee

278
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,960
to make a relatively sizeable
payment that's supposed

279
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:03,850
to be due for a supposed
acquisition that's taking place

280
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:05,463
of an Asian based company.

281
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:09,089
And these are the types
of sophisticated pre-tax

282
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:12,550
that we see becoming
more and more frequent

283
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:14,670
in the wire transfer BEC space

284
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:17,810
which not only makes them more successful

285
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:19,640
because they're putting
a little bit more time

286
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:24,330
into creating more
legitimate looking emails

287
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:27,320
but it also allows them
to ask for more money

288
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,923
as they create these more
sophisticated pre-tax.

289
00:13:32,483 --> 00:13:35,449
So the next type of the
cash out method that we see

290
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:38,010
in BEC tax are payroll diversions.

291
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:42,050
Essentially in this case,
actors are asking, you know,

292
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:45,280
impersonating a CEO or some of
their executive at a company,

293
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,490
targeting someone on
the human resources team

294
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:52,490
and asking them to update
their direct deposit account

295
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:55,180
that they're using for payroll.

296
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:57,630
Now, the upsides to these are, you know,

297
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:00,380
one there's sort of a
delayed detection here.

298
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,980
You know, people only get paid once,

299
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,880
usually maybe once every two weeks.

300
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:07,780
And if the direct deposit doesn't come in,

301
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:10,020
it could be a matter of days,
if not a matter of weeks

302
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:13,630
before someone actually realizes
that they didn't get paid.

303
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:17,680
What's also, a benefit to
Payroll Diversion Attacks

304
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,550
are the types of mule accounts
that are being used here.

305
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:22,780
Now, usually at wire transfer BEC attacks.

306
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:25,600
Most of the accounts that
we see receiving the funds

307
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,740
are going to be normal checking
commercial accounts, right?

308
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:33,410
With Payroll Diversion Attacks
what we would generally see

309
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:36,020
are actually prepaid
card accounts being used.

310
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:39,340
Things like Go Bank and
green dot cards being used

311
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,690
to receive these funds.

312
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:45,690
And that allows the ability
for the laundering process

313
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:48,600
to take place a little bit more quickly

314
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,760
than they would in other of methods.

315
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,990
Now, the downsides to
Payroll Diversion Attacks

316
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:57,560
are the amounts are unknown to the actors.

317
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:01,459
You know, the actors
generally don't know how much

318
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:03,060
an employee is going to be making.

319
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,229
So while they usually are going to be

320
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:06,260
impersonating an executive.

321
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,939
So the thought process there is that

322
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,190
they're probably gonna be making

323
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:11,160
a significant amount of money.

324
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,839
They don't actually know
how much money they're gonna

325
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:16,060
be making if one of these
attacks is being successful.

326
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:18,890
And then also there's a
relatively limited population

327
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:20,670
of targets out there.

328
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:23,170
Not only are they generally only going to

329
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:25,000
be impersonating the executives,

330
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,530
but they also have to target someone

331
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:29,640
that's generally gonna be on the HR team,

332
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:32,770
which is not a large number
of employees generally

333
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:33,803
in most companies.

334
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:36,470
When we look at what happened

335
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:39,620
in the payroll diversion
threat landscape in 2020,

336
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:40,510
it's something really,

337
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:42,720
we saw something very
interesting happening.

338
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,250
So in the first six months of 2020,

339
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,670
we saw a pretty significant decline

340
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:49,490
in overall Payroll Diversion Attacks.

341
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:53,010
And the reason for this
was two primary reasons,

342
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:56,390
one the mule accounts that
were being used changed,

343
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:59,439
we saw one of the primary
organizations being used

344
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,662
to receive a lot of Payroll
Diversion Attacks up

345
00:16:01,662 --> 00:16:05,360
until sort of the late part of 2019.

346
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,760
Really put some very good
mitigation procedures in place

347
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,180
which caused a lot of
payroll diversion actors

348
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,729
to start looking for other
ways to receive their funds.

349
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:17,390
And so, as they were doing this,

350
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:20,770
we saw them testing out
different types of accounts

351
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:25,770
to be used for receiving
payroll diversion funds.

352
00:16:25,867 --> 00:16:29,079
What we also saw in the beginning of 2019

353
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:33,000
and what I mentioned earlier
was because of COVID-19,

354
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,140
we saw a significant amount
of unemployment fraud

355
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:40,449
and other types of fraud
being because of the amount

356
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:44,190
of money that was put out to
STEM the impacts of COVID-19.

357
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:47,050
And so a lot of the
actors involved in things

358
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:50,219
like payroll diversion
actually temporarily pivoted

359
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,290
to things like unemployment fraud,

360
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:55,160
right after something like the
cares act was being passed.

361
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,250
And a lot of the mule
accounts that were being used

362
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,210
to receive payroll diversion funds,

363
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:03,810
we're also now being used to
receive unemployment fraud.

364
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:06,089
So a lot of prepaid card accounts groups

365
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:07,810
like Scattered Canary almost exclusively

366
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:10,889
used green dot accounts to
receive unemployment fraud.

367
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:14,624
So a lot of those mule
accounts were being used

368
00:17:14,624 --> 00:17:17,540
for other types of fraudulent activity.

369
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:21,050
Now that really changed after
we hit July of last year,

370
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:23,560
in July of 2020 we really saw

371
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,069
the payroll diversion ecosystem bottom out

372
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:29,270
about only 3% of all of
the BEC attacks we saw

373
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:32,060
in July of last year were
Payroll Diversion Attacks.

374
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:35,300
But as you can see on the
screen here month over month

375
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:39,430
throughout the this entire
second half of 2020,

376
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:43,060
we saw an increase every single
month in payroll diversion.

377
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,950
And it's now almost
gotten to the point where

378
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:47,773
it's eclipsed a Wire
Transfer Attacks again.

379
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:54,590
So the third primary cash
out method for BEC attacks

380
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:58,738
are gift cards and gift cards
are now the number one cash

381
00:17:58,739 --> 00:18:01,660
out method for BEC attacks,

382
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:04,140
and the reason for this
is really interesting.

383
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,200
As you can see on the pie chart here,

384
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:10,550
more than a half of all of the
BEC attacks we saw in 2020,

385
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:13,470
requested gift cards as a form of payment.

386
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:14,714
Now, the reason for this

387
00:18:14,714 --> 00:18:16,580
there are a couple
different reasons for this.

388
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:19,610
One, these gift cards are non-reversible.

389
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:21,149
Once and we'll look about here,

390
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:22,700
look at this on the next slide.

391
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,317
Once they are sent to the
attacker, they're laundered

392
00:18:25,317 --> 00:18:29,430
very quickly in the money hits
the scammers bank accounts.

393
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:32,600
There's no need for those
middlemen or money mules.

394
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,226
As we talked to with the
Wire Transfer Attacks,

395
00:18:35,226 --> 00:18:37,609
one of the reasons that
there's a downside of is

396
00:18:37,609 --> 00:18:40,120
that they have to use those money mules.

397
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,229
In this case, there is
no middleman that needs

398
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:44,900
to be used in these scams.

399
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:48,580
And the third reason that
gift cards have become

400
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:50,300
so prominent, I think this is probably one

401
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,710
of the main reasons,

402
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:54,730
is that there's a much larger population

403
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:56,930
of potential employees
that could be targeted

404
00:18:56,930 --> 00:19:00,800
in these attacks compared to
other types of BEC attacks.

405
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:04,053
Now, while something like
a wire transfer BEC attack

406
00:19:04,053 --> 00:19:07,200
is looking, you know to target
someone on the finance team

407
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,420
or Payroll Diversion Attacks
are looking to target someone

408
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,980
on the human resources team.

409
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:15,320
Gift card attacks can target any employee

410
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,610
at an individual company.

411
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:19,550
We've seen BEC campaigns
requesting gift cards

412
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:23,386
that have targeted 50, 60, 70 employees

413
00:19:23,386 --> 00:19:26,895
at a single organization
in one single campaign.

414
00:19:26,895 --> 00:19:29,740
And you know, these actors are not looking

415
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,520
for a huge success rate,

416
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,139
but the more of these
emails they can send out,

417
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,480
the higher the chance of one of them

418
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,973
or a handful of them becoming successful.

419
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,460
Now, the downsides to
gift card attacks are

420
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:44,780
the payouts are significantly smaller.

421
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:48,077
We're generally looking
between 1000 and $1,500

422
00:19:48,077 --> 00:19:51,310
for a successful gift card BEC attack.

423
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:54,159
So that's a fraction
of what they're getting

424
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,760
in Wire Transfer Attacks.

425
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,970
And then also the ploys they're using

426
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:00,030
are generally gonna be less convincing.

427
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:01,830
So if you look at an example
here on the right-hand side

428
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:04,080
of the screen here, a
lot of the themes we see

429
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,659
in gift card attacks are gonna be looking

430
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:09,226
at things like, you know,
I need to get rewards

431
00:20:09,226 --> 00:20:13,120
for employees or gifts for customers.

432
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,959
That's generally the themes we see,

433
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,210
which I think make a little bit of sense

434
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:20,710
but as the attack unfolds
and you start saying,

435
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:22,670
well then you have to go to the store

436
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:26,080
and get me a bunch of
Apple iTunes gift cards,

437
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,669
take pictures of them individually
and text them back to me.

438
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:33,760
Then it starts to put the
potential to raise a lot

439
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,580
of red flags as you go along.

440
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:38,540
And so that makes that sort of the pre-tax

441
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:42,913
and employees a little bit
more difficult as they unfold.

442
00:20:43,991 --> 00:20:47,800
And so the last thing we'll
talk about here is, you know,

443
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,399
what drives the BEC engine today?

444
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,990
So there are two primary
things that drive BEC today.

445
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:55,860
One are the prepaid cards
that I've talked about before.

446
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,129
You know, the picture here
on the right-hand side

447
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,597
of the screen is a picture
I took at my local Walmart.

448
00:20:59,597 --> 00:21:03,160
That is what I essentially
call the mule account box.

449
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:06,620
This is where a lot of those
prepaid cards are purchased

450
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:09,659
and are then used to receive a lot

451
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:13,360
of different types of fraudulent
funds for BEC attacks.

452
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,939
We've also seen the rise
of apps like Cash App being

453
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:20,250
really integral in the BEC ecosystem

454
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:23,670
because that is a big place where a lot

455
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:25,810
of the funds are now being
moved out of the country.

456
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:28,810
One of the upsides to Cash
App and why it's so attractive

457
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:32,679
to the actors is that
it allows for someone

458
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:36,393
to convert funds into
cryptocurrency very quickly.

459
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:39,459
Speaking of cryptocurrency, other sites

460
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:42,750
like Paxful are also
being used more frequently

461
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:45,630
in BEC attacks at the
bottom of the screen here.

462
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:48,040
This is the laundering chain of how a

463
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:51,090
a gift cards are laundered
almost exclusively.

464
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:53,110
Almost all the groups that we've tracked.

465
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:56,129
All the BEC groups who track
this is essentially the process

466
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:59,350
by which the gift cards
are laundered very quickly

467
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:02,770
from the time they
received from the victim

468
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:04,463
to a Nigerian bank account.

469
00:22:06,062 --> 00:22:08,850
So let's pivot here a little
bit to the future of BEC.

470
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:12,600
What do we see in the BEC
Threat Landscape moving forward?

471
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,870
Well, one is the types of
BEC attacks we're seeing.

472
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:18,729
And one of the biggest threats in BEC

473
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:20,890
is what we call Vendor Email Compromise.

474
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:23,300
Vendor Email Compromise
is essentially a hybrid

475
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,310
of a credential phishing attack

476
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:28,840
and identity deception
CEO impersonation attack

477
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:32,830
that allows an attacker to
create a very sophisticated

478
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:34,300
realistic looking email,

479
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:37,550
targeting a vendor or suppliers customers.

480
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:41,780
What happens in a VEC attack
is first the attacker will send

481
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:45,040
out a credential phishing campaign,

482
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,230
generally going to be something

483
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:49,230
that's gonna be impersonating
Officer's 65, Dropbox,

484
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:51,310
DocuSign, Adobe, things like that.

485
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:54,550
And we'll compromise
a number of mailboxes.

486
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:57,690
The attacker will then identify
high profile mailboxes,

487
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:00,370
high value mailboxes there
that are going to be involved

488
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:03,610
in some way, shape or form with payments.

489
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:06,870
And once those high value
mailboxes have been identified,

490
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:09,159
the attackers will sit on those mailboxes

491
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:12,100
and collect intelligence
from them to identify things

492
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,976
like when payments are due.

493
00:23:13,977 --> 00:23:17,300
What customers or vendor supplier has?

494
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,500
What do invoices look like?

495
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,370
And they'll steal copies
of those invoices.

496
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:23,659
What do normal communication
patterns look like?

497
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:27,610
And after a few weeks, if
not sometimes a few months,

498
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:30,050
the attackers will then
use that intelligence

499
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:34,010
to send completely realistic
looking emails to that vendor

500
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:36,530
or suppliers customers requesting payment

501
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:38,560
for a payment that's actually due.

502
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:41,179
The only difference is
the account number where

503
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:43,810
the payment is supposed to
be sent is going to change

504
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:48,190
and they might use a replica
invoice there for that.

505
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:50,670
And so a lot of the
BEC attacks that we see

506
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:52,780
in the news today are going to be

507
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,830
these Vendor Email Compromise attacks.

508
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:58,439
And these are the biggest
threat to enterprises really all

509
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,240
over the world when it comes to BEC.

510
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,850
Now, the next thing that
we've seen has become much

511
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:06,780
more common in the past
few months are something

512
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:09,410
that we call aging report BEC attacks.

513
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:11,550
These are very interesting attacks.

514
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:12,710
And what happens

515
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:14,500
for those who don't know
what an aging report is.

516
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,870
So an aging report is a financial report

517
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:20,179
that essentially lists all
of the outstanding payments

518
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:22,810
that are due for a vendor or supplier.

519
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:25,570
It lists off, you know
how much is actually due,

520
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:26,980
how overdue it is.

521
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:29,780
And then it also shows who
the points of contact are

522
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:34,530
for each customer and
their contact information.

523
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:36,528
So what we've seen happen more recently

524
00:24:36,528 --> 00:24:41,050
our attackers are instead of
requesting a wire transfer

525
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:44,879
to be paid to a suppose to vendor,

526
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,170
they're impersonating a CEO

527
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:51,060
and asking for a copy of the
most up-to-date aging report.

528
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,790
And as you can see at the
bottom of the screen here

529
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:55,000
this looks like, you know, a sample

530
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,420
of what you might see in
one of these aging reports.

531
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:00,860
And what the attackers
will do is they'll use all

532
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:03,550
of this information to then send an email

533
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:06,300
to all of the customers on this list,

534
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:10,490
asking for payments for
those outstanding balances.

535
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:11,390
And you could see an example

536
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:13,240
of what one of those
emails might look like

537
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,280
on the right-hand side of the screen.

538
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:19,030
Now, essentially these are
the exact same concepts

539
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:20,110
and tactics that we see

540
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:22,340
in normal Vendor Email Compromise attacks.

541
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:23,800
The only difference is here,

542
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,659
there's no compromise that's required

543
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,400
in order to make these successful

544
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,750
but all of the steps are
essentially the same.

545
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:31,430
And one of the interesting
things is so there's

546
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:34,500
a group that we call Ancient
Tortoise that has been involved

547
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,500
in aging report attacks
for about 18 months now,

548
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,750
based on our research.

549
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:41,380
And what's really interesting
is while this group

550
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:43,330
is still involved with
a lot of these attacks,

551
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:46,437
we've started to see
more and more BEC actors

552
00:25:46,438 --> 00:25:49,620
with different types of
tactics starting to come

553
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:52,889
into starting to use aging
report pre-checks as well.

554
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:57,890
And in January of 2021
more than 10% of all

555
00:25:58,410 --> 00:26:00,310
of the BEC attacks that we saw

556
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,810
were actually requesting aging reports.

557
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:04,408
So we can see that this is
becoming much more popular

558
00:26:04,409 --> 00:26:06,643
in the BEC sphere.

559
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:09,950
Something else we've seen more recently is

560
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:13,470
more sophisticated actors
entering the BEC space.

561
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:17,310
This is an article from 2020 looking

562
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:21,210
at North Korean state actors
actually being involved

563
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:22,840
in BEC attacks while

564
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,750
they were also compromising infrastructure

565
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,130
for other types of attacks,

566
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:29,580
they were also using a
lot of that intelligence

567
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:32,520
to commit things like
Vendor Email Compromise

568
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,470
attacks as well.

569
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:35,250
So we can see this is becoming,
you know, what I mentioned

570
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:37,190
at the very beginning
of this presentation,

571
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:39,010
we're starting to see a lot
of these actors starting

572
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:40,290
to think to themselves.

573
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:43,409
There's a lot of money to be
made here in the BEC space.

574
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:44,660
Let's try our hand at it.

575
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:48,950
BEC actors are also becoming
more geographic and diverse.

576
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:52,280
You know, traditionally
a lot of BEC activity has

577
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:55,780
been coming from places
primarily in Nigeria

578
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,149
but also places like South Africa.

579
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:00,363
What we've seen over the past year or so,

580
00:27:00,363 --> 00:27:05,363
it started to see a global
footprint for BEC actors.

581
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,530
More recently, we've seen a
lot of sophisticated actors

582
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:10,030
coming out of places like Russia.

583
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:11,470
And we'll talk about
an example of that here

584
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:12,680
in just a second.

585
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:15,250
And also places like Israel,
we've seen the number

586
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:19,459
of Israeli actors using some
pretty sophisticated tactics

587
00:27:19,459 --> 00:27:24,459
in the BEC space that they're
being quite successful.

588
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:28,310
And then also some of the other
more Western countries out

589
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:31,000
there like the U.S. and great Britain.

590
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,920
And it's one some of the research
that we published in 2020,

591
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,920
we saw that upwards of a
quarter of all of the BEC actors

592
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,070
that we engage with on a daily basis,

593
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:42,112
were actually based out of the U.S.

594
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,820
So I mentioned those Russian actors,

595
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,810
and one of the groups I wanna
point out here is a group

596
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:49,379
that we call Cosmic Lynx.

597
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:51,220
This is a group that we
published a report on

598
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:53,030
in July of 2020.

599
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:56,260
And it's very important
I think this report,

600
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:59,290
because it is, as far as we
can tell the first instance

601
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:05,070
of a Russian specific Business
Email Compromised group.

602
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:06,820
Now, some of the things about Cosmic Lynx,

603
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:09,020
that's really interesting
is their attack tactics

604
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,785
are extremely well-written.

605
00:28:10,785 --> 00:28:13,643
You can see an example of one
of their initial emails here

606
00:28:13,643 --> 00:28:15,620
on the right-hand side of the screen,

607
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:18,409
and you can see there's a
lot of context in there.

608
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:19,820
There's a lot of information in there

609
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:22,419
and it's written very very well.

610
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:24,960
Most of their attacks
are written in English.

611
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,510
And as you can see form
a native English speaker

612
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:30,093
this is almost perfect
spelling and grammar.

613
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,140
They also take the time

614
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:34,643
to understand their
targets infrastructure.

615
00:28:34,643 --> 00:28:36,840
They wanna understand, you know do they

616
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,429
have an effective DMARC policy in place?

617
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:41,920
And if an organization does
have an effective DMARC policy

618
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,743
in place, they actually adapt
their tactics accordingly,

619
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:48,639
depending on whether
they can directly spoof

620
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,363
an executives email or not.

621
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,030
Their emails are M&A theme.

622
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:56,270
So it's so similar to an example

623
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:57,310
I showed a little bit earlier,

624
00:28:57,310 --> 00:29:00,789
they're looking at a
mergers and acquisition

625
00:29:00,789 --> 00:29:04,214
of a company based out of Asia.

626
00:29:04,214 --> 00:29:06,780
And you can see that they actually use

627
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:09,030
what we call a dual impersonation scheme.

628
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:12,930
So they initially target
impersonate the CEO of a company.

629
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:15,083
And then they'll hand
the target employee off

630
00:29:15,083 --> 00:29:16,914
to another persona who is impersonating

631
00:29:16,914 --> 00:29:21,914
an actual attorney generally
based out of a U.K. law firm.

632
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:24,433
And you can see what's really interesting,

633
00:29:24,433 --> 00:29:27,195
the follow up emails
that this group sends,

634
00:29:27,195 --> 00:29:29,240
again look very legitimate and look

635
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:32,070
like they could be coming
from a legitimate attorney.

636
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,274
They even use a lot of the information

637
00:29:34,275 --> 00:29:37,065
from the law firms website and the picture

638
00:29:37,065 --> 00:29:42,065
of the lawyer in the
signature of their emails.

639
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:49,710
Now similar to most of the
other BEC groups that we track,

640
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:51,920
Cosmic Lynx is what we would consider

641
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,230
to be industry agnostic.

642
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:55,890
So they're not going
after a specific industry

643
00:29:55,890 --> 00:29:56,940
but it's pretty clear

644
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:59,870
that they have a specific
target profile in place.

645
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:04,479
And those are large multinational
global organizations.

646
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,050
We've identified targets of Cosmic Lynx

647
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:08,867
in 53 different countries at these point.

648
00:30:08,867 --> 00:30:11,680
A lot of these organizations

649
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:15,320
are fortune 500 companies
or global 2000 companies.

650
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:19,409
And in addition to these big,
large global organizations,

651
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:21,670
instead of also going after, you know,

652
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:23,850
lower-level financial employees,

653
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:27,909
the targets of these attacks,
also senior level executives,

654
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:31,400
similar to a lot of the other
BEC groups that we track.

655
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,420
It's pretty clear that Cosmic Lynx

656
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:37,550
is identifying targets
based on their title.

657
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:41,399
And 75% of all of the
targets that we've seen

658
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,300
from Cosmic Lynx are
either managing directors,

659
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,443
vice-presidents or general managers.

660
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:51,740
So you know, we've gone over a little bit

661
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:56,500
of what BEC is, how it's
changed over in 2020.

662
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:59,000
How it's evolving in 2021

663
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,123
but let's look at how we can
combat this type of activity.

664
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:06,320
So one of the really
interesting aspects of BEC

665
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,020
is that unlike things
like credential phishing

666
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:13,253
or things like malware or
malicious payload attacks,

667
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:16,050
it actually requires interaction

668
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:18,513
with the victim in order to be successful.

669
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:22,770
So that gives us a really good opportunity

670
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:24,750
to get in the middle of these attacks

671
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:27,730
and start collecting intelligence

672
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:29,848
to better understand how they operate

673
00:31:29,848 --> 00:31:32,363
and how we can prevent them.

674
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:35,680
And this is what we call active defense.

675
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,320
And our definition of active defense

676
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,980
is essentially interacting
with an attack or an attacker

677
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:42,180
for the purpose of
collecting intelligence.

678
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:44,920
Now, this is not the same
thing as hacking back,

679
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,450
which has been sort of a buzzword

680
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:48,040
that we've seen in recent years.

681
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:51,110
It's not no deploying malicious payloads

682
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:53,949
on an attacker's infrastructure.

683
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:56,740
It's essentially just
interacting with that attack

684
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:59,180
for the purposes of collecting
additional intelligence.

685
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:01,840
And that could involve
things like engaging

686
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:05,350
with BEC actors, seeding
credential phishing sites,

687
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:07,300
embedding beacons in our communications

688
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,510
and setting up honeypots that allows us

689
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:12,033
to collect various types of intelligence.

690
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:15,370
At a small scale this is how it works.

691
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:18,889
A BEC actor may say, can you
send a payment to a new vendor?

692
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:21,010
We say, yes.

693
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:23,490
They may say can you change
my payroll information?

694
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:25,750
Our response sure.

695
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:28,560
Can you go buy $3,000
in iTunes gift cards?

696
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,290
Of course we can.

697
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:32,780
Would you mind sending me all the W-2s

698
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:34,230
for all of our employees?

699
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:36,040
Yeah, not a problem at all.

700
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,460
And can you send me something

701
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:39,130
like an up-to-date aging report?

702
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:41,140
Right away, we will get right on that.

703
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:42,790
You know, at its core that's essentially

704
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:45,120
how active defense works but
let's walk through a sort

705
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:48,209
of another overview of just demonstrate

706
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:50,960
in more concrete terms
about how this works.

707
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,160
So this is an email from a BEC actor

708
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,730
who's impersonating a CEO.

709
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:57,245
Who's asking for a payment
that's supposed to be sent out

710
00:32:57,245 --> 00:32:59,379
and saying what information do you need

711
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:00,540
to process this payment?

712
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:02,379
Please get back to me ASAP.

713
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:04,110
We say, not a problem at all.

714
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:06,189
Please send me the
beneficiary account details

715
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:08,120
and I'll get right on it.

716
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,370
They of course send us the details

717
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:12,260
for the first bill count
we're gonna be collected.

718
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:14,830
So we know where they
want the money to be sent.

719
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:17,000
And so this is sort of piece number one

720
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,860
of this intelligence collection.

721
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,560
We know where they want money to be sent.

722
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:24,559
We also know how this
attack is going to unfold

723
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:26,450
but of course we're not
gonna send them any money.

724
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:28,200
So our first response is to be like,

725
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,710
I'm actually getting a
message that says this account

726
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:33,940
isn't able to receive incoming
transfers at this time.

727
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:36,970
Could you check on that to
see if anything's wrong?

728
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:40,490
And of course they, something
may or may not be wrong

729
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:41,830
with the account, but
of course they send us

730
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:43,510
with another option for us to use.

731
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:45,320
And so this is the second
mule account that we've

732
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,090
now collected in this attack.

733
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:50,590
And in this case we're gonna
send them back a fake receipt.

734
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:51,423
They're like, perfect.

735
00:33:51,423 --> 00:33:52,256
The payment is out.

736
00:33:52,256 --> 00:33:53,940
Here's what, here's your confirmation,

737
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:57,560
by the way if there are any
other payments that you need me

738
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:01,210
to take care of please just let
me know as soon as possible.

739
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:03,750
To which they appreciate
the payment being sent out.

740
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,350
They said that they've seen it and said,

741
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:08,080
there's another payment I
actually need you to make.

742
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,620
Here are the details for that one.

743
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:11,889
And so we now have another mule account

744
00:34:11,889 --> 00:34:14,420
and this just goes on and on and on really

745
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:17,710
until these engagements
extinguish themselves,

746
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:20,050
you know sometimes this can take 24 hours.

747
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:22,260
Sometimes it could take a multiple months.

748
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,563
We've had some engagements
that we have that

749
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:27,770
have lasted almost three months
and we've collected dozens

750
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:29,880
of mule accounts from these actors.

751
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:33,360
And while the mule accounts
aren't the only component

752
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,460
that we're interested in.

753
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:36,293
We're also interested

754
00:34:36,293 --> 00:34:38,050
in other pieces of information as well.

755
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:41,159
Really the best thing about
these active defense engagements

756
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:45,000
is it allows us to understand
how one of these tax attacks

757
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,493
were to unfold if it was to be successful.

758
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:51,090
Now, similar to those
response based attacks,

759
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:53,860
we can use a lot of the same
concepts for courage efficient.

760
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:56,210
So this helps us better
understand what happens

761
00:34:57,330 --> 00:34:59,140
after account has been compromised.

762
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:01,170
We can set up our own infrastructure,

763
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:05,063
seed credentials into
that infrastructure based

764
00:35:05,063 --> 00:35:08,230
on the infrastructure we've sent out,

765
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:11,610
seed those accounts into
credential phishing sites

766
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:14,380
and then look at the back
end and see what happens.

767
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:17,060
We can see how quickly an
account's been compromised

768
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:19,040
or where is it being accessed from?

769
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,570
How is it being accessed?

770
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:23,389
And then what does the actor also wanna do

771
00:35:23,389 --> 00:35:24,530
with those accounts?

772
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:28,114
Do they want to send additional emails out

773
00:35:28,114 --> 00:35:29,740
from that account?

774
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:31,939
Will they then pivot to other
types of infrastructure?

775
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:34,186
Do they wanna go to
one drive or SharePoint

776
00:35:34,186 --> 00:35:37,920
or do they wanna set up forwarding
rules on those accounts?

777
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,241
Again, it helps us understand what happens

778
00:35:40,241 --> 00:35:43,323
after one of these attacks is successful.

779
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,040
So at its core, how does
active defense help?

780
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,820
So, again, as I've mentioned

781
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:52,160
it allows us to see the
entire BEC attack cycle.

782
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,350
We can observe BEC actor
tactics that we wouldn't be able

783
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:58,370
to see if we were just
doing passive collection.

784
00:35:58,370 --> 00:36:01,299
It helps us understand
a fraudulent accounts.

785
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:03,110
We can optimize their defenses based

786
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:05,300
on the strategic intelligence
we're collecting.

787
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:09,023
And at its core, it helps us
mitigate risk from BEC attacks.

788
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:11,143
We can help this.

789
00:36:11,143 --> 00:36:15,060
We can also use active defense
to disrupt the BEC ecosystem.

790
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,029
Based on what we collect,

791
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:18,760
we can send the validated email accounts

792
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,090
to email providers to get those shutdown.

793
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:23,050
We can provide the mule accounts to places

794
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:25,980
like FSI SEC and other
banks to get those reviewed

795
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,700
and mitigated as quickly as possible.

796
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:28,970
And then we can also collaborate

797
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:31,930
with law enforcement to help
supplement investigations

798
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:33,230
that they may be conducting.

799
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:35,930
That's pretty much the
end of my presentation.

800
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:39,259
No, as far as applications
of how you can apply

801
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:41,858
this information, I hope
you learned some things,

802
00:36:41,858 --> 00:36:43,510
few things like, you
know, asking questions.

803
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:45,920
Like, do I have systems
today equipped to defend

804
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,010
against identity deception attack?

805
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:51,070
Do I have effective
internal processes developed

806
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:53,360
to prevent unauthorized wire transfers?

807
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:57,380
And am I able to run an active
defense program in house?

808
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:59,810
Or is this something
that I should outsource

809
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:01,580
to another organization?

810
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:04,549
If anyone would like more
information about BEC

811
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:06,410
and intelligence that we
know my team has collected

812
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:08,509
about the BEC ecosystem,

813
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:12,830
please you can go to
agari.com/active-defense

814
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:16,860
and you can also go to
acid.agari.com to download any

815
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:19,470
of the previous BEC intelligence reports

816
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:21,533
that my team has published.

817
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:25,129
Thank you very much for

818
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:26,250

and I hope you enjoy the
rest of the conference.
