1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:02,980
- Welcome everybody to today's session.

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:06,710
End The Battle Between
Security And Productivity.

3
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:09,670
I am joined today with my
colleague, David Holmes,

4
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:13,809
talking about a super important
topic and the future of work

5
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:15,330
and in cybersecurity today,

6
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:18,940
which is how to balance the need for

7
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:21,590
securing enterprise data
and your organization

8
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:24,280
as a whole with end-user productivity.

9
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,170
And so this has been a major challenge

10
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:27,660
for many organizations today.

11
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,680
We're gonna tackle some topics

12
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:33,140
around employee experience,
engagement productivity

13
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:34,670
and also how to balance that

14
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:37,200
with a modern security strategy.

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,260
So David and I both work for
a company called Forrester.

16
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:44,180
If you don't know Forrester,
we are a market research firm,

17
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,240
based out of Boston, Massachusetts

18
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,620
and we work with business
and technology leaders

19
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:52,390
to drive customer obsessed
strategies for growth.

20
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:56,730
And so I sit on our Infrastructure
and Operations team.

21
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:59,300
I've been at Forrester
now for seven years.

22
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,599
So I think I'm the lone IT Ops person

23
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,660
that doesn't work at
insecurity at this conference

24
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:07,640
but I cover all end-user
computing at Forrester.

25
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,730
I'm one of our lead
researchers for remote working.

26
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:14,520
And I also do a lot of work
on technology experience

27
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,839
for employees which is why
I was the representative

28
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,320
on the technology EX
component of this research

29
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,899
with my colleague David Holmes.

30
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,530
So David, you wanna introduce yourself

31
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:27,690
and bring the audience
through our agenda today?

32
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:30,329
- Yeah, hey everybody,
it's David at Forester.

33
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:33,880
So I am an analyst on Forester
Security and Risk team

34
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,679
coming up on my second year at Forrester

35
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,250
but it feels like 14 years.

36
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:39,060
So I think it's like dog years,

37
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,150
like your time as an analyst at Forrester,

38
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:44,560
but I cover things like security,

39
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,920
Zero Trust, Zero Trust network access

40
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,790
what Forrester calls the Zero Trust edge

41
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:51,160
or what you'll see in
the market and sassy.

42
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:54,020
And I cover DDoS and
network security controls

43
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,300
and crypto and DNS, and
a whole bunch of stuff.

44
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,470
And I'm really, really
excited to be here with Andrew

45
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:02,800
to talk about ending that battle between

46
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:05,679
productivity and security, right?

47
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,810
This is something that has been
a challenge my entire life,

48
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:12,510
is when security gets in
the way of productivity

49
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:14,880
and what we're positing in
the report that goes along

50
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:18,230
with this talk is that not
only can you end that battle,

51
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:19,063
you can actually,

52
00:02:19,063 --> 00:02:22,399
when you do Zero Trust or
do cybersecurity correctly,

53
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,860
you can actually improve productivity

54
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:28,290
and improve the employee experience

55
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:30,890
while you improve your security posture.

56
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:33,809
So we're gonna lay this out really simply.

57
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:35,640
We're gonna talk about what we think

58
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:40,640
of as measuring productivity,
the EX part, right?

59
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,820
And then we'll talk about
and define Zero Trust

60
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:44,653
in the cybersecurity part.

61
00:02:44,653 --> 00:02:46,640
And then we'll try to tie those together.

62
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,109
We'll give real world examples
and then we'll leave you

63
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:51,900
with, what can you do in
like in the next 60 to

64
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,160
90 days to get started?

65
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,000
But one of the things I wanted to mention

66
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,030
before we move on is Andrew And I actually

67
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:01,600
started this research prior
to the pandemic, right.

68
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,519
I think it was at the
company Christmas party 2019

69
00:03:05,509 --> 00:03:08,130
- It was, our last in-person interaction.

70
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:10,430
I think it was with you dude.

71
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:11,263
- Oh my goodness.

72
00:03:11,263 --> 00:03:14,970
My goodness seems like
forever ago, but we actually

73
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:17,590
started this report prior,
this research, prior

74
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,270
to the pandemic, but
everything that happened

75
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:22,720
during the pandemic has,
I think, proven us out

76
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,767
and given us real good concrete
examples to, to show you.

77
00:03:26,767 --> 00:03:28,490
So I'm going to turn it back to you

78
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:31,930
for a little bit, Andrew, to
explain what we mean by EX

79
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:35,050
- So EX is the really
important research area

80
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:37,760
at Forrester and also a
really important area to focus

81
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,299
on as an organization,
as you go into 2021.

82
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:44,210
We define employee experience as the sum

83
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:45,940
of all the perceptions that an employee

84
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,670
has working at the company.

85
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:51,170
It could be perceptions
around a manager relationship.

86
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:53,359
It could be perceptions
around collaboration

87
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,630
with their coworkers, with technology.

88
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:58,140
It's really, basically
everything that they experience

89
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,299
on a daily basis.

90
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,720
The sum of all those things.

91
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,310
And does that make them happier

92
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,540
or does that make them
want to leave your company

93
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,489
and go somewhere else?

94
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:08,260
And so one of the things that you'll see

95
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:12,160
throughout our presentation is
the importance of technology

96
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,859
in that overall employee
experience in terms

97
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:18,370
of how it either contributes
to better engagement

98
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:21,730
of your workforce or
contributes to the opposite

99
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:25,200
which is burnout and
attrition and your workforce.

100
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,140
And specifically, we're
gonna talk about how security

101
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:31,810
really can play a role
in driving an employee

102
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:33,760
towards more engagement
or to more burnout.

103
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,170
And so I'll make that
connection here and then

104
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:39,707
we will apply some of the best
practices around Zero Trust

105
00:04:39,707 --> 00:04:42,360
technology and strategy as a whole

106
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,924
as far as how do you overcome

107
00:04:43,924 --> 00:04:47,440
some of this tension between
security and productivity?

108
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,469
So let's dive in a little bit first

109
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:52,180
I'll say that the stakes are
incredibly high when it comes

110
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,610
to these two topics.

111
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:57,599
So the thing that really launched
this whole research stream

112
00:04:57,599 --> 00:05:00,130
for me, and it was really
illuminating with clients

113
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:03,469
is I had a conversation
with an IT director

114
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,050
and a large financial services firm.

115
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:07,586
I believe it was in the US and he said,

116
00:05:07,586 --> 00:05:11,350
"I'm worried that if we don't
give employees more choice,

117
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:15,400
there's going to be a full-on
revolt in our organization."

118
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,880
People are going to leave and

119
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,960
they were starting to hear this

120
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,150
in the exit interviews that the technology

121
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:22,960
that they were given on
a daily basis was not

122
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,359
allowing them to do
their jobs effectively.

123
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,080
It was a very standard,
PC to employee type

124
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,859
of environment, lock
down, corporate image,

125
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:35,120
very little self service,
very little autonomy overall.

126
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,410
And so the employees
wanted more flexibility,

127
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:39,530
something that was being driven a lot

128
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:43,059
by consumerization of IT that
we've heard about for so long.

129
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:46,500
And so for this organization
trying to solve this tension

130
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,340
between what do we need to do

131
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:51,489
from a compliance risk
and security perspective

132
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:53,700
on our environment
versus what our employees

133
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:57,380
actually want was a major
challenge for them to overcome.

134
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,170
And we posit three things

135
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:02,170
in our research that are
major business outcomes

136
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:04,430
from not solving this issue.

137
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:08,160
So number one is engagement
is going to increase

138
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,650
and decrease, not increase
across your workforce.

139
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:14,380
And what we found
statistically is that the most

140
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:17,909
engaged employees also are much
more likely to be satisfied

141
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:20,480
with our company's security policies.

142
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,480
We'll show some of the data
that proves that point.

143
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,163
We also found that employees will dodge

144
00:06:27,163 --> 00:06:29,170
the security blanket if it gets in the way

145
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:30,610
of them being productive.

146
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:32,650
There is some pretty horrifying

147
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:35,169
and eye-opening data about the frequency

148
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:37,940
and willingness to
circumvent security policies

149
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,840
in the name of productivity,
which we'll also show you.

150
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,979
And thirdly, which is really
important as you start to come

151
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,850
out of this pandemic is
innovation will suffer

152
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:48,930
and why will that occur?

153
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:49,763
It will occur

154
00:06:49,763 --> 00:06:53,450
because organizations will spend months,

155
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:54,860
if not years,

156
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:58,300
going through RFPs to make sure that

157
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,480
they can handle the newest

158
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,500
and greatest technology
that employees want to bring

159
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,930
into the workforce, that they
can adopt it in a secure way.

160
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:09,350
If you don't have a modern
security architecture

161
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:11,430
that allows you to take on things quickly

162
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,490
and do it in a secure manner,

163
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:16,080
what you're going to find
is that your competition

164
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,060
is going to start to
take on new technologies

165
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,860
and start to out-compete you in markets

166
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:23,810
because their employees are
going to be way more effective

167
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:24,990
at getting their work done

168
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:27,090
and contributing to the company overall.

169
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:29,969
So just to wrap things up,
this stakes are really high.

170
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:33,520
We need to start thinking about
how do we end this war here.

171
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,190
So diving a little bit into the
employee experience overall,

172
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,030
we have at Forester what's called

173
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,469
our Employee Experience Index

174
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:42,190
and this was developed by an ambulance

175
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:45,040
by the name of Dave Johnson
on our future of work team.

176
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,674
And essentially the Employee
Experience Index measures

177
00:07:47,674 --> 00:07:50,988
employee engagement on
a scale of zero to 100,

178
00:07:50,988 --> 00:07:55,200
100 meaning I'm most
engaged, very productive,

179
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,979
I'm likely to stay at my company.

180
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,910
Zero being I'm not engaged at
all, probably gonna be gone

181
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:01,910
in the next couple of
months, that sort of thing.

182
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:04,020
And so what we found
that there were a variety

183
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,830
of different psychological
factors that impact

184
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:10,750
whether someone is engaged
towards that 100 or disengaged.

185
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,510
And they roughly break down into these

186
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:15,610
three buckets of empowerment,
which is all about

187
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:18,300
how does the organization,
give you clarity

188
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,530
of your role, gives you
the right manager resources

189
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:23,296
etcetera, to be successful.

190
00:08:23,296 --> 00:08:25,150
That's the most influential

191
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:26,979
on the overall employee experience.

192
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:29,010
Inspiration which is all about alignment

193
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:31,520
of my personal values with the mission

194
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,568
and values of the company,

195
00:08:32,568 --> 00:08:34,419
feeling like my work matters,

196
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:38,599
that sort of thing, and enablement,
which is all technology.

197
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,549
So this is one of the biggest
findings of this research

198
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:44,670
is that 30% of what drives
the employee experience

199
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:46,810
are actually technology
related factors here.

200
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:50,527
So you can see six of
the most statistically

201
00:08:50,528 --> 00:08:54,870
relevant factors for
improving employee experience

202
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,840
or impacting employee experience

203
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,756
from a technology perspective
on the screen here

204
00:08:58,756 --> 00:09:00,981
- Can I put you on the spot if we didn't

205
00:09:00,981 --> 00:09:02,082
- Yeah.

206
00:09:02,082 --> 00:09:05,780
- That these data points here
where they collected prior

207
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,100
to the pandemic

208
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,020
- They were, yep.

209
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:11,000
- So you think these numbers
are probably even more skewed

210
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,680
toward technology in
the remote work worlds?

211
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,370
- I would say absolutely. We
haven't done the analysis yet

212
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:20,610
but technology is literally the lifeline

213
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:22,160
between the employee and the organization.

214
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,430
Now, there's broad shifts
towards remote working

215
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:28,880
and you'll see some data later
on that we're going to share

216
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,840
around that we expected this
to continue to increase.

217
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,550
So absolutely, I think
if we were to look back

218
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:37,097
at this data now and rerun
the engagement survey

219
00:09:37,097 --> 00:09:41,117
we probably see it's potentially
even higher than 30% now.

220
00:09:41,118 --> 00:09:43,180
But the end goal here is to really

221
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,540
to drive a purpose worker.

222
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:47,150
That's what we call a
fully engaged worker.

223
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:49,520
Someone who is bringing
their selves to work

224
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,949
in the fullest way
possible every single day.

225
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:55,340
And so technology plays
a major role in that.

226
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:58,177
And one of the really
interesting things that we found

227
00:09:58,177 --> 00:10:00,970
in the research is that security directly

228
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:03,480
impacts engagement as well.

229
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,680
So if you look here,

230
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,560
the light blue bars are
your most engaged employees.

231
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,449
And so 89% of your highly
engaged employees are satisfied

232
00:10:12,449 --> 00:10:15,271
with company technology,
security policies,

233
00:10:15,271 --> 00:10:19,620
just 25% of the lowest engaged
employees are satisfied

234
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,960
with that overall policy.

235
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,107
So there's a huge gap.

236
00:10:23,107 --> 00:10:25,620
If you are a non-engaged

237
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,540
you're likely not to be satisfied

238
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:30,520
with those security policies overall.

239
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,590
And the same thing occurs

240
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:33,720
for things like information access.

241
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,128
There's a 63% gap there,

242
00:10:36,128 --> 00:10:39,767
satisfaction with
collaboration technology 66%.

243
00:10:39,767 --> 00:10:41,310
And so there are a variety

244
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:44,290
of different technologies
that we've looked at as far

245
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:48,449
as their impact on overall
engagement, security policies

246
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:50,750
and satisfaction with
those policies are one

247
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,540
of the most decisive for
someone's satisfaction

248
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:57,310
with technology and engagement
in the workplace overall.

249
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:58,270
So it's actually

250
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,329
- This correlation - born out.

251
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:00,368
There's a correlation. Yep.

252
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:02,913
That's born out in a lot of the data here.

253
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:07,760
And the reason the following
question to that is,

254
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,710
why does this matter so much?

255
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,329
When you think about overall engagement

256
00:11:11,329 --> 00:11:14,859
one of the most illuminative
pieces of research

257
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:17,530
that I've read is from the
work of Teresa Amabile,

258
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:19,769
who's a PhD at Harvard who says that,

259
00:11:19,769 --> 00:11:21,540
"Employees are most happy

260
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,640
when they're making progress every day

261
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,170
and work that they feel is meaningful."

262
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:28,010
So it is about productivity overall

263
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:31,189
that's driving higher levels
of satisfaction and engagement.

264
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,649
Think about it in your own life.

265
00:11:32,649 --> 00:11:35,910
How good do you feel at the end of the day

266
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:38,569
if you go home and you've just
been procrastinating all day

267
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:40,060
and you've gotten nothing done

268
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:42,050
versus a day where you were super focused

269
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:44,000
and you got a lot of stuff off your plate,

270
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,760
you feel a lot more engaged on the ladder,

271
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,870
I guarantee you.

272
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:49,640
And so this is one of the
reasons why, when we ask folks

273
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,360
why do you sometimes ignore

274
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,920
or go around your company's
security policies?

275
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,280
34% said they had to
collaborate with peers

276
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,530
outside of the company that's
related to productivity.

277
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:02,020
And 33% said, it's the most efficient way

278
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,178
of doing what I need to get done.

279
00:12:04,178 --> 00:12:07,612
31% saying that their policies are strict

280
00:12:07,612 --> 00:12:09,480
or unreasonable in nature.

281
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,930
So if an employee feels

282
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:13,849
like their productivity is being impacted

283
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:16,695
by security policies,
they will circumvent that.

284
00:12:16,695 --> 00:12:19,650
And interestingly, we didn't
include this data point here

285
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:24,650
but 10% of employees
admit that they would go

286
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,530
around a security policy
if they knew how to.

287
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:30,220
So it doesn't sound like a
huge number, but if you think

288
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:33,260
if 10% of your workforce is
saying, if I knew how to get

289
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:35,880
around this policy, I
would absolutely do it.

290
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,770
That's why this conversation
is so important because lack

291
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:43,410
of productivity leads to
lack of security as well.

292
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:44,764
And it also leads to burnout.

293
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,260
Here are your 10 predictors

294
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,569
of burnout as statistically proven

295
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:51,490
through the employee experience index.

296
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:52,800
You can see at the bottom here

297
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,250
these are the top 10 security
policies, hinder productivity.

298
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,740
So security policies are
basically the number 10 driver

299
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:02,290
of employee burnout in the workplace,

300
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:04,329
which is high considering
all the other factors

301
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:06,570
that can contribute to overall burnout,

302
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:10,540
not the most, correlated
with burnout overall,

303
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,189
but definitely playing a role.

304
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:15,030
And so as you start to
think about productivity

305
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:16,120
in your organization,

306
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,640
you really going to have to start thinking

307
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,390
about how does security get

308
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:21,810
in the way of people
getting their work done.

309
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:24,579
And so one of the major
posits that we made

310
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,708
with this research, and I'm
going to hand it over to David

311
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:31,180
in just a moment is that a
new, modern security strategy

312
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,599
what we call a Zero Trust

313
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:37,240
at Forester, is a way to help
overcome a lot of these issues

314
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,140
and resolve some of that
fundamental tension.

315
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,640
So over the next couple of minutes

316
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,210
I'm going to hand it over to David.

317
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:43,880
I'll probably chime in as well.

318
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:44,970
Just to talk a little bit

319
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:47,842
about how ZT specifically can help you

320
00:13:47,842 --> 00:13:50,420
with your employee experience strategy.

321
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,610
Over to you, David.

322
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:52,920
- Andrew, Fantastic.

323
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:53,752
Thanks for setting that up.

324
00:13:53,753 --> 00:13:55,020
I'm going to back up one slide real quick

325
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:55,960
because I wanted to look

326
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:59,210
at the two numbers where security policies

327
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:01,520
hindering productivity,
and too many meetings

328
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:04,420
on my calendar who
doesn't hate that, right?

329
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,180
Those are like, that's the same

330
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,840
almost the same number four.

331
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,660
That's going to drive on employee burnout.

332
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,613
And that's, I just
wanted to highlight that.

333
00:14:12,613 --> 00:14:14,764
- I bet that that would be
higher this year as well.

334
00:14:14,764 --> 00:14:18,040
- I think so too. I think
they're both (indistinct)

335
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:21,022
Okay so, in two slides, I just wanted to,

336
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,350
if you weren't familiar

337
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:25,100
with Forrester's Zero Trust, right.

338
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:28,190
This was a paper that came
out of Forrester in 2009.

339
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:30,210
And I remember I was a younger man,

340
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:31,540
almost maybe Angela's age.

341
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,530
When I first read the paper

342
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:35,370
and I was reading a
bootleg copy of this paper

343
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:38,000
and I was like, "This, these
are what should people get."

344
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,280
This is what we have
everything we have done wrong.

345
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,079
It's security, and this
is the way for it, right?

346
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:45,310
So the paper lays out
three core principles

347
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:47,819
for a Zero Trust model
of information security.

348
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,600
And the first one was consider
all networks on trust.

349
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,381
There shouldn't be part of
your network where you say,

350
00:14:52,381 --> 00:14:54,309
"Oh, well it's coming from
that part of the network

351
00:14:54,309 --> 00:14:55,280
so I'm just going to trust it"

352
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,343
Right? And that's less common today

353
00:14:57,343 --> 00:14:58,967
that you see networks like that,

354
00:14:58,967 --> 00:15:03,603
partly because of the
advocacy of Zero Trust.

355
00:15:03,604 --> 00:15:05,972
And another way to think
about this principle is

356
00:15:05,972 --> 00:15:07,720
trust the identity, right?

357
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,070
Establishing, trusting identity.

358
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:10,490
Don't just trust a network connection

359
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:13,070
because it's coming from a
place that you consider trusted.

360
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:15,370
A second core principle
is least privilege access

361
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:18,230
must be enforced, but
only give the privileges

362
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:21,750
to somebody that they need in
order to do their job, right?

363
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,838
And if you need to
elevate them temporarily

364
00:15:23,838 --> 00:15:27,510
or to do a certain task and we do so then

365
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,750
but then revoke it later, right?

366
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,740
And then the third one
is, well, the paper didn't

367
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:34,680
use the phrase assume
breach that came later.

368
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,170
That's what it was really talking about

369
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:40,689
is assume that attackers
will eventually get in.

370
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,730
If they're not in already
and have the machinery

371
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:44,900
in place that you can detect them

372
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,120
and then hopefully block
the lateral movement, right.

373
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,653
Or contain the blast radius.

374
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,300
And then if you wanted
to make a bumper sticker

375
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,712
out of Zero Trust, you would say

376
00:15:52,712 --> 00:15:54,959
"Never trust, always verify."

377
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,280
As a matter of fact if you
ever want to sound smarter

378
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,350
at a party, right?

379
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:00,850
You can just say "Never
trust, always verify people."

380
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:02,890
People in the know will
know what you mean.

381
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:06,629
Now, we haven't sat still
at Forrester for over the

382
00:16:06,629 --> 00:16:10,070
since 2009, we have somewhat
evolved Zero Trust to

383
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:12,340
make it a little bit more
less about the network

384
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:15,550
which is what the initial papers
were really talking about.

385
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:18,189
And more to talk about the
different elements, right?

386
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:21,320
And so this is how we
visualize Zero Trust today,

387
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,390
and what we think of as
an extended ecosystem

388
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:25,187
with seven domains, right?

389
00:16:25,187 --> 00:16:28,309
And the reason we do this
is we put data at the center

390
00:16:28,309 --> 00:16:31,240
because we think Zero Trust is
all about protecting the data

391
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,480
and not protecting, about
protecting a network.

392
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,979
However, you need more
than just data security,

393
00:16:35,979 --> 00:16:37,730
you need to have security controls

394
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,600
around the things that
interact with the data

395
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,360
which can broadly be categorized

396
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,740
into four domains,

397
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:45,970
people, devices, networks, and workloads.

398
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:47,080
And so when you think of people

399
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,740
you might think of technology groups

400
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,780
like identity and access
management, right,

401
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,620
or workloads can be applications.

402
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:57,280
And you could think of application
security or for networks

403
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,660
you might think of technologies
like micro-segmentation.

404
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:02,199
And for devices, you may
think of device security.

405
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,570
And throughout all that,
we think you need to

406
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:05,369
have this some kind of visibility system

407
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:07,206
or what we call network analytics ability

408
00:17:07,207 --> 00:17:09,670
so that you can see events

409
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:11,760
and correlate them through
the different domain.

410
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,869
So for example, if David was put

411
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:17,500
on a personal action notice
and may leave the company, so,

412
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,160
but also started downloading a whole bunch

413
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,770
of data on his laptop.

414
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:22,609
Maybe those two things are related

415
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:24,719
and we need to have some kind
of visibility between those.

416
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,260
And then lastly, we think you
need to be able to orchestrate

417
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,170
and automate everything
because the number of threats

418
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:30,455
coming at you are too high.

419
00:17:30,455 --> 00:17:33,189
So, anyway, just in
those two slides, right,

420
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:35,350
that was Zero Trust, the
three core principles.

421
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:37,310
And then here's how we
can operationalize it

422
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:38,560
and think about it today.

423
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,633
All right.

424
00:17:40,633 --> 00:17:44,280
So we have set up EX and
we have set up ZT, right.

425
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:48,760
And now let's talk
about how ZT can improve

426
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,693
the EX part.

427
00:17:51,693 --> 00:17:54,680
So, there are, so the
pandemic happened, right.

428
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,400
And nobody was prepared
except for, I guess,

429
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,020
the home, the people who
are already remote workers

430
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,040
were prepared.

431
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,376
But, but Andrew, I don't know

432
00:18:02,376 --> 00:18:04,420
if you wanted to speak to
some of these stats here.

433
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,840
- Yeah. So I think, if you

434
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,850
weren't thinking about Zero Trust and

435
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:12,351
how to implement that to
improve user experience in 2019,

436
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,770
you were definitely thinking

437
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:15,650
about it by the end of 2020, right?

438
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:19,350
Because this data that has
left the data center that is

439
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:23,080
now traveling to home network
to personally own devices.

440
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:26,783
It's never coming back, our personal,

441
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,560
or your Forrester's take

442
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:33,283
on the overall increases
that 300% expected increase

443
00:18:33,284 --> 00:18:35,340
and permanent full-time remote workers.

444
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,860
So in the US that means one in five

445
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,892
typically it's on a yearly basis.

446
00:18:39,893 --> 00:18:42,300
7% of US workers are full-time.

447
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,340
We anticipate it's going to be 21%.

448
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,750
And so you're going to have
to deal with this challenge

449
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:47,686
like it or not.

450
00:18:47,686 --> 00:18:50,520
That's the way that the world is moving.

451
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:54,660
And most organizations are
going to be hybrid in nature.

452
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:57,680
We've said 60% of
organizations will be hybrid

453
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,440
but that means that
you're still gonna have to

454
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,400
protect that data wherever it goes,

455
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,336
whether it's on your corporate
network or whether it's in,

456
00:19:04,336 --> 00:19:08,460
a coffee shop, or in a
library, or at someone's home,

457
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,630
it's never coming back.

458
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:12,660
And so we knew that people
weren't really prepared

459
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:15,390
for this 47% responded to our survey.

460
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:17,294
And the early part of COVID saying,

461
00:19:17,294 --> 00:19:19,620
our infrastructure, wasn't
ready to handle this.

462
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:22,860
And so we've had so many
different conversations,

463
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,560
both David and myself on

464
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,139
what are those technology investments

465
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:29,780
that you can make to one,
improve your security

466
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:32,350
and make it more flexible
for remote work environment.

467
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:35,060
But two, also enable someone to be very

468
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:37,710
productive in basically any circumstance

469
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:40,990
- Perfect segue into this first thing.

470
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:42,660
So here's the first example we have

471
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:45,060
of how Zero Trust can improve EX.

472
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:48,570
And as Andrew was hinting
that less than half

473
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:50,810
of the organizations that
we surveyed said that

474
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:53,780
they were equipped to handle
so much remote, remote work.

475
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:56,149
And guess who all of
those people who are not

476
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:59,970
equipped to handle calls,
they called Andrew and myself.

477
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:02,090
And I basically sat on
the phone for months

478
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:03,986
at a time talking to people that said,

479
00:20:03,987 --> 00:20:06,430
"Look our VP can't
just, can't handle this,

480
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:07,990
all this remote work."

481
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:10,840
And they want, can I
split tunnel my traffic?

482
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:13,899
Right. Can I just send all
of my internet bound traffic

483
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:17,390
out to the internet, but still
keep me keep my VPN going?

484
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:19,430
And that was a conversation
I had all the time

485
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:22,313
when they still have
that with clients today.

486
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,627
But I tried to tell them, you know what

487
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,679
that's suboptimal from
a security perspective

488
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:32,520
because while you may be improving

489
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,980
your employee's experience
with their internet browsing

490
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:39,250
you're actually providing a
tunnel for them to get infected.

491
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:43,140
And then for the malware to
go right into your perimeter.

492
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,210
So don't do that, right?

493
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:46,230
And so they would say, well,
what am I supposed to do?

494
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:49,560
The answer fortunately
was a technology called

495
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,990
Zero Trust network access.

496
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:53,670
So you may have seen this
prior to the pandemic,

497
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:55,230
it's called a Secure Remote Access

498
00:20:55,230 --> 00:21:00,070
but it is applying Zero Trust principles

499
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:02,750
to be able to create some kind of access

500
00:21:03,807 --> 00:21:07,240
that allows a remote worker to connect

501
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:10,870
to the on-prem applications
that they need, right?

502
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:13,515
So for many organizations
that I talked to,

503
00:21:13,516 --> 00:21:15,615
the applications that
people use day to day

504
00:21:15,615 --> 00:21:19,010
are ones that are, they're
up in the cloud, right?

505
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:21,370
They're the workdays of the
world, Salesforce, etcetera.

506
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:24,283
But they still have a
few on-prem applications.

507
00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:28,240
And having a Zero Trust
network access was one

508
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,227
of the things that they were able to say,

509
00:21:30,227 --> 00:21:31,940
"Okay, we're going to use this."

510
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:36,690
And maybe in combination
with cloud deliver

511
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:39,270
and secure web gateway, we'll
combine those two things.

512
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:42,120
And then our, all of
our remote workers are

513
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:46,270
will be unhindered by our VPN capacity.

514
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:48,490
And they'll have a mostly straight path

515
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:51,010
out to the internet while
still being protected.

516
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:52,040
But then when they want to come

517
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,282
into our on-prem to access,

518
00:21:54,282 --> 00:21:56,983
whatever resources we still have on prem

519
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:58,560
that they can do so.

520
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,889
And so this is a
conversation they still have

521
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:02,160
with people every day.

522
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:05,280
And remember that we
started this research prior

523
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,090
to the pandemic, and then this was one

524
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:10,360
of the signature technologies
that happened, right?

525
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,841
And so very likely at your organization

526
00:22:12,841 --> 00:22:14,810
you may already be doing this right.

527
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:16,780
If you signed up with one of the many

528
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:21,010
there's probably 30 vendors
that offer a solution like this,

529
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:23,810
or Microsoft itself offers
a solution like this.

530
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:25,540
You may already be doing this.

531
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,633
And ideally it works so well

532
00:22:27,633 --> 00:22:29,750
that you don't even notice, right?

533
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:32,040
And that's what we're trying to get up.

534
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:35,475
Now, one of the things I wanted
to make clear here is that

535
00:22:35,475 --> 00:22:39,139
if you are a security
professional and attending this

536
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,660
conference, very likely you are, right,

537
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,070
you might've been familiar with Zero Trust

538
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,020
for the last 10 years.

539
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:46,280
And you might've seen
that, it's been creeping

540
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:49,420
up in adoption, was popular
while it's become the sort

541
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:53,070
of defacto Mindshare
cybersecurity strategy.

542
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:55,689
You may have to look pretty far and wide

543
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:57,120
before you find somebody who's

544
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,810
actually implemented it, right?

545
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:01,040
And one of the things that was missing,

546
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,480
the Zero Trust was missing
was a clear business driver

547
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,530
for why to do it, right.

548
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:05,777
Many security professionals to say,

549
00:23:05,777 --> 00:23:06,610
"I clearly recognize this,

550
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:08,296
this is a security strategy,

551
00:23:08,297 --> 00:23:09,740
that's built around the theme

552
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:10,980
of reducing the threat surface."

553
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:11,880
And I totally get that.

554
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,090
That's great.

555
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:14,990
But how do I sell that?

556
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:17,130
How do I get the budget to do that, right?

557
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:20,100
What you actually need
was a business driver.

558
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,919
And here comes the biggest externality

559
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,160
of my entire career, the pandemic.

560
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,020
where everybody goes to work from home

561
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,970
and then nobody can get any work done.

562
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:29,640
And then somebody headboard is gone.

563
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,380
What, we're losing
millions of dollars a day

564
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,130
because none of our employees can work.

565
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:34,590
Why don't we adopt their trust?

566
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:35,550
Boom.

567
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:39,240
That's like, there's the business
driver that took this off.

568
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,960
So many companies today are sort of

569
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,927
they're dating Zero Trust by

570
00:23:42,927 --> 00:23:45,717
using a Zero Trust
network access solution.

571
00:23:45,718 --> 00:23:47,923
And before I, before
I move on here, Andrew

572
00:23:47,923 --> 00:23:49,983
did you have any comments about this one?

573
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,780
- I would just say, thank you so much

574
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:55,557
for taking all the VPN
inquiries last year.

575
00:23:55,557 --> 00:23:57,380
(both laughs)

576
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:59,040
- I was the new guy time.

577
00:23:59,040 --> 00:23:59,873
I felt like

578
00:23:59,873 --> 00:24:01,410
- You were missed their VPN last year.

579
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:05,440
- It was VPN, hail the VPN.

580
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,273
All right.

581
00:24:06,273 --> 00:24:07,106
I think you might have some things,

582
00:24:07,106 --> 00:24:09,340
we'll both have some things
to say about this one

583
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,294
but I'll let you start.

584
00:24:10,295 --> 00:24:11,397
- Alright.

585
00:24:11,397 --> 00:24:12,889
Okay. So, if we look back at some

586
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:15,667
of the drivers of engagement
for employee experience

587
00:24:15,667 --> 00:24:18,740
one of the top ones is access to tasks,

588
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,950
critical information to do my job,

589
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:24,510
ability to get stuff that helps
me learn about my customers,

590
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:26,128
learn about my colleagues,

591
00:24:26,128 --> 00:24:28,090
really just contribute to my company.

592
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:29,360
And the biggest thing that gets

593
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:34,050
in the way of this is the
traditional password and the,

594
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:38,760
especially with some of the
more difficult requirements

595
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,100
around password length and complexity

596
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:44,620
and how often you have to
shift out that password,

597
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,199
that can be a huge mess.

598
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,910
And especially when you start thinking

599
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:50,850
about a multi OS or
multi-device environment

600
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:54,260
where every time I
update a domain password

601
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:58,110
on my primary laptop, I have
to do it on my smartphone.

602
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:00,760
And every other thing
that I'm, that I'm using.

603
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,879
And so passwords are one

604
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,370
of the key areas that
you can start thinking

605
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:06,409
about as part of your Zero Trust strategy.

606
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:10,089
One, eliminate them
because they're less secure

607
00:25:10,089 --> 00:25:13,450
than a passwordless
form of authentication.

608
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:16,948
And two, think about
reducing the cognitive load

609
00:25:16,948 --> 00:25:19,030
for that employee, as they're thinking

610
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:22,190
about what is my password, I
know I changed it last week

611
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:23,680
but I don't remember what it is.

612
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,510
All of a sudden I'm super distracted

613
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:27,930
and can't focus on my most important work.

614
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:30,850
So when we think about sort
of modern Zero Trust security

615
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:34,110
with regards to the password,
obviously there's things

616
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:37,022
like multi-factor authentication,
which continued to be

617
00:25:37,022 --> 00:25:42,010
highly asked about amongst
our clients, biometrics,

618
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:45,820
and device factors are also
a form that can help to

619
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:49,689
decrease that overall
need, facial recognition,

620
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:52,150
I think will be something important

621
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:53,501
once we get rid of the masks

622
00:25:53,501 --> 00:25:55,990
- That was going great
till the mask thing.

623
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:56,823
- Yeah, it was going great.

624
00:25:56,823 --> 00:25:57,830
- Lot more touch ID.

625
00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:01,580
So the touch ID was a
perfect example of security,

626
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:05,189
helping, your finger was about
to touch that button anyway.

627
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:06,870
And so instead of having to enter a pin

628
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:08,080
like we used to have to

629
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,100
which just authenticate you based

630
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,840
on the button you are
about to touch and same

631
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,850
with the, face ID was
supposed to be was instead

632
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:17,237
of putting in an eight digit pin,

633
00:26:17,238 --> 00:26:20,060
you were going to lift this
up toward your eyes anyway,

634
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:24,139
so that that's the example,
but I wanted to rewind people.

635
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,830
So some of the older
people might remember this

636
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:27,540
remember back in the late 90's,

637
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:30,370
when we had different passwords
for everything, right?

638
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:33,320
And the average person who worked

639
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,100
at a corporation might have to

640
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:39,419
remember like 17 or 22
different passwords.

641
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:41,440
And these things would
expire every 90 days.

642
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,273
And so people would just be,

643
00:26:42,273 --> 00:26:44,360
"Well, I can't remember 19 passwords."

644
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,392
I'm just gonna use the
same password, right?

645
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:50,440
Think of how far we have
come since those days.

646
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,220
Right. I never, I worked
in the whole SSO business

647
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:55,210
for a long time and it's such a pain.

648
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:56,407
It was awful.

649
00:26:56,407 --> 00:26:59,320
But now, because of the standards, like,

650
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,399
OWWA, and Federation SAML

651
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,817
and all that stuff, Andrew was saying,

652
00:27:03,817 --> 00:27:06,430
"Oh, I have to change my
password because we all have,

653
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:08,710
many of us only really have one password."

654
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:09,910
That's like a corporate password.

655
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:11,849
And here we are right on
the verge of talking about

656
00:27:11,849 --> 00:27:14,610
could we get rid of
this last one password?

657
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:18,800
And sometimes I think we
forget how far we have come.

658
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,050
How far we have come, like,

659
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:21,909
when you go sit down
to your computers today

660
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:23,930
you might be faced with, here's my 15 apps

661
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:26,110
and you don't have to log
into each one of them, right.

662
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:28,810
If you have to log in to
a single one separately,

663
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:29,986
you might be like,

664
00:27:29,987 --> 00:27:32,580
"God, that's so old timey
who does that anymore."

665
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,409
Right? At least that's what
you should be thinking.

666
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:36,440
So we've actually come a huge way.

667
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,490
Now we're talking about

668
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:39,170
could we get rid of this last password?

669
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:41,620
Right. And so if you
remember back in those days

670
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,280
people couldn't remember 19 passwords.

671
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,113
They forget them.

672
00:27:44,113 --> 00:27:45,160
They have to call somebody.

673
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,396
And that person would be like,

674
00:27:46,396 --> 00:27:50,200
"Oh, I'm on call for
two weeks, after hours

675
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,550
just so I can reset passwords."

676
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:55,190
And it was the number
one, it was the number one

677
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:57,490
IT tickets for like over a decade.

678
00:27:57,490 --> 00:27:59,030
And now we have gotten to the point

679
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:00,889
where we almost reduced it.

680
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:03,560
And, I would like to celebrate the fact

681
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,840
that we've come so far and we're right

682
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,240
on the verge of being able to say

683
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,908
no more passwords, right?

684
00:28:07,908 --> 00:28:10,469
Okay, okay. I know we can talk
about this snowballed name

685
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:11,940
and I'm going to move to the next one

686
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,070
just so we don't run out of time.

687
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:15,090
- Alrighty.

688
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:15,923
- Alright.

689
00:28:15,923 --> 00:28:17,130
- So I start off with this one

690
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:19,610
since it's very end-user
computing focus here.

691
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:22,169
So trends in endpoint management

692
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:24,480
and endpoint security specifically,

693
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,910
David showed the graph of
different elements that interact

694
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:30,520
with data in a Zero Trust model.

695
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,639
One of them is devices.

696
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:34,140
And I think we haven't
paid as much attention

697
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:36,710
to devices in the Zero Trust model,

698
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:39,030
as David mentioned it's
very network focused,

699
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:39,970
but I think we need ought to

700
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:42,940
be paying more attention
to a modern security

701
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:44,980
and endpoint management
strategy when it comes

702
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:46,270
to those devices overall.

703
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:48,790
And so there's two major trends that

704
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:52,090
I want to highlight here
that are Zero Trust oriented

705
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:54,476
that also have an impact
on the user experience.

706
00:28:54,477 --> 00:28:58,420
And the first one is this
endpoint management strategy.

707
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:00,150
So if you're not familiar with this

708
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:03,650
certainly go reach out
to your EUC, a leader

709
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:05,620
across the aisle over the next week or so,

710
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,260
just to learn a little bit about

711
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:09,570
modern management of endpoints.

712
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:11,570
And so the traditional way of doing this,

713
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:14,189
if you're not familiar is
domain joining the endpoint,

714
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:18,096
pushing out patches, updates,
all of that stuff via the VPN,

715
00:29:18,096 --> 00:29:22,797
and using an on-prem endpoint
management tool in order to

716
00:29:22,797 --> 00:29:25,810
do policy configuration,
all of that stuff.

717
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:28,080
And that is completely changing.

718
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,830
And it's moving very
much towards the cloud,

719
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:34,620
utilizing mobile device
management, APIs, instead

720
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:37,580
of kind of your traditional
group policies to do management.

721
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:41,580
And so this overall shift
actually has a pretty big impact

722
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,725
on the overall user experience.

723
00:29:43,725 --> 00:29:44,840
First of all,

724
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,929
it doesn't require you to domain join

725
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:51,020
and receive all your patches
via a VPN, which is by the way

726
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:53,610
as we already mentioned
already completely full

727
00:29:53,610 --> 00:29:54,939
as a result of the pandemic.

728
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:57,267
And so if you're pushing
out patches that way

729
00:29:57,267 --> 00:30:00,220
it's going to have a
really terrible impact

730
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:01,410
on the user experience.

731
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:03,890
If I can push that out over the air

732
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:05,870
it gives me more flexibility to ensure

733
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:07,459
that I can patch those end points.

734
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:11,000
Remotely, people can work
effectively in a mobile setting.

735
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,160
And then the second area is

736
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:15,380
that it gives me an
opportunity to bring in

737
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:17,300
different types of devices.

738
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:22,220
The APIs from the major
OEM operating systems,

739
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:25,400
are consistently getting
more and more granular

740
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,170
and our ability to go out and just hook

741
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:29,960
into those APIs and manage those devices

742
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,480
over the internet is just getting better.

743
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:34,790
And so we have an opportunity
to provide more autonomy

744
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:36,220
and choice for the user

745
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:38,770
by making the shift
towards modern management.

746
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:40,300
And then the second area that I would call

747
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,830
out here is a major
shift that we're seeing

748
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:46,780
with endpoint security
point products, and a lot

749
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:49,850
of that starting to shift into
the native operating system

750
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:53,820
and leveraging less bolt-on technologies

751
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,639
third party tools, and more

752
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:58,220
of the native operating
system security capabilities

753
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:00,810
and forced through say an MTM

754
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:02,770
or unified endpoint management tool.

755
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:05,370
And so, a lot of that has
to do with performance

756
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:06,559
of the device.

757
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:11,450
I talked with one of our
US, government clients.

758
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:12,743
And they came to me and said,

759
00:31:12,743 --> 00:31:16,740
on average it takes employees
20 to 30 minutes to boot

760
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:18,930
up a workstation every single morning

761
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:22,090
because the amount of security
agents that we have loaded

762
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:23,860
onto the device, right.

763
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:24,725
That's just too much,

764
00:31:24,725 --> 00:31:27,600
that is too much to enable productivity

765
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,850
at the beginning of the day, right.

766
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:31,169
And so the more that we
start to embrace the sort

767
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:33,320
of native security functionality,

768
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,649
the less of an impact those
third-party tools have.

769
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:38,350
And so all of this is in
the name of reducing some

770
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:40,572
of this complexity you see down here,

771
00:31:40,573 --> 00:31:43,400
some of the biggest
information, security challenges

772
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,470
in organizations are complexity
of the IT environment.

773
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:48,540
So if you can expand

774
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:51,550
and modernize your endpoint
management security strategy

775
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:54,780
you're also going to have an
impact on the user experience.

776
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:57,200
So David, anything to add there?

777
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,917
- Yeah. Just, I'm going
to echo what you said.

778
00:31:59,917 --> 00:32:01,030
And I recognize that some

779
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:02,770
of what we just talked
about there was like, well

780
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:05,350
this will definitely make the IT people

781
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:06,830
their jobs easier and better,

782
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:08,820
but especially that move to native,

783
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:11,530
where we're seeing that on
the security side as well.

784
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:13,450
And that's not be recommending that.

785
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:14,670
I'm just saying a lot of our clients

786
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:17,240
that we talk to seem to be opting

787
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:21,460
for the native device security,

788
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,430
which appears to be getting better

789
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:24,950
to the point where they're happy with it.

790
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:26,537
And it enables higher productivity.

791
00:32:26,537 --> 00:32:29,343
And at the end of the day,
that's what it's all about.

792
00:32:30,589 --> 00:32:34,440
Okay, so we have provided
in the very last slide,

793
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,010
I think it's like two from now

794
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:37,860
some links to a lot of the reports

795
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,939
especially the report
that we mentioned here,

796
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:43,210
enhance the employee
experience with Zero Trust.

797
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:45,850
And we recommend that people can,

798
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:47,580
if you are an IT ops,

799
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,750
you might want to reach
out to your security people

800
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:51,570
even more so than you have been already

801
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:55,280
because if they're not,
they may or may not be

802
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:58,490
on board with this concept of
right security done, right.

803
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:00,970
Can actually improve productivity, right.

804
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:02,740
They may look at you like, that's crazy

805
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:05,090
but you just tell them
to watch this video,

806
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:09,090
like these two guys at
Forrester figure this all out

807
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:10,260
and they have the numbers to prove it.

808
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:14,868
So what do you think people
should do this month, Andrew?

809
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:17,050
- So I think some of the
major things you can do

810
00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:20,020
are one, figure out all the
device agents that you have

811
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:22,430
for endpoint management and security.

812
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:24,050
See if there's overlap between them.

813
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:25,703
Do you have duplicates?

814
00:33:25,703 --> 00:33:27,170
What does that look like?

815
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:29,520
What is the impact on
the overall performance?

816
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,617
That can be a quick way

817
00:33:30,617 --> 00:33:34,870
to get some performance
improvements overall,

818
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:36,719
especially if you feel like you're covered

819
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,860
from a security perspective.

820
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:40,790
The other thing that we hear a lot about,

821
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:44,550
especially during the
pandemic is employee listening

822
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:47,972
and really giving a chance
for the employee to,

823
00:33:47,972 --> 00:33:50,590
give feedback around the experience.

824
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:52,409
And so this is something that you could do

825
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:55,463
with employees directly,
or you could do with,

826
00:33:55,463 --> 00:33:57,472
IT ops to really discover,

827
00:33:57,472 --> 00:34:00,070
how are these security policies

828
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:02,100
actually impacting productivity?

829
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,590
How, what sorts of things are you running

830
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:04,620
into on a daily basis?

831
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:08,170
What's super frustrating to
the point where you need to

832
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:10,210
get up and leave your
desk, because you're so mad

833
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:12,159
about not being able to
access something, right?

834
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:14,799
So get that user feedback upfront

835
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,594
and that'll help prioritize some areas

836
00:34:16,594 --> 00:34:18,239
over the next three months.

837
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:19,899
David, you want to take this one?

838
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:20,880
- Sure.

839
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,300
So we're working with a lot of clients

840
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:25,330
who are either doing the
digital transformation, right.

841
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:27,799
Or selling already in the
movement into the cloud.

842
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,070
But they're also looking strategically

843
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:32,219
and how, because remember what Andrew said

844
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:34,819
about remote work increasing by 300%,

845
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:36,590
there's you cannot treat remote workers

846
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:38,150
as second class citizens anymore

847
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:40,449
whatever you do for them,
you actually have to do,

848
00:34:40,449 --> 00:34:42,839
whatever you do for the non-work at home,

849
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:45,320
new on-prem people you have
to do for everybody, right?

850
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:48,840
So treat, I guess the theme
of that is treat everyone

851
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,204
the same and give them the best security

852
00:34:50,204 --> 00:34:53,489
and employee experience that we can

853
00:34:53,489 --> 00:34:55,879
in order to keep up
their, their productivity.

854
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,890
All right. So I hope you can read this,

855
00:34:57,890 --> 00:35:01,430

you'll see is the links,

858
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:09,622

that we referenced.

859
00:35:09,622 --> 00:35:12,470
And I just wanted to
thank everybody for coming

860
