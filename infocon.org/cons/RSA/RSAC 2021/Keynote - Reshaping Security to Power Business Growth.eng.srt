(music)

2
00:00:11,468 --> 00:00:14,051
(music)

3
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,700
- Hello and welcome everybody.

4
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,590
I'm Mary O'Brien, general
manager for IBM Security

5
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:23,470
and I'm delighted to have
the opportunity to speak here

6
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:25,532
at cybersecurity's premier event.

7
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:28,670
It's amazing how much our lives

8
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:30,980
and so many aspects of
our lives have changed

9
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:32,900
in the last 18 months.

10
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:36,750
As an industry, cybersecurity
has also seen its fair share

11
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:37,833
of that change too.

12
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,410
And cybersecurity has proven its mettle

13
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:44,419
and value to business
beyond simply identifying

14
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:45,633
and addressing threats.

15
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,460
We've witnessed how
cybersecurity is essential

16
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:53,510
to help businesses maintain
continuity and build resilience

17
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:56,653
against unprecedented
circumstances and challenges.

18
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,700
And as we move forward in 2021 and beyond,

19
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:04,150
I wanted to share two observations
that offer a blueprint

20
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:06,930
for how we secure our
businesses for the future

21
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:09,593
and how we grow as a
cybersecurity industry.

22
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:13,163
Firstly, I want to talk about trust.

23
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:18,419
Trust is so essential to how
we connect with our partners,

24
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,950
customers, and employees.

25
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:23,590
It really is the most basic,

26
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:26,330
the most fundamental form of currency

27
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:28,803
that we trade with those around us.

28
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:32,800
The second thought I want to
address is about community,

29
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,360
and more specifically
about the powerful force

30
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,790
that occurs when individuals come together

31
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:38,740
for a common cause.

32
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:43,670
As organizations, when we
lean into the principles

33
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:47,163
of trust and community, we
can do remarkable things.

34
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:50,730
In a few minutes, I'll be
joined by Mauricio Guerra,

35
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:53,840
the Chief Information Security
Officer for Dow Chemical

36
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,560
to share how he is using an
approach called zero trust

37
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,260
to do just that.

38
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,550
But before we get there,

39
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:03,073
I want to briefly discuss zero trust.

40
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:07,260
Okay, as an attendee of
a security conference,

41
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:10,000
I've no doubt that you've
heard of the term zero trust.

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,623
It's a term we use quite
a bit in this industry.

43
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:16,870
Zero trust offers a better way

44
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,110
to address the complexity in security

45
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:21,343
that's challenging our businesses today.

46
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:26,170
Traditionally, security
focused on building a perimeter

47
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:28,380
of protection around valuable assets,

48
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:31,329
and that worked well for
decades while the majority

49
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:34,223
of our valued as assets
were inside a firewall.

50
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:38,450
But that's not the way
we do business anymore.

51
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:41,869
Today it's not even common
to have all of your users,

52
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,630
your data, and your applications

53
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,820
operating in different environments,

54
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:48,489
and they all need to
connect to one another

55
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:51,293
quickly, seamlessly, and securely.

56
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:57,350
At its core, zero trust is
a multi-dimensional approach

57
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:00,130
to addressing risk and protecting data

58
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:02,453
where nothing is inherently trusted.

59
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:07,660
Now, there are numerous
frameworks from industry experts

60
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,940
that tell you what
security elements you need

61
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,050
to implement zero trust

62
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:13,500
and where to invest your
resources to achieve it.

63
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,840
But how do you put these
frameworks into action

64
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,993
that deliver results for your business?

65
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,230
To help me answer this question,

66
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:25,690
Mauricio from Dow Chemical will join me

67
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:27,113
to share his approach.

68
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,190
Dow is one of the largest
material science producers

69
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:33,900
in the world and operates from 109 sites

70
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,893
across 31 countries with
more than 36,000 employees.

71
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:42,019
Welcome Mauricio, thank
you for joining us.

72
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:42,980
Can you talk to us

73
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,619
about what this means
for your role as CISO?

74
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:48,520
What are some of your
key responsibilities?

75
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,384
- Thank you Mary, great to be here.

76
00:03:51,384 --> 00:03:55,109
The CISO role at Dow has
three main responsibilities.

77
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:57,080
The first one is in
the area of compliance,

78
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,640
compliance with IT control.

79
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,630
So we need to ensure that
the company as a whole

80
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:03,820
is in compliance with
key framework regulations

81
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,590
like Sarbanes-Oxley,

82
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:09,090
and most recently a very
critical one nowadays

83
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:12,160
is the data privacy being GDPR,

84
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:16,029
the critical regulation that
we need to be in compliance.

85
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:19,429
The second one is managing
cybersecurity risk

86
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:23,370
from identification of
the threats to mitigation.

87
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,780
And the third one is to ensure

88
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:29,799
that Dow's digital
capabilities are delivered

89
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,800
in a secure way that is
consistent with our company,

90
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,650
with our company's risk profile.

91
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:40,429
So those are our three
main responsibilities.

92
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,310
Challenging ones,

93
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:44,920
but that that's what they
CISO role encompasses.

94
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,350
- For sure, just tackling one
of these responsibilities,

95
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:50,500
Mauricio, is a significant undertaking

96
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,830
in today's environment.

97
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,969
Managing all three simultaneously

98
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:56,740
has got to be quite the challenge.

99
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:59,150
And I started off the
session by discussing

100
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:02,010
how businesses can establish
trust with their users.

101
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:05,340
And I briefly mentioned using
zero trust as an approach

102
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,060
to achieving this goal.

103
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:10,080
Now I know that you're a
big proponent of zero trust.

104
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,969
So I'd like to ask you to share

105
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,600
what zero trust means to you

106
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,770
and why you felt the time was right

107
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:17,780
to implement this approach at Dow.

108
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:20,750
- Mary, zero trust for us is a concept.

109
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,750
It's an architecture, it's a framework.

110
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:27,750
So we look more at what
can we get from zero trust.

111
00:05:27,939 --> 00:05:30,510
And what zero trust is helping us

112
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:32,780
managing the new environment,

113
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:36,400
the new ecosystem that
we have to support now.

114
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,219
So, and I'm referring to the new reality

115
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:43,930
of in a digital age
when we have more users,

116
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:47,240
more mobile users, we
have cloud applications.

117
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:52,240
We have IOT devices when
our data lives everywhere,

118
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,760
when internet is our new network.

119
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:59,450
So we had to transform
our cyber security program

120
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:01,530
and practices, and the answer we found

121
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:06,457
was the adoption of a
zero trust architecture.

122
00:06:08,513 --> 00:06:12,099
- Wow, and Mauricio, just tell us,

123
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,830
what does good zero
trust look like to you?

124
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,370
To take this a step further,

125
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:19,270
can you talk a little bit
about how you got started?

126
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:21,323
And also it will be really good

127
00:06:21,323 --> 00:06:26,323
if you could pinpoint why you
chose that starting point.

128
00:06:26,635 --> 00:06:31,462
- So we start by understanding
Dow's digital transformation,

129
00:06:31,463 --> 00:06:33,279
understanding the business outcomes,

130
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:35,783
therefore the priorities.

131
00:06:35,783 --> 00:06:38,110
Then it is specifically on zero trust

132
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:40,310
because there are many, many ways to go.

133
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:43,800
There is not a one size fits
all approach for zero trust.

134
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,260
So we decided to start

135
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:48,000
with the zero trust network architecture

136
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,260
because that's what we
needed in enabling our users

137
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,240
to have full access to internet.

138
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,240
So all forms of internet,
cloud, services, email,

139
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,480
and so forth.

140
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:06,060
So one of the first deliverables
of our zero trust model

141
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:11,060
is what we call secure access to internet.

142
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,250
So that's a key one.

143
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:17,490
Second where we have
delivered a secure access

144
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:20,040
to our different locations,

145
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:24,070
replacing data tools that we have before.

146
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:28,060
We are replacing our
telecommunications network

147
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:30,510
and zero trust is helping
us to deliver an SD-LAN

148
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:33,920
and SD-WAN solution.

149
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,310
And the last couple of examples,

150
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:39,160
being a manufacturing company,

151
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,370
IOT support is a big priority for us.

152
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:46,660
So we are designing and
implementing secure models

153
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,910
to manage all the new devices,

154
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:51,280
sensors that we are implementing

155
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,119
in the manufacturing space.

156
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,490
And then finally, the whole
area of conditional access

157
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:58,690
and authentication.

158
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:03,690
So all I know is zero trust
is giving us the flexibility

159
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:07,250
to support all the business needs,

160
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,673
but in a secure way.

161
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:13,900
- Gosh, Mauricio, I'm sure that
everything hasn't been easy.

162
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,400
I mean, that's a lot.

163
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,620
Can you talk a little bit
about any of the roadblocks

164
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,600
or the challenges that you've encountered

165
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,380
and what you did to overcome them?

166
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:26,600
- That's a very interesting one, Mary,

167
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:31,600
because, well first of all,
as we lead the security space,

168
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:35,970
the leaders, we decided to
embrace the zero trust concept.

169
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:39,900
Said, okay, that's the answer
for what we need to do.

170
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,039
But then we need to be in,

171
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:45,209
how can I say this, in selling
mode, we need to convince,

172
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:48,360
we need to engage our IT workforce

173
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,950
that that was the way to go,

174
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:52,260
because this is completely different

175
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,860
from what we used to do
before with firewalls

176
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:58,560
and in a firewall,
either you're on or off.

177
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,839
Now it's different.

178
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:04,080
So we need to engage our IT workforce

179
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,770
and then train the workforce
to do something different.

180
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:11,800
That's one good challenge.

181
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,140
The other one is still,

182
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:16,319
even though the concept is not too new,

183
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,603
but it had been in the
last couple of years

184
00:09:18,603 --> 00:09:21,300
that zero trust is
gaining a lot of momentum

185
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,530
in the industry.

186
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:25,880
So still maturing, it's a complex journey

187
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:30,070
to integrate different layers,
different technologies.

188
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,243
So for that it's absolutely critical

189
00:09:32,243 --> 00:09:35,720
that you pick the right
partners to be with you

190
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,430
in this journey.

191
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:40,489
So I may say retraining your workforce

192
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:44,442
and selecting the right
partners are two good challenges

193
00:09:44,442 --> 00:09:47,740
in this job, have been good
challenges in this job.

194
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:50,260
- I wonder if you could offer some advice

195
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:53,270
to some of the other security
leaders in the audience,

196
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:56,490
the ones who are considering
or actively implementing

197
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:59,227
zero trust in particular.

198
00:09:59,227 --> 00:10:02,220
- The main one I would
offer is making sure

199
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:05,380
that the security is a
partner to your business,

200
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:09,270
that you work very, very
integrated with other IT teams,

201
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:11,656
but also with business partners,

202
00:10:11,657 --> 00:10:14,560
and in particular around the zero trust,

203
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,979
have a good roadmap.

204
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:18,030
I mean, don't start doing this or that

205
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:21,589
and then try to ensure that
the whole thing fits together.

206
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:24,433
Start with a roadmap,
probably I'll suggest

207
00:10:24,433 --> 00:10:25,730
a three years view,

208
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:28,280
what do we want to do
in the next three years?

209
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:31,510
Understanding that every
six months probably,

210
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:34,750
you will need to fine tune the roadmap.

211
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:38,470
It might change business
priorities, business realities,

212
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:41,500
technology also change,
but it is fundamental

213
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,700
to have a good roadmap.

214
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:48,114
Ensure that you know where you're going,

215
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:50,800
your of course are
aligned to that direction

216
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,430
and that you can measure if
you're making progress or not.

217
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:56,662
That that for me is critical.

218
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,786
- That's fantastic, Mauricio.

219
00:10:59,786 --> 00:11:03,069
So plan what you want to achieve

220
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:06,090
and have a detailed roadmap
maybe over three years

221
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:08,490
and be prepared to go back and revisit it

222
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:10,380
to make sure you meet your objectives.

223
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,840
That's fantastic.
- Absolutely.

224
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,750
- Yeah yeah yeah.

225
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,010
So your perspectives have been amazing

226
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:18,780
and they offer a glimpse
to what we can achieve

227
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:21,920
when we put zero trust
into action, Mauricio.

228
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,110
So I want to thank you so much.

229
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:25,307
- Thank you, Mary.

230
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:31,300
- It's clear that a zero trust
approach done successfully

231
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,979
will reduce the barriers to innovation

232
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:36,580
by incorporating security and privacy

233
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:38,993
into the design and
development of new services.

234
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:43,940
It will facilitate migrating
to a modern infrastructure

235
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:47,110
that provides customers and your workforce

236
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:49,480
with secure, frictionless access

237
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,893
to the services they need.

238
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,910
And it will enable of prioritization

239
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:56,280
of continuity and resiliency

240
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,910
by facilitating context-based monitoring

241
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:01,520
of both internal and external threats

242
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,160
that would jeopardize the availability

243
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,653
of critical assets and operations.

244
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:09,700
Now, earlier I mentioned
the need to change

245
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:13,023
the way we think about and
the way we implement security.

246
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:18,250
Zero trust is a step
in the right direction.

247
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,920
But to get there, to make zero trust

248
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,589
more than a point of view,

249
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:24,820
we need to be able to work together.

250
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:28,030
The APIs and the standards that are needed

251
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,900
for products to work together seamlessly

252
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:33,329
either just haven't existed
or didn't work well.

253
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:35,893
There are of course
competitive concerns always.

254
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:38,760
But when I stopped to think about

255
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,819
all of the modern processes
and collaboration tools

256
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,450
that we at IBM, and many of you as well,

257
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:47,690
have put into place to make
running your businesses smooth,

258
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:49,930
it seems only natural that security

259
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:53,343
should take this collaborative
step forward too.

260
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:58,070
I spoke of the importance
of trust earlier.

261
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:01,140
Moving towards a more
open model of security

262
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:03,723
is a critical piece of establishing trust.

263
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:08,610
With open security, you're
no longer putting your trust

264
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:10,020
in a single vendor

265
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:14,069
or even your own in-house
development team.

266
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:17,110
Instead you have an entire
community of experts,

267
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:18,850
of users and other vendors

268
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:20,900
that can support your security efforts.

269
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:24,620
All looking at the same problems,
all sharing methodologies,

270
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:27,340
all reviewing the same code
and making improvements,

271
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:31,260
and all looking at the same
threats and sharing knowledge.

272
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:35,040
The result is a better
security for everyone.

273
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,760
Clients and customers get a
more comprehensive resolution

274
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,120
to security problems.

275
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,570
They get better, more reliable products.

276
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:45,010
And as vendors we can learn faster,

277
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:48,060
we can innovate more, and
pass along those benefits

278
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,053
to our customers.

279
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,800
We're all connected now

280
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,099
in ways we could never
have imagined a year ago.

281
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,610
We come to these events
as leaders looking to grow

282
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:01,660
and secure our business,
to protect our assets,

283
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,910
and to strengthen our teams.

284
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:07,329
But we're also part of a
value chain of suppliers,

285
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:08,843
and we're all consumers too.

286
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:12,040
This is why we must get comfortable

287
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,813
with being uncomfortable.

288
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:17,619
Building trust and embracing
community practices

289
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,240
shouldn't be afterthoughts.

290
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,540
They must be the guiding principles

291
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,772
for the way we secure our businesses.

292
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,420
Our business goals and
the operations we define

293
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:31,740
to achieve them are
unique and individualized.

294
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,050
This is one of the reasons why zero trust

295
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:36,713
has been such a challenge
to implement for so many.

296
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,250
But if we reset, if we just reimagine

297
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,500
the way we implement security,

298
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:49,510
if we focus on open practices
and collaborative methods,

299
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:52,360
we'll be able to generate
the valuable context

300
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,223
that makes zero trust
actionable and effective.

301
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:58,720
We will connect openly,

302
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,400
we'll manage cybersecurity proactively,

303
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,110
we'll empower business to grow fearlessly

304
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,773
and with total confidence.

305
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:08,103
Thank you.
