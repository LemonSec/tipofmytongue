1
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:03,340
- Hi, I am Nelson.

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:06,230
And I am really happy to be here today.

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:11,230
It's our pleasure to present
today our research paper

4
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:16,630
regarding A Case Study of
Capital One Data Breach.

5
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:20,509
With me I have my partner Anchises Moraes

6
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:24,820
that work together to write
this paper and this research.

7
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:27,030
During all the presentation feel free

8
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:28,850
to ask any question,

9
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:31,550
that would be my pleasure, our pleasure

10
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:34,740
to answer that for you.

11
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:38,190
So to compose this study.

12
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:41,763
We have four main steps for that.

13
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,720
The first one is the research goal.

14
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:50,197
And the research goal is,
are compliance controls

15
00:00:50,197 --> 00:00:52,860
and Cybersecurity legislation

16
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:57,743
sufficient to prevent Capital
One's Data Breach Incident?

17
00:00:59,108 --> 00:01:02,140
This is one important
question of the main question

18
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:03,600
of this study.

19
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,960
The second point is the
methodological considerations.

20
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:11,990
Here we define, and we got all information

21
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:16,720
regarding technical and
trustworthy information regarding

22
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,270
the detail of the incident

23
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,680
and which regulation were applied

24
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,500
in that specific moment of the incident.

25
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,590
The third point here we
have a detailed analysis

26
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:32,930
regarding the Capital One incident.

27
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:36,590
How is the modus operandi of the attack?

28
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:41,440
And what conditions allow the
breach and related mitigatory

29
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:45,020
controls that could avoid this incident.

30
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:48,600
And in the end, the fourth
step we have the discussion,

31
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,300
recommendation and conclusion.

32
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,483
So the research goals,

33
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:57,870
here we have the Capital
One case that Capital One

34
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:00,960
is one of the biggest
banks around the world.

35
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,250
It won't be specific, any
curious point regarding

36
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:08,289
this incident is that we have online

37
00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:13,030
extensive technical reports
that are public and available.

38
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:17,790
It is really difficult to find
a lot of technical reports

39
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:20,730
regarding Cybersecurity incidents.

40
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:25,010
And in this case Capital
One suffered a data breach

41
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:28,970
that impact more than
100 million customers,

42
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:33,633
and the shares fell around
6% after the breach.

43
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,610
And Capital One has a curious history

44
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:41,799
in that it was the first bank in the world

45
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,490
to migrate their own premise data centers

46
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:47,450
to a cloud computer environment.

47
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:51,220
So the main research goals and questions

48
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:55,289
of this study are, first of all,

49
00:02:55,289 --> 00:02:58,239
understand the Capital
One Data Breach Incident.

50
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,500
With this analysis we can understand

51
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:06,500
a lot of information and
the techniques regarding

52
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:10,580
what happened and the
details of the Breach

53
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:13,303
and what happened in
this specific incident.

54
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:17,100
And the most important question here

55
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:20,549
were compliance controls,
any Cybersecurity legislation

56
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:24,970
sufficient to prevent the
Capital One Data Breach.

57
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:27,460
So to do this,

58
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,960
we have some methodological considerations

59
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,390
that are important to drive us

60
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:35,619
to have a complete vision of what happened

61
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:40,260
and this suggestion to help this scenario.

62
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,880
So here we have the great scenarios

63
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,290
that data leaks cases
in large institutions

64
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:51,060
did you not resort to minimize
the occurrence of leaks?

65
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:54,140
As we can see in this new research paper,

66
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:58,070
the number of the data
records breach increased from

67
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:01,769
4.1 billion of required in 2018

68
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:06,400
to 322 billion required in 2019.

69
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,480
It's a expressive data leaks number

70
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,703
that they are coming every year.

71
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:16,230
And that we don't see
any results to minimize

72
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:18,100
this kind of offer course.

73
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,950
So they initially
hypothesis of this study was

74
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:26,310
first of all, global
regulations and the laws

75
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:30,290
on Cybersecurity do not
provide a proper guidance

76
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:34,450
not protection, to avoid
new data leaks incidents,

77
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:39,450
or the institution in this
case, Capital One were deficient

78
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:44,503
in managing the controls,
required by existing regulations.

79
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:50,280
So one more important two
criteria for this study

80
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,219
and then the methodology point,

81
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:58,220
we needed to understand the
modus operandi of the attack

82
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:02,560
and what kind of a regulation was applied

83
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,340
to Capital One in that specific moment.

84
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,409
To cover that,

85
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:10,003
we took the decision to
use the MITRE ATT&CK.

86
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:15,420
just to understand this is a framework

87
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:20,030
that they help you to map
that tactics, techniques

88
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:23,460
any proceeded, offer a
Cybersecurity attack,

89
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:27,469
and to understand what is control failure.

90
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:32,470
We have here, the NIST
Cybersecurity Framework.

91
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:36,380
This framework is applied
as a mandatory Cybersecurity

92
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,570
bank regulation in US.

93
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:42,180
That's why we are using
NIST that is covering

94
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:46,850
a lot of ways to protect your systems,

95
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:48,510
any information.

96
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:52,280
So we have the waste in
the domains to identify

97
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:56,229
to protect, to detect,
to respond and to recover

98
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,300
I specifically incident.

99
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,810
So now let's cover a little bit

100
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:03,180
about the Capital One Incident.

101
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,310
- Hi everyone.

102
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,150
I am Anchises.

103
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:07,770
I work with Nelson Novaes in the paper.

104
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:10,253
So we would discuss a little bit about the

105
00:06:10,253 --> 00:06:11,750
Capital One Incident

106
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:15,420
about the bridge incident
that took place in 2019.

107
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,830
So first of all,

108
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:20,962
by March, 2019,

109
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:27,710
the attacker Ms. Paige Thompson,
a former Amazon employee

110
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,680
she had the initial access

111
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,330
to the kept going infrastructure
hosted at AWS servers.

112
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:39,210
And then on April, about
a month later on April 21

113
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:43,630
she had access to more
than 700 S3 buckets.

114
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:46,230
We've kept the one customer data. Okay?

115
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:49,173
And then she start, installing the data.

116
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,490
However, just about three
months later on July

117
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:58,320
Capitol One realized that
these things took place

118
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,550
because actually it was not detected

119
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:04,760
by their own regular
Cybersecurity operations.

120
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:08,590
They received a report through an outsider

121
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:12,289
via their vulnerability report program

122
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:14,960
that's something weird was happening.

123
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,690
And then they're starting
the investigation.

124
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:19,750
And on July 19, they kept on going public

125
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,090
about the incident,

126
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:25,229
which means that took about four months

127
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:29,580
between the initial attacker
access to the network

128
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:32,419
to Capital One and then find
the attack and releasing

129
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:36,493
our report about going public
about the incident.Okay.

130
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,950
It's way too much time.

131
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:43,530
And just summarizing how
the attack took place.

132
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:46,119
We have a plenty of
literature on the internet,

133
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:51,120
we have a FB report of
detailing how the attack works.

134
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:53,570
So initially Ms. Paige Thompson,

135
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:57,640
she was using Dart Network

136
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,460
and both IP per liter VPN

137
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:03,010
to hide her access to the
network infrastructure,

138
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:05,283
and then hide their original IP address.

139
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,420
She had Butte previously and his crypt

140
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:14,420
to scan AWS servers and
looking for a specific web

141
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,470
application firewall vulnerability.

142
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:18,980
And then by running
this a script, actually

143
00:08:19,947 --> 00:08:22,900
she attacked almost 30 companies,

144
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:26,929
according to the department,
US department of justice,

145
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:30,060
and one of the companies
where was kept the window,

146
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,220
unfortunately,

147
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,799
and then by writing this script,

148
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,159
she was able to figure
out that Capital One

149
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:37,809
had a misconfigured web
application firewall.

150
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:42,582
And then she ran a server-side
request, further attack.

151
00:08:43,427 --> 00:08:48,427
In order to relay specific comments

152
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:52,283
to internal servers, hosted
at Amazon infrastructure.

153
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,210
By doing so,

154
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:58,680
she was able to access a server

155
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:03,089
and get access to internal credentials.

156
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:07,233
And by then having access
to internal servers at all.

157
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:10,730
After she gained access to the servers

158
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:14,650
she was able to run command line comments

159
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:16,459
in the capital infrastructure

160
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:20,010
including a comment to
list, the entire list

161
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:22,200
of buckets that kept the one hat,

162
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:27,010
and later a comment just sync
to actually to copy the data

163
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:29,350
from the buckets to her computer.

164
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:32,110
And by doing so instlling kept on

165
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:35,020
internal and perpetuity data,

166
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:40,020
which includes nearly 30
gigabytes of Capital One data.

167
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:44,060
So in a nutshell, this
is how the attack work.

168
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:48,300
There's in our paper, we have
a more detailed description

169
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,060
of each steps of the attack. Okay?

170
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,489
So as we explained before,

171
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:54,490
in our paper,

172
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:56,660
we took each step of the attack

173
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:00,589
and map it to a MITRE ATT&CK Framework.

174
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:04,530
And then based on that mapping,

175
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:09,140
we went to NIST Framework
and we'd look for each one

176
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:13,620
of the specific controls that would apply

177
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:17,520
to that specific particular attack step.

178
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,569
By doing so we're able to, again,

179
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:25,570
to map a plenary of
these controls that would

180
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:29,000
help preventing each step off the attack.

181
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,070
I will not go in details for each one,

182
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:36,010
but we can see that
there's a lot of controls

183
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,680
that could help preventing the attack

184
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,189
in determinant point of time.

185
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:45,030
Actually, we figure out
that they are 61 potential

186
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:49,199
NIST controls that would help preventing

187
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,480
the attack to happen.

188
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,833
Okay. It's any stage of the attack?

189
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:57,660
Obviously not some of
the controls are similar

190
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:01,420
because they applied to different
steps of the attack. Okay?

191
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:04,430
But if you're thinking from
the technical perspective

192
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:07,969
even as the fact that the
control is a similar one

193
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:11,070
for the news perspective,
the technical control

194
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,610
the technical measure
usually is different.

195
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:17,750
So you apply the same concepts

196
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:21,603
to different technical measure. Okay?

197
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:26,560
If we see the most frequent,
the most usual controls

198
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,420
that we map it, most of them were related

199
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:34,329
to lack of proper vulnerable management.

200
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:39,330
Some of them were related to
not implementing some sort

201
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:43,640
of list privilege principle
that help adapt back again

202
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:47,850
access even more than that, we wanted to

203
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:51,250
we have lack of security
with wondering as well.

204
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,370
This is the reason why

205
00:11:53,252 --> 00:11:57,339
the Decker goes in notice
to most four months.

206
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:00,523
Okay. And L sequel
principles are all a fail.

207
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:03,670
Just an example.

208
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,810
If we pick just one stage of the attack

209
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:09,060
when Paige Thompson
exploited, the web application

210
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,010
firewall vulnerability to gain access

211
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:13,810
to the Capital One infrastructure.

212
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:17,141
We had seven controls
that might be in place

213
00:12:17,141 --> 00:12:21,270
that would have preventing
the attack to happen.

214
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:24,510
For example, the lack of
vulnerability management

215
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:28,310
blend properly develop
it to help me to gauge

216
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:31,609
in SSRF attack.

217
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:35,130
Lack of Audit/log records

218
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:39,260
that would help Capital One monitoring

219
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,439
what's happened with infrastructure

220
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,010
and the attacked in the attack, or like

221
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:47,489
the principle of least
functionality was not

222
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:52,670
implemented in the web application,
firewall configuration.

223
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:55,382
For instance, it seems that some data

224
00:12:55,383 --> 00:12:58,610
when it's not collected and monitored

225
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:00,630
to help Capital One detect the incident,

226
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:03,000
why what's happening. Okay?

227
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,490
Even the lack of monitoring
for unauthorized access

228
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:09,450
to the infrastructure.

229
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:14,161
And from the provinces perspective,

230
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:18,160
we understand that there was
a lack of the really scans

231
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:23,079
happening on a proper frequency

232
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:27,740
that would help Capital One
detect the misconfiguration

233
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,990
into amplification,
fire prior the incident.

234
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:32,793
And last but not least,

235
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:38,400
we understand that there's
a field they control

236
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,819
related to the detection activities

237
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:45,833
should comply with the
security needs. Okay?

238
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:48,300
So this is just when the sample

239
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,782
in one particular stage of the attack.

240
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:55,930
And we understand that based
on the Office of Comptroller

241
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:57,319
of the Currency report,

242
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:01,430
that is the US authority

243
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:06,430
that build a report regarding the attack

244
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:11,408
and help the authorities to understand

245
00:14:11,408 --> 00:14:16,408
the incident and end up
finding the Capital One.

246
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,699
Their final report

247
00:14:19,914 --> 00:14:23,300
it's very similar to
our finds in our search.

248
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:27,979
So they understood that
Capital One had issues

249
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:30,483
with their risk assessment process.

250
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:35,207
They have issues if the
risk management process

251
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:39,800
are all their internal
audit scene failed to detect

252
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:43,339
the vulnerabilities prior, the incident,

253
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:47,250
and did not effectively
report the vulnerabilities

254
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,830
to the technical team
in order to fix them.

255
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:51,313
And last but not least,

256
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:57,310
the LCC understood that the
management team was accountable

257
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:02,820
because of this lack of
proper risk assessment

258
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:05,593
vulnerability management, and reporting.

259
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:09,232
And all of these
contribute to the weakness

260
00:15:09,232 --> 00:15:12,223
need to Capital One environment
that led to this breach.

261
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:19,319
So we understood that
Capital One really failed

262
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,810
in having appropriate
risk management process.

263
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:26,000
So we had plenty of as usual,

264
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,010
we have a plenty of these
controls that have prevented

265
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:31,370
the attack to happen.

266
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:33,360
But even though the attack happened

267
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,660
which means that Capital
One who really failed

268
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:40,137
to implement the proper
mitigatory controls(mumbles).

269
00:15:44,059 --> 00:15:48,257
From our study, we had
some key points to discuss

270
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,719
that we'd like to share with you.

271
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,796
So, first of all, we understand

272
00:15:54,796 --> 00:15:58,400
that whenever you have a regulation

273
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,886
companies have the flexibility to decide

274
00:16:01,886 --> 00:16:06,050
which control is required or
not based on the environment

275
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:09,199
on their risk posture

276
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,830
or the risk scenario.

277
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:13,718
So we have such flexibility

278
00:16:13,718 --> 00:16:15,390
something that really takes part

279
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:18,689
of all the regulatory bodies.

280
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:21,730
So it's not something
just written on stone.

281
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:26,090
So we have the companies
have the possibility to adapt

282
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:28,650
the controls to their reality.

283
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:30,699
This is a good point.

284
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:35,170
Okay. So it helps company to adapt their

285
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:37,920
regulatory requirements
to the environment,

286
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,199
but it also

287
00:16:42,987 --> 00:16:43,903
has a issue.

288
00:16:45,048 --> 00:16:49,503
We have the risk of having
specific regulatory controls

289
00:16:49,503 --> 00:16:52,420
that the company just
decide should not apply

290
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:55,223
and even though they were important so,

291
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:00,060
companies have to take
too much care on really

292
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:03,959
deciding which controls apply
or not to their environments.

293
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,260
So for example,

294
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:09,369
focusing on best security, best practices

295
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:14,199
focusing on access control,
and least privilege, et cetera.

296
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,960
So we have a lot of controls that are

297
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,363
like security principles
that we have to follow.

298
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,980
The second point that we'd like to discuss

299
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:28,980
is that the companies have
a consistent compliance

300
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,550
and risk management across different parts

301
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:36,399
of the organization and across
different infrastructures,

302
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,420
the different technical
infrastructure that they have.

303
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:43,560
So we usually, we work with
three lines of the defense.

304
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,540
So the people mark close
to the infrastructure

305
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:50,800
from the managers,

306
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,090
and we need to have this three lines

307
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:55,659
of defense talking with each other okay.

308
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,870
And having them very well aligned

309
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:00,899
about what are their risk posture,

310
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,800
but more important than that

311
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:07,370
we have to really understand and adapt

312
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:10,919
our regulatory controls,

313
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:14,213
should different technical environments.

314
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,696
In this particular case,
we have to really...

315
00:18:20,696 --> 00:18:24,889
And people are usually very
well used to work with security

316
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:27,660
on premise in traditional
on-premise environments.

317
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:29,650
But whenever you move
to cloud environments

318
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,700
sometimes people are not so well adapted.

319
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:35,590
So we have to, as much as possible,

320
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:39,360
have the same security principles
that we use on our brain

321
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,679
on premise environments also covered

322
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,870
in our cloud environments.

323
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:46,310
So we have to understand the difference

324
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:50,649
between the different
technological frameworks,

325
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:52,440
the different technological
infrastructures

326
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,890
and adapt our security posture

327
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:57,123
our security needs to them.

328
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,563
And last but not least,

329
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:05,730
during our search we
realized that there's a issue

330
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:09,710
with the Capital One Cybersecurity team.

331
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:13,240
Human error might be
take part of this cause,

332
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,120
Why?

333
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:17,280
Because we realize that

334
00:19:18,555 --> 00:19:20,340
the Capital One in the beginning,

335
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:23,899
they built a very solid
Cybersecurity team,

336
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:28,900
very well of technically capable

337
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,240
on running on cloud environments.

338
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,310
But all of a sudden they
changes their leadership

339
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:39,740
and the new person that
took the leadership

340
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:43,140
had issues with the
current Cybersecurity team

341
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,410
different cultures.

342
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:49,410
And then as a result, it
emerged a toxic culture

343
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,900
in the Cybersecurity
thing, enough Capital One.

344
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,910
And, they face it high
turnover, which means

345
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:58,370
in just one year, 2018,

346
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:01,639
they lost 130 of their employees.

347
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:04,270
It's a lot of people,
you know, can you imagine

348
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:07,604
all of a sudden in one year period,

349
00:20:07,604 --> 00:20:11,150
you're losing one third
of your Cybersecurity team

350
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:13,810
which means you have to
hire different people.

351
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:15,877
You have to train them,

352
00:20:15,877 --> 00:20:19,490
you have to have them
adapt at your environment.

353
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:24,270
So we understood that this high turnover

354
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:29,240
might have had a huge impact
on the cyber security team

355
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,890
and the Cybersecurity posture

356
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:31,840
of the Capital One.

357
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:37,220
And now I know, so you'll go back here

358
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:40,080
and we will discuss some
of the recommendations

359
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,880
to share with you.

360
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,040
Thank you very much.

361
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,409
- So after a big failure,

362
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:50,110
the most thing is the learning process.

363
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:52,010
And the insight of our research,

364
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:54,990
we give you a lot of recommendation

365
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:56,990
that you can apply in your company,

366
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:59,120
in your business, in your life.

367
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,392
So let's see some recommendation off that.

368
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:07,170
So here we have something
that is really fast

369
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:09,300
that you can apply next week.

370
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,770
So you should.

371
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:15,040
If you're the most recently
compliance audit reports,

372
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,980
check with your team,
check what do you have

373
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:20,240
that can impact your company?

374
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,700
So look for potential
weakness that you have.

375
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:27,400
Address and fix critical vulnerability

376
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,560
any focus on Cybersecurity, best practice.

377
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:35,560
Let's see what is the best
rep that you are falling.

378
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:38,860
Even if the regulator, doesn't mandate it.

379
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:42,250
It's important to check on the market.

380
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:45,610
We have a lot of the best
spreads that you can follow

381
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:46,443
to help you.

382
00:21:46,443 --> 00:21:48,860
And we are going to cover some of that.

383
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:50,740
Double check your security controls

384
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:52,983
for cloud computer infrastructure.

385
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:56,459
So a little bit more complex.

386
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,370
And for the next month

387
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:00,804
you should focus on review your

388
00:22:00,805 --> 00:22:03,560
vulnerability management process.

389
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,000
And then with that,

390
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,810
you also review your
audit process to avoid

391
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:12,169
improper adoption of compliance control.

392
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:15,430
Let's see review for the
vulnerability management process

393
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:18,860
correlated with the
audit can work together

394
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:22,260
to improve the maturity
of Cybersecurity control

395
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,800
that you apply in your company.

396
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,960
So maybe to comply with
your global policies

397
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:31,770
for data protection and
Cybersecurity, for example

398
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:35,840
the NIST Cybersecurity Framework

399
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:40,435
ISO standards, GDPR, PCI, DSS,

400
00:22:40,435 --> 00:22:42,510
and a lot of your other device.

401
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:45,110
So apply the best secure

402
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:48,330
the best Cybersecurity, best-practice.

403
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:52,669
So you don't need to just
apply what is the regulator

404
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:54,510
is mandate to you?

405
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:57,610
We can see around the road
that we have a different level

406
00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:02,379
of Cybersecurity maturity
in some kind of markets.

407
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:06,230
So find it that the one
that is most complete

408
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:08,030
to protect your company.

409
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:10,270
So keep the controls prevalent,

410
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:12,210
as the technology evolves.

411
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:14,450
Everyday we have the new technology,

412
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:16,760
the everyday where we have a new practice

413
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:19,480
in everyday we have a new vulnerability.

414
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:23,050
So they can care what
kind of new technologies

415
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:24,790
that you are using.

416
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:27,810
And it keeps strong security principles

417
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:32,433
as defense in-depth in
the least privilege.

418
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,850
Let's see that one our deep process

419
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:38,399
is much just on checklist.

420
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,190
If you have a security parameter
in, on a specific control

421
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:45,253
for example, access permission,

422
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:48,510
don't check that.

423
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:52,240
Let's see if you have the
correct permission for that.

424
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,590
Apply the defense in-depth,

425
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:55,909
stuff that you fail.

426
00:23:55,910 --> 00:24:00,910
And if you have two or a
different layers of protection

427
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,230
you can avoid a big problem.

428
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:06,360
And use the least privilege.

429
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,070
You don't need that to have more access

430
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:11,889
than you need to do a specific function.

431
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:14,300
And in six months,

432
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:18,040
try into manage the compliance window

433
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:21,850
the time that you wanna audit
your internal control team

434
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:23,250
reports to you,

435
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:27,120
and how can you establish a connection

436
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,219
in a real time response

437
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,960
to help you to keep everything

438
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,580
in a risky manage approach

439
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:36,300
to protect your company.

440
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:39,540
And here we are saying that

441
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:45,420
you can build a governance
operations center,

442
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:48,950
is a new name that we'd like to share

443
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:52,650
if you are a way that you
can practice to measure

444
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:55,390
the efficiency of existing
compliance controls

445
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:56,730
in real time,

446
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:58,500
you can establish a partnership

447
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,990
with all the internal controls

448
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:05,990
just to use or helping them

449
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:10,640
to monitor all those compliance
controls in real time,

450
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,830
because normally security
operation set it changed.

451
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:17,230
I focus on operation in techniques control

452
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:20,040
in no visibility or regulator demands.

453
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:24,210
So y'all can also establish
a specific way monitoring.

454
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:26,130
And it contains real time validation

455
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:29,180
for touch code and compliance controls.

456
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:33,190
As you are using cloud
and continuous integration

457
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:36,580
continuous delivery,
you can establish a way

458
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:41,580
to help him to fight any
vulnerability as soon as possible.

459
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,900
And in the end, in the next six months

460
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:49,560
you can help together with your HR team

461
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:52,429
and it help your company and your team

462
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:54,550
to have a great leadership,

463
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:56,629
a multidisciplinary team

464
00:25:56,630 --> 00:26:01,610
and help IT and security to work together.

465
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:05,149
Leadership is something that
is crucial for any company

466
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:08,000
mailing, for Cybersecurity.

467
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,720
Build a leadership and an
organizational culture,

468
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:15,800
to avoid silos, to avoid finger-points

469
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:20,118
and to avoid a toxic environment.

470
00:26:20,118 --> 00:26:21,688
Review with your HR team,

471
00:26:21,689 --> 00:26:24,318
the strategy and the
tools that you can help

472
00:26:24,318 --> 00:26:26,529
to create the best culture

473
00:26:26,529 --> 00:26:28,617
and the best place to work

474
00:26:28,617 --> 00:26:31,857
to build a people-centric culture.

475
00:26:31,857 --> 00:26:33,649
Review with your HR team,

476
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:37,910
the leadership gaps that you
have around your company,

477
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:41,640
that is going to help you
to keep the best talents

478
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,490
to work with you.

479
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:46,290
Work on employees retention policies.

480
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:50,620
That's something that is
also going to help you.

481
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:53,209
So I'd like to thank you

482
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:55,170
and thank you(mumbles)

483

all the MIT and Incomes Institute

484
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:59,760
and cases and (mumbles)

485
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,920
and he take you everywhere
for all passions.

486
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:05,280
Indeed we are here to answer all of them.

487
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,470
