1
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:05,660
- Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:07,630
Thanks for joining this session today.

3
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:11,170
All about how to get started with SASE.

4
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:13,540
Over the past year,
there's been a lot of hype

5
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:17,130
around the Secure Access
Service Edge or SASE.

6
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:19,210
And over the next 30
minutes, I'm gonna give you

7
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:22,270
a crash course on all things SASE

8
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:26,450
including the top five
tips and pitfalls to avoid

9
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:29,140
when coming up with your own strategy.

10
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:31,480
Let's start by talking
about some of the trends

11
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,050
that have been driving this.

12
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:35,459
The shift towards a more
distributed workforce

13
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,620
is not something new but
it has accelerated over

14
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,120
the past year.

15
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,099
Now, most people are
working from anywhere.

16
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:47,270
At home, on the go,
eventually back in offices

17
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:49,710
and they're doing it on any device.

18
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:54,360
A recent Gartner survey revealed
that 82% of company leaders

19
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,380
plan to allow employees to work remotely

20
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:00,520
at least some of the time moving forward.

21
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,750
With this shift, the data
center is no longer the hub.

22
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,200
The user is.

23
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:09,330
And to give them more secure
access to work resources

24
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:13,250
and applications, our users
now have to almost be treated

25
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,380
as a branch of one.

26
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:18,330
With this hybrid work environment
becoming the new norm,

27
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:20,830
users are connecting in different ways.

28
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:23,030
More and more companies are adopting

29
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:25,130
a multiple cloud strategy.

30
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:29,220
In fact, 92% of companies
report that they've embraced

31
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,420
a multi-cloud strategy.

32
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:34,310
And it's not just one
or two different clouds.

33
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:37,220
The average company connects to over 20

34
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:39,429
different cloud services.

35
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:43,560
This adds complexity to what
used to be a fairly simple task

36
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,430
of connecting the user to the application

37
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,880
in the data center.

38
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,100
But regardless of the, the complexity,

39
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,649
users still expect a seamless connection

40
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:56,840
to the applications that they're using.

41
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,060
And the ways in which users are connecting

42
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,890
to their business applications
really differs almost daily

43
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:06,053
in this hybrid work environment.

44
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,810
With 60% of organizations
expecting majority of applications

45
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:15,370
to be SASE, IT needs to
factor in where the user

46
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:18,950
is coming from and how they're
connecting to those apps

47
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:20,643
which are now all over the place.

48
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:24,900
So how is this impacting the network?

49
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,220
This on the left-hand side
is how things used to work

50
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,750
with network and security.

51
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,940
All applications used
to be hosted on-prem.

52
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:37,060
Users had to be connected
to the corporate network

53
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:41,020
in order to access them
and get their work done.

54
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,600
And branch offices would
tunnel traffic back

55
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,927
to the corporate data center over MPLS.

56
00:02:46,927 --> 00:02:50,340
And 80% of that traffic was internal

57
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,090
because they were connecting
back to those apps

58
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:53,293
in the data center.

59
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:58,450
And all internet traffic was
also routed back through there

60
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:00,910
or access to the internet.

61
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:03,940
And you had that complete
security stack, the firewall,

62
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:06,420
secure web gateway, et cetera,

63
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:09,859
was really deployed there
within the corporate data center

64
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,650
or headquarters.

65
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,900
So for years, this was the way
that most companies deployed

66
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,860
their network architecture
and it allowed you to have

67
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:21,563
this single place for all
security on your network.

68
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,660
Over the last five years,
there's been this dramatic

69
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,900
increase in internet traffic.

70
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,410
You have organizations who
have continued to adapt

71
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:34,790
cloud applications and
storage and are running more

72
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:37,320
of their workloads in the cloud.

73
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,940
And now when you look at the
percentage of internet traffic,

74
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:43,370
that is typically higher
than the amount of,

75
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:46,890
of internal traffic that's
flowing over the network.

76
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:50,679
And so back hauling all of
this traffic through expensive

77
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:55,680
MPLS lines in and VPNs doesn't
really make sense anymore.

78
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,590
More organizations are moving
to direct internet access

79
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:03,210
which exposes them to more threats.

80
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:04,980
Because a lot of times
what ends up happening

81
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:09,239
is you're bypassing the
traditional security protection.

82
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,260
So this old centralized approach forces

83
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:15,440
all of the internet traffic
through that single stack

84
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,550
of security appliances.

85
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:20,459
And that leads to performance problems,

86
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:24,510
it impacts user satisfaction
and it can cause issues with

87
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:27,163
SASE adoption in many organizations.

88
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:32,200
As a result of these changes,
networking in security teams

89
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,930
struggled to, to do a few things.

90
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:38,150
So first of all it's a
challenge to connect users

91
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:41,320
to the applications and
data that they need.

92
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,640
When you're back hauling
everything, there's often a poor

93
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:48,550
user experience when accessing cloud apps

94
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:50,430
and most of the time users don't really

95
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,020
like that very much.

96
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,500
There's also complexity
when you're connecting to

97
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,450
multiple cloud providers.

98
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:59,409
And you lack that end-to-end visibility

99
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:01,570
of application performance.

100
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:05,540
If something is running slow,
how do you actually pinpoint

101
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,453
the cause and fix it quickly?

102
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:11,090
The second thing is, you know
they're, they're struggling

103
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:14,280
to protect against
evolving threat vectors.

104
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,880
You have gaps in security
protection, right?

105
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,469
If you're connecting
directly to the internet

106
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:22,140
and bypassing the on-prem security,

107
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:25,823
you're not getting the security
protection that you need.

108
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:29,970
We often hear a lot of times
there's inconsistent policies

109
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:32,680
being enforced across disparate locations

110
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,550
because they might be set
up by different people and,

111
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:40,010
you know not really centrally managed.

112
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:44,030
And it can also be difficult
to verify the identity of users

113
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:45,869
and devices.

114
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:49,390
So all of this is really
requiring a new approach

115
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:52,430
to networking and security.

116
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:54,400
And that's where SASE comes in.

117
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,400
So SASE was a term that was
coined by Gartner back in 2019

118
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:03,200
and it stands for the
Secure Access Service Edge.

119
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,030
And it's all about moving
security and networking

120
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:10,640
to the cloud and delivering
it as a subscription service.

121
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,620
Today's cloud-centric world
is really what's driving

122
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:16,020
the need for this new architecture.

123
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:20,219
SASE combines networking and
security functions in the cloud

124
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:24,010
to deliver secure access to applications

125
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:26,343
anywhere that users are working.

126
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:31,040
And Gartner describes it
as five core functions,

127
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:36,040
including Software Defined
Wide Area Network or SD-WAN,

128
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:40,490
firewall as a service, secure web gateway,

129
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:43,330
Cloud Access Security Broker or CASB

130
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:47,580
and Zero Trust Network Access or ZTNA.

131
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:51,880
The goal of the SASE model is
to consolidate these functions

132
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:56,219
which were traditionally
delivered as siloed point products

133
00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:00,060
into a single consolidated,
you know integrated,

134
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,770
cloud service.

135
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:05,630
And SASE is really designed to
help you first of all combine

136
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:08,460
those networking and security functions

137
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:12,930
to deliver secure
connectivity as a service.

138
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:16,300
You can connect users
seamlessly to the applications

139
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,940
and the data that they need to access

140
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:22,380
in any environment from any location.

141
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:25,610
And you can control access
and enforce the right security

142
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:28,453
protection anywhere that users work.

143
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:33,010
I like to think of it in, in
terms of the three Cs, right?

144
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:35,950
'Cause who doesn't love, you
know using the same letter

145
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,690
to kind of remember things, right?

146
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:41,480
So the first C is all
about connecting users

147
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:45,180
to the applications and data
that they need to access.

148
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:47,670
And that's really done
through the SD-WAN piece

149
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:49,940
and remote access.

150
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:53,840
Second, the control part is
extending the secure services

151
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,549
from the data center to any cloud.

152
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,830
So being able to extend
that security stack

153
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:03,830
of secure web gateway,
CASB, firewall, zero trust,

154
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:07,700
extending that anywhere that users go.

155
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:10,740
And then last is, is this,
this idea of convergence.

156
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,710
That we can bring together
networking and security functions

157
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:19,450
to deliver this secure connectivity
in a more integrated way

158
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:20,420
as a service.

159
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:23,273
And that's really what,
what SASE is about.

160
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:27,849
Now there's an opportunity
here for network operations

161
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:31,000
and security operations
to work better together.

162
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,890
NetOps and SecOps often work in silos.

163
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:38,140
It's in part because of,
of the different tool sets

164
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:42,039
and vendors that the teams rely
on and the natural tendency

165
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:44,599
for the groups to work independently.

166
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,810
So this, these, these silos
have really formed over time.

167
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:52,390
But with, with multiple vendors
you've probably encountered

168
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:55,040
kind of that finger pointing
when something goes wrong

169
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,969
and it's unclear who's
actually accountable.

170
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:00,300
Gartner actually recommends with SASE

171
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:05,170
selecting a single vendor
to deliver a SASE solution.

172
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:08,410
And as a result, we'll see
more convergence between

173
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:12,730
networking and security
teams as we move from

174
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:17,470
more of a product mindset
to more integrated services.

175
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:22,470
So this is a continued evolution
of, of the NOC and the SOC

176
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,790
coming together that will
drive a stronger collaboration

177
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:28,459
and faster time to resolution.

178
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:31,510
And there are a lot of
efficiencies that can be gained

179
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:35,144
by cutting out complexity
and these low value

180
00:09:35,144 --> 00:09:37,820
admin tasks for IT.

181
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:41,630
So with SASE, you'll really be
able to, first of all improve

182
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:45,250
network and security
visibility and control.

183
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:49,210
You'll be able to, to drive
collaboration and resolve issues

184
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:52,770
faster because it's all gonna
be consolidated together.

185
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:54,449
And then you'll be able to lower costs

186
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:57,823
because you can gain more
efficiencies and productivity.

187
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,910
So let's take a closer
look at the capabilities

188
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:04,459
of a SASE architecture.

189
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:09,460
So first, whether it's remote
workers or any fixed locations

190
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:13,750
or any IoT or internet facing devices,

191
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:18,070
before they connect to the
internet or any SaaS, IaaS,

192
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:21,390
public or private apps,
they first connect to

193
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:23,080
the cloud edge.

194
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,130
And by cloud edge what I really mean is,

195
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:28,566
is the boundary between
your users and applications

196
00:10:28,566 --> 00:10:30,820
that they need to access.

197
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:33,470
That's where SASE is
really bringing together

198
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:35,500
these capabilities.

199
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:39,530
On the networking side, by
bringing WAN into the cloud

200
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:41,839
and I'm not just talking
about you know, bringing a few

201
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:45,090
features there or just
managing it in the cloud

202
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:48,070
but really delivering
the WAN from the cloud.

203
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:50,130
You're able to increase
performance, right?

204
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:53,930
It can dynamically select
the best path across

205
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:55,170
the SD-WAN fabric.

206
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:58,610
Including providing
high quality of service,

207
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:01,530
it can optimize for SaaS applications.

208
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:06,140
So you're getting the
fastest, most secure path

209
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:09,080
and really driving efficiency
through the middle mile

210
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,203
and more.

211
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,060
Then you look at, on the security side.

212
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:17,290
It's bringing all of the
layers of the security stack

213
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:18,959
together in the cloud.

214
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:23,240
Everything from protecting
access to the internet with,

215
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,550
with DNS security and secure web gateway,

216
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,716
making sure that users aren't going to

217
00:11:28,716 --> 00:11:31,950
malicious or inappropriate sites,

218
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:36,240
securing the use of, of
those cloud apps with CASB,

219
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,580
using data loss prevention to
protect data that's in motion

220
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,614
on and data and apt.

221
00:11:42,614 --> 00:11:45,190
So especially your most sensitive data,

222
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:47,210
which you know now feels like it's,

223
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:50,180
it's even more accessible than ever

224
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:53,819
and bringing that firewall
protection in as well.

225
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,823
And even being able to protect
workloads in the cloud.

226
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,210
Then you have the Zero
Trust Network Access, right?

227
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:05,220
That's all about building
continuous trust verification

228
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:09,630
by looking at the actual
users, devices and services

229
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:12,689
that they're accessing
and not just basing it on

230
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,370
network locations.

231
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:17,935
So with SASE you can enable
zero trust by verifying

232
00:12:17,935 --> 00:12:22,119
the identity of users and
the health of their devices

233
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:25,540
before they're allowed
to access applications.

234
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:28,550
And you can do it on a per session basis.

235
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:31,569
So constantly looking and evaluating that.

236
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:33,300
Then there's the observability piece

237
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,550
that you see at the bottom.

238
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:37,900
And, and that's important, an
important piece to consider.

239
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:38,733
Right?

240
00:12:38,733 --> 00:12:42,030
In order to deliver the best
application performance,

241
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:44,880
you need to be able to remediate and,

242
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,150
you know any sort of performance
anomalies that happen.

243
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:50,699
And you need to be able
to do that very quickly.

244
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:54,520
And to do that, you need to
be able to see end-to-end

245
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:58,689
from the user all the way
up to the applications.

246
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:01,730
And when I say observability
I don't just mean

247
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:03,300
getting the visibility, right?

248
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,099
But you actually need that
actionable intelligence

249
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:09,673
and actionable insights to
know how to take action.

250
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,490
When you think about the,
the increased reliance

251
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:16,780
that we have on the
internet and cloud services,

252
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:19,600
more networks are
outside of your ownership

253
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,107
and direct control.

254
00:13:21,107 --> 00:13:23,569
So you need to be able to ensure that the,

255
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:27,800
the performance and integrity
of that underlying transport,

256
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,800
even when you don't actually
own the infrastructure

257
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,382
or control how the service
providers route traffic.

258
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,270
And you need that complete
visibility from the user

259
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:43,460
to the applications over
any network or cloud.

260
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:47,800
And, you need insight into
any performance issues

261
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,180
so that you can remediate
incidents quickly

262
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:52,793
and maintain that reliable connectivity.

263
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,760
All of this together, right?

264
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,600
The networking, the security,
the observability piece,

265
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:03,140
these are all of the key
components of a SASE architecture.

266
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:06,300
Now, let's take a look at
what you can actually do

267
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,319
with this.

268
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:11,320
There are two major use
cases that SASE solves.

269
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:14,660
First we have secure
remote workers, right?

270
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:17,310
This is all about getting
the seamless connection

271
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:21,209
to apps and data anywhere
that users work, right?

272
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:25,560
Think about opening your
laptop and just start working.

273
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,739
And then being able to
secure access to the internet

274
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:29,920
and cloud apps, right?

275
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,257
Not requiring the user to
necessarily log into a VPN

276
00:14:33,257 --> 00:14:37,010
in order to be protected
but ensuring that they

277
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:40,390
have that constant secure access.

278
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:43,140
And being able to
authenticate users and ensure

279
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:47,460
their device health before
establishing connection.

280
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,550
The second major use case is around

281
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,939
securing the edge, right?

282
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:54,870
So whether it's your, your
WAN edge across any location,

283
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:56,397
you wanna make sure that you can,

284
00:14:56,397 --> 00:15:00,770
can streamline that connectivity
to public and private apps

285
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:04,220
across all of your office locations.

286
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:07,950
You wanna be able to
provision the SD-WAN fabric

287
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:11,750
across thousands of
users and, and locations.

288
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,360
And make sure again that
you have that secure access

289
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,800
to the apps and direct internet access,

290
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,790
whatever it is that your users are doing.

291
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:23,189
And really being able to
simplify your policy enforcement

292
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:25,840
across all of these different environments

293
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:30,560
so that you can have that
consistent secure protection.

294
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,319
So how can this benefit you?

295
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,610
It's really all about helping you get back

296
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:39,520
into the driver's seat
and, and gain more control

297
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:44,060
by cutting out the complexity
and leveraging the cloud

298
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,959
for secure networking.

299
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:49,090
So with SASE, you can
deliver you know, seamless,

300
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:52,660
secure connection experiences
that users expect, right?

301
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:56,810
Our users expect it to be
easy and simple and fast.

302
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:58,729
And you can, you can, that's what really,

303
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:01,193
SASE is about helping you deliver.

304
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:06,450
You wanna be able to move
access control back to,

305
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:08,550
you know closer to where it's needed

306
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:11,359
like moving it closer
to user in a cloud edge

307
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,290
because we know that users are everywhere.

308
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:15,920
They're no longer, you
know it's no longer working

309
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,410
the same way that it once did.

310
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:19,459
So we wanna be able to safely move

311
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:21,980
that access control there.

312
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,830
And then we wanna make your,
your organization more agile

313
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:28,470
by leveraging the cloud to
remove a lot of the complexity

314
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:29,820
from your infrastructure.

315
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:33,000
And that complexity is gonna continue to

316
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,380
grow in time if we try to do things that,

317
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,689
the way that we once did.

318
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:41,980
And so it's about coming up
with this new approach with SASE

319
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:45,400
to kind of re-imagine your,
your infrastructure and security

320
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:49,000
and leverage the cloud to
remove a lot of that complexity.

321
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,737
And you get that kind of
agility as your networking

322
00:16:51,737 --> 00:16:55,439
and security really start
to inter-operate and work,

323
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,903
even better together.

324
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:01,260
And then converging those
resources to gain more

325
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:05,640
efficiencies especially through
and as a service model for,

326
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,579
for secure networking.

327
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:11,990
Now I wanna share with you five
tips and also some pitfalls

328
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:15,859
to be aware of and avoid when
you're looking at how SASE

329
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:18,060
fits into your organization.

330
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,839
So tip number one,

331
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:23,899
look for a complete
integrated architecture.

332
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,510
One of the challenges that you'll face

333
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:31,310
is trying to decipher the,
the different SASE solutions

334
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,540
from vendors.

335
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:35,639
When you think about the
broadest definition of SASE,

336
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:39,150
bringing networking and
security together in the cloud.

337
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:42,340
There are a lot of
capabilities that could fall

338
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,780
into that bucket.

339
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:46,210
So start by focusing on what's important

340
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:50,190
to your organization
today and in the future.

341
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:53,840
First, think about what use
cases you're trying to solve.

342
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,649
I mentioned two main use
cases earlier, right?

343
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:59,940
Securing remote workers
and securing the edge.

344
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:03,920
But break those down into
what an ideal state looks like

345
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,390
for your company.

346
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:07,720
And it might be a phased approach

347
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,673
broken down by different products too.

348
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,960
Next, you wanna consider what capabilities

349
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,790
are most important in order for
you to solve those use cases

350
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:22,300
both now and in the future.

351
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,860
Like I said before,
you'll see some variation

352
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:28,050
in what's available from different vendors

353
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:28,883
in their offerings.

354
00:18:28,883 --> 00:18:31,300
So think about what matters most to you

355
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,379
and what's gonna provide you with the,

356
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:36,100
the most complete solution.

357
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:39,230
Then think about what
the vendor offers today

358
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:41,650
and what their future vision is.

359
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:45,980
SASE is still relatively
new, a new market area.

360
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:48,200
So it's important to think about where

361
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,250
or what the vendors plans are to take it,

362
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:54,280
where they plan to kind of
take that in the future.

363
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,420
For example you know, does the vendor have

364
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:59,620
all the capabilities that
you're looking for today

365
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:02,709
but available in separate products?

366
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:05,860
You'll wanna understand, how
do they plan to bring that all

367
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:06,693
together?

368
00:19:06,693 --> 00:19:10,010
Because that's where the real
magic of SASE happens, right?

369
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:13,040
When you can bring all of
those capabilities together

370
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:16,530
in a single cloud dashboard

371
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:19,510
and then deliver it as
a subscription service.

372
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:20,976
Which brings me to,

373
00:19:20,976 --> 00:19:24,620
some pitfalls to just be
aware of and avoid, right?

374
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:27,790
Products from multiple vendors
that are brought together

375
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:30,550
with more basic integrations.

376
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:34,610
So you'll wanna look for a
vision of consolidation of those,

377
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:38,110
those five core functions that
I mentioned earlier, right?

378
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:43,110
SD-WAN, firewall, ZTMA,
secure web gateway and CASB.

379
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,220
And consolidation is key because

380
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,410
even though you may only have you know,

381
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:51,710
zero trust or SD-WAN today,

382
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:54,023
you'll likely need to extend
to some other services

383
00:19:54,023 --> 00:19:57,429
in the future and move more to the cloud.

384
00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:01,630
And according to Gartner,
about 5% of enterprises

385
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:05,430
have all five of these
services from one vendor today.

386
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:07,970
But by, in the next couple of years,

387
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:11,370
it's predicted that
about 20% of enterprises

388
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:15,142
will have those five
services from one vendor.

389
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,570
Even if it's multiple products
from a single vendor today,

390
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:23,370
look at how easy it is to
actually integrate them together

391
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:25,540
and how they're gonna be brought together

392
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:30,315
even more in the future versus
having to always rely on,

393
00:20:30,315 --> 00:20:34,370
product integrations across
multiple vendors, right?

394
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:37,169
That's really where there's
this shift happening

395
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:40,570
from kind of best of
breed to best of platform.

396
00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:42,200
That's really gonna drive

397
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,670
efficiency for your
networking and security teams,

398
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:48,970
particularly as, as vendors
integrate more of these

399
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:51,723
core services together in SASE.

400
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:58,270
On to tip number two, consider
a flexible consumption model.

401
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:01,430
Over the past last year,
we've seen huge changes

402
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:03,970
in the way that businesses operate.

403
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:06,680
You need to be able to
move with speed and agility

404
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:10,110
and have the flexibility to quickly adapt

405
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:12,169
to changing priorities.

406
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:14,660
And be able to scale up and down,

407
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:16,800
in different areas when needed.

408
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:20,044
For example, if you look at
needing to quickly spin up

409
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:24,530
a new location or have you
know, 2000 remote workers

410
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:26,610
that you have to get set up.

411
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:28,760
What would that look like for you?

412
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:32,600
Beyond technology, think about
how the SASE architecture

413
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,540
can actually be delivered.

414
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:37,260
Are there flexible delivery models?

415
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:41,660
Including you know,
usage based, pay per use

416
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:45,450
or pay as you grow
options that are offered.

417
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:47,730
If there's generic hardware that's needed,

418
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:51,690
is that something that can
be delivered as a service?

419
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:53,780
With SASE, the goal should be

420
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:57,129
having this instant global
coverage with the ability

421
00:21:57,130 --> 00:22:00,150
to provision thousands
of locations in minutes

422
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:04,240
and be able to scale up and
down your level of service,

423
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,400
the features that you use
and the number of connections

424
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,190
in your service.

425
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:14,190
So tip number three, not all
clouds were created equal.

426
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,580
Now cloud has been a bit of
a, a buzzword in our industry

427
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,149
for years now.

428
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:23,340
And when you're considering
SASE, it's an important one

429
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,173
to consider.

430
00:22:24,173 --> 00:22:26,180
It's not just a buzzword,
it's something that,

431
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,840
that's very important for
you to think about, right?

432
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,409
When you think about your network

433
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:33,380
and security infrastructure
running in a cloud,

434
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:37,290
it becomes pretty important for
that cloud to be rock solid,

435
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:39,710
reliable and fast.

436
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:42,980
To really look into the
cloud infrastructure that,

437
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,120
that's offered, right?

438
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:47,590
Think about how long has the
company been running the,

439
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:48,760
the cloud infrastructure?

440
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:52,480
And what does that, that
track record look like?

441
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,540
And when you look at,
at data center locations

442
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,509
around the world, don't just
look at the sheer number

443
00:22:58,509 --> 00:23:01,840
of data centers that, that they have.

444
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:06,320
What's also important is
how well connected they are.

445
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,649
So think about how many
peering partners does,

446
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:11,505
does the vendor have?

447
00:23:11,505 --> 00:23:14,380
How many peering sessions do they have?

448
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:17,460
That's really how you'll
get the fastest connections

449
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,010
to sites and applications.

450
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:22,770
It's not just having the data
centers but how well connected

451
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:26,120
are they with that, those
core internet exchange points

452
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,969
and those different peering partners?

453
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:30,670
And then you wanna also consider,

454
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:34,260
how are their services
architected in the cloud?

455
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,480
Is it a cloud native solution?

456
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,400
Or is it virtual machines that are,

457
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,150
are running in the cloud, right?

458
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:42,840
A microservices based architecture

459
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:47,050
is one that will enable the
service to scale dynamically

460
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:50,360
much better than just
relying on virtual machines

461
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,419
that are in the cloud.

462
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:56,160
So just another aspect to
really keep in mind and dig into

463
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,053
as you're looking at solutions.

464
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:04,150
Tip four is remembering the
importance of security efficacy.

465
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:08,100
Security efficacy is not something
that's always factored in

466
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:11,270
by organizations but it's
actually pretty important, right?

467
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:13,530
We just talked about the
fact that not all clouds

468
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:14,750
are created equal.

469
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,560
And the same goes for the efficacy

470
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:19,120
of your security protection.

471
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,810
And while no product out
there is 100% effective,

472
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:25,340
you wanna make sure that,
that you are stopping

473
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,659
as much as possible.

474
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:31,420
And when you're evaluating
solutions, consider this as,

475
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:32,640
as a test criteria.

476
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,660
So looking at, at the security efficacy

477
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:37,210
of different products.

478
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:39,740
Or look for third-party
comparisons that you can

479
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:40,910
take a look at.

480
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:43,670
As an organization you should
also look into the sources

481
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:45,020
of the threat intelligence.

482
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:48,060
So is it mainly coming
from third-party feeds

483
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:52,280
or does the vendor have their
own threat research team?

484
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,050
You know, what does
that actually look like?

485
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:57,409
And what's delivered in
terms of threat intelligence

486
00:24:57,410 --> 00:24:59,150
for the product?

487
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:03,270
Another consideration is how
the SASE solution ties in

488
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:08,270
to an Extended Detection and
Response or XDR platform.

489
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:12,550
XDR is all about integrating
multiple security

490
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:16,440
control points and applying
analytics and automation

491
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:21,440
to make detection and
response faster and easier.

492
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:25,790
And XDR and SASE actually intersect as,

493
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:28,930
as SecOps and NetOps and ITOps,

494
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:32,430
continuously assess the risk and trust.

495
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:36,020
And it's not just based on
context from the network

496
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:39,430
or cloud analytics but
also endpoint security,

497
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:40,950
email security and more.

498
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:44,040
So when you can tie SASE in with XDR,

499
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:47,173
that just amplifies
what you're able to see

500
00:25:47,173 --> 00:25:50,910
and how well you're able to respond.

501
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:55,670
And finally tip number
five, do SASE your way.

502
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:59,530
There's no one size fits
all approach for SASE.

503
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:02,930
Every organization has
different architectures,

504
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:05,870
different investments,
different requirements,

505
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:10,050
different digital transformation
plans to consider.

506
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:12,899
So really think about you
know, and look for a vendor

507
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:16,350
who can deliver all of
the core SASE components,

508
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:21,350
and bridge your journey to
SASE from wherever you are.

509
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:25,160
You know, you need to be able
to leverage your existing

510
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:28,150
investments and go to
the cloud in a manner

511
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:31,170
that's right for you and at your own pace.

512
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:36,170
And you know, when you're
looking at moving from on-prem

513
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:40,110
to the cloud, it doesn't
need to happen overnight.

514
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:43,459
Look for somebody who you
can partner with to map out

515
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:45,860
the right approach for you.

516
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:48,530
You may already be on your SASE journey

517
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:51,170
or you may take time to get there.

518
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:53,230
You need to choose a
vendor that can meet you

519
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:58,210
where you are today with a
vision that enables this longterm

520
00:26:58,210 --> 00:26:59,863
SASE transformation.

521
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:03,379
You may also need to
consider a hybrid approach.

522
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:07,170
Maybe your goal is to move
everything to the cloud

523
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:10,460
or you may need to have
some locations or regions

524
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:13,380
where you still need some on-prem support.

525
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:17,260
So look for a vendor who can
support you in this sort of,

526
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,390
of deployment as well.

527
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:22,330
And then finally think
about investment protection.

528
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:25,139
You've probably already
invested quite a bit

529
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:27,440
into your existing infrastructure,

530
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:32,440
and it may take time for you
to fully move to a SASE model.

531
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:36,230
You know, maybe you
just refreshed recently

532
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:40,180
and it may seem a bit difficult to justify

533
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:43,290
another investment to move to the cloud.

534
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:46,320
So look for vendors who can offer you

535
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,280
some investment protection there

536
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,000
to help you in the transition.

537
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,510
And again, you know as you're ready,

538
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:55,613
be able to move to the cloud at your pace.

539
00:27:56,890 --> 00:28:00,900
Now that you've gone through
this crash course on SASE,

540
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:04,070
let's talk about some next
steps that you can take.

541
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:07,139
So first and the next week you should,

542
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:09,690
talk with your network and security teams

543
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:13,600
about the role that SASE can
play within your organization,

544
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:18,530
and maybe identify some possible
use cases to get started.

545
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,060
Then as you look at over
the next few months,

546
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:23,129
some other things that you wanna consider.

547
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:25,750
First of all, the, the complexity of your

548
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:26,800
current environment.

549
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,510
What are some of those, those
major challenges that you're,

550
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:32,400
that you're having today
and how can you reduce

551
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,690
some of that complexity?

552
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:39,050
Consider how a new approach
could simplify your management,

553
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:42,730
improve your security and
provide better scalability

554
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:44,053
for the future.

555
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:49,210
Think about what operational
efficiencies you could gain

556
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:51,570
with vendor consolidation and with this,

557
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:53,980
this move to the cloud.

558
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:56,940
And then start to research
what sort of SASE solutions

559
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:59,750
would be best for you and start to develop

560
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:02,040
a project timeline.

561
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:05,930
So with that, we'll now
open it up for questions

562
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:07,450
and see what's on your mind.
