00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:13,870
- [Announcer] Please
welcome, Abnormal Security,

5
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:18,796
Chief Executive Officer
and Co-Founder Evan Reiser.

6
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:21,180
- Hello, I'm Evan Reiser.

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,020
The Founder and CEO of Abnormal Security

8
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,310
a cloud native email security
platform that leverages

9
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:28,150
behavioral data science to
stop modern email attacks.

10
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:29,910
Today I'm here to talk about
the number one security threat

11
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,810
facing companies today
and how we stop them.

12
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:34,770
According to the FBI
socially engineered email

13
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:35,980
tacks responsible for more

14
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:38,010
than $2 billion a year
in financial losses,

15
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,320
by far more than any
other security threat.

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,430
They utilize impersonations to steal money

17
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:45,390
and they pose an order of
magnitude more risks organizations

18
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,920
than well-publicized
attacks like ransomware.

19
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,400
Similar to solar winds, if
you look at the true source

20
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,309
of the colonial pipeline attack,
you'll see it all started

21
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:54,060
with a single spear phishing email.

22
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:58,100
Here's an example from
a fortune 100 customer.

23
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,090
The attacker has
compromised a known vendor,

24
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,450
has leveraged the implicit
trust and online identities

25
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:04,769
to steal money from our customer.

26
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:07,130
The reason this attack
bypasses conventional email

27
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:09,759
security is there's no known bad signals.

28
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,380
It's sent from a trusted
account with no bad reputation.

29
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:14,570
There's no links, no bad attachments.

30
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:16,270
So conventional email security controls

31
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:19,800
like reputation analysis and
file sandboxing will not work.

32
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,149
Abnormal takes a fundamentally
different approach.

33
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:23,540
Architecture integrate,

34
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,510
we don't integrate into
the network like Gateway.

35
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:28,300
We integrate directly in
a Microsoft 365 platform.

36
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,130
The product can be
installed and integrated

37
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:33,600
and configured in a single
click through cloud native APIs.

38
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,500
We then use behavioral profiles.

39
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,870
We then build behavioral
profiles, the organization,

40
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:39,330
by looking at organizational identity,

41
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:43,330
relationships, and content
to baseline normal behavior.

42
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:45,620
When emails come into the
environment, we use behavioral

43
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:48,890
anomaly detection to detect
and block these attacks.

44
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:51,330
In the previous example,
Abnormal is able to

45
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:54,100
identify behavioral anomalies
to stop this attack.

46
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,600
Despite it being a trusted party

47
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,100
with no known bad indicators,

48
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,860
we're able to stop it
because we saw it was sent

49
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,080
from an unusual location, to an individual

50
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,060
with no known relationship,
and by analyzing the content

51
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,720
and context and contrast
in that to vendor base,

52
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,229
our federated network of
supply chain intelligence,

53
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:12,290
we're able to detect the
fraud and stop the attack.

54
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:14,230
This behavioral approach to email security

55
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:16,100
generalizes extremely well.

56
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,739
It enables us to stop the full spectrum

57
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:20,330
email security attacks, things
like social engineering,

58
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:22,070
phishing, and malware, as well as more

59
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:24,400
sophisticated attacks, like
internal account takeover

60
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,280
and supply chain compromise.

61
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,680
All this is built on a set
of unique behavioral profile

62
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,060
technologies enabling us to
achieve 10 X higher accuracy

63
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,660
than conventional email systems.

64
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,640
In summary, Abnormal
security's solving the

65
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,390
largest cybersecurity risk,
which is objectively 10 X

66
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:40,359
bigger source of loss,

67
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,360
According to that, according to the FBI.

68
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,610
We have a novel architecture
with deep integration

69
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:48,090
to cloud office, giving us
access to 10 X more data.

70
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:50,340
We then leverage that data
with a unique behavioral

71
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:53,220
detection technology to
block emails with 10 X

72
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,203
higher accuracy.

73
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:58,239
This order of magnitude
increase in efficacy is why 5%

74
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,730
of the fortune one currently
has 100% of their employee

75
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:04,190
mailboxes protected by
Abnormal, which I hope gives me

76
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,570
credibility when I say,

77
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:07,560
we're the only email security
platform you'll ever need.

78
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,658
Thanks guys so much for your time.
