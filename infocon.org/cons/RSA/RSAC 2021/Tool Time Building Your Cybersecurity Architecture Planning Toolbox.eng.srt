00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:03,500
- Hello, and welcome to Tool Time:

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,910
Building Your Cybersecurity
Architecture Planning Toolbox.

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:11,240
I'm Diana Kelley, founder
and partner at SecurityCurve.

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,700
And joining me today is.

5
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,700
- Ed Moyle, I am a
Software Security Principle

6
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,012
with Adaptive Biotechnologies,
though if you know my name,

7
00:00:20,885 --> 00:00:24,160
it's probably from ISACA
where I ran the research group

8
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,710
there for a period of
about four or five years.

9
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:31,040
- So if you're a fan of COBIT,
you can impart thank Ed.

10
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,570
You worked on that for years.

11
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:34,010
- I worked some COBIT to the,

12
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:37,382
it says some COBIT into this so.

13
00:00:37,383 --> 00:00:40,480
- More COBIT.
- Everybody needs one.

14
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,480
- So we are virtual as everybody
knows, but we're also live.

15
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:46,959
So we're here with you live

16
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,050
in addition to this being prerecorded.

17
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:52,370
So please, we're here to
answer questions in the chat.

18
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:53,640
So as we go along,

19
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,670
don't worry about holding
your questions to the end,

20
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,700
so we can chat with you interactively

21
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,530
during the session too.

22
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:03,030
And with that let's get started.

23
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,620
So our agenda today, we're gonna give you

24
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:07,370
a little bit of an
overview about why tools

25
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:09,790
can help with cybersecurity architecture.

26
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:11,050
And really what you wanna do

27
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:13,710
to have a successful
cybersecurity architecture.

28
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:15,720
And then we'll dive right into the tools,

29
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,060
there are three different
categories of tools

30
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,730
that we'll be going over.

31
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:23,600
Analytical type tools,
informational and the design tools.

32
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,330
And then we'll give you some guidance

33
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:27,550
on how to bring this all together.

34
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:30,399
We do wanna mention that every
tool that we're referencing

35
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,790
throughout the talk are
free and open source.

36
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:34,160
So they're all fast tools,

37
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,140
so they're all available
for you to go take a look at

38
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,100
and we have a list of
references at the end,

39
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,580
don't worry about on every slide saying,

40
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:42,899
I have to capture that,

41
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,500
because we also have a list
of references at the end

42
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,900
so that you can find these
tools after the talk.

43
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:54,700
So, to get started, that
you can probably tell

44
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:58,360
is actually me with with
the towel on my head.

45
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,200
And we have an important point here,

46
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,960
because if you're a fan
of the show South Park,

47
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,931
you may be familiar with Towelie.

48
00:02:05,931 --> 00:02:09,130
And Towelie's favorite phrase
is always, you're a towel.

49
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:11,210
And so we kind of in a lighthearted way

50
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:14,530
wanting to remind everybody
that we're actually,

51
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:17,200
we the human beings are the strongest

52
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,753
and most effective tool in the toolbox.

53
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:26,830
- Absolutely, all right, so let's start,

54
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:33,320
our deep diving into the
actual architecture process.

55
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:36,310
We're gonna be moving
very quickly through this.

56
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:38,660
So just like Diana said, at the end

57
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,359
we've captured all the references.

58
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,890
For you to review at your leisure

59
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:45,779
but the most important
thing, if you look at

60
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,637
at kind of the, how
architecture is done, right?

61
00:02:48,637 --> 00:02:52,410
Or how it should be done
to be disciplined, right?

62
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:54,420
You want to have kind of a normalized

63
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,299
a repeatable process that you can follow,

64
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:00,310
to get to, a robust and resilient
architecture at the end.

65
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:03,940
So, there are some principles
to keep in mind, right?

66
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,970
You don't wanna necessarily overinvest.

67
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:07,130
You don't wanna boil the ocean.

68
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:10,560
You don't want to, you need to
be able to react to changes.

69
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,927
So for example, with, with COVID-19.

70
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:17,180
We're all in a situation where
it needed to be adaptable.

71
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:19,053
And then when it comes to,

72
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,140
the data that you collect,
so more is always better.

73
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:26,359
So just, in have these
things kind of in your mind

74
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,820
as we talk to, talk through
first the architecture process

75
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:32,148
and then kind of how
the tools fit into it.

76
00:03:32,148 --> 00:03:34,897
- Yeah, and how you'll
be successful with them.

77
00:03:34,897 --> 00:03:37,829
So what's the problem though
that we're trying to solve.

78
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:38,740
There's always a problem.

79
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:42,710
And in security architecture,
one of the big problems is

80
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,870
that it's incredibly manual.

81
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:48,050
The process takes a long time.

82
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:49,970
There's not a whole lot of automation.

83
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:52,350
That's why we really wanted
to focus on what tools

84
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:54,359
were available, because we've seen,

85
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,500
as we've worked on
cybersecurity architectures

86
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,560
over our careers,

87
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,710
that, it can be really hard
to get everybody together

88
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:02,910
on the same page.

89
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,700
And because it's so
manual, you're losing a lot

90
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,470
of that repeatability.

91
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:09,810
And some of that like tribal knowledge.

92
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:11,772
So some of these tools really can help,

93
00:04:11,772 --> 00:04:13,890
to address that problem.

94
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:16,899
Because it really doesn't
have to be completely manual.

95
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:19,260
There really are ways to make it better

96
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,280
and easier for you to
accomplish the architectures

97
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,640
that you're working on.

98
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,395
And one note that we probably
should have set up front,

99
00:04:26,395 --> 00:04:28,599
but we have forgotten is that a lot

100
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,450
of this talk is actually based on a book

101
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:33,530
that we wrote called Practical
Cybersecurity Architecture.

102
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:36,619
So in addition to exploring
the tools after this talk

103
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,140
that book can also take you,
if you want to get deeper

104
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,690
into cybersecurity architecture,

105
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:42,840
a lot of these concepts
are explained there,

106
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,760
but in more detail.

107
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,080
- Absolutely true.

108
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,640
So the three different categories

109
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,169
of tools that we're gonna
be talking about right.

110
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:54,450
Is as we teed them up analytic
informational design tools

111
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:56,330
but what, what does that mean right.

112
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:57,300
At a high level?

113
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,350
What does that mean?

114
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:01,900
So from an analytic standpoint, basically,

115
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:06,630
what there's kind of a
process that these fold into,

116
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:10,570
and in terms of kind of
understanding where you are now

117
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:13,980
both from a, like a gap
analysis standpoint.

118
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:17,130
So kind of the difference
between where you are now

119
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:19,930
and where you wanna be across
a few different dimensions

120
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:21,040
that we're gonna talk about.

121
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,250
From a risk standpoint,

122
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,160
and then also from a threat
environment standpoint

123
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,380
that would fall under the category

124
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,230
of what we're calling analytic tools,

125
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,549
or analytical tools if you prefer.

126
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:33,360
The next one is kind of
all about data gathering.

127
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,670
And so this is mostly like
understanding your environment

128
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:40,013
gathering telemetry, gathering
metrics that you can use.

129
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:44,950
We're, we'll spend some time
talking, kind of through that.

130
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:48,880
And then lastly is, the
design time element.

131
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,760
The, documentation. the modeling,

132
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,500
the things that you need to do

133
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:56,750
in order to support,
the, both the expression

134
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:02,110
of your design to someone
else, which is important.

135
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:04,610
But more importantly, I
would say just kind of,

136
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:08,350
the way that you kind
of finalize it yourself.

137
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:10,390
So people always think
about documentation is how

138
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:12,900
do I explain this to somebody
else, but also keep in mind

139
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:13,780
that as you're creating it,

140
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,650
you're almost explaining it to yourself

141
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:17,780
and working through a
lot of these problems,

142
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:20,580
that if you didn't go
through that exercise,

143
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,539
you would be needing to deal
with real time on the fly.

144
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:26,790
- And if you've ever done a
really complex architecture

145
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:30,410
or even written a very
complex research document

146
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:32,260
you sometimes find yourself getting lost.

147
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,670
Or if you've written up a
really big complex piece of code

148
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:37,140
you can kind of get lost in your own work.

149
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,570
So it's such a great point

150
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:40,000
that you also want to document it

151
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,100
not just for others, but for yourself too

152
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,210
especially in these bigger,
more complex projects.

153
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:46,130
- Absolutely.
- Unless you have

154
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:48,032
a perfect memory, which I sure don't.

155
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:53,032
So the architectural process
at a high level is really

156
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:58,479
around understanding your
current state validating that.

157
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,710
Using metrics, using measurements.

158
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:02,609
And then documenting where you are

159
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:04,360
and where you wanna go
in the future state.

160
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,990
So if you see those three steps

161
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:09,100
within the architectural process map

162
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,190
to the categories is the
tools that we're gonna

163
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,500
be talking about.

164
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,300
And we broke that up.

165
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,133
That's why the tools,

166
00:07:15,133 --> 00:07:18,330
we brought the tools into the
architectural process rather

167
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:21,628
than layering the process over the tools.

168
00:07:21,628 --> 00:07:22,461
- Absolutely true.

169
00:07:22,461 --> 00:07:24,520
- So getting started
with the analytical tools

170
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:28,560
or the analytics, this is about
assessing the current state.

171
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,080
- Yeah, so basically what,
the most important thing,

172
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,289
and at least in my opinion, that you wanna

173
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:37,440
do is you wanna understand
kind of where you are now.

174
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,200
And you want to understand

175
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,260
that in a few different ways, right?

176
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,450
Because you want to understand
kind of what you have

177
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:45,430
and then you wanna look at

178
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,360
kind of how it can be attacked, right?

179
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,120
So understanding the threat environment

180
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,060
and then you could put
those two things together.

181
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:53,764
And at the end of it,
you're going to understand,

182
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:55,850
you'll have a risk-based view, right?

183
00:07:55,850 --> 00:08:00,110
So to start that process,
you can look at gap analysis

184
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:02,830
now and across a couple
of different dimensions.

185
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:03,663
Now, in my mind

186
00:08:03,663 --> 00:08:05,730
I'm sure there are few
dimensions beyond this,

187
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:08,970
but in my mind, the three
most important dimensions

188
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:11,740
to look at are what we're
calling effectiveness

189
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,157
maturity and efficiency.

190
00:08:13,157 --> 00:08:14,390
And there's other names for this.

191
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:16,560
But effectiveness is basically like

192
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,680
if you've ever been through like an audit

193
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,010
or if you've done kind
of like a ISO assessment

194
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:26,050
or something like that,
basically what that is

195
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:29,130
is that's to help you understand kind of

196
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:31,820
if you have a given control
or given countermeasure

197
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,120
or what have you in place, right?

198
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,159
So this is basically like looking

199
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:38,929
at your implementation
across a documented baseline.

200
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:42,449
Now, the ones that we've
listed here are COBIT 5

201
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:44,810
because of course, I worked
for our ISACA for a long time

202
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:47,359
so I can't let it go without the COBIT.

203
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,293
But there's also others
too, like SP 800-53,

204
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:56,170
the ISO 27,001 standard
in particular, Annex A.

205
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,630
The reason why Annex A
as opposed to kind of,

206
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:01,540
the rest of the standard is
that, because we're talking

207
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,185
about controls here and,

208
00:09:03,186 --> 00:09:05,820
the earlier sections of the
standard are really about some

209
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,560
of the things that are going
to come later in the process

210
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,766
like risk management and program
management what have you.

211
00:09:10,766 --> 00:09:14,069
So we're talking about the controls piece.

212
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:16,350
So that's really kind of looking at it,

213
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:17,970
from a do you have this.

214
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:19,810
The next one is kind of your maturity.

215
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:22,050
So it's important to
understand if you have it

216
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:23,670
but then it's also important to understand

217
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,660
if you're how you're doing it.

218
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,510
So one way you think

219
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:29,460
about something like
spam filtering, right?

220
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,680
There are two ways that
you could do this, right?

221
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,880
Like one way would be that you,

222
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,700
implement a spam filtering tool.

223
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,610
Another way would be that
you could hire a Legion

224
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:40,580
of people to like actually read emails

225
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,520
as they're coming in
and sort them into spam

226
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,220
versus non spam, right?

227
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,650
Now, the manual approach

228
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:49,010
and the automated approach
while they do the same thing

229
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:51,030
have very different
characteristics, right?

230
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:56,030
So maturity refers to, the
maturity of the processes,

231
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:02,160
the process implementation supporting it.

232
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,829
So if you look at models like the CMMI,

233
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:08,830
the capability and maturity
model, or if you're looking

234
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:12,160
at something like CMMC
right for doing validation.

235
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,199
Maturity evaluation, and so on,

236
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,020
this is really kind of
one strategy to do that,

237
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,280
but, it tells you more

238
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,110
about just do you have
this control or not?

239
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:23,130
It's telling you about the level

240
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:25,630
of maturity for the
underlying supporting process.

241
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:28,870
- And then the last thing
you want to think about is

242
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:31,240
are you doing it efficiently?

243
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:34,967
So how you're doing it,
and if you're doing it

244
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,660
but you also want to
know, does it make sense?

245
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:39,260
Are you spending more money to do less?

246
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:42,580
Are you paying a sort of reasonable amount

247
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:45,580
for that control or are you
overpaying for the control?

248
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,420
There's the classic example of

249
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:52,420
you don't insure a $300 car
that's old and about to die.

250
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,640
You don't pay $2,000 a year for insurance

251
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,590
for the cost of replacement of that car.

252
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,010
Cause it doesn't make sense, right?

253
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:01,670
You wanna get that right
measurement, that right balance

254
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,630
between the budget and the efficiency.

255
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,910
So you wanna make sure
that what you're paying for

256
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:07,640
you're getting over and above that.

257
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,870
Not that you're paying more than

258
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:09,710
what you're getting for them.

259
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,970
That's where the economic
modeling tools can

260
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:12,803
really come in

261
00:11:12,803 --> 00:11:15,040
and help you understand
how much you're paying

262
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,339
for each control in addition
to how well it's being used

263
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:20,840
and the maturity of that control.

264
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,060
- Absolutely true, and all of those things

265
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:26,780
kind of tell you a little bit
about your control environment

266
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,189
as it exists right now.

267
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:29,610
But there's more that you need to know

268
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:31,860
in order to be able to do a full kind

269
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:34,220
of current state analysis, right?

270
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,920
The next step is you need to understand,

271
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,849
your own internal threat environment.

272
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:41,000
And, who's trying to compromise you.

273
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,320
So, one approach, to understanding kind

274
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,730
of that that threat environment,

275
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:50,560
is to use, threat
modeling kind of approach.

276
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,250
There's multiple
different ways to do this.

277
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,980
There's things like application model.

278
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:57,230
Application threat modeling
that you may be familiar with.

279
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:59,100
but there's been along the way,

280
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,030
threat trees and other other strategies

281
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:04,189
for how to evaluate the
attackers eye point of view.

282
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,520
But really all this is saying is

283
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,819
that once you understand
kind of that initial,

284
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:11,320
baseline environment you also
want to understand kind of,

285
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,860
the threat model or,

286
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:17,310
the threat environment in
which you'll need to operate.

287
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:20,349
- Yeah, the misuse cases,
how can people abuse it?

288
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:22,250
And back in the day,
sometimes we would call

289
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,680
before threat modeling
became a common term.

290
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,380
We often called threat modeling.

291
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,260
What we did was risk assessment work

292
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:31,030
around specific use cases or controls.

293
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:34,300
So it's not unusual that to bring back in

294
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,599
risk assessment frameworks in this process

295
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,460
as you're doing the analytics.

296
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,547
So we've talked about some
of the maturity frameworks

297
00:12:40,547 --> 00:12:42,910
and some of the risk
frameworks, but again,

298
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:46,589
I ISACA's risk it framework,
is one that you can bring in.

299
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:49,090
And for fans of Jack Jones also,

300
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:52,100
or just stands, the fair analysis

301
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,110
of information risk is
another risk assessment

302
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:55,550
framework that can be brought

303
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:58,920
in to help you understand
how you can bring,

304
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:02,459
you can connect threats and
weaknesses in the current state.

305
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:05,570
So if you add was talking
about web apps, for example.

306
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:08,330
And so, there's attacker to a web app.

307
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:11,000
You've got vulnerabilities
in that app, say it's,

308
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,310
vulnerable to SQL injection.

309
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:13,180
Something really simple

310
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:16,599
that everybody knows
what could that do inside

311
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,070
of your organization and
what damage could be caused.

312
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:20,450
Could that become a pivot point

313
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:23,910
for someone to get into,
impact the integrity

314
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:25,839
of the data in your database, for example.

315
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,700
So you start using these
frameworks to help you think

316
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,740
in a sort of formalized way,

317
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:33,860
around how you bring threats
and weaknesses together,

318
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:36,930
and see where you want
to go ultimately too.

319
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:38,569
Because that's a really critical part.

320
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:41,500
Another framework that
some people use is CSF

321
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:45,530
and the NISTCSF, and then that
focuses a lot on the targets.

322
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:47,670
Because it can be very easy when

323
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:49,380
you're building architectures again

324
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,310
to sort of get lost in your own work.

325
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:52,849
And companies can kind of get lost

326
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:54,640
in where we are and what's happening

327
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:58,210
and forget that most importantly
is where you want to go.

328
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:01,800
So frameworks can really help
you with those target States.

329
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,790
They also help again
with that repeatability

330
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:06,740
that being able to
reproduce what you're doing

331
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:09,710
so that we get out of this manual loop

332
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:11,660
that that many times get happens

333
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,760
with cybersecurity
architecture, start getting

334
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,670
into a repeatable process
that you can do over and over.

335
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:20,640
And frameworks really helped
with the thinking around that.

336
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,473
And Ed, I don't know

337
00:14:21,473 --> 00:14:22,880
if you want to add anything on framework

338
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,310
cause I know you've done a
lot of work with them too.

339
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:27,180
- Yeah, I was just gonna say the one thing

340
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,209
that I think is kind of
helpful, at least it's helpful

341
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:31,750
to me is that when you think about risk.

342
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,710
It's impact times likelihood.

343
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:35,250
So like when you're kind of looking

344
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,070
at your architectural process

345
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:39,750
like how do you answer the
question about the impact?

346
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,330
Well, you need to understand kind of

347
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:43,060
your current environment, right.

348
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,630
In order to be able to do that.

349
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:46,350
And then how do you
understand the likelihood?

350
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:48,810
Well, you need to understand
the threat environment

351
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:49,925
in order to do that.

352
00:14:49,925 --> 00:14:51,390
And then you put them both together

353
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,260
and you plug it into,

354
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,319
whether you use a framework or
not, but you kind of plug it

355
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,220
into a risk assessment process
or risk analysis process.

356
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,250
And at the end of that, you
have kind of a risk-based view.

357
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:03,930
So, these kind of three things
that we're talking about

358
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:06,689
are kind of synergistic in the
way that they work together.

359
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:11,690
- Absolutely, and so onto
our first tool gap analysis.

360
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:13,969
- Yeah, absolutely.

361
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:15,460
So the first one,

362
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,533
so to try to understand the,

363
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:21,400
for doing that kind of gap analysis piece,

364
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,053
that we were talking about.

365
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,980
The Eramba tool.

366
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,711
So this is, this is advertised
as being open source.

367
00:15:28,711 --> 00:15:30,647
The only caveat to that is that,

368
00:15:30,647 --> 00:15:35,647
so for folks who are, real
kind of fire-breathing like,

369
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,420
open source people.

370
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,247
I happen to be one I'm on Linux right now.

371
00:15:39,247 --> 00:15:42,390
But if you're really in open source

372
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:47,390
like the license is not OSI
approved, but, but it is free.

373
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,000
And it does, the license
does give, some elements,

374
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:57,520
of what folks would consider
to be an open license to, it.

375
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:00,790
But really, what this is helpful to do

376
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:04,459
is to evaluate kind of doing
that baseline assessment.

377
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:06,210
You can use it from an effectiveness point

378
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:07,713
of view to understand kind of,

379
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:12,550
whether you have a given
countermeasure in place

380
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:14,780
you can use it from us,
from a maturity standpoint

381
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:17,980
to evaluate the maturity of
the supporting processes.

382
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:20,230
Really what it is, is
kind of a GRC platform.

383
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,970
- And one of the things that
we talked about was efficiency

384
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:27,040
and whether or not
you're spending too much

385
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,180
for control versus what
that control is giving you.

386
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:33,150
So looking at another gap
analysis tool that can help

387
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:36,579
with analytics is actually
the TCO tool itself

388
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,100
which is open source.

389
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:41,230
And it helps you model the
total course cost overall

390
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:43,260
of the ownership of that tool.

391
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,510
So that means, both what you're paying.

392
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:46,950
'Cause a lot of times it's like, well

393
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:51,280
the licensing fees are X, but
the actual care and feeding

394
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:55,089
of a tool may be extremely
or control can really add up.

395
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:57,930
I remember, way back
when Sims were very new.

396
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:00,449
And I worked at a vendor that had a SIM

397
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:04,800
that the cost of the SIM the
license costs, if that was X

398
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,700
the actual cost of implementation,

399
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:09,950
the total cost of owner
was 10 to 20 X per year.

400
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:11,859
Which if the company was getting that kind

401
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:14,310
of value out of the
tool, that's fantastic.

402
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,940
But it's a really good reminder

403
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:19,190
of how much that the licensing
doesn't cover everything.

404
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:21,480
You really also have to
think about the soft cost

405
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,140
of your resources and your people

406
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,730
and how they're interacting
with that control,

407
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:29,950
to get a real a real idea of
the total cost of ownership.

408
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:31,780
So a tool like this can really help

409
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:34,790
with that gap analysis on efficiency.

410
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:39,790
- Absolutely, yeah, this
is a tool I use a lot.

411
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:44,020
So we, there's a few
different tools out there

412
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:46,440
that do threat modeling and do it well.

413
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,900
So there's the, everybody knows

414
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,350
about the Microsoft threat modeling tool.

415
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:54,500
I personally like, the
OWASP Threat Dragon tool.

416
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,260
It's open source, it's the Apache license.

417
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:02,260
It's really good for
it's it's much simpler.

418
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,830
It has a lot less kind
of fancy shapes than

419
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,370
than the Microsoft tool does.

420
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:08,300
Not to ding on the Microsoft tool but,

421
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,925
it's kind of less fancy in the shapes,

422
00:18:10,925 --> 00:18:13,210
that it allows you to use.

423
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:17,113
But the workflow is
easy, it's simple to get,

424
00:18:18,341 --> 00:18:21,957
a model up and start
actually interacting with it.

425
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:24,890
And, assigning, looking at the threats

426
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:28,440
and working through,
stride analysis of it.

427
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,810
Creating a data flow diagram

428
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:32,149
if you've ever tried to do
this in like PowerPoint.

429
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:34,430
So people always say
why not use powerpoint.

430
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:35,420
If you're trying to do this,

431
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,870
it's really difficult
to do it in PowerPoint.

432
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:39,652
I think because, to do things like,

433
00:18:40,694 --> 00:18:43,710
the boundaries and, have the curve arrows

434
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:46,030
and like, I find that
to be difficult to do.

435
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:48,500
So this has some helpful automation.

436
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,180
It's not super heavyweight it's free.

437
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,803
So I just really liked
this particular tool.

438
00:18:53,803 --> 00:18:56,330
- Another tool for
threat modeling is Trike.

439
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:57,949
Coming out of MIT.

440
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:00,670
And this one is really nice
because it gives you the ability

441
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:03,010
to document who the actors are

442
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:05,850
and the data and how they
all interact together.

443
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:07,480
So it's a really nice compliment

444
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,560
to the kind of like to a dragon type tool.

445
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,750
- So I, and so it's MIT licensed for sure,

446
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,910
but it may not be MIT the school.

447
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:17,167
So just, one quick point.

448
00:19:17,167 --> 00:19:21,270
- Okay, (laughs)

449
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:24,840
- Speaking, of Fair, so the Fair,

450
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,649
so the open group has
a Fair specific tool.

451
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:30,270
So this one, I think
this may be the only one

452
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:32,250
that we're that's in this group.

453
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:35,180
But this one is not actually
open, like fully open source.

454
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:38,790
So this is a 90 day
evaluate valuation license

455
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:41,149
that you can obtain if you wanna use it

456
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:44,694
basically it allows you
to do probability based

457
00:19:44,694 --> 00:19:46,803
risk assessment, risk analysis.

458
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:52,360
To help you automate kind of, the process

459
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,439
that you would go through, from a Fair,

460
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,820
if you were gonna go through
kind of a Fair based exercise.

461
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:58,990
So there's things like,

462
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:01,440
Monte Carlo simulation
and whatnot, that's built

463
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,800
into this so that you can kind of,

464
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:07,530
get kind of like that, that
probabilistic view of it.

465
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:09,090
- Yeah, that's one of
the things I really like

466
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:10,899
about this is that you can play around

467
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,790
and change numbers so that
you can get different views

468
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:17,139
which is a really nice
thing for visualization.

469
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,600
- Great.
- Okay.

470
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,310
So now we're gonna move on
to the informational tools

471
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:22,490
and these are the tools that, again

472
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:24,630
these are the ones that
help you to gather and track

473
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:27,230
and analyze the information
that's in your environment.

474
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:28,250
So looking at things

475
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,820
like what your performance indicators are

476
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:34,629
what your risk indicators are,
and then a big problem that

477
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:37,030
you know, if you do any
security assessments,

478
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:38,370
one of the first questions is,

479
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,270
do people have an inventory?

480
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:42,120
So these are the tools
that can start helping you

481
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,760
get a handle on what's
in your organization

482
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,846
where the devices are, who the are

483
00:20:46,846 --> 00:20:51,040
where the licenses are and
where your data happens to be.

484
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,263
- Yeah, absolutely.

485
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:56,940
So you can really use these
metrics kind of anywhere

486
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,440
along the architecture process, right?

487
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,730
You can use it as part of
your current state assessment.

488
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:03,670
You can use it as you're
planning your future state.

489
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:06,670
You can use it to track the
implementation and obviously

490
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:09,650
to make sure that you're
successful at the end

491
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:11,383
but key performance indicators,
key risk indicators.

492
00:21:11,383 --> 00:21:14,500
You know, these are the
things that you're looking to

493
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,610
distill this information

494
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:17,409
down into so that you can keep track

495
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,540
- And of the tools there's Grafana

496
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:25,889
which is it's commercial
and community version.

497
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:28,660
But what, it's a dashboard.

498
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:31,100
So you can start to see graphs of

499
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:34,000
you can do number of different
graphs of almost anything.

500
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,270
But if you start using this

501
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:38,100
for operational metrics
that can help you report

502
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,092
out on where you are.

503
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,179
- Yeah, this is really good for, basically

504
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:47,810
tracking anything, and
dashboarding anything.

505
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:49,663
I mean, you could dashboard, your.

506
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,770
- Your energy use.

507
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,160
- Exactly your energy use

508
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,680
or anything like that,
you can put together.

509
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,600
So this is not a security
specific tool by any means

510
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,740
- But it is great for visualization.

511
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,260
- That's true.

512
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:04,330
The next one, this is kind of like,

513
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:06,639
this is going old school, right?

514
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,020
So this is an open source tool

515
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:11,139
for basically asset management,
inventory management.

516
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,530
So this allows you to inventory.

517
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:16,580
Anything can be hosts, can be
virtual machines, containers

518
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:20,660
data centers, people there is, you just

519
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,750
you can really just inventory

520
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,543
whatever what using this tool.

521
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:28,080
- And again, if you've got,
if you're not doing inventory

522
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,990
or organization, somebody needs
to be doing the inventory.

523
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:32,300
And this is really a step

524
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,120
up from the traditional spreadsheet.

525
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:37,040
That a lot of people don't
know Dan stripped spreadsheets

526
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:40,030
but they're not the best inventory tool.

527
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:41,750
So if you're ready to
graduate from something

528
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:44,620
but not ready to buy a certain
heavyweight inventory tool

529
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:46,633
that's a great option.

530
00:22:46,634 --> 00:22:48,846
- And then I know this, one's
your ballywick for sure.

531
00:22:48,846 --> 00:22:52,520
- Yeah, so yeah, so network management

532
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,540
and being able to get the view, right

533
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,770
when you're a network admin

534
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:57,560
you wanna know everything that's going on

535
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,490
all of your network, where are the, where

536
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:02,130
what what's not working, what is working.

537
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:05,020
And so, if you, again,
if you don't have the

538
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:06,540
if you want to use no concern tool

539
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:08,360
you don't have the money
for a commercial tool.

540
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,840
This is a fantastic option.

541
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,649
OpenNMS, and it'll help you

542
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:14,460
with looking at the data collection

543
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:17,360
understanding what devices you
have and what they're doing

544
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,490
and then reporting out on
how effective they are.

545
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:21,680
If you've got outages.

546
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:24,157
For example, if you've got
some really unusual activity

547
00:23:24,157 --> 00:23:26,820
in one part of the network

548
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:29,570
those tools are really great
way to start to hone in

549
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:32,129
on where those problems may
be or to just get reporting

550
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:34,393
and analysis on things are going well.

551
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,240
- Absolutely true.

552
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:39,430
All right, and then just from,

553
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:42,640
in terms of reference materials.

554
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,573
So one referenced material, that,

555
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:50,010
have just found handy is
the, CFS reference tool.

556
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:52,060
So this is just a public domain resource

557
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:54,720
from this that allows you to look up,

558
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,307
basically what's in the CSF,

559
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:00,700
so this is helpful because keep in mind

560
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:03,980
that the CSF has mapped to a
lot of other different things.

561
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:07,530
So it can be kind of a useful
cross crosswalk in that way.

562
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:10,810
And this can help support
your, your gap analysis

563
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:12,639
particularly when you've
got metrics coming in

564
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,300
you want to kind of sort those metrics

565
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:17,010
and understand how they
play into a product.

566
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:18,930
- Exactly, all right

567
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:22,870
So now we are onto the
documentation tools.

568
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:25,594
So looking at design and documentation

569
00:24:25,595 --> 00:24:27,370
and do you want to start with you?

570
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:30,280
We want to have a software
architecture description.

571
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,200
So the way that we like to say unit

572
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:36,030
just remember that you'll be
sad if you skip this step.

573
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:37,930
I know that there's this
real movement towards,

574
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:40,340
Oh it's dev ops and we're super agile

575
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:42,540
but that doesn't mean not to document

576
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:45,330
and really in the long
run, as much as it may feel

577
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:47,659
like a bit of an overhead
to do documentation.

578
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,190
And that's where we're
gonna give you some tools to

579
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:50,980
maybe help with that.

580
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:52,780
It really in the long run is one

581
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,310
of the best things that you can do

582
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:57,560
because you won't get lost
inside your own architecture.

583
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:00,070
You won't ask yourself
later, why did we not

584
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:02,649
have this control when an
assessor comes in and says

585
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:05,780
why do you not have this
really important control?

586
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:08,360
Well, if you've documented
why you decided to

587
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,949
have an exception and
not include that control

588
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:13,940
then it's because that's
gonna really back you up.

589
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:16,270
And it may, you may think,
but I won't forget that

590
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:18,490
but, it's really surprising how often

591
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:21,500
that people do forget
why decisions are made.

592
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,430
It may have been somebody

593
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:26,000
in a business unit that wanted
to override a recommendation.

594
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,830
So you wanna get this recommend.

595
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:30,199
You wanna get your documentation down,

596
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,710
and as you're doing your documentation,

597
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:33,620
some things to capture

598
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:36,010
and this is summarized,
from the TOGAF ADM.

599
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:38,770
As you wanna understand the
scope of what you're doing

600
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:41,670
with your architecture, the
goals and the objectives

601
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:44,170
the principles themselves, and
those principles are listed

602
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:49,140
in section 32.2.4 of TOGAF 9.2.

603
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:51,050
And then this is also where you come in

604
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,800
with your impact and
your transition phases.

605
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,225
So you start to get a handle really around

606
00:25:56,225 --> 00:25:59,610
what you're doing overall with the program

607
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:01,000
and also to remind yourself

608
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,640
as decision points are made

609
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,382
as you deploy out that architecture.

610
00:26:05,382 --> 00:26:06,490
- So just one thing to keep

611
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:08,310
in mind that we want to just hammer on.

612
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:12,850
32.2.3 is the, is where TOGAF,

613
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:15,490
the architecture description document is

614
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:18,430
but we really wanted to hammer
on the principles piece.

615
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:19,550
because a lot of people forget it.

616
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:20,860
And it's really important to.

617
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:24,669
So, if you go to that, those
two sections are useful.

618
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:26,960
If you wanna understand
kind of the TOGAF process.

619
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,890
- Yes, that's true, yeah, actually

620
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:31,370
all of the TOGAF, but yeah.

621
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:34,679
- Yeah, exactly, so great.

622
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,670
So from a modeling standpoint

623
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:38,550
there's a number of great resources.

624
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:42,379
We're just gonna run through
them generally speaking.

625
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:45,340
So I'm, I personally, I was

626
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,709
I started off as a developer, right?

627
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:48,150
So I'm kind of a UML guy.

628
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:50,856
I love UML and I use it
for all kinds of stuff

629
00:26:50,856 --> 00:26:54,010
but it's not by any
means your only option.

630
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:58,190
ArchieMate is kind of the
architectural modeling language

631
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:01,720
that TOGAF has and makes available.

632
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,940
So those are really kind of the two

633
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:05,520
that at least initially
we're gonna focus on

634
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,670
from a tool standpoint.

635
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:11,250
The first one being the, the Archie tool.

636
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:14,080
So the Archie tool is specifically created

637
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,560
for our teammate diagrams.

638
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:19,750
It's, a really good tool,
a really powerful tool.

639
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:23,350
The problem is the UI,
like the UI though, right?

640
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,250
Like what people would say nowadays.

641
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:27,300
So, the advice that I would give people

642
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,159
if you're going to use
Archie read the mag.

643
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:32,680
Like seriously RTFM because it's really,

644
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:35,150
I found, I personally at
least found it very difficult

645
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:37,877
to navigate the UI before
reading the manual.

646
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,960
So just understand that
if you're doing ArchieMate

647
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:45,610
the Archie tool is kind of
designed to do that diagram,

648
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:46,973
and modeling for you.

649
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,610
From a UML standpoint, though,

650
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:54,240
the tool that the open source tool

651
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,640
that I think has advantages is Modelio.

652
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,920
So modelio.org, opensource GPLv3

653
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:04,030
lets you it's really, it
lets you do ArchieMate.

654
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:06,879
It lets you do other
types of modeling too.

655
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,170
But we're at least in my opinion

656
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:09,993
where it really excels is with UML.

657
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:15,050
Now this one much like
the Archie tool is also

658
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:17,129
kind of a little bit of a beast from,

659
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:18,850
getting understanding how to use it

660
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:22,100
and kind of getting familiar
and conversant with it.

661
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:25,100
In this case though the
getting started tutorial

662
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:28,070
and there's, there's some
great written resources

663
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:30,939
and also some video
resources that are out there.

664
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:33,360
Are really good for kind
of just getting up to speed

665
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,919
and kind of figuring out
where you are in the UI

666
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,070
and how to get started.

667
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:41,100
- And this next one is about mind mapping.

668
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:43,669
And I have to say that
I, I sort of went kicking

669
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:45,500
and screaming into doing mind mapping.

670
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:48,360
Cause at first I was like, is it just some

671
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,919
like another annoying
way for people to think

672
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,640
that they're like
looking cool or whatever.

673
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,360
But Mind map is actually a, really helpful

674
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,580
especially when you're trying
to get security requirements

675
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:01,870
from a number of stakeholders
across an organization

676
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:04,209
because you can start
just with brainstorming

677
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:05,690
and you start to see patterns

678
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:08,600
and interconnections will begin to appear

679
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,980
as you use a mind mapping tool.

680
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:11,700
So if you've been a little bit resistant

681
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:12,870
like I was, I don't know.

682
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:15,250
And I don't think you were
resistant about mind mapping.

683
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:16,083
I do have to say

684
00:29:16,083 --> 00:29:18,020
that when you're looking
at doing architecture

685
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:20,740
and especially as you're
gathering security requirements

686
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:23,370
mind maps can actually be, very helpful.

687
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:26,409
And this one is a nice free
tool to be able to do that.

688
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:27,337
I don't know what, what's your experience

689
00:29:27,337 --> 00:29:29,190
with mind mapping Ed?

690
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:30,450
- Yeah, I mean, I use it a lot.

691
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:31,570
I use it for,

692
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:35,320
in particular to understand
kind of like the scope of stuff.

693
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,919
Cause you know what I like about

694
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:39,290
so I was latecomer to, mapping tool.

695
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:41,260
But what I like about it is you can just,

696
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:43,110
you can put stuff on there

697
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:45,320
and then drag it and
reorganize it as you want.

698
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,790
So you can move a whole tree's worth

699
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:50,760
of a drill down and
kind of one fell swoop.

700
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,580
So it's really helpful when
you need to move data around

701
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,943
or, move items around quickly.

702
00:29:56,890 --> 00:29:58,380
- Yeah, and especially
when there are a lot of

703
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,963
you have so many ideas too

704
00:29:59,963 --> 00:30:02,460
like sometimes until you
started to put them down

705
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:03,730
and you don't start to see

706
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:06,470
that the grouping and
people will start throwing,

707
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:08,010
well we need this, we need that.

708
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:11,362
And then yeah a mind map
can really help with that.

709
00:30:11,362 --> 00:30:12,195
That grouping, especially as you noted.

710
00:30:12,195 --> 00:30:13,028
Cause you can do that sort

711
00:30:13,028 --> 00:30:16,120
of automatic re calking
when you add something

712
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,875
to a different group.

713
00:30:17,875 --> 00:30:19,670
- Okay, and yeah, absolutely true.

714
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:21,730
And this one's a little
bit of a specialized one.

715
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:24,720
So Osate or Osate2, I guess I should say.

716
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,760
So this tool, is a great tool

717
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:32,370
for the specific purpose of
embedded systems modeling.

718
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:34,260
So this is kind of like a, you'll know it

719
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,870
if you need a tool like that,

720
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:38,221
you will know that you
need ia tool like that.

721
00:30:38,221 --> 00:30:42,230
But, we want it to mention it because

722
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:45,150
for the specific purpose of
embedded systems modeling

723
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:46,610
for those folks who have to do that, like,

724
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:49,562
if you're working in
robotics or IOT, for example.

725
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:52,410
This can be an excellent tool to help you

726
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:54,399
help you develop that.

727
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:56,520
- And again, it's a great
point about, what this is

728
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:59,450
about building your toolbox
or trying to give you a number

729
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:01,320
of really good tools that we've used

730
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,659
that we've found helpful but your toolbox

731
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,020
is gonna be unique to you.

732
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:07,700
Because remember you're
the most important tool

733
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:08,533
in your toolbox.

734
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,439
You', the tool or the towels.

735
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:14,570
So remember that, as
you're going through this

736
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:16,730
and thinking about this
afterwards, about which

737
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:18,610
what does your toolbox look like

738
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:20,899
for your security architectures?

739
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,560
So bringing this all together

740
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,560
we really would like to underscore that

741
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:28,350
being able to visualize what you're doing

742
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:31,590
and finding tools that can help
you collaborate with others,

743
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:35,020
will really helped to lift
out of that very, very manual.

744
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:38,160
Very one-off kind of security
architecture approach

745
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:41,970
and to something that's
going to be more repeatable.

746
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:45,340
- Absolutely, And these
are the tools, that we use.

747
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:48,820
I mean, keep in mind that the
best tool is the one that fits

748
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:51,280
into your process, and knows like

749
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,430
so for example, if I'm,

750
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:54,420
when I'm doing security architecture work,

751
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:57,610
I use a very heavily modified
most of the time version

752
00:31:57,610 --> 00:32:00,483
of, the TOGAF process.

753
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:04,550
But that's not to say
that you have to do that.

754
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:06,837
If you have a different
approach that works for you

755
00:32:06,837 --> 00:32:10,620
like, maybe you're more into
SABSA right than you are TOGAF

756
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:11,453
or what have you.

757
00:32:11,453 --> 00:32:13,889
Like basically look for the tools

758
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:14,730
whether they're these

759
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:17,210
or others that kind of
fold into your process

760
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:20,475
and that best support what
it is you can try to do.

761
00:32:20,475 --> 00:32:22,538
- And don't forget the core principles

762
00:32:22,538 --> 00:32:25,840
remember to be adaptable and
to be a little bit flexible

763
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,820
as you go along the process of building

764
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,730
out a security architecture,
especially when

765
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:32,720
you have a number of stakeholders,
there may be compromises

766
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,300
there may be areas where you have to bend

767
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:37,460
or flex a little bit and that's okay.

768
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:40,270
And some of these modeling
tools can be really helpful

769
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:41,560
for you to understand.

770
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,830
Well, if we make this change

771
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:45,020
what's the impact over
here in another part

772
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:48,960
of the architecture, another
part of the organization.

773
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,043
- Absolutely true, absolutely true.

774
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:55,710
- So how can people apply,
what they learned today?

775
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:59,220
- Yeah, so I think, a good way to start.

776
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:02,511
Would be to look at what you're doing now

777
00:33:02,511 --> 00:33:05,610
from a security architecture,
planning standpoint

778
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:07,379
find those inefficiencies, just look

779
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:09,960
at it the way that you would,
any other kind of process.

780
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:14,090
And then, think through, how
can you improve that process,

781
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:15,550
both procedurally but then also

782
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:18,710
how can you help to automate
it using these types of tools?

783
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:23,710
And then , as you start, to
figure out where you can grow

784
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:26,620
and how you can improve, then,

785
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:28,040
kind of build on that baseline

786
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,050
and look for additional
free tools out there.

787
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:32,620
Or commercial tools or what have you.

788
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:36,290
And then really most importantly,
like kind of over time

789
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:39,270
collect out the metrics that
you need to be able to measure

790
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:41,980
not only how, your designs fare

791
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:44,210
once you push them into production,

792
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:48,250
but also how your architecture
process itself performs.

793
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:51,280
How can you improve the
way that the reliability

794
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:54,450
the maturity, the resiliency

795
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:56,610
of the architecture process itself

796
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:58,240
and, keeping these Metametrics

797
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,800
that's really important too, right?

798
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,600
Understanding how long it
takes you to put together

799
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,610
your documentation, for example,
how can it be streamlined?

800
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:07,899
So these are things that not
everybody always looks at

801
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:10,530
but it, it can behoove you to.

802
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:13,429
- Yeah, and architecture is
not a point in time activity.

803
00:34:13,429 --> 00:34:18,190
It's really, it's, an ongoing
journey of optimization.

804
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:20,330
And that's, again, as you
know, Ed was pointing out

805
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:23,560
once you start building more
automation and you can find

806
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:26,250
that that optimization
gets easier and easier.

807
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:28,639
And you can bring the lessons of the past,

808
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:31,069
looking at a lot of
companies who got caught out,

809
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:33,050
for example 'cause they
had these sort of older

810
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:36,449
brittle architectures from a decade ago.

811
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:40,230
When suddenly especially
for VPN deployments,

812
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:44,110
when they had to start working
remotely entirely after COVID

813
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:46,060
they had to just completely rethink.

814
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:49,230
Whereas when you're in this
ongoing optimization approach

815
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:53,300
to, your architecture you're
not only able to stay ahead

816
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,820
of some of these trends
before they catch you out.

817
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:58,522
But you also can learn from the past.

818
00:34:58,522 --> 00:35:02,299
So with that, we wanna thank
you so much for listening

819
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:05,300
to this talk as promised,
here are the references

820
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,320
all the tools that we talked about.

821
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,600
And all of the links to get to the tools

822
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,732
are here on this slide.

823
00:35:13,956 --> 00:35:14,789
- Thank you so much.

824
00:35:14,789 --> 00:35:16,580
- So thank you so much
for listening to us.

825
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:17,509
Thank you, Ed.
- Thank you.

826
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:21,630
- For presenting with me
and we'll see you next time.
