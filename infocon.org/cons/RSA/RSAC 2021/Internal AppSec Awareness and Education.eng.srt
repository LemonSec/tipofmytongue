1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,569
- I'd like to welcome you to
the AppSec Village Sandbox,

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:05,680
AppSec Village is a
volunteer run community

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,520
that creates AppSec content for everyone

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:08,743
at various conferences.

5
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:12,129
Today we're really excited
to have brought three leaders

6
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:13,410
to talk about introducing,

7
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,820
or including the rest of your organization

8
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,970
in your AppSec process.

9
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:19,919
Each of our speakers will
share their ideas with you

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,520
in a seven minute lightning talk,

11
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,740
please feel free to drop your questions

12
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:25,209
at any time into the chat.

13
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:27,890
I will be collecting them for the Q and A,

14
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:31,380
which will happen after all of
the speakers have presented.

15
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,760
Our first speaker is Marisa Fagan.

16
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,920
Marisa is the head of
security at Atlassian

17
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,770
where she runs the program responsible

18
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:41,470
for application security
training, security champions

19
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:42,970
and security culture.

20
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:46,680
Yes, these programs do rely
heavily on JIRA and confluence.

21
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,540
Previously, she has built similar programs

22
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:50,600
at Synopsis and at Salesforce.

23
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,960
She will be presenting building,

24
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,510
a verifiable application
security training program.

25
00:00:57,609 --> 00:01:00,110
- Hello everyone, I'm Marisa Fagan,

26
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:02,800
Head of Security Awareness at Atlassian,

27
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,379
in my career I have built,

28
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:06,330
application security training programs

29
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:07,880
in at least three different companies.

30
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:10,449
And I've seen the before,
and the after effects

31
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:11,750
of each of them.

32
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:12,960
Today, I'd like to share with you,

33
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,679
my lessons learned the hard way

34
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,143
so that you can consider
those things from the start.

35
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,000
Okay, first, let's
level set on what I mean

36
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,080
by an application
security training program.

37
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,399
Since it's Thursday of
RSA conference week,

38
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,410
by now you've probably heard a lot about

39
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:33,130
this idea of shifting left for security

40
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:35,570
in the software development life cycle.

41
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:38,009
This is the practice of weaving security

42
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:40,703
into every step of the
software development.

43
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,920
In theory, the earliest
you can add security in

44
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,720
is before the development has even begun.

45
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,083
This is that shifting
left in the timeline.

46
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:52,640
This is one of the most common places

47
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,920
to add security training

48
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,850
with the idea that the developer

49
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:58,449
will learn a paranoid mindset,

50
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:01,880
and have the knowledge of what
vulnerabilities look like,

51
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,119
and therefore try to avoid them,

52
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,613
at least the obvious ones.

53
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,360
Since you can't measure
something that doesn't happen,

54
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,650
the effectiveness of a
security training program

55
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:14,560
is often measured by capturing

56
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,810
whether knowledge has been delivered

57
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:19,270
through quizzes and surveys,

58
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:22,910
and sort of capturing the delivery side

59
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,109
of the training program.

60
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:28,070
But this is only one part
of a complete balanced

61
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:31,340
secure software development
life cycle program.

62
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,350
So let's get into it.

63
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:36,250
The first lesson I learned the
hard way is a tactical one,

64
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:39,740
make sure that your training
platform has the standard

65
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:43,460
learning management system
functionalities from the start.

66
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,440
You will most likely be buying something

67
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,440
and the platform you want has
a mature set of admin tools

68
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:54,170
like enrolling students,
tracking performance,

69
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:58,130
sending reminders out and
generating progress reports

70
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:01,460
for managers without
making your life harder

71
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:04,183
and doing a bunch of manual tabulations.

72
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:07,950
Some vendors are definitely
better than others at this,

73
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:11,720
and if you're in love
with a training course

74
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,500
but they don't have any
of these admin functions

75
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,230
then you at least need to make sure

76
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:19,030
that they have a proven
ability to integrate

77
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:21,070
with one of the standard LMS

78
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:24,343
that you will have to purchase separately.

79
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:28,520
The one thing that might come
up is it could be difficult

80
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,760
to identify in the system
who is actually a developer.

81
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,250
Sometimes titles are not obvious,

82
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:38,760
being able to carve up that
HR data by team manager role

83
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,363
is going to save you a lot
of time in the long run.

84
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:45,370
Okay, secondly, customize the content

85
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:47,080
to your security risks.

86
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,330
You absolutely should not
just deliver a training course

87
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:53,280
that you bought off the shelf
without analyzing first,

88
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,760
what are the most common
vulnerabilities that you see

89
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,700
in your own organization,
and then verifying

90
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,929
that the course actually
addresses those issues.

91
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:05,380
And only those issues
don't train about swift

92
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,440
if you don't have a mobile app,

93
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,930
do not waste developers time,

94
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,480
only train about the essentials.

95
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,910
And if you are, if your
training is not interactive

96
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:18,050
and hands-on, and lab
like, then this is an area

97
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,850
that you also need to do
some customization in.

98
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:23,880
It's better to buy an
interactive dynamic course

99
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,150
from the start than trying
to build it yourself.

100
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:27,620
And there are companies out there

101
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,720
that are delivering
some really cool things.

102
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,820
So take the time to get to know

103
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,540
all of the vendors in the space,

104
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:37,750
and find the one that has the
fanciest bells and whistles.

105
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,570
It's really gonna pay
off for your audience.

106
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:44,130
Thirdly, set up mandatory baseline course

107
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:46,790
that all developers must take first,

108
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,530
and then go deeper with developers

109
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:51,609
who are interested optionally later.

110
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:55,300
Okay, so first part set a
mandatory baseline course.

111
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,550
This is the course that you spend

112
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:59,120
all of that time customizing
for your environment.

113
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,100
Many companies don't have
any single mandatory course

114
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,160
for developers, and they should make sure

115
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,140
that they don't have a
compliance requirement

116
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,200
and a customer expectation that
they're skating by on here.

117
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,200
This could come back to haunt you later.

118
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:18,030
But maybe you're just
interested in the second part,

119
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,460
going deeper with developers

120
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:23,010
who are interested in secure coding.

121
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:25,750
I have a couple of ideas for you here.

122
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:28,340
This could be part of a leveling up system

123
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:31,520
or a belt system where
there's a learning path

124
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,010
and you go deeper and
deeper down the rabbit hole

125
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:36,593
with more courses to self-learn with.

126
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:41,380
Or maybe you have a vulnerable
web application CTF.

127
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,740
Those can be really fun events

128
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:45,300
that get people really
excited about security,

129
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,820
or maybe it's a workshop, or a brown bag,

130
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,089
or a learning lab hosted by
the product security team,

131
00:05:50,089 --> 00:05:52,770
once in a while to not only get people

132
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:54,620
excited about security,

133
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,170
but introduce the product security team

134
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:00,530
putting a face with a
name, that sort of thing.

135
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:04,520
All good things to do to
really foster the people

136
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,630
that are interested in
excited about secure coding,

137
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:09,469
once you've got your baseline set.

138
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:12,540
Okay fourth thing, fourth
lesson I learned the hard way

139
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:15,290
is to partner with the
security champions group

140
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:16,740
early and often.

141
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,214
The security champions
should be that focus group

142
00:06:19,214 --> 00:06:21,630
that you interview for requirements,

143
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:24,659
the pilot group that you
test the trainings with,

144
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,860
and that street team to get the word out,

145
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,950
once the training is ready to go.

146
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:31,310
I won't say anything more
here about security champions

147
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:34,850
because Nikki is going to go
there in great detail next

148
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:37,643
but they really are the key to everything.

149
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,873
And that's it.

150
00:06:39,873 --> 00:06:42,000
Those are the four things
that I learned the hard way,

151
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,711
that could have saved me
a lot of time and pain,

152
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:45,970
if I had known from the start.

153
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:48,350
The application security
training program is a great way

154
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:51,390
to insert a positive proactive touch point

155
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:54,770
into your secure SDLC,
and if done correctly

156
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:56,870
you've shifted left with
your security program,

157
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:59,170
and started the journey
off on the right foot.

158
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:01,120
Now you're ready for the next phase

159
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,010
which is weaving just-in-time
security training

160
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:07,030
into every activity in
the software security

161
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:10,969
software development life
cycle using the same lessons.

162
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:12,780
Learning is a never ending journey,

163
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,330
and building a verifiable,

164
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:16,050
application security training program

165
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:18,673
is a never ending effort
as well, good luck.

166
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,940
- Thanks Marissa for getting us started

167
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:27,173
so that we can build amazing teams.

168
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,880
Next we're gonna hear from Nikki Brandt.

169
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,200
Nikki leads part of Slack's
Product Security Organization

170
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,171
where her team has spent
years working on building out

171
00:07:36,171 --> 00:07:37,980
a network of security champions.

172
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:41,390
She will be presenting simple
suggestions for spinning up

173
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:44,340
your first security champions program.

174
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,239
Once again, just feel free to
drop any questions you have

175
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,540
in the chat, and we will
gather them up later.

176
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:54,210
- Thank you so much for
the introduction, Tiffany.

177
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:55,810
I'm so excited to talk with you all

178
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,550
about security champion programs

179
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:00,500
and tell you a little bit about
what we've learned at Slack

180
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,270
from developing, launching,
and running our program

181
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:06,010
for a little more background
info for anyone on this call

182
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:08,480
who's not already familiar
with security champions.

183
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,740
I'm not gonna go into depth about

184
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,080
what a security champions program is,

185
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,080
but you can consider any program designed

186
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,050
to deputize engineers in your company

187
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:20,410
to act as agents of the
security organization

188
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:22,880
to be a security champions program.

189
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,000
We've been working towards
the Security Champions Program

190
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,250
at Slack for over two years at this point,

191
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:32,250
and we just launched our biggest
cohort ever this quarter.

192
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:34,640
Looking back across all of
the work that we've done

193
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,409
on security champions and
everything that we've tried,

194
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:39,780
I have five pieces of advice
that I'd give to someone

195
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:42,112
who was starting a new
program from scratch.

196
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:46,230
The first one surrounds
who you're going to get

197
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:48,470
to be your security champions.

198
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:49,930
Eventually you're gonna get to a point

199
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,300
where you don't have a lot of people

200
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,020
who really wanna be security champions,

201
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:55,490
and maybe you'll have to
volunteer some of them.

202
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:58,180
But when you're first starting
out for your first cohort,

203
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,260
I strongly encourage you

204
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:02,240
to solicit volunteers where possible.

205
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,580
Starting with a group of people

206
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,820
who are excited to learn about security,

207
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,060
excited to work with the security team

208
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,569
means that you're gonna get
people who are gonna come

209
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:11,590
to your trainings, who
are gonna actually listen

210
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:12,423
to what you're saying.

211
00:09:12,423 --> 00:09:15,220
Who are gonna do any take
homework that you give them.

212
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,570
So start with those volunteers.

213
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:19,440
The second piece of advice,

214
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,300
is to be really specific
and really limited

215
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,300
in what you are expecting
your security champions to do

216
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,660
for the security organization.

217
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:31,030
So suppose you found some volunteers

218
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,980
who wanna be security champions,

219
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:35,350
the next thing that those
people are gonna have to do

220
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:37,500
after they say, yay, I wanna do it,

221
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,410
is they're gonna have to
talk to their managers

222
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:41,189
and they're going to have
to convince their managers

223
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:42,690
that this is an opportunity

224
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:45,620
that the team should
provide resources for.

225
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:48,630
You can prepare those volunteers
to have that conversation

226
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:51,100
by figuring out exactly
what it is you want them

227
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,990
to do for you, both in onboarding

228
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:55,010
and after the onboarding program,

229
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:58,050
and how much time those
things are going to take.

230
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:00,479
You need to identify what the tasks are

231
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,290
that you really need your
security champions to do,

232
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:04,723
and then you need to
figure out how much time

233
00:10:04,724 --> 00:10:07,793
that's gonna take, and that's
your whole set of asks.

234
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:11,490
At Slack, we ask for two hours a week

235
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:13,490
of a security champions working hours,

236
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:16,070
and we publish a really
limited set of tasks

237
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:19,000
that we expect them to do in that time.

238
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,490
And that's two hours for onboarding,

239
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:22,453
and two hours once onboarding is over.

240
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:27,100
My third piece of advice
is to build in incentives.

241
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:30,410
Again, there's gonna be
some sort of arrangement

242
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:31,860
between the engineer and their manager

243
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:35,910
to let them participate, and
having incentives codified,

244
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:37,250
and identified ahead of time

245
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,730
can make that a much
smoother conversation.

246
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:43,280
You should look to have
at least one incentive

247
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,500
that will appeal to managers

248
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,380
and at least one incentive
that it'll appeal to engineers,

249
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,090
and get more people
interested in your program.

250
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:54,140
Some examples of incentives
that we've tried out at Slack

251
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:56,180
on the sort of appealing
to managers front,

252
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:58,900
we commit that for every
security champion we have,

253
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,990
we will provide at least one piece

254
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:03,630
of significant written
feedback for them per quarter,

255
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:06,250
about their participation in the program.

256
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,810
And on the champion level themselves,

257
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:11,449
we allow champions who
make it through onboarding

258
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:13,800
to pick out one security book

259
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,900
that we then send them for free.

260
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:19,900
So build an incentives
at two separate levels.

261
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:23,050
So at this point, hopefully
you have a couple of volunteers

262
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:25,060
and you've got them committed,

263
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,920
what do you do with them now?

264
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,130
This might actually be
the spiciest suggestion

265
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:30,510
on my slide.

266
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:32,230
I think that you should really focus

267
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:34,540
on basic enablement for your champions,

268
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:37,579
and do not try to make
every security champion

269
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,750
a security expert.

270
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,860
Your team, are the security experts.

271
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:44,590
Champion doesn't
necessarily need to be that.

272
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:47,050
My team has explicitly designed
a program in such a way

273
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:49,280
that our champions can be
successful at the tasks

274
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,459
we've set for them,

275
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,970
without a deep level
of security expertise.

276
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:55,860
So like one of our specific asks,

277
00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:00,080
is that when a champions team
is introducing a new feature,

278
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,860
they work with us to
complete a threat model

279
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,210
for that feature.

280
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:05,620
In order for champions, to
be able to meet that ask

281
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:08,050
we don't need to teach them
the intricacies of Burp,

282
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:10,780
or the specific types of XSS.

283
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:13,130
We just need to teach them
how to think about threats

284
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:15,880
so that's what our education focuses on.

285
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,870
Whatever your core tasks are,

286
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,490
you should align your
onboarding and training

287
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:22,163
for security champions to
focus on getting them all up

288
00:12:22,163 --> 00:12:24,350
to that same bar,

289
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:26,520
whether or not they're deeply
interested in security,

290
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,530
whether or not they're
deeply technically engaged

291
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:31,893
with the content get them
all up to that same low bar,

292
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,160
and then the last piece
of advice comes in.

293
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,400
Offer extracurricular opportunities

294
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,630
after your onboarding program
for security champions

295
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:44,083
who are really interested in the content.

296
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:49,160
In any cohort we find, we have
at least a couple of people

297
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:52,310
who are there because they're
really interested in security

298
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:54,329
and they wanna spend time
with the security team

299
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:56,020
learning what we do.

300
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:59,829
Inviting them to team
activities, such as bug bashes,

301
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:02,100
or code jams is a great
way to get them involved

302
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,310
and help them feel like they're trying out

303
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:06,439
being a security engineer.

304
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,680
As Marissa mentioned,
it's great to have them

305
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,050
as your first audience

306
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:12,880
for trying out new processes or tools,

307
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,100
looking at tech specs for
projects your team's gonna do,

308
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,700
all those things can help keep

309
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,780
your security champions involved

310
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,433
after that initial onboarding.

311
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:25,560
And having them involved
after your initial onboarding,

312
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,550
means that building out your next cohort,

313
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:29,500
and getting other people
in the organization

314
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,750
to hear about your program,

315
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,713
is gonna be that much easier.

316
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,449
So once again, my five pieces
of advice from the top,

317
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:38,240
if you're starting from scratch,

318
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,110
start with volunteers for
your security champions,

319
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:42,640
be really specific and limited

320
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,980
in what you're asking them
to do as security champions.

321
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,670
Build in incentives that make them,

322
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:50,560
and their managers want
them to work with you.

323
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,969
Focus on enabling all of them
to do the set of specific

324
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:56,360
and limited S that you identified,

325
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,010
and then keep them engaged afterwards

326
00:13:58,010 --> 00:13:59,800
with extracurricular opportunities,

327
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,170
like invitations to bug bashes

328
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:04,819
events at Hacktober et cetera.

329
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:05,653
And that's it,

330
00:14:05,653 --> 00:14:07,840
good luck with the
security champions program.

331
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:10,310
- Thanks so much for teaching us

332
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:12,310
about security champions Nikki.

333
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,439
Our final speaker is Tom Hudson.

334
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,530
Tom is a security researcher at Detectify,

335
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:18,680
and he spent years working
as a technical trainer

336
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,020
teaching recent graduates about security.

337
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:25,090
He also builds tools and tutorials
for the hacker community.

338
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:26,090
Tom will be presenting,

339
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:28,610
teaching security training for beginners.

340
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:30,680
Once again, please drop all
your questions in the chat

341
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,979
and I'll gather them up
for the Q and A after.

342
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:35,240
- Thank you, Tiffany.

343
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,973
So yeah, my name is Tom.

344
00:14:38,135 --> 00:14:39,610
A few years ago, I found myself tasked

345
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:42,830
with training a group of
20 or so recent graduates.

346
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:44,520
The idea was I had about eight weeks

347
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,140
to get them on their way to
being software engineers,

348
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,699
just on their way, of course.

349
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:51,430
It wasn't a bootcamp, it
was an apprenticeship skim,

350
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:53,099
no one was expecting them to be,

351
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,120
you know off writing
software all by themselves,

352
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,230
or anything like that.

353
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,760
Just to be at the point
that they could join

354
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,240
a small software team, and
start to pick things up

355
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,460
as they worked on simpler tasks.

356
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,100
Something that I think
is worth mentioning,

357
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,460
is that not all of them,

358
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,980
in fact, most of them have not graduated

359
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,870
in software engineering related degrees.

360
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,440
We're gonna have a way to accept people

361
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,290
from different backgrounds.

362
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:16,280
We just needed them to be
enthusiastic about technology,

363
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,699
and of course we needed them
to be willing to learn too.

364
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,500
I've always been at least
a little bit interested

365
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,193
in security, so I knew right away,

366
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,790
a little bit of security
was gonna be important.

367
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:30,329
How to write secure
code was the main thing.

368
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:32,340
But knowing a little bit
about how to break things

369
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,640
I think would be good too.

370
00:15:34,621 --> 00:15:36,350
It turns out there was a
little bit of a problem

371
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:38,620
teaching security to absolute beginners.

372
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,120
If you don't know how it works yet,

373
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,330
like what JavaScript is and what it does?

374
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:46,380
Or what SQL databases, it's
really hard to grasp exactly

375
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:49,930
why vulnerabilities happen,
being taught how to prevent them

376
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:52,760
really just feels like being
taught a long list of rules

377
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:56,580
you have to follow with
no indication as to why.

378
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,860
And I think that was one of the things

379
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,860
I really disliked about school.

380
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:03,260
Being told to follow rules
without knowing why they existed.

381
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:05,600
I don't mean like don't run with scissors.

382
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,150
I mean like these are the
rules you have to follow

383
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:10,420
to solve this equation,
or these are the steps

384
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:13,410
to make the computer do this
thing that the curriculum says

385
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:15,260
that we have to teach you.

386
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:18,230
I always want to know
why it really existed.

387
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:20,190
What would happen if it wasn't followed.

388
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:22,210
Cause I think it's a
lot easier to remember

389
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:24,573
to follow the rules if
you know why they exist.

390
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:28,050
I eventually think I hit
upon a reasonable process

391
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:29,740
to teach these things well enough,

392
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:32,910
which is to tell a story, you know,

393
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,730
talk about how things were before

394
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:37,000
the thing you're teaching about existed.

395
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,480
What was the world like before that

396
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,130
and what problems do people have

397
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:42,150
because this thing didn't exist?

398
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:44,610
And talk about how the
problems were solved,

399
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:46,920
what things did we invent to solve them?

400
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:50,449
But the whole time,
explain how things work.

401
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:52,560
I think having an understanding
of how things work

402
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,969
is one of the best ways to be able

403
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:56,310
to reason about stuff for yourself.

404
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:58,660
It doesn't have to be
an excruciating detail

405
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,319
but I think you really need to make sure

406
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,180
that you always hit on upon all
the moving parts of a system

407
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,800
and how they interact.

408
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,680
I might be a little bit
abstract advice wise.

409
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,400
So I think it'd be a good idea

410
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,400
if I give you a slightly
more concrete example.

411
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,050
So early on in our training
after we'd been writing

412
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:18,690
some simple games with
JavaScript in the browser,

413
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:21,126
we moved on to writing server side stuff.

414
00:17:21,126 --> 00:17:23,393
I think it was with no
JS but with what it is,

415
00:17:23,393 --> 00:17:25,410
it doesn't really matter.

416
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:27,480
And the plan was to quite
quickly get to talking

417
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,120
about SQL databases with a SQL injection.

418
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,429
But before we got to that,

419
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:35,200
I pretty quickly found out
a lot of people struggled

420
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,780
at least a little bit with the distinction

421
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:40,399
between things being client
side, or server side.

422
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,030
So I talked about the old web.

423
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:45,740
The web 1.0 or the way you wanna call it.

424
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:48,630
But when the vast majority
of the web was static.

425
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:51,310
So it's about the limitations
of this static web

426
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,710
where you couldn't easily have things

427
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:54,970
we take for granted like blog comments,

428
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:58,090
although back then really
it was a guest book.

429
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:00,689
But at least without being
some kind of Pearl guru

430
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:03,563
and knowing about this
dark magic called CGI.

431
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:07,060
I talked about the gradual
introduction of technologies

432
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,710
like PHP and cheap shared hosting.

433
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:13,010
It lowered the barrier for
entry to server-side programming

434
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:15,650
things that let you do
like storing data in files

435
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:17,930
on the server, or where
that got more difficult

436
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,890
to manage using a database.

437
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,617
We talked about why database existed,

438
00:18:22,617 --> 00:18:24,330
how the data was organized in them,

439
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:27,770
how you could talk to them
to get information you wanted

440
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:29,833
with this query language.

441
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,100
But once they all had a
mental model for what client

442
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,580
and server side applications
and databases were,

443
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,610
and how the three of them interact

444
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:40,439
with user data coming from
the client side application,

445
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,080
being processed by the
server side application,

446
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,230
and ultimately being used
to query a database somehow.

447
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:47,680
We had everything in place to be able

448
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:51,100
to actually discuss
SQL injection properly.

449
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,679
That might seem a little bit excessive

450
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,240
to start answering the question

451
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,700
what is SQL injection with?

452
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,970
Well back in the nineties,

453
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,250
but you'd be surprised how
much history you can cover

454
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:02,150
in just 10 minutes or so.

455
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:04,930
And I distinctly remember
when I first wrote some code

456
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:06,530
that query the database.

457
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:09,590
I think the advice I received
was sensitize your inputs,

458
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:11,486
otherwise SQL injection will happen.

459
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:13,880
And I was mostly left to fend for myself.

460
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,550
And I never really felt
like enough for me.

461
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:18,159
No one told me exactly

462
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,430
why that would be an especially bad thing,

463
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:24,123
or even what good enough
sanitation actually was.

464
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,700
In security we talk a
lot about establishing

465
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,300
the root cause of things.

466
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,129
And when you teach only
about the solutions

467
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:33,510
it's pretty easy to accidentally label

468
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:36,780
the lack of that solution
as the root cause.

469
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:39,300
Like the root cause of SQL
injection vulnerability

470
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:42,190
is you haven't sensitized
your inputs correctly.

471
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:43,890
You didn't follow the
rule that we taught you

472
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:45,710
and that that's the problem.

473
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:47,220
If you learn how things work

474
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,110
and how the moving parts fit together,

475
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:50,290
you're in a much better position

476
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:52,580
to understand the real root cause.

477
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,689
I think on some level
I kinda knew the code

478
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:57,240
I wrote years ago was sending the SQL

479
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,277
I'd written to a database server

480
00:19:58,277 --> 00:20:01,750
but I didn't really think about
it clearly and deliberately.

481
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:04,570
Like many junior developers,
I think I just wrote the code,

482
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:07,950
and if it did what I wanted,
and that was good enough.

483
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:11,150
But if you know that this
query you've put together

484
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:13,390
sent to the database
server all in one chunk,

485
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:15,360
and how the moving parts fit together

486
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,860
becomes easy to understand
that the database servers,

487
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,709
no way of knowing which bit of the query

488
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:21,610
you as the developer wrote,

489
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:23,479
and which parts came from the user.

490
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:27,105
No amount of calling my SQL
real escape strings gonna help

491
00:20:27,105 --> 00:20:29,400
with that fundamental problem.

492
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,825
And there's always gonna be
those possible edge cases

493
00:20:31,825 --> 00:20:33,000
that slipped through the net.

494
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,240
But knowing this and how things work,

495
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,180
makes the solution of prepared statements

496
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:41,220
or parameterized queries make sense,

497
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,160
give the database these
two pieces of information

498
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,540
in two steps.

499
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:45,940
First, the query you wrote,

500
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,710
and second, the data that came the user,

501
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:50,320
and that lets the database now for sure

502
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,463
which part is which and never
get confused between the two.

503
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:57,720
When it comes to security,
you wanna teach both sides,

504
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,700
red and blue, or offensive
and defensive way

505
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,803
if you wanna call it.

506
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:04,010
We didn't just talk about
prepared statements,

507
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:07,220
we talked about SQL
injection payloads too.

508
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:09,410
Although again, it wasn't just

509
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:11,950
here's a SQL polygon you can try,

510
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:14,490
or run SQL map, or whatever it was.

511
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:16,870
We talked about what the
attacker's goals are,

512
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:18,929
what they're thinking, what
they're trying to achieve.

513
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:21,750
We told the story of the attacker

514
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,720
when of course I think
everyone also wants to be

515
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,220
a little bit like the hackers in the movie

516
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:29,450
which definitely helps
keep people interested too.

517
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:32,460
I think telling a story is a
great way to explain things,

518
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,570
and when you're stuck,

519
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:35,350
and don't know what audio
you should explain things

520
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:37,520
in chronological is a great way to start.

521
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,730
Cause it inherently gives
you points to talk about

522
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:42,630
why things exist as well as how they work,

523
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:44,900
and that gives people the
ability to reason about systems

524
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:47,850
for themselves instead of being
forever dependent on others

525
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:49,679
to feed them the information.

526
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,007
Thanks for listening.

527
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:57,560
- Thanks everyone, now that
you've had a great set of guides

528
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,120
for building an AppSec training
program for developers,

529
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:04,510
and how to spin up a
great champions program,

530
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:06,160
as well as how to tailor your education

531
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,740
to absolute beginners,

532
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,790
we are gonna start taking your questions.

533
00:22:11,408 --> 00:22:13,808
I think we're gonna put
all of us on the screen.

534
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:19,820
And so I'll start with our
first question from my list

535
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:22,230
which is how can you
measure the effectiveness

536
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:23,823
of an AppSec training program?

537
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:31,469
- So there's, it sort of
depends on what you're trying

538
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:33,930
to achieve with your
AppSec training program.

539
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:38,010
And, you know you measure
what you're trying

540
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:40,273
to define as success.

541
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:46,960
In many cases, it's going to
be around coverage and adoption

542
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:50,580
and quiz answers.

543
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:54,350
You wanna make sure that you
have 100% of your organization

544
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:58,899
taking the training and that
100% have reached a certain bar

545
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:03,240
like past 70% of the quiz
questions, that sort of thing.

546
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,960
So those sorts of effectiveness measures

547
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,113
are around adoption.

548
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:15,130
And I really think that
that is the direction to go.

549
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:17,460
There's a lot of talk on
whether you should be looking

550
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:21,240
at counting vulnerabilities,
and looking at the Delta

551
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,880
between this year and last year

552
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,930
for a number of vulnerabilities
as a way to describe,

553
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:27,170
whether the training
program was effective.

554
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:29,870
But you have to look at
training more like insurance,

555
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:33,112
it's more proactive and defensive.

556
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:35,889
There's just too many
reasons why you might have

557
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:38,460
a different number of
vulnerabilities from year to year.

558
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:42,180
It's not, that's not the
path I have found to go down.

559
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:44,970
So this is a question of how to scale,

560
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:48,290
and measuring the
rollout of your training,

561
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:50,580
and measuring whether people
have knowledge checks,

562
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:53,040
that's how you measure the program.

563
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,850
- Well, all right, so our next question,

564
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:57,100
we're gonna go with the
theme of measurement,

565
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:01,270
and Nikki, what is your, how
do you measure the success

566
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:02,993
of a security champions program?

567
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:05,200
- Yeah, that's a great question.

568
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,870
I will say for us, we spent a lot of time

569
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:09,820
before we rolled out our first cohort

570
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:12,080
defining what we call a job description

571
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,210
for our security champions.

572
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:14,340
So getting back to that idea

573
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:17,699
of having a really specific set of asks.

574
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,260
So there are a couple of different things

575
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:22,240
on that job description,
which are activities

576
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,290
that we expect the champion to perform on.

577
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:26,540
And we don't actually rate champions on,

578
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:29,149
did they do a particularly
amazing threat model?

579
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:32,200
Did their pillar have fewer
vulnerabilities or anything?

580
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,720
When we report back to their manager

581
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,020
on like how valuable they've been,

582
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,200
we're literally looking for

583
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,100
did they do those things
on our specific asks?

584
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,810
I think like Marissa mentioned

585
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:45,040
with a security awareness
programs, we considered a metric

586
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,530
of maybe if we have a security champion

587
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:49,950
the number of vulnerabilities
coming out of their team

588
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:51,840
or their pillar will drop,

589
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,919
but it feels like a
really variable measure,

590
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,710
that's not necessarily in the
control of a security champion

591
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:58,890
particularly because some
of our security champions

592
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:01,040
are like one person working in a pillar,

593
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:04,060
that's 50 people and it's
gonna take time for them

594
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:07,760
to exert their influence
across that size of a group.

595
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,700
We are monitoring that metric though,

596
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:13,490
we're just not convinced
it's gonna be a useful gauge

597
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:15,290
of how, how much impact they've had.

598
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:19,614
- That makes a lot of sense.

599
00:25:19,614 --> 00:25:23,460
So I'm gonna start with Tom, but I think

600
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:26,963
this is a question everybody can answer.

601
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:29,530
What tactics worked best,

602
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:31,580
and what failed in teaching secure coding.

603
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:35,370
And do you think that sprinkling
in a little threat modeling

604
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:37,503
to education for developers makes sense?

605
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:41,820
- Sure, so I think one of the tactics

606
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:44,389
that really worked best for
the security side of things

607
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:46,830
at least was to teach both sides

608
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:50,240
let's say the offensive and the
defensive, because, you know

609
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,530
if you don't know your opponent,

610
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:54,030
you can't defend against them.

611
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:59,380
For things that failed., I
think, you know, like I mentioned

612
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,990
just giving people a
list of rules to follow,

613
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:04,910
I think generally speaking
doesn't work very well,

614
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:08,500
because firstly, people generally
can't remember the rules

615
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,670
if they don't know why they exist.

616
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:12,470
For the threat modeling side of things.

617
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:14,190
I think absolutely that's
a really good idea,

618
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:15,880
even for beginners as well.

619
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,700
You know, when we got to
talking about password security

620
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:21,433
for example, and different
hashing mechanisms,

621
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,100
we talked about the trade-offs

622
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:27,760
between what you could do depending on

623
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,400
who it was you were defending against.

624
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,641
So if you were just
trying to defend against

625
00:26:32,641 --> 00:26:35,130
kids running tools, for example,

626
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:38,010
or if you were trying to defend
against a nation state actor

627
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:40,400
your requirements become quite different.

628
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,250
We didn't need to go
into too much more depth

629
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:46,330
than that for beginners, but
I think using the extremes

630
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:49,102
in that way works quite well
to get the point across.

631
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:53,300
- Marisa did you have any thoughts on it?

632
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:56,620
- I think Tom said it beautifully

633
00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:02,820
as far as what works hands-on
training and making sure

634
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:07,200
that you are looking for courses
that have the break stuff,

635
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,450
and the fixed stuff,
focusing on both sides,

636
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:13,070
and really it's the patching

637
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:15,470
how to defend against these issues

638
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:17,330
that developers are really interested in.

639
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:19,530
It helps them connect
to the content better.

640
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:24,253
And then as far as what's failed,

641
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:29,940
yeah there's really
just no appetite anymore

642
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,143
for click through slides training.

643
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:40,490
- That is the death, well,
okay, so now we've discussed

644
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:43,250
like what works for training developers

645
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:45,450
and how to get them to
think about secure coding,

646
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:46,803
and what doesn't work.

647
00:27:48,303 --> 00:27:49,420
And we've got this idea

648
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:51,550
of building security champions program

649
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:54,720
to kind of help with our developers

650
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,790
having access to security.

651
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:59,330
Why shouldn't we train
every security champion

652
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:00,822
to be a full fledged expert?

653
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,870
- Yeah, I think this
actually ties really well

654
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:07,479
into one of the other questions
that I think Rez asked

655
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:10,320
about security champions

656
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,120
and what their responsibilities are.

657
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,439
So when we originally pulled
people about, you know

658
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:19,820
so Slack has 800 engineers
and before we got started

659
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,520
our security champions program,

660
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,500
we pulled people who
had worked in companies

661
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,970
that had security
champions programs before.

662
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:29,700
And one of the anti-patterns
that people brought up

663
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:33,080
was security champions
became like an extension

664
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,139
of the security team.

665
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:38,470
So when my engineering
team had a security problem

666
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:42,340
I took the heat for it as
an engineer on that team.

667
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:45,340
So one of the things that
like we really want to avoid

668
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:47,110
is putting engineers in that position.

669
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:51,060
Like they are employed
to work on the products

670
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:53,360
their expertise is on the product.

671
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,469
They shouldn't be taking the
blame for security issues

672
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:58,260
like where at the end of the day,

673
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:01,129
we're the people who are
on the line for that.

674
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:02,630
Additionally, I also think that

675
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:04,240
it makes your program more inclusive

676
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,180
if you don't require a security champions

677
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:12,090
to have that level of interest,
and passion for security.

678
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:13,709
Like it's great, if you
have a couple of people

679
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:17,130
who are that excited, but there
are a lot of useful things

680
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,770
that a smart engineer can do for you

681
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:21,530
without necessarily being able to go

682
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:23,040
into the weeds on security.

683
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:26,340
So like for instance, people
hate when I use this term

684
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:28,209
to describe security champions programs.

685
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:30,980
But one of the things
that I leveraged mine for,

686
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:35,880
is as a network of spies, or
allies throughout engineering,

687
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,270
one of the biggest values
that I find from the program

688
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:42,230
is that projects that my team
otherwise might not about,

689
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:44,200
these people have their noses to the wind.

690
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,290
They're like, this
could be security scary,

691
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:49,240
product security, please help us out.

692
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,180
And you don't need to be a
security expert to do that.

693
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:53,170
You just need to be a little bit of savvy

694
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:54,510
and I can teach that to anybody

695
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:56,710
no matter how passionate
they are or aren't.

696
00:29:59,226 --> 00:30:01,800
- So then what is the proper audience

697
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,850
for developer training?

698
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:05,540
We have a large number of
applications support members

699
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:08,370
and DBAs that aren't
conventional developers.

700
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:10,010
It seems that OWASP
training would translate

701
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:12,373
to other roles like on the IT org.

702
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,250
- This is such a great
question, thank you for that.

703
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:18,810
It's the next steps.

704
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:21,210
So you start your program thinking

705
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:23,570
about the minimum viable product

706
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:26,120
and then the sky's the limit.

707
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,780
Yes, you absolutely should
be looking at other audiences

708
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:33,780
besides strict code, you know,
code submitting developers.

709
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:37,540
There are a lot of other technical roles

710
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:38,760
that work in software

711
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,760
that need application security training,

712
00:30:41,699 --> 00:30:44,180
SEC a lot of different roles.

713
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:46,333
I really don't think you should limit,

714
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,390
think outside the box with that.

715
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:51,840
One, that I'll point out
in addition to the example

716
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,352
that you gave is QA,

717
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:56,810
giving application security training

718
00:30:56,810 --> 00:31:00,870
to your quality assurance,
quality engineers,

719
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:04,750
that's stage of testing after coding,

720
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:07,370
maybe where there's a
handoff to a different team

721
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:08,760
that are not the developers,

722
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,570
absolutely AppSec training there as well.

723
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:15,409
And also consider application,

724
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:18,133
web application pen
testing training for QA.

725
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:20,710
If you really want to get advanced,

726
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:24,210
and get that high level of
maturity in your program,

727
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:25,510
you're on the right track.

728
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,853
- I have another question.

729
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,130
We're currently working

730
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:33,980
to extend our existing
security champion program

731
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:37,540
to include Ops folks, which
is somewhat straightforward,

732
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:39,980
and products people
which I personally find

733
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:41,770
somewhat more challenging.

734
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:43,290
Is that something you have done,

735
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:45,993
or are working on, or could
share your experience with?

736
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,640
- Yeah, so I will say my
team has mostly worked so far

737
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:52,700
with teams that work
directly on the product.

738
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:55,360
So we haven't worked as much with ops yet.

739
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,639
We're actually in our current cohort,

740
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:02,260
we have our first set of
people from our QE division,

741
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,980
who like Marissa said,

742
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:06,670
we expect them to be like
really amazing allies,

743
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:09,240
and we have plans to
branch out, into DevOps.

744
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,760
For product people I'm
not sure if you mean

745
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,530
like less technical product people,

746
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:15,560
like product managers maybe.

747
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,169
I will speak to that,

748
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:20,740
we've worked with product
managers a bit, and right now

749
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:21,980
we're a little too technically

750
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:23,377
focused in our security program,

751
00:32:23,377 --> 00:32:25,419
our security champions
program to loop them in

752
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:27,393
but they're future iteration.

753
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,330
- While we're with you, Nikki,

754
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:33,010
what is your recommended ratio

755
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:34,910
of security champions to developers?

756
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:36,260
- Oh yeah, great question.

757
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:39,970
So in an ideal world where
everyone would me resources

758
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:43,420
I would love to have one
security champion per team.

759
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:46,850
Again just so we have that
direct view of here's the project

760
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:49,770
we're spinning up, we
need a little help on it.

761
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:52,610
In reality, we have, like I said,

762
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:54,540
we're about 800 engineers right now,

763
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:57,730
and we're at about 35 champions.

764
00:32:57,730 --> 00:33:00,500
So I guess that's like around 1:40 ratio,

765
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,060
maybe I did that math wrong.

766
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:03,760
It's pretty good, it's
a lot better than it was

767
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,963
before we had that many.

768
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,080
- We have time for one
more question in the chat

769
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,889
if you'd like, and while we wait for that,

770
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:14,310
what are some of the
cool lesser known tools

771
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:16,760
that are a boon for the
security team within Slack

772
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,233
or Atlassian products.

773
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:27,570
- And sort of not in all seriousness,

774
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:30,659
the Atlassian products,
are what Atlassian leans on

775
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:33,760
quite heavily Confluence and JIRA.

776
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:37,280
We've got a lot of JIRA
orchestration to create tickets

777
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,879
for this work security champions

778
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:42,760
are minted with the JIRA
ticket and then their process,

779
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,350
and life cycle is followed through

780
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:47,689
with a checklist of JIRA
ticket items and tasks.

781
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:50,680
And you can know what's expected of you

782
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:55,520
based on a tool that you're
very comfortable with.

783
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,780
But I wanted to also say another tool

784
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:59,970
that's not an Atlassian product.

785
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:03,100
There's some the really advanced programs

786
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,820
are really focusing on automation,

787
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:07,614
and orchestration, and administration.

788
00:34:07,614 --> 00:34:10,850
So we have a tool that
captures all of the behaviors

789
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:13,330
and work that everybody's doing.

790
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:15,139
The one that we use is called elevate,

791
00:34:15,139 --> 00:34:20,139
and it's kind of capturing
a risk score for employees

792
00:34:20,139 --> 00:34:24,489
that is looking at have you
done all of the different tasks

793
00:34:24,489 --> 00:34:29,439
that are required of the
baseline for all employees,

794
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,357
and save yourself some time,

795
00:34:31,357 --> 00:34:34,580
and just use a tool that is
meant, and designed for that.

796
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:36,572
Don't build the database yourself.

797
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:41,810
- And is there anything else in Slack

798
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:43,670
we should keep an eye out for?

799
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:46,710
- Yeah, this isn't related
to security awareness at all.

800
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,440
But the first thing that
popped into my mind,

801
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:52,130
is my team has been
rolling out static analysis

802
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:57,130
to a very wide number of
programming languages and repos.

803
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:00,710
And we've been using this open
source tool called Semgrep

804
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:03,490
and it's choice, you can write
rules for, really easily.

805
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:05,740
If you have a security team that needs

806
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:07,319
to put static analysis in place,

807
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,240
and doesn't necessarily
have a lot of background

808
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:13,453
in static analysis, it's a
really easy, a great tool to use.

809
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,180
- Excellent, my next
question is for Hudson Tom,

810
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:21,930
if you had a team that
has a very limited budget

811
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:25,582
what would you recommend
when it comes to training?

812
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:35,140
- It's quite a difficult question.

813
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:37,920
I think definitely as
someone earlier on, you know

814
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,930
don't waste time teaching the
things that aren't applicable

815
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:41,763
to your stack.

816
00:35:41,763 --> 00:35:44,440
So I think don't teach swift security

817
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,640
if you don't have a
mobile app, for example.

818
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:50,970
But also I think you can
get a surprising amount done

819
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:53,839
with in-house resource.

820
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:57,010
Perhaps if one of your
security champions is an expert

821
00:35:57,010 --> 00:36:00,600
maybe they can lend a hand
with that kind of thing.

822
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:05,080
But I think the main thing
is keep it practical as well

823
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:08,680
because I think that's
where you get the best bang

824
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,109
for your book.

825
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:12,250
Again, I think it was
Marisa said, you know

826
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:14,540
the click-through slide training is dead.

827
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:18,470
It's expensive to prepare
and it's not very good value

828
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:20,069
for the amount of time invested.

829
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:24,970
- Yeah, there's a couple
of some free trainings

830
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:26,669
that some of the vendors make available.

831
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:29,360
So use your network, ask on Twitter

832
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:32,470
if other people are seeing
one-off free trainings

833
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:35,540
that you can weave in and
it's an oldie, but a goodie.

834
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:38,490
I just think that juice shop, you know

835
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:40,680
some of the stuff, OWASP puts out

836
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:43,460
it's well traveled at this point.

837
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:44,870
So there's some good walk-throughs

838
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:46,779
about how to use juice shop,

839
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:49,980
the vulnerable web app training platform

840
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:53,950
to illustrate these concepts

841
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:55,312
and it feels very hands-on.

842
00:36:57,260 --> 00:37:01,750
- That's awesome, so our final
question, and then I'll ask

843
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:03,680
if you have anything
you'd like to part with

844
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,100
is how big should a security team be

845
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,933
when you have 800 engineers?

846
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,580
- I think there's a difference
between how big it should be

847
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,973
and how big it practically can be.

848
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:22,060
I will say for us, our
product security team

849
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:23,210
it's divided in two halves,

850
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:26,470
one that's focused more on
secure by default development,

851
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:29,600
and one that's focused more on
traditional AppSec behaviors

852
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,766
and between the two word 19 engineers

853
00:37:31,766 --> 00:37:34,520
which is I find very well-resourced

854
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:37,433
for this number of engineers overall.

855
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:43,703
- Anybody else?

856
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:51,049
- So SeMS put out a state
of the industry report

857
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:55,630
that talked about having
three to four awareness

858
00:37:55,630 --> 00:38:00,630
and training and culture
practitioners in your program.

859
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:07,120
And I think that that's a
number that I've heard that,

860
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:11,910
you know, around like the
five to 10,000 employees,

861
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:16,910
you should start to lean
towards having a solid team

862
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:21,410
of maybe four people for your
awareness and culture program

863
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:23,812
that the topic of this conversation today.

864
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:28,069
So yeah, there's a
security awareness programs

865
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:31,830
SeMS industry report that just came out

866
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:33,960
very recently that you might look out for

867
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,713
if this specific topic
area is of interest.

868
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:41,330
- Awesome, so thank you
everyone for coming.

869
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:42,830
I hope that you learned a lot.

870
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:46,340
I hope you have three
excellent jumping off points

871
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:48,663
as you continue to integrate AppSec

872
00:38:48,663 --> 00:38:51,560
into the rest of your organization.

873
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:55,350
And if you'd like to
follow any of our speakers

874
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:57,650
so that you can learn more about it

875
00:38:57,650 --> 00:39:01,263
as they go about their daily
lives, please feel free to.
