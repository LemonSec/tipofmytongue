1
00:00:00,645 --> 00:00:03,228
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:37,890
- Welcome to this year's
Global Threat Brief

3
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,790
that we do here at the RSA conference.

4
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,160
I'm so pleased to do the
stock this year jointly

5
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,190
with Sandra Joyce, who runs
threat intelligence for FireEye

6
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:47,030
to give a broader industry perspective

7
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:49,470
on the latest in the
cyber threat landscape.

8
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:50,699
So welcome Sandra.

9
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:51,990
- Thank you for having me.

10
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:54,286
- And Sandra, 2020 was
certainly a challenging year

11
00:00:54,286 --> 00:00:55,970
in so many respects.

12
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:57,710
We have the global pandemic,

13
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:59,760
we've seen cyber adversaries of all types

14
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,190
take advantage of the
stress and the workload

15
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:04,149
that is brought onto the defenders,

16
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:08,040
but also we've had the elections
and the cyber interference

17
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,710
that we all expected that somewhat

18
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:13,050
has not still materialized in those times,

19
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:16,390
but before we drill into the
go round the world threat brief

20
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:19,320
let's talk about two major
events of the last few months

21
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,270
SolarWinds and the Exchange HAFNIUM hacks.

22
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:24,390
Two operations that are
both very similar in nature

23
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:26,420
in terms of their initial objectives,

24
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,490
but also vastly different in scope

25
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:30,740
and behavior of the adversary.

26
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:33,640
So let's begin with SolarWinds
or Holiday Bear Operations,

27
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,090
I call it.
- 2452 that is

28
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:39,140
- Holiday Bear, since we now
know it has certainly impacted

29
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,590
more than just SolarWinds itself.

30
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:43,880
So from my perspective, Sandra

31
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,229
this was a traditional
espionage operation.

32
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:47,770
We now know it was orchestrated

33
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:50,119
by the SVR Russian Intelligence Services

34
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,870
and the targets were the targets

35
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:56,210
that you expect the Russians
to go after foreign governments

36
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:59,000
particularly US governments,
Department of Treasury,

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,210
we know was hit, Department
of Homeland Security,

38
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:04,289
justice department and other companies

39
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,370
that would be used to facilitate access

40
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:07,810
to those government networks.

41
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:11,039
- And when you think about
an espionage operation

42
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,840
it's very interesting
to see what was targeted

43
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,673
and what wasn't.

44
00:02:14,673 --> 00:02:18,120
And clearly it was a espionage based on

45
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,130
what wasn't targeted,
financial information, PII.

46
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:24,960
There wasn't a dump of
information that we've seen.

47
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,430
So all of that really points to the idea

48
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,080
that this was an operation

49
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,470
to satisfy national level
collection requirements,

50
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:33,707
and that's espionage.

51
00:02:33,707 --> 00:02:37,040
- And the most interesting
thing for me, Sandra is

52
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,170
when you guys actually
published in your blog post back

53
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:41,299
in December when you analyze the malware,

54
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,220
is that it had a kill switch in it.

55
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,180
And the Russians actually
used that kill switch

56
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,350
to terminate their access
permanently shut down the malware

57
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:51,130
in 99% of the victims, the
victims they didn't care about

58
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,570
including companies I've
seen that they have targeted

59
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:54,403
in the past.

60
00:02:54,403 --> 00:02:58,700
So clearly had an espionage
objective and, but they decided

61
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,780
to focus their efforts on
the most high value targets

62
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,297
obviously not out of the
goodness of their hearts,

63
00:03:04,297 --> 00:03:07,109
but because they wanted
to keep this operation

64
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:09,540
in stealth mode as long as possible.

65
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,810
And in some ways what they're
doing here is emulating

66
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:14,730
what they've traditionally been
doing for almost a 100 years

67
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:18,840
in human intelligence, where
we all remember the illegals

68
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,893
operations, where they send
out people under cover,

69
00:03:23,652 --> 00:03:25,970
under a fake names to live in countries

70
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:29,020
like the United States and
Europe for long periods of time

71
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,800
so that they can get
close to people in power

72
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,950
and collect information.

73
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:35,140
It seems to me that this
operation many ways mimics

74
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,549
what they're trying to do in human.

75
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,340
Get inside those networks
through supply chains

76
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,540
that are hard to detect

77
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,810
and stay in there for
long periods of time.

78
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:44,930
- In a way it's a real modernization

79
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,650
of very classic techniques.

80
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:49,770
But now with cyber as an
instrument of national power

81
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:53,260
that's the method that
they're going to as a plan A

82
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,310
instead of a plan B or C

83
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:59,350
- Let's contrast that with
Exchange HAFNIUM hacks from China

84
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:01,260
it start out in a very traditional way.

85
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,750
They found some vulnerabilities,

86
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,990
they use those vulnerabilities
in exchange to get access

87
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:09,230
to mail servers of their
traditional targets.

88
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:13,010
Obviously Think Tanks,
dissident groups, Uyghurs,

89
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:14,429
the types of people that we expect

90
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,680
the Chinese intelligence
services to go after.

91
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,959
But then they did something unprecedented.

92
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,250
They went after literally
everyone, once they learned

93
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,210
that Microsoft was gonna
patch these vulnerabilities

94
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:25,960
have you ever seen them do this?

95
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,299
- It's incredibly aggressive.

96
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,150
And it also has the secondary effect of

97
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:31,530
when they drop these web shells

98
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:33,719
they leave so much vulnerable.

99
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,370
So organizations that
cannot mitigate, can't patch

100
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:39,590
they really are it's open season on them

101
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:42,659
for following attacks by other APT groups.

102
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:46,640
But even more disconcerting
would be a Ransomware operator

103
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,020
who now has access to these organizations.

104
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,270
- That's exactly right, Sandra.

105
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:53,539
The faculty uses web shells
with very basic passwords,

106
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:56,050
sometimes just default passwords

107
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:58,230
that will allow virtually
anyone that could scan

108
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:01,320
for those web shells to gain
access to those networks.

109
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,960
Even if they've been patched is

110
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,549
what makes us even more reckless

111
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:06,130
because you're not just targeting people

112
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:07,954
that you have no business targeting,

113
00:05:07,954 --> 00:05:10,410
but you also leave them
vulnerable as you said,

114
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:13,690
to Ransomware operators and others

115
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:16,380
that can do real damage
inside those networks.

116
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:19,240
And it's amazing to see
this contrast where Russia

117
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,580
is the more responsible
actor in this particular case

118
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,900
when traditionally it's been China

119
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,659
that has never used destructive
attacks in the past.

120
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:28,230
And obviously in this particular
case, it wasn't destruction

121
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:31,560
but the reckless nature of
this is quite unprecedented.

122
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,760
- Agreed.

123
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,349
- Now let's switch gears

124
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:37,140
and actually start talking
broadly about China.

125
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:40,240
They of course have been focusing a lot

126
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,390
on the pandemic and
biotech as a target for US,

127
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,700
but what else have they been up to?

128
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,780
- If you look at China's strategic plan

129
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:50,549
you can really see the areas
that they're interested in

130
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:53,800
and healthcare and biotech
have long been on that list.

131
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,780
With the backdrop of the global pandemic

132
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:58,479
what we saw were Chinese threat actors

133
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:02,620
who were going after vaccine
developers, researchers,

134
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:05,360
trying to get a picture,
trying to collect information

135
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,510
that could help them in battling,

136
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:09,840
not only battling the virus itself

137
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,690
but also understanding the
decision making process

138
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:14,260
of countries around the world.

139
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:18,730
And interestingly, they weren't
just the only perpetrator

140
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:21,210
in this, they were also
the victim of some of this.

141
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:24,630
So in Vietnamese APT
group that we observed

142
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:27,320
had actually targeted the
Wuhan regional government

143
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,170
looking for information on COVID 19.

144
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:33,690
So this is one of those cases
where China was the aggressor

145
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:35,070
and also the victim.

146
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,930
- I imagine every intelligence service

147
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,090
was trying to figure it
out back in January, 2020

148
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:40,400
what was going on exactly in Wuhan

149
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,342
and they had good reasons too.

150
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,729
So what else has China been up to?

151
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:47,950
- What we're seeing also is...

152
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,390
One of the things that we're not seeing

153
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:51,110
is probably even more interesting.

154
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,180
We're not seeing a lot of destructive

155
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,720
or disruptive capability
coming out of China.

156
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,190
And when you look at their
peers, Russia, North Korea

157
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:03,810
and Iran who willingly and
frequently use destructive

158
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:07,030
or disruptive operation
China hasn't done that.

159
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:08,400
They're using that in reserve.

160
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,039
And when we think about
their long-term plan

161
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:15,340
and how that fits into it, we
start to see a picture emerge.

162
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,929
- One of the most
interesting things has been

163
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:19,850
that the PLA that probably
would have the authority

164
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:21,970
to execute destructive attacks in China

165
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:24,530
has been really taking a
back seat for many years now

166
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:26,270
to the Ministry of State Security,

167
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:29,469
their civilian intelligence
agency really since 2015,

168
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:31,970
about mushy agreement, when
we saw the peel activity

169
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:34,450
just plummet across the
board in cyberspace,

170
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:35,930
but they're really starting to reemerge.

171
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:37,670
We saw them in the Equifax hack,

172
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:40,030
we're starting to see them in
some of the later operations

173
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:41,229
that are being conducted.

174
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:44,150
So this is quite worrying sometime.

175
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:45,770
- It's also very characteristic though,

176
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:46,969
of Chinese operations.

177
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:50,960
So in the past, when we seen
them become publicly exposed

178
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,060
like APT10, for example,
we then see them go

179
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,440
into some kind of
hibernation and retooling.

180
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:00,020
And when we think about the
reorganization of the PLA

181
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:03,060
and the MSS, they're doing
the same type of thing

182
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:06,370
a very quiet retooling and reorganization

183
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:08,910
and what's emerge is a much more focused

184
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:10,930
and disciplined operation.

185
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:12,010
- And speaking of retooling,

186
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:14,130
we've really seen them
go after mobile devices

187
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:16,600
which is not an easy task by any means.

188
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,960
And particularly targeting of Uyghurs

189
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,250
and other dissident groups within China

190
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,140
they've really stepped
up their game there.

191
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:25,349
- They're using cyber means in order

192
00:08:25,349 --> 00:08:28,770
to perpetrate their political ends.

193
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,690
And when we think about dissident groups

194
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:34,110
and groups that are running
contrary to the communist party,

195
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:39,110
we see an aggressive behavior
from Chinese threat actors.

196
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:40,789
And that's just not going to stop

197
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:42,689
that's gonna continue into the future.

198
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:45,160
- Next up Iran.

199
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,038
We really started the year in 2020,

200
00:08:47,038 --> 00:08:51,030
worried about retribution
for the Soleimania operation

201
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,560
conducted by the Trump administration

202
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,415
but it really hasn't occurred.

203
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:59,050
Obviously there was a kinetic
response shortly thereafter

204
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:01,560
but in cyberspace, they really held back

205
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,002
from most of 2020 against
the United States.

206
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:05,469
What do you make of that?

207
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:06,780
- I really think that sometimes

208
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,500
in the cybersecurity industry

209
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,885
we tend to think of a quid pro quo

210
00:09:10,885 --> 00:09:13,840
as having to stay in the cyber domain.

211
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,090
But there are lots of
ways that organizations

212
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:19,680
and nation states can
actually exercise power.

213
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,680
It doesn't have to stay
in the cyber domain.

214
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,560
So we could see a cyber
action being followed on

215
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:29,099
by diplomatic sanctions or
kinetic military action.

216
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,660
It's really about a
government perpetuating

217
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,850
their own national security needs

218
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:36,480
using whatever tools they
have at their disposal.

219
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,627
- But we did see them
interfere in the elections

220
00:09:38,627 --> 00:09:40,689
and they did more aggressive
way than the Russians did

221
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:43,270
in cyberspace where the Proud Boys emails.

222
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:44,103
Can you talk about that?

223
00:09:44,103 --> 00:09:46,040
- That was a big surprise to us

224
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,650
because everybody really
was focused on Russia

225
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:51,020
and that as you said, didn't materialize.

226
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,730
But what we saw was a real evolution

227
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:55,300
in the use of information operations

228
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:59,050
where they used cultural elements,
excellent taste in music.

229
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:02,890
They used Metallica to
back up their video.

230
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:06,460
And really what this email
was supposed to do was

231
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:09,310
it was targeted to voters
trying to intimidate them.

232
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:11,760
And we saw as a result of that

233
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,250
it really changed our thinking into

234
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:16,210
what the Iranian government
was willing to carry out.

235
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:20,280
And they ended up being the primary way of

236
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,430
that we saw election
interference happening.

237
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:23,810
- One of the other
things that they're doing

238
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:26,380
that's really innovative is
leveraging social networks

239
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:30,030
like LinkedIn to identify
people within companies

240
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:33,020
that they can target, particularly
for espionage purposes.

241
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:33,853
That's one of the major ways

242
00:10:33,853 --> 00:10:36,525
that they're now getting inside
the organizations, isn't it?

243
00:10:36,525 --> 00:10:37,358
- That's right.

244
00:10:37,358 --> 00:10:39,020
They're taking a page right
out of the Russian playbook

245
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:39,853
on this one.

246
00:10:39,853 --> 00:10:41,510
And then we've been seeing
them do this for a while.

247
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,540
A group that we call Newschaster

248
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,839
was actually doing this several years ago.

249
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,730
So this is a tried and true technique

250
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:51,740
that we're seeing where Iran
is doing the network analysis

251
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:54,186
that they need to do
to find key individuals

252
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:58,890
or to propagate some
very effective narrative

253
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:00,670
that they wanna see amplified.

254
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,949
That's classic information operations

255
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:05,210
and we're seeing around
really embraced that.

256
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:07,480
- And also DNS hijacking is coming back.

257
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,010
They did this years ago.

258
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:11,810
They famously compromised
certificate authorities

259
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:15,550
to facilitate those
operations within Iran.

260
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,370
But now we're seeing
more and more of that.

261
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:18,390
- We're seeing more of that

262
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:21,023
and we're seeing a
really clear distinction

263
00:11:21,023 --> 00:11:22,910
between their regional plan

264
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:25,569
and that international plan that Iran has.

265
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:30,190
So they're also targeting
regionally groups like APT33

266
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,110
are using Shamoon and other wipers

267
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:33,970
to target businesses
throughout the middle East.

268
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:35,847
And they continue to conduct espionage

269
00:11:35,847 --> 00:11:37,930
in the United States and elsewhere.

270
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,370
So they really have a plan

271
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:41,900
and their sophistication
continues to grow.

272
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:45,140
- So they remain very focused
on using that power regionally

273
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:46,880
but still staying away
from the United States,

274
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,990
except in espionage cases.

275
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:49,823
- For now.

276
00:11:49,823 --> 00:11:51,621
- For now and North Korea.

277
00:11:51,621 --> 00:11:54,520
They're in some ways my
favorite actor in cyberspace

278
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:57,230
because they're just so
incredibly innovative.

279
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:59,010
If you think about it,
they've come up with

280
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,680
some of the most innovative
attacks we've seen yet.

281
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,209
In fact, we just talked
about destructive attacks.

282
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:06,190
North Koreans have really
pioneered that back

283
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:08,350
in the early two 2000s when they went hard

284
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:10,280
after South Korea with destructive attacks

285
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,500
and of course they did Sony.

286
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,760
And with Sony, they really
pioneered another model

287
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,069
that the Russians then to con

288
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:17,650
which is the hack and leak capability,

289
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:20,770
where they hacked into Sony
and leaked their emails.

290
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:22,939
And then of course from
a cyber-crime perspective

291
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:27,340
they're incredibly audacious in going

292
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:30,660
after the banking sector
and cryptocurrency changes

293
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,209
- They're one of the first threat actors

294
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:35,630
that nation state sponsors
to crossover into cyber crime

295
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,960
to fund the government.

296
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:40,390
Groups like APT38 we watched
them conduct bank heist

297
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,580
around the world.

298
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,040
They were targeting at one point

299
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,430
16 different financial
organizations at once.

300
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:50,510
And this is after a long
history of being able to pivot

301
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:53,420
from regional focus like APT37,

302
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:57,240
trying to conduct espionage
operations on the peninsula

303
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:01,080
and then expanding to a more
international operation.

304
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,277
So we're watching North
Korea do a lot of evolution

305
00:13:04,277 --> 00:13:08,750
and a lot of, again,
sophistication in their techniques.

306
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,720
And a lot of it's homegrown.

307
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,250
- That's the most fascinating
thing about their operations.

308
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,530
If you think about what
the Russians are not doing

309
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:18,130
what the Chinese are doing, the Iranians,

310
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,270
they're leveraging common
tools like Cobalt Strike.

311
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:22,020
They still have some of their
own capabilities as well

312
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:24,560
but more and more they're
leveraging off the shelf tools.

313
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,910
One because you don't need
to spend efforts gradient.

314
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,930
And two it's even better if you're trying

315
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:30,870
to avoid being attributed,
because it's much harder

316
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:33,860
to attribute a common
commodity tool like that.

317
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:36,245
But the North Koreans have
really shied away from that.

318
00:13:36,245 --> 00:13:38,789
They're still focused
on custom development

319
00:13:38,789 --> 00:13:42,510
and almost, you can call it Juche malware

320
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:47,050
where Juche, of course, is
their core themes in North Korea

321
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:49,479
for self sustainment and
that the economy needs

322
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,200
to be completely independent of the West.

323
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,010
But there seemed to be taking
the same tack in cyberspace.

324
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:58,000
- And their innovation doesn't stop there.

325
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,950
They're actually
targeting cryptocurrencies

326
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:02,090
developing their own cryptocurrencies

327
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:05,730
and targeting vulnerability
researchers to target

328
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:07,470
the applications that they're developing.

329
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:09,620
- And by the way, we are
all rightly concerned

330
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:12,360
about Supply chain hacks, post SolarWinds

331
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,580
but the North Queens have
been pioneers there as well.

332
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,990
They've targeted AV vendors,

333
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:18,460
they've targeted even
cryptocurrency software

334
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,760
to insert backdoors
into their applications.

335
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,569
So just incredible level of sophistication

336
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:24,930
that we're seeing from North Koreans.

337
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,620
If you face them on your networks,

338
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,470
you really need to bring your A game.

339
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,680
And of course, no threat
brief can be complete

340
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,569
without a discussion of Russia.

341
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:36,060
Election hacking really
did not materialize

342
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:38,000
in a significant way in 2020

343
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,270
but we still saw some major activities

344
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:41,860
that's quite disturbing from Russia

345
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:44,050
aside from SolarWinds in 2020.

346
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:47,459
- Yeah. We saw them target
a wealth of VPN exploits.

347
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:50,160
And also with the SolarWinds activity

348
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,410
we saw the Golden SAML
technique being used

349
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:55,069
which allowed them to
mint their own tokens

350
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:57,130
and then have access to
multiple applications

351
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:59,030
within the same federated environment.

352
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:02,790
Some of these innovations
also led to a real obfuscation

353
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:05,099
and OPSEC really stealthy techniques.

354
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,400
They would name their own infrastructure

355
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,980
after their target infrastructure.

356
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,600
So you couldn't tell the difference.

357
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,089
They would also use IP addresses

358
00:15:13,089 --> 00:15:15,170
that were in the United States

359
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:18,120
to complicate the investigation efforts.

360
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,960
It's a lot harder to
investigate US infrastructure

361
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,260
when you're an intelligence organization

362
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:27,750
that doesn't have access or
jurisdiction in that area.

363
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:28,583
- That's right.

364
00:15:28,583 --> 00:15:29,930
And of course their interest in the cloud

365
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,089
has been long standing

366
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:32,810
that they've been
targeting cloud providers

367
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:35,660
for many many years, but they're
taking this up a notch now.

368
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,750
And particularly with Goldman SAML attacks

369
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,670
targeting authentication systems,
targeting identity systems

370
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:42,620
that makes it super hard for defenders

371
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:43,990
to actually do incident response

372
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:47,330
because if the actor is
using legitimate credentials

373
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:49,360
of a real employee inside the network,

374
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,570
it's so difficult to
figure out if the action

375
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:54,860
that you were looking at was
done by a legitimate user

376
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:57,090
within the network or if it
was done by the adversary.

377
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:59,260
- And it doesn't matter if
user is changing their password

378
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,490
or using multifactor, none of that matters

379
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:04,270
the threat actor is
going to maintain access.

380
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:07,819
- But also one of the big
concerning points from Russia

381
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,120
that we saw last year was turning

382
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,100
of critical infrastructure.

383
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,440
We often think about
critical infrastructure

384
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,990
as the energy or water, but transportation

385
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:16,920
is a huge factor here as well.

386
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,920
And they went pretty hard
after it, didn't they?

387
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,640
- Right. And a group that
we've tracked for years

388
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,650
called Temp Isotope.

389
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:25,165
We saw them having huge interest
in airports specifically.

390
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:28,270
And when you think about the threats

391
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:30,800
against critical infrastructure
they really underpin

392
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,853
not just the economy,
not just the daily life

393
00:16:34,853 --> 00:16:37,130
of organizations and people

394
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:39,380
but they also underpinned the confidence

395
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:42,750
in those critical systems
for people themselves

396
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:43,960
in their own government.

397
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:47,410
So critical infrastructure as
a target has multiple effects

398
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:49,086
not just the systems themselves

399
00:16:49,086 --> 00:16:51,960
but instilling fear in people.

400
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,070
- So we've talked a lot
about the nation states,

401
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:55,550
the four primary nation state adversaries

402
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:58,089
that we face in cyberspace.

403
00:16:58,090 --> 00:16:59,360
But to me the biggest threat

404
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,850
is actually not the nation
states, it's Ransomware.

405
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:05,460
It's impacting everyone on the
planet from your grandmother

406
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:09,450
that now has to find Bitcoins
to unlock her family photos

407
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:13,119
to smaller organizations,
school districts, and the like

408
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:16,089
and hospitals to the largest companies.

409
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:18,349
And now they're moving towards extortion.

410
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:21,240
- They're using extortion
in really shaming ways.

411
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,839
So they'll threaten to dump
data that they've found

412
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:28,409
they'll even call competitors,
they'll call your customers.

413
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:31,200
They want to make sure they
can use shame as a tool.

414
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,150
And that puts organizations
in an impossible situation.

415
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:35,730
If they decide to pay the rents

416
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:39,550
they could also be risking
paying out in OFAC country

417
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:41,850
in violation of sanctions laws.

418
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:43,909
So not only are they taking these steps

419
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:45,910
but they're also targeting hospitals

420
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:49,020
something that's really crossing the line

421
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,950
when it comes to humanity

422
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:52,820
and especially during a global pandemic.

423
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:55,270
- That's right. But the
ransom payments themselves

424
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:57,570
are going up astronomically.

425
00:17:57,570 --> 00:17:59,760
They're now in the tens of
millions of dollars, aren't they?

426
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,695
- We saw an extortion attempt
for $50 million recently.

427
00:18:03,695 --> 00:18:06,980
And that's, if you think
back just a few years,

428
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,237
it was a few hundred Bitcoin

429
00:18:08,237 --> 00:18:10,660
when Bitcoin was worth a lot less

430
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,800
and now we're talking about $50 million.

431
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,760
We've seen 10 20, 30.

432
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,820
This is just getting out of hand.

433
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:19,620
- Absolutely. And now they're
becoming so aggressive

434
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:20,530
on the extortion demands.

435
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:21,950
They're even reaching out to journalists

436
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:23,060
to give them a heads up

437
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,020
to put further pressure on the company.

438
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,440
It's almost like Ransomware
is now just a side business

439
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,440
to the overall extortion business.

440
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,273
- That's right.

441
00:18:30,273 --> 00:18:32,719
And it puts these
organizations in a position

442
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,770
where even law enforcement
can't touch the threat actors

443
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:37,690
who are sitting on the
other side of the world

444
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:39,710
being protected by governments

445
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:41,960
who are just turning a blind eye.

446
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:45,850
- Yes. And the reality is
most of these operations

447
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:48,159
in terms of the hardcore criminals

448
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,080
that are developing the malware,
developing the capabilities

449
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,669
are in Russia or Russian speaking

450
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:56,840
and many of them are being hidden

451
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,480
or in some cases assisted even

452
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,010
by the Russian Intelligence Service.

453
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:02,100
In some cases we know they actually work

454
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,709
for Russian intelligence by day,

455
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:07,150
executing operations for the state purpose

456
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:08,673
and then by night moonlighting

457
00:19:08,673 --> 00:19:10,883
conducting cyber crime operations.

458
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,510
In many ways, I coined this
phrase over half a decade ago,

459
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:16,920
we don't have a cyber problem

460
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,230
we have a Russia, China,
Iran, and North Korea problem.

461
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:20,510
It applies to cyber crime

462
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:23,300
as much as it does to nation states.

463
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:26,341
So let's talk about the
future what's coming up here.

464
00:19:26,341 --> 00:19:28,350
We have the Olympics coming up

465
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:30,850
just in a little bit
over a month from now,

466
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:32,320
what do you think is gonna happen there?

467
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,100
- The Olympics is this very
highly visible political event.

468
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:40,139
It has been a target of
threat actors in the past

469
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:42,880
and we fully anticipate the Tokyo Olympics

470
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,470
having the same situation.

471
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:47,030
The Olympics provide threat actors

472
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:50,753
the ability to send a message
and to do it at scale.

473
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:53,730
- And when it comes to Ransomware

474
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:55,840
we expect that they
will continue to evolve

475
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,550
both in terms of their business model

476
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:59,810
but also in terms of sophistication.

477
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:03,169
We have not yet seen Ransomware
really go after firmware

478
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:05,370
and try to physically destroy hardware

479
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:08,040
but that can absolutely be on the horizon.

480
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,530
We know the technically
that capability exists.

481
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:12,190
What else do you think is gonna happen?

482
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:14,580
- As you mentioned before,
really this departure

483
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,429
from Ransomware all together
and straight to extortion

484
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:21,320
there is a path for
threat actors who can just

485
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,710
without even breaching an organization

486
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:26,960
can still conduct extortion operations.

487
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,270
And that is very lucrative

488
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:32,200
and could possibly be the
next steps that we see.

489
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,650
- The other key trend
that's really fascinating

490
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,900
is the growing expertise
that China has developed

491
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,790
in this zero-day development game.

492
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:41,070
And you've seen this
both on the research side

493
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:44,090
with the pony tones that
they're increasingly winning

494
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:47,209
and have been for years, but
also in their use of zero-days

495
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:49,300
you guys have just highlighted that

496
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,840
in the Network Gear space is all secure

497
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,709
and the Sonic wall appliances

498
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,540
we've seen that obviously
on the exchange side

499
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:58,170
but you're really starting
to see China emerging

500
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:00,730
as one of the top users of
zero-days going forward.

501
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:03,350
- And what's interesting
to me is the audacity

502
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:05,560
and the reduction of OPSEC.

503
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:08,020
Because what we're
seeing is they don't care

504
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:12,170
if they get discovered,
the widespread targeting,

505
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:14,990
a lot of this is happening
in broad daylight.

506
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:16,650
And it seems to us that

507
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,500
they're really are
trying to send a message.

508
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,440
They don't care if they're
caught they're making a statement

509
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,150
and they're saying that they
are going to be able to do this

510
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:27,180
and perhaps testing
the new administration.

511
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:29,120
- And of course, if you
wanna develop zero-days,

512
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,600
one of the best ways you can do that

513
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,209
is by targeting security researchers.

514
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:34,560
We've seen North Korea do this lately,

515
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,600
we've seen China do this
in the past as well.

516
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,209
And security industry's really

517
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:41,450
become a top target
for every single actor.

518
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:44,110
- As if the security
researchers didn't have enough

519
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:46,719
on their plate as it is,
now they have to worry

520
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,270
about being personally
targeted for the information

521
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:51,110
that they're personally working on.

522
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:54,129
They're probably doesn't
have the security set up

523
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:56,100
that maybe an enterprise company does.

524
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:59,730
It's a shortcut to a
lot of great information

525
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:00,680
- And let's face it

526
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,670
unfortunately there's a lot
of double-talk in our industry

527
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:06,420
and people that should be
practicing better security

528
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:08,950
that know better are
not doing what's needed.

529
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:11,040
So the other trend that I
think is really interesting

530
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:14,720
is how all of these actors,
the nation states in particular

531
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,470
are really becoming shameless in my view.

532
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:19,450
We've talked a lot for many
years now about the need

533
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:22,050
to name and shame actors
and publicly attribute them,

534
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:23,360
which I think is still
very, very important

535
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,898
but they're really
becoming immune to that.

536
00:22:25,898 --> 00:22:27,639
And it's interesting that
they're not even changing

537
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,960
their TTPs much when they're
being called out anymore.

538
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,920
One example of that is China Chopper.

539
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,230
The Chinese have been using it for so long

540
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:37,550
and it's just a one-line
web shell, for God's sakes,

541
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:38,770
change it up a bit,

542
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:40,690
then make it a little
bit more interesting.

543
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:44,260
But obviously China's not the
only party that's using it,

544
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:47,700
but it's just such a telltale
sign when you see it.

545
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:51,130
It's amazing that they
don't change up their tools

546
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:51,990
that often.

547
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:54,940
- When you see something
like the complete disregard

548
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:57,800
for operational security, at that point,

549
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,629
you either have a threat
actor who is not afraid

550
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:03,780
of the consequences, or is
trying to send a message or both.

551
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,570
And I think that's what's happening here.

552
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:06,500
- That's right.

553
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,740
And finally, the last
point I wanna make is that

554
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:11,660
the threat environment is
becoming the worst it's ever been.

555
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,500
Not just because of all
the technical reasons

556
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,370
we've talked about but from
a geopolitical perspective

557
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:18,870
the four primary atmospheres
we face Russia, China, Iran

558
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:20,989
North Korea, our relationship with them

559
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:23,850
from the Western standpoint,
is the worst it's been

560
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:26,139
probably in at least 60 years.

561
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:28,520
Most of these countries
have stopped caring

562
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,840
about a good relationship
with the United States

563
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,810
they're much less
dependent on us and in part

564
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:37,370
through sanctions activities
that we've done against them.

565
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:40,000
And as a result, they're
becoming more and more reckless.

566
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,730
And I really fear for what's to come

567
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:45,240
with the growing sophistication
of these adversaries

568
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:48,960
and also their willingness to
push us further and further

569
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,143
because they don't feel the consequences.

570
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:55,000
- Cyber continues to be
a tool of national power.

571
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,850
And it provides an asymmetric
capability for countries

572
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:00,820
that don't have the military might

573
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:02,669
or don't have the economic power

574
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:05,760
and as they grow and influence
and they grow in capability

575
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,814
they just continue to do these things

576
00:24:07,814 --> 00:24:11,300
without fear of any type of retribution.

577
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,240
- Well, thank you so much.

578
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,520
This is Dmitri Alperovitch.

579
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,690
- And Sandra Joyce.

580
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:16,570
- And thanks for joining us
for the Global Threat Brief

581
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:18,614
at the RSA conference.

582
00:24:18,614 --> 00:24:21,031
