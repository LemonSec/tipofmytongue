1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,050
- Hi everyone.

2
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:02,883
And welcome to

3
00:00:02,883 --> 00:00:07,210
"Piñata Time: Why We Should
All Start Bashing Mules!"

4
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:10,240
It's a panel and I'd like to welcome

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,130
our panelists for today.

6
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:16,151
Starting with Stacie Purcell from Citi.

7
00:00:16,151 --> 00:00:19,940
Stacie's SVP Fraud Policy from Citibank.

8
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:20,773
Hi Stacie.

9
00:00:20,773 --> 00:00:22,633
Hey, good day.

10
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:27,810
- Andy Collins, Financial Crime
Executive from Wells Fargo.

11
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:29,130
- Howdy.

12
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,823
- And we have Paul Gardner,
Manager in Financial Crime

13
00:00:32,823 --> 00:00:35,406
in Suncorp from Australia.

14
00:00:35,406 --> 00:00:37,660
- Hi, how are we doing?

15
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:40,239
- And folks, if you have any questions

16
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,820
to the panelists or to myself

17
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,423
you can use Pigeonhole,

18
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:49,640
this application to ask
interactive questions,

19
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,620
and we'll do our best to answer them

20
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,709
during the live broadcast for this panel.

21
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,320
So let's kick it off.

22
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,963
And of course, we're
going to talk about mules.

23
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:03,629
There are many types of mules,

24
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:08,360
and I think before we actually
start the mule typology

25
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,050
and discussing those
specific types of mules,

26
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:13,759
at the end of the day,

27
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,240
every type of financial crime,
you know, you have to think

28
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,458
about where am I moving
my money to, right?

29
00:01:21,458 --> 00:01:23,840
I'm not going to send money to myself.

30
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,340
I need some sort of account.

31
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,770
This might be a collaborator
like a human collaborator.

32
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:32,020
This might be an account that I opened

33
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:34,839
under someone else's
name, but in any case,

34
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,780
those are the new accounts
that we're going to talk about.

35
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:41,280
And we're going to focus on fraud.

36
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,963
So financial fraud and mules,
they're related to that.

37
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:50,960
And, this is essentially just
to kick the conversation off,

38
00:01:53,167 --> 00:01:55,510
a little bit of a typology that looks

39
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:58,640
at account opening
versus existing accounts.

40
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,783
So in account opening,

41
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:03,449
you typically want to fight
several types of fraud.

42
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,710
You want to fight deposit account fraud,

43
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:09,940
meaning an account, like
a bank account is opened,

44
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,370
and money is deposited to that account.

45
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:13,970
Credit or loan account fraud.

46
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:15,210
Meaning I opened an account

47
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:18,393
and instantly I have access to credit.

48
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:21,627
First Party Fraud is, "I'm, you know,

49
00:02:21,627 --> 00:02:25,530
"trying to defraud the bank myself",

50
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:29,940
but look at this intersection
with money mules,

51
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,910
Mule Account Opening, meaning
I'm opening an account,

52
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:35,970
not because I want to
do instantly some fraud

53
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:38,970
but I want to use that account

54
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:43,700
for any type of fraud that will follow on.

55
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,000
And then you have the existing accounts.

56
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,670
We talk about unwitting mules,

57
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:49,000
and professional mules or witting mules.

58
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,960
So lots of different types of mules.

59
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,047
And maybe before we move

60
00:02:58,490 --> 00:02:59,820
further into the conversation,

61
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,130
let's just describe the sort

62
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:02,829
of mules that you guys are seeing

63
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,930
and how they're different from each other.

64
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,760
Stacie, we'll start with you.

65
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,320
- Sure. Yeah.

66
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,878
Thanks Uri.

67
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:14,970
So before COVID, before the
pandemic really kicked off

68
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:17,640
I think, you know, you saw
more of the unwitting mules.

69
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,649
You had a few professional mules
mixed in there, but I think

70
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:25,740
with the pandemic we've
seen, what is, I would say,

71
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:28,730
you know, kind of an
onslaught of a new kind

72
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:33,530
of mule that's really targeting
the government programs.

73
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:36,024
So your unemployment insurance,

74
00:03:36,024 --> 00:03:39,624
the economic impact
disaster loans in the US.

75
00:03:39,624 --> 00:03:44,624
Just, there's those programs
that are really just

76
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,139
have been created to get as
much money into the hands

77
00:03:48,139 --> 00:03:49,850
of the people who really
need it as quick as possible.

78
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:53,290
And these mules, it's really
kind of migrated from a

79
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:57,230
a small social media type
of effort to get people

80
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:01,079
to open up accounts for
the use of being a mule,

81
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,430
to really just these large scale rings.

82
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:06,700
So I think there's been a
big shift with the pandemic

83
00:04:07,764 --> 00:04:11,680
to really move from those
romance scam unwitting mules,

84
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,560
your one-off, you know, business email

85
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:18,560
compromise recipient mule
account to just large scale

86
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:20,660
targeted mule account openings,

87
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:24,550
leveraging stolen PII to
really get their hands

88
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:25,760
on the pandemic funds.

89
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,219
So I think across the industry,

90
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,650
that's really what we're seeing

91
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:32,010
especially in the United States.

92
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:35,857
- Andy, what is your perspective on this?

93
00:04:35,857 --> 00:04:40,040
- Yeah, well, I echo
what Stacie said, Uri.

94
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:44,320
I would also add that,
you know, the weaknesses

95
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,480
of the government were
pretty much put on display

96
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:51,810
during COVID, but also
because the fraud actors were

97
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:54,310
doing the same things
that we were seems like,

98
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:56,800
they were locked down as we all were.

99
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,443
They spend a lot of
time on online type of,

100
00:05:01,443 --> 00:05:02,990
you know, businesses.

101
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:07,530
So, we're seeing intentional
mule account openings as well.

102
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:09,809
The accounts that are being used for fraud

103
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:13,600
for these third-party
businesses, for an example,

104
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,950
we had a common issue with a few large

105
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,479
property rental firms.

106
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,170
And what the fraud actor was,

107
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:23,470
kind of had a two-part story.

108
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:26,610
One was they had a fake property owner

109
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:29,830
and then the second is
that they had fake renters.

110
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:33,017
And then the fake property
owner who actually a fraud,

111
00:05:33,017 --> 00:05:35,310
who actually opened a mule account

112
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,730
with our bank and with others.

113
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:39,180
And then it's used for two things.

114
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:42,513
The first thing it's used
for is to validate the

115
00:05:42,513 --> 00:05:45,510
fraudulent property owner themselves.

116
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:48,260
And then once that account
is validated, the fraud actor

117
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:51,780
then makes fake rental deposits
and moves the money out

118
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:54,282
before he runs into a
bad credit card deposit,

119
00:05:54,283 --> 00:05:56,350
because it actually comes back.

120
00:05:56,350 --> 00:06:01,280
And so they have pointed that
there's inherent weaknesses

121
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,500
in third parties as well, and
we're starting to see those

122
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,906
in the mule account is one
way to get the money moving.

123
00:06:06,906 --> 00:06:07,739
- Okay, great.

124
00:06:07,739 --> 00:06:11,263
Hey, Paul, what sort of mules
do you see in Australia?

125
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:15,880
- Yeah, so echoing both
Stacie and Andy's points.

126
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:19,293
We see both the account opening mules.

127
00:06:19,293 --> 00:06:23,570
So mules that are facilitating
audit takeover and opening

128
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:28,500
up an account to receive
fraudulently obtained funds,

129
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,400
both from our own customers,

130
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,570
but also from other
financial institutions,

131
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:35,483
or other sources of wealth.

132
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,921
But we also see a small number,

133
00:06:38,922 --> 00:06:42,830
less and less all the
time of recruited mules.

134
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:45,693
So those that might be
an existing customer

135
00:06:45,693 --> 00:06:49,530
that have been recruited to siphon

136
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:53,150
out scan funds or other
funds that have been

137
00:06:54,135 --> 00:06:56,060
obtained by the fraudsters.

138
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:56,893
- Right.

139
00:06:56,893 --> 00:06:59,849
And what's the split more
or less from, you know,

140
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:01,840
from your perspective in Australia?

141
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,760
Is it more account opening

142
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:08,332
or witting or unwitting existing mules?

143
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:13,100
- Yeah, so having a rerun
on the stats the other day,

144
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,220
we can see that more than 90%

145
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,996
of our mule accounts are kind of new-

146
00:07:17,996 --> 00:07:19,859
- Okay, so newly opened accounts,

147
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:24,051
rather than trying to
go after existing folks.

148
00:07:24,051 --> 00:07:28,460
10 years ago, by the way, or 12 years ago,

149
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:31,250
during the economic
crisis, there was a lot

150
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,480
of recruitment going
on globally, you know,

151
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,660
in the US, in Australia, et cetera.

152
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,710
And account opening was a non-issue.

153
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:40,280
So, like just in like 10 or 12 years,

154
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,880
it flipped almost entirely
and account opening

155
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,590
is now the main thing
from your perspective.

156
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:50,732
Stacie, what sort of statistics
do you see in the US?

157
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,799
- Yeah, no, I, I think it's probably

158
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,340
on par with what our counterparts
in Australia are seeing.

159
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:00,609
The majority of our mules
at this point in time,

160
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:02,902
even just from a year ago, right?

161
00:08:02,902 --> 00:08:05,349
Or let's not go a year ago, we'll go back,

162
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:08,283
let's say 18 months ago,
right, before the pandemic,

163
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:12,900
I think banks in the US had a mule problem

164
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:16,859
but they were existing
mules or unwitting mules.

165
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,340
Right, so you had your unwitting
mules that had kind of been

166
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:23,082
on your books probably at
least 12 months or more,

167
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,023
that you would get
notified by the other FIs

168
00:08:27,023 --> 00:08:29,410
that there were some
fishy activity going on.

169
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:33,260
But I think in the last
nine, 12 to nine months here,

170
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:36,510
nine to 12 months,
we've seen that shift to

171
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,240
account opening is where it's at, right?

172
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,919
The breaches in the
industry have just opened

173
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:44,790
up doors to these fraudsters
to open up these accounts.

174
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,930
And, you know, it's shifted our focus

175
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:48,887
like you said, right, for years?

176
00:08:48,887 --> 00:08:51,510
On the credit side,
there was this, you know,

177
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:55,050
a lot of emphasis on
understanding identity theft and

178
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:59,615
and synthetic identities
and really jumping on the,

179
00:08:59,615 --> 00:09:02,790
you know, the account opening fraud train.

180
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:05,670
But on the bank side, you
know, our focus has always

181
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,030
been third party, right?

182
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:07,863
Third party fraud.

183
00:09:07,863 --> 00:09:10,310
Yeah, our job has been to make
sure that that person sitting

184
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:12,849
down at that device is our client, right?

185
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:15,050
And we've invested millions upon millions

186
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:18,349
of dollars to ensure we have
the right controls there.

187
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,910
And it's not just on our rear, rights?

188
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:23,557
It's changed our focus immensely to say,

189
00:09:23,557 --> 00:09:24,767
"We've got to stop.

190
00:09:24,767 --> 00:09:26,020
"We've got to stop the mules."

191
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:30,150
And, really it's game
of whack-a-mole, right?

192
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:33,544
It's like you shot one down and
then you gotta go over here.

193
00:09:33,544 --> 00:09:37,319
It's quite insane to
see how it shifted, Uri.

194
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,229
- Folks, if you were sitting
on the advisory board

195
00:09:40,229 --> 00:09:45,229
of a cyber crime syndicate
and, you know, basically

196
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,920
your role is to consult,

197
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,990
would your commit to investing
in account opening mules

198
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,510
or trying to recruit existing mules?

199
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:56,653
What would be your
advice to the syndicate?

200
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:00,020
Andy, maybe we'll start with you.

201
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,770
- Yeah. Yeah.

202
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:05,177
I think, I would do what the rest of the

203
00:10:05,177 --> 00:10:06,380
the fraud actors are doing.

204
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:09,770
And I would focus in on
the account opening and

205
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:12,956
and the reason for that is
because, well, first of all

206
00:10:12,956 --> 00:10:15,323
there's enough PII out in, you know,

207
00:10:18,092 --> 00:10:22,860
the environment to be able
to use either bad information

208
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,760
or even my own information
for that matter.

209
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,069
But there's so many inherent weaknesses

210
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:30,640
with third parties and
government and so forth

211
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,343
that I mentioned that are
just now being discovered.

212
00:10:34,991 --> 00:10:39,420
And, to me, rather than to
have to recruit somebody

213
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:43,209
and go through that, the time
that it takes to actually

214
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:46,610
have somebody come onboard
and be a unwitting mule,

215
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:49,401
and then or maybe even account takeover.

216
00:10:49,401 --> 00:10:51,103
Why not just go ahead and attack some

217
00:10:51,103 --> 00:10:53,239
of these inherent weaknesses
that are very evident.

218
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,890
And I think that's what's happening.

219
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:57,050
This is a whole brave new world

220
00:10:57,050 --> 00:11:00,030
for a lot of fraud actors
that are now just seeing

221
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:04,010
that the, you know, the
businesses that are being set

222
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:08,298
up for online and also
for government especially,

223
00:11:08,298 --> 00:11:11,446
that they're just lots of opportunity

224
00:11:11,446 --> 00:11:13,880
to be able to defraud them.

225
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,010
- By the way, you folks are coming from

226
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:19,540
large financial organizations,
some of the smaller banks,

227
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:24,360
can really suffer from such a trend.

228
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,300
Because if you think about it,
like if a small organization

229
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,420
let's say a new digital bank et cetera,

230
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:33,010
is being hit by a gang that
wants to open multiple accounts,

231
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:35,233
that's going to be problematic for them.

232
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:41,480
There was a case in California
a year and a half ago

233
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,970
or two years ago where it
was a new digital bank.

234
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:48,000
They had more or less like
100 new applications per day.

235
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,310
And all of the sudden it jumped to 1,000!

236
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,541
And they said,

237
00:11:51,542 --> 00:11:53,410
"Hey, finally the marketing
team is doing something!"

238
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:54,980
No, it's an attack.

239
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:58,080
You have 100 good users and you have

240
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,510
900 bad users every day.

241
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:02,600
Now it might be deposit fraud,

242
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,922
but it can also be opening new accounts.

243
00:12:05,922 --> 00:12:09,210
Interestingly enough, it
wasn't that it was some sort of

244
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:12,800
bot account opening,
like, it wasn't automated,

245
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,069
it was a human being,
probably a single person

246
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:18,823
that was opening 900 applications per day.

247
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:23,760
So that's essentially
something that can almost

248
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,750
like cripple a new financial organization

249
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,877
or small financial organization,

250
00:12:28,877 --> 00:12:31,065
because you can really cope
with those sort of numbers.

251
00:12:31,066 --> 00:12:33,360
If you have 100 good users,
you have 900 bad users,

252
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,410
you probably have to
stop receiving new users

253
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:38,709
or maybe stop moving money out, you know,

254
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:41,120
going out of the bank
or something like that.

255
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,913
So definitely the small
banks are also suffering.

256
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:49,170
Do we have any specific
interesting news stories, Stacie,

257
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:51,832
maybe you can share one of yours.

258
00:12:51,832 --> 00:12:55,410
- Sure. Yeah, no, I've got
lots of them, Uri (laughing).

259
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:57,839
So, you know, in the
past, you know, I had lots

260
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,130
of great stories about
business email compromise.

261
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:02,593
You know, mules that
we've had and you know,

262
00:13:03,506 --> 00:13:05,694
how we've been, you know,
the stories never match,

263
00:13:05,695 --> 00:13:08,970
and when you ask for answers,
right, they're very colorful.

264
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:11,477
But, you know, during the pandemic,

265
00:13:11,477 --> 00:13:14,439
as we started to see the surge

266
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,460
of unemployment insurance
payments from multiple states

267
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:21,517
coming into one account or SBA idle loans

268
00:13:22,387 --> 00:13:25,270
coming into consumer bank accounts, right?

269
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:26,460
Which isn't the norm.

270
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,150
I'm not saying they're all fraud

271
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:30,663
but there's a lot of fraud in that

272
00:13:30,663 --> 00:13:32,880
in that piece or
opportunity there as well.

273
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,660
But what we started to see was in this,

274
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:40,459
in kind of the dark web and
what people were hitting

275
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:44,140
individuals up to do these
mule account openings,

276
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:47,490
and then obviously
target the unemployment.

277
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:49,890
Get the money in, move
the money out as quickly

278
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:52,037
as they could through Cash App,

279
00:13:52,037 --> 00:13:56,536
Square, Zelle, any PTP, right,
debit card transactions.

280
00:13:56,536 --> 00:13:59,698
Just get the money out
as quickly as you can.

281
00:13:59,698 --> 00:14:02,520
But then the guidance
that they were given was,

282
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,540
then go ahead and file a dispute.

283
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:09,339
So file a reggy dispute against
your financial institution,

284
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:13,050
you'll get that money back in
provisional credit right away,

285
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:14,910
take that money and run, right?

286
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:17,735
So with your leveraging,
it's one thing when

287
00:14:17,735 --> 00:14:20,410
you're leveraging your own
information to open an account

288
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:23,207
and can commit this type of
activity, but, especially

289
00:14:23,207 --> 00:14:25,030
if you're using stolen PII,
you could care less, right?

290
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,589
So we just started to see the surge

291
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:31,897
of this incoming mule
activity, dispute claims,

292
00:14:31,897 --> 00:14:33,630
giving them provisional credit,

293
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:35,290
and then we never hear
from them again, right?

294
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:37,219
And obviously it turns out, you know, we

295
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,150
should've never given
them provisional credit,

296
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:40,949
and this was an industry
wide thing, right?

297
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:44,179
It wasn't just one FI,
everybody was seeing it.

298
00:14:44,179 --> 00:14:47,160
And, what was even crazier is, you know,

299
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,900
you didn't realize, this was
very early on in the pandemic

300
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:53,299
when we were all kind of
trying to get our hands around

301
00:14:53,299 --> 00:14:54,140
what we were dealing with.

302
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:56,180
We started to do the link analysis.

303
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:58,579
And when you started to look at, you know,

304
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:02,840
just what was logging
in to your accounts from

305
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,530
all over the world, you
would have one user who had

306
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:09,350
27 different devices
logging into that account,

307
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:11,020
checking the balances.

308
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:13,720
So, you just realize how
large this network was

309
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:17,310
of just how many people,
what was in play here.

310
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:19,320
And this was just the beginning, right?

311
00:15:19,321 --> 00:15:20,820
We're talking April of last year.

312
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:25,610
So it was just kind of
the, you know, that double,

313
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:27,469
you know, what do they call it?

314
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:28,563
Like the left hook, right?

315
00:15:28,563 --> 00:15:31,560
It kinda, it stung because, you know,

316
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,099
it's bad enough that
they're stealing money

317
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,040
from the government and as
a US taxpayer, that hurts.

318
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,939
But then to see them turn around and

319
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:43,069
hurt the bank on top
of it, needless to say,

320
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:46,113
we put the kibosh on
that relatively quickly.

321
00:15:46,113 --> 00:15:50,350
But it was definitely a new
spin from a mule perspective.

322
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:51,520
Maybe not as sexy as some of

323
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,390
the business email
compromise stories, Uri,

324
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:56,797
but certainly a different spin
that we weren't expecting.

325
00:15:57,883 --> 00:16:01,473
- Paul, any interesting
stories from your end?

326
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:06,970
- Yeah, so in Australia, we've
seen significant evidence

327
00:16:07,807 --> 00:16:11,320
of mules being recirculated
across the institutions,

328
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:14,120
and predominantly what we saw

329
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,690
in the last eight months
to two years is a number

330
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:21,660
of mules are opening up
accounts across different banks.

331
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:24,050
And the reason they were doing that is to

332
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:26,969
hop the funds and create
a distance between

333
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:31,133
the originating account to
to obviously the exit point.

334
00:16:31,133 --> 00:16:34,295
And, you know, one of the
things that we found through

335
00:16:34,295 --> 00:16:38,671
collaborating with our
peers in the industry

336
00:16:38,672 --> 00:16:41,955
is financial crime
detection is not competitive

337
00:16:41,955 --> 00:16:44,500
with a significant number of mules.

338
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,080
Many of which had the same attributes.

339
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:50,103
And one of the benefits we got from that

340
00:16:50,103 --> 00:16:52,339
was actually a benefit
for one of our costumes.

341
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:55,540
We had 90 year old lady
who was a victim of a scam

342
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:59,069
and because we'd identified
a number of mule accounts

343
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:03,580
opened by the same offenders,
we were able to stop the funds

344
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,859
basically her life savings from exiting.

345
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:08,599
And so that had a real
benefit and that came

346
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:11,137
as a result of that, you know,

347
00:17:11,137 --> 00:17:13,149
that collaboration across
those institutions,

348
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:16,359
but also by recognizing that, you know,

349
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:18,829
the MO was becoming
more and more prominent

350
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:21,332
through that online origination channel.

351
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,650
- Excellent.

352
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:26,569
Andy, any stories from your side?

353
00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:30,139
- Oh yeah. There's a
story a minute, sadly.

354
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:35,140
I think one that I'll relay
to you is a very, very, very,

355
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,230
large search engine company (laughing).

356
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:43,040
They had a situation
where, you know, ourselves

357
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:46,370
and other major financial
institutions started

358
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:51,370
getting a very high velocity
of small dollar deposits

359
00:17:52,212 --> 00:17:56,550
and that very very large
search engine company is also,

360
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:58,919
as we would expect, a marketing company.

361
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:02,470
And so they pay
individuals, you know, click

362
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:04,493
for click revenue, click ads.

363
00:18:04,493 --> 00:18:08,030
So that type of velocity perhaps was not

364
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:11,000
necessarily something they didn't expect.

365
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,650
Well, all of a sudden we
started having money go

366
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:15,630
into new accounts that were set up

367
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:18,440
for the purposes of of moving money.

368
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:23,380
And what was happening and
apparently is that on their side,

369
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:26,140
somebody had gotten a hold of the accounts

370
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:29,360
or the ACH account
numbers used to be able to

371
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,830
validate new accounts
within their search engine.

372
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:38,547
And so we were seeing and
other banks were seeing 30, 40,

373
00:18:38,547 --> 00:18:41,680
50,000 different transactions per day

374
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:44,430
inside of these mule accounts.

375
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:47,330
And because a lot of banks
don't necessarily look

376
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:49,310
at the inbound transactions,

377
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:51,129
there weren't necessarily any triggers.

378
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,610
Just lots coming in and then boom,

379
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:54,909
the money was actually leaving.

380
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:58,110
And so again, the weakness
was not necessarily

381
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:00,080
at the bank level, but
you could certainly say

382
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,913
that the absence of mule
monitoring may have been.

383
00:19:04,028 --> 00:19:05,460
But the absence, the weakness was actual

384
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:08,162
with the third party,
that large search engine,

385
00:19:08,162 --> 00:19:10,650
and they weren't doing
velocity checks, right?

386
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,336
So they didn't know whether

387
00:19:12,336 --> 00:19:13,674
they had to come in and going out.

388
00:19:13,674 --> 00:19:15,990
And, so that ended up being a
very interesting case study.

389
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:18,800
It took a while to resolve
because they had to resolve it.

390
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,113
- Right, and before we move on,

391
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:23,861
one of the stories around

392
00:19:23,861 --> 00:19:27,333
the unwitting mules is
romance scams, right?

393
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:30,490
Can anyone tell me a little bit about that

394
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:33,076
and how they use it to recruit mules?

395
00:19:33,076 --> 00:19:35,600
- Yeah. I can take that one.

396
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:40,250
So what we often see is our,

397
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:45,250
we'll have clients who
are almost tricked into,

398
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,960
through an online dating
service or something

399
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:51,530
to that effect, into
entering into relationships

400
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:54,166
with people who are perhaps not being

401
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:56,370
as honest as as they should be.

402
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:59,659
They convince their clients
that the funds they need to,

403
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:02,070
you know, utilize their bank account

404
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,492
for whatever reason, right?

405
00:20:03,492 --> 00:20:06,020
There's a number of
reasons that are leveraged

406
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:11,020
but they want to use our
customer's bank account information

407
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:14,670
to move money for their sister's surgery.

408
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:16,930
And, you know, because
of the laws in the land

409
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:20,069
where they live, they can't
move the funds to their account,

410
00:20:20,069 --> 00:20:21,042
yada, yada, yada.

411
00:20:21,042 --> 00:20:23,231
And then, and so the individual,

412
00:20:23,231 --> 00:20:27,180
our client believes that the
funds are for a good purpose,

413
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:29,930
and it's for one thing but
they're actually stolen funds,

414
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:31,610
either through business email compromise

415
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:34,679
or unemployment payments,
you know, social security,

416
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,150
whatever the case may be.

417
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:38,990
They're unauthorized
funds, they're stolen.

418
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:39,910
It's stolen money.

419
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:41,627
And our customer is given instructions,

420
00:20:41,627 --> 00:20:43,327
"When you get the funds, you know,

421
00:20:43,327 --> 00:20:45,496
"send it here, move it here."

422
00:20:45,496 --> 00:20:47,470
So our customer legitimately has no idea

423
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:50,059
that what they're doing is wrong.

424
00:20:50,059 --> 00:20:53,230
The sad thing is, is that
even when you confront them

425
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:55,200
with the evidence that what
you're doing, you know,

426
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,260
you're taking part in, you
know, illicit activity,

427
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:02,020
quite often it's a hard conversation,

428
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:04,680
because they're adamant
that this is legitimate

429
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:08,320
and they're their fiance in, you know,

430
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,520
insert country name here
is legitimate even though

431
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,460
they've never seen them
in person or, you know,

432
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:15,970
spoken to them over the phone.

433
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:19,850
So, it's a hard
conversation and they legit,

434
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:21,659
a lot of times there's
a lot of money movement

435
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,918
before you put the kibosh on it.

436
00:21:23,918 --> 00:21:26,659
But it's a very sad situation often

437
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,940
that we have to deal with every day.

438
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:32,065
- Yeah, and Uri, let me also add in,

439
00:21:32,065 --> 00:21:33,540
I know this is not
romance, but we're seeing

440
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:36,629
it seems like grandparents'
scams are picking up as well.

441
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:40,270
And, I know that my father was recently

442
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:43,468
nearly a victim of that where, you know,

443
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:46,617
his grandson, my son called him and said

444
00:21:46,617 --> 00:21:49,917
"I've been arrested in
West Virginia for a DUI.

445
00:21:49,917 --> 00:21:53,409
"And can you please send
money $5,000 to bail me out?"

446
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:56,180
And my father's index
finger was really close

447
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:59,641
to hitting that enter button if it wasn't

448
00:21:59,641 --> 00:22:02,559
for my, you know, watchful
mother who was looking

449
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:03,800
over his shoulder and
saying, "What are you doing?"

450
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,710
And anyway, it was really well done.

451
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:08,280
And I just, I bring it up because

452
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,830
I've heard several different
instances of people

453
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:14,220
even locally being attacked the same way.

454
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:16,300
- Right. All right.

455
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:20,320
I guess one of the main drivers for US,

456
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,580
the newest mule industry
is a stimulus fraud.

457
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:27,780
And what we see here is the percentage

458
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:31,889
of claims for basically
fraudulent, you know,

459
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:36,890
from almost zero to 56% in
the state of Washington,

460
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:40,940
or the fact that at some
point in the state of Arizona,

461
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:43,570
82% of the population were unemployed.

462
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,695
Which, of course, just suggests

463
00:22:45,695 --> 00:22:46,862
there was a huge wave of fraud.

464
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:53,170
Why, you know, is fraud
hitting the government relevant

465
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:55,463
to the banks in the US, you know,

466
00:22:55,463 --> 00:22:58,930
what's the relationship
between the two, Stacie?

467
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:06,422
- Yeah, so, you know,
there's a lack, you know

468
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:09,800
across the board, I think it.

469
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:14,419
With the pandemic, it really
brought to light that there

470
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:16,800
was a push to, as soon as you could,

471
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,460
get the money into the hands
of the people that need it.

472
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:23,037
Unfortunately with that
drive and that sense of,

473
00:23:23,037 --> 00:23:25,770
'We've got to help the people",

474
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:29,710
there was a lot of missing due diligence,

475
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:33,820
a lot of missing fraud
controls that enabled

476
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,990
the fraudsters to take
advantage of it, right?

477
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:40,210
And then you couple
that with perhaps a lack

478
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:44,430
of focus and visibility from the bank side

479
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:49,430
to what could be done from a
fraud app perspective, right,

480
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:51,610
a new account opening perspective.

481
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:54,498
It was almost the perfect storm, Uri.

482
00:23:54,499 --> 00:23:57,430
I think without having
the right controls to

483
00:23:57,430 --> 00:24:00,410
validate the legitimacy
of an unemployment claim

484
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:03,580
or the legitimacy of an SBA loan,

485
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,810
under a certain threshold,
if you didn't have

486
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:10,030
those eyes on it, those controls in place,

487
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:13,610
those velocity checks in place, right?

488
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:17,330
If anybody took the time
to read the SBA's review

489
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:20,899
internal audit of themselves
that was released last year

490
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,010
it was eye-opening.

491
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:24,830
And so we, I think for a lot of us,

492
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:27,645
it was get the money in
the hands of the people

493
00:24:27,645 --> 00:24:30,484
who need it at all,
you know, at all costs.

494
00:24:30,484 --> 00:24:31,570
And unfortunately, as you can see

495
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:34,669
from those numbers on
the screen with Arizona,

496
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:36,220
that's exactly what it was, right?

497
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:38,930
It's millions, hundreds of millions

498
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:40,460
of dollars in stolen funds.

499
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:43,050
So, I think the environment was ripe.

500
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:44,980
It was like I said, the perfect storm,

501
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,760
the environment was right for the taking

502
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,620
and that's what they did.

503
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:51,870
- Yeah, in all of these
billions of, you know,

504
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:55,629
funds from state level government agencies

505
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:58,200
had to go somewhere and
obviously not to the real

506
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,128
bank accounts of those
criminals, but to mule accounts,

507
00:25:01,128 --> 00:25:04,484
which was driving a lot of
the account opening activity.

508
00:25:04,484 --> 00:25:07,937
In Australia, did you see
something similar, Paul?

509
00:25:07,937 --> 00:25:12,558
- Yeah, so we, you know,
during COVID, the government

510
00:25:12,558 --> 00:25:16,140
executed the Early Release
Superannuation scam.

511
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:19,611
And those in the US may not
have heard of superannuation

512
00:25:19,611 --> 00:25:21,553
but it's basically your
savings from your income.

513
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:26,877
And what we really saw was
eminence that, you know,

514
00:25:26,877 --> 00:25:31,440
something that a scheme
or a saving facility

515
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,150
that is not really designed to be used

516
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:35,540
until you hit 65 years of age,

517
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:40,540
was also not designed to hand
out $10,000 here and there.

518
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:44,399
And there was really no effective controls

519
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,673
from a velocity perspective,
from an identity perspective,

520
00:25:48,673 --> 00:25:50,224
and from a transactional perspective.

521
00:25:50,224 --> 00:25:52,928
Much of which we take
for granted in banking.

522
00:25:52,929 --> 00:25:54,413
So, we saw quite a bit of that

523
00:25:54,413 --> 00:25:57,400
and the use of mules
for other wealth funds,

524
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:01,084
plus your own to exit those funds.

525
00:26:01,084 --> 00:26:04,010
- Okay, I'd like to move
to the second driver

526
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:05,960
which is faster payments.

527
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:10,960
And the US has seen a lot of
movement around faster payments

528
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:13,406
in the last few years because of Zelle.

529
00:26:13,406 --> 00:26:16,580
Andy, you know so much about Zelle

530
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:19,439
and certainly whenever you
have a new sort of scheme,

531
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,550
you also need the money
mules to go with it.

532
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:25,000
What can you tell us about
money mules and Zelle?

533
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:30,939
- Well, I can tell you that
when we first launched Zelle

534
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:34,390
we got our proverbial lunches eaten,

535
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:36,770
it was a you know, blood fest.

536
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:41,680
And the reason that it
was was because we set up

537
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:44,520
Zelle originally to do
what it was supposed to do,

538
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,113
which is move money as
quickly as possible, right?

539
00:26:47,953 --> 00:26:48,786
That's the idea.

540
00:26:48,786 --> 00:26:51,790
We want to be able to move
money now, not wait for it.

541
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:55,080
And so I know that when
we first launched it,

542
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,129
we had some real failures.

543
00:26:57,130 --> 00:26:59,610
One of them was that we moved money

544
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:01,723
without giving ourselves a breather.

545
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:06,000
The breather which we call the
kind of a review and release.

546
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,850
If something flags make sure that

547
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:13,149
if it's kind of sitting in
the middle of, you know,

548
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:14,750
being naughty or nice that you look at it.

549
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:17,170
And because, it's one thing to, you know,

550
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:19,240
for the naughties that
are evident, to stop them.

551
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,920
But it's the ones that are in the middle

552
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,260
and the middle just ate us out.

553
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:27,310
And so that desire for consumers

554
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:30,080
and also banks and then
also the competition

555
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,350
with index to move money
as quickly as possible

556
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:38,179
is really what Zelle is still all about.

557
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:39,840
Well, because money is moving so quickly.

558
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,189
And because as with anything else

559
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:47,190
the mitigation tools being
established to prevent fraud

560
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:51,640
from occurring is moving much slower

561
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:55,159
than the capability of
moving the money fast, right?

562
00:27:55,159 --> 00:27:57,000
So banks have been spending
the last several years

563
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,300
catching up and making certain

564
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:02,120
that those good fraud tools
and mitigation are in place.

565
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:05,780
Well, a lot are, but
then the problem still is

566
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:08,657
that if you're not looking out for your

567
00:28:08,657 --> 00:28:10,730
transactions that are
incoming on the mule side,

568
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:11,860
then you're probably not looking

569
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,449
at everything that you need to.

570
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:16,510
Outgoing money is certainly a risk,

571
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:18,730
but I think banks are
beginning to open their eyes

572
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:21,550
that incoming money, especially
when it's coming all kinds

573
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:24,570
of different ways and very
quickly at ya' is also as much

574
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:26,700
of a risk because it has to go someplace.

575
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:27,533
- Right.

576
00:28:28,494 --> 00:28:33,260
So "Piñata Time" Why We Should
All Start Bashing Mules".

577
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:38,245
And Stacie, why would banks
care about all of this?

578
00:28:38,245 --> 00:28:40,312
It doesn't really hit the bottom line.

579
00:28:40,313 --> 00:28:41,650
It's not a fraud issue.

580
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:43,600
What's the real risk?

581
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:47,409
Why focus on trying to detect

582
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:49,060
those mules from your perspective

583
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,990
- The reason, a couple of reasons, right?

584
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:57,060
First, it's the right thing to do, right?

585
00:28:57,060 --> 00:29:00,120
You don't want to allow
your institution to

586
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:03,300
be the one that allows
fraudsters to move money

587
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,310
in and subsequently out, right?

588
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:07,402
So, it's the right thing to do.

589
00:29:07,402 --> 00:29:11,900
I think, as you look at
the, in the United Kingdom,

590
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:14,870
as faster payments came on
board, kind of the shift

591
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:17,729
to really make sure,
it's not just making sure

592
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:20,070
that user sitting down is your client

593
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:23,379
and that they're authorized
to make that transaction.

594
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:26,760
It's making sure that
we are all responsible,

595
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:31,180
that we know what fraud
we have on our own books

596
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:33,520
and that we're not
allowing it, these accounts

597
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,879
to be leveraged to receive
those funds, right?

598
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:39,070
So in the UK, there is a
drive to make sure that

599
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:41,020
you know what's coming into your accounts.

600
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:44,010
And I think in the US
there's going to be a shift.

601
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:46,640
And I, unfortunately I think
the pandemic is going to

602
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,010
help us get there a lot
quicker than we would have,

603
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:51,440
but there's going to be a shift

604
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,647
from a regulatory perspective.

605
00:29:52,647 --> 00:29:55,090
And I think there's going
to be more eyes on us

606
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:58,510
to make sure it's not just
knowing your customer, right?

607
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:00,870
It's making sure that your customer is

608
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:02,409
doing the right thing and it's monitoring

609
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:05,240
those incoming payments
to see these red flags.

610
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:08,350
So I think there's going
to be a shift there

611
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:10,934
but from a reputation perspective,

612
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:13,002
I think it's regulatory and reputational.

613
00:30:13,002 --> 00:30:14,800
You just don't want to be known

614
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,950
as the company that allows, you know,

615
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:20,450
the FI that allows money
to flow freely (laughing)

616
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:21,390
in and out of your bank.

617
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:26,390
So I think that's the push
to all of us to do better.

618
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:30,280
- Right. So sounds very logical.

619
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,470
Let's actually start talking about how.

620
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:35,103
How can we do all of this?

621
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:39,010
So there are a lot of ways and, you know,

622
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:44,010
tools and methods to, you
know, do this mule bashing.

623
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:46,310
Starting with, you know, user data,

624
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:48,360
you know, trying to understand when users

625
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:52,246
open an account,
information about their KYC,

626
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:58,620
and national database linking,
device recognition, you know,

627
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:03,411
link analysis around the
phone and other attributes.

628
00:31:03,411 --> 00:31:06,310
Obviously after an account is opened,

629
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:09,710
what is being done inside that account?

630
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:12,400
It can also provide some clues

631
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,480
and then behavioral biometrics,

632
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,534
when someone is opening an account

633
00:31:16,534 --> 00:31:19,840
is the person familiar with the
data that they're inserting?

634
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,632
Are they familiar with the
process of account opening?

635
00:31:23,833 --> 00:31:26,920
If they're saying that
they're like 70 years old,

636
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:30,480
does it match their actual
behavior as they operate

637
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,290
on a mobile device or move the mouse,

638
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:34,970
and move between fields
and things like that?

639
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:36,840
So these are some of the analysis layers

640
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,985
that banks are using.

641
00:31:38,986 --> 00:31:40,931
Paul, let's start with you.

642
00:31:40,931 --> 00:31:45,309
What actually works well in
terms of detecting mules?

643
00:31:45,309 --> 00:31:47,858
Can you talk a little bit about
your mule detection program?

644
00:31:47,858 --> 00:31:50,538
- Yeah, so ours is very much light,

645
00:31:50,538 --> 00:31:54,290
but the most successful
thing that we use is

646
00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:59,290
behavioral biometrics
by applying, you know,

647
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:03,792
known behaviors of mule account openers

648
00:32:03,792 --> 00:32:07,139
and leveraging that to then identify

649
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:09,510
other accounts that have been opened

650
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:13,020
using the device or otherwise is critical.

651
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:15,730
I mean, the first use of that technology,

652
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:19,720
we found 50 mules in the first two alerts.

653
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,397
So behavioral biometrics is key

654
00:32:22,397 --> 00:32:25,870
and then also leveraging
some old fashioned analysis,

655
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:28,459
and looking at what we're seeing,

656
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:32,370
and taking advantage of the known knowns.

657
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:34,560
Understanding and leveraging
that information to shut

658
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:38,663
down accounts that are
behaving very much like mules.

659
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:42,399
- Okay. Stacie, what's
your experience here?

660
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,210
- Yeah, I think it's just as Paul said.

661
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:47,080
It's a layered approach.

662
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:50,338
It's looking at stopping
them from coming in the door

663
00:32:50,338 --> 00:32:54,976
using behavioral
biometrics, using, you know,

664
00:32:54,976 --> 00:32:58,990
some key third party tools
to ensure the validity

665
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:02,500
of the information from
an ownership perspective,

666
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:05,389
for instance, phone
ownership, things like that.

667
00:33:05,389 --> 00:33:06,969
And then once they're on
the books, it's really

668
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:10,850
looking at the incoming
payments, making sure there's

669
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:12,760
name matches on the incoming payments.

670
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:16,120
It's having, you know,
utilization strategies, right?

671
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,770
Most people who have normal
consumer bank accounts

672
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:21,318
aren't pulling in large sums
of money and immediately

673
00:33:21,318 --> 00:33:23,580
depleting them while not having any

674
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:25,860
normal consumer activity, right?

675
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:27,979
Mortgage payments, bill
payments, things like that.

676
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:31,803
So, it's building your
strategies around what does

677
00:33:31,803 --> 00:33:34,600
a known mule look like and anything

678
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:38,419
that meets that criteria,
you know, just pop it out

679
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:40,504
for somebody to take a look at.

680
00:33:40,504 --> 00:33:42,199
And it's really not as difficult

681
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,920
as people have made it seem.

682
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,570
It's relatively, I think it's going to be

683
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:47,950
easy for people to do

684
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:50,629
- So, Stacie, you mentioned
the other biometrics

685
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:53,860
and also Paul, can you
give a little bit more

686
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:57,719
grander explanation of what it
does for that specific thing?

687
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,230
- Sure. Yeah.

688
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:01,580
So the tools that we leverage
is really looking at,

689
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:03,973
so especially for our account opening,

690
00:34:03,973 --> 00:34:07,800
it's looking at are they
cutting and pasting the name

691
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:11,230
of the applicant into the application,

692
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:13,190
because that's not normal behavior, right?

693
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,949
You don't typically do that.

694
00:34:14,949 --> 00:34:18,060
So that cut and paste behavior
becomes incredibly important

695
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:20,779
as a giant red flag that you don't want

696
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:23,063
to let this guy in your house.

697
00:34:23,063 --> 00:34:26,013
So, and then once they're on
the books, it's really, again,

698
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:30,779
looking at the behavior, the age analysis

699
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:32,100
is a big one, too, right?

700
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,319
Does the activity that
they're performing really stay

701
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,804
in line with what you expect?

702
00:34:36,804 --> 00:34:38,886
And Paul, I don't want
to steal all the thunder.

703
00:34:38,887 --> 00:34:40,467
I'll let you go ahead and jump in

704
00:34:40,467 --> 00:34:41,683
on how you can leverage it.

705
00:34:41,684 --> 00:34:43,489
- Yeah, and I think it's learning

706
00:34:43,489 --> 00:34:47,299
and leveraging the networking
analysis that's undertaken.

707
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:50,793
So in addition to the cut and paste

708
00:34:50,793 --> 00:34:53,310
and the other activities
such as the $15,000 scheming

709
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:56,650
straight out, it's also
looking at, well, you know,

710
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:59,670
this device ID has been used previously.

711
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:02,759
So let's go and find all
the accounts that have

712
00:35:02,759 --> 00:35:04,950
been opened using the same
device ID and shut them

713
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:07,259
down because we know that
it's fraudulently used.

714
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:09,720
So therefore we can assume this is-

715
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:12,669
- Yeah, you always leverage
the behavioral piece to

716
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:15,070
identify the one account and then through

717
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:17,474
link analysis, you then-

718
00:35:17,474 --> 00:35:19,280
- Find additional ones.
- Right, yeah.

719
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,850
You just identify 10,
20, 30, 40, 50. Yeah.

720
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:23,810
- All right.

721
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:26,330
Let's move to getting a buy in.

722
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:30,529
So we're all excited about,
you know, detecting those mules

723
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:32,610
but we need the budget for this, right?

724
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:35,240
We need to create a
program and hire people

725
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,649
and maybe use some technology for that.

726
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:39,500
We're going to run a small simulation

727
00:35:40,335 --> 00:35:44,997
and Andy is going to
be the head of product

728
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:50,850
that has the budget for
something like this.

729
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:54,960
And Paul and Stacie, you are, you know,

730
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:59,960
the mule detection program
advocates internally.

731
00:36:00,737 --> 00:36:04,730
And, you know, go ahead and
explain to Andy, you know,

732
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:08,519
why you need this sort of budget

733
00:36:08,519 --> 00:36:09,352
and what you're going to do with it.

734
00:36:10,951 --> 00:36:13,900
- So just to be clear, I'm
the guy that needs to be,

735
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,360
I need to echo the voices that have stood

736
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,210
in the way of progress with this, right?

737
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:18,597
- Exactly. Yeah.

738
00:36:18,597 --> 00:36:20,450
But you should be reasonable, you know,

739
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:23,290
listen to these guys
and hear them out, Paul.

740
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:26,009
- Okay, yeah. Thank you.

741
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:28,000
Well, Andy, you've got the cash

742
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,970
so we need to influence you.

743
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:34,100
One of the key points we know is that most

744
00:36:35,028 --> 00:36:37,482
of our most vital weak points
exists on the customer side.

745
00:36:38,554 --> 00:36:40,870
And that includes in
the detection of fraud

746
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:43,174
but also the detection of mules.

747
00:36:43,175 --> 00:36:45,270
And what would you say

748
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:48,282
if I told you we could implement something

749
00:36:48,282 --> 00:36:53,282
that would reduce fraud
losses and mules by up to 40%?

750
00:36:53,754 --> 00:36:57,281
- You've already got my attention.

751
00:36:57,281 --> 00:36:59,226
(all chuckling)

752
00:36:59,226 --> 00:37:00,199
- Fantastic.

753
00:37:00,199 --> 00:37:03,730
Well, what I'm proposing and
I'll let Stacie fill in as well

754
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:07,550
is that we embark on a proof of value.

755
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:11,865
So we use a behavioral
biometrics solution to,

756
00:37:11,865 --> 00:37:15,026
in real world conditions to detect

757
00:37:15,027 --> 00:37:18,570
and shut down the old accounts
and fraudulent behavior.

758
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:22,070
So we use that proof of value
to boot up business tests

759
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:24,943
to justify a more substantive investment.

760
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,370
- Yeah, and, I would
add Andy that, you know,

761
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:33,380
I think it's important that we put money

762
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:35,570
up against this from a short-term

763
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:37,644
and long-term perspective, right?

764
00:37:37,644 --> 00:37:39,310
Short-term, let's stop getting these guys

765
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:41,455
on our books, right?

766
00:37:41,455 --> 00:37:43,340
So let's put in the right
controls to behavioral biometrics.

767
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:46,278
Let's invest in those controls,

768
00:37:46,278 --> 00:37:47,736
keep the bad guys out, right?

769
00:37:47,737 --> 00:37:50,850
Save our reputation, keep us
out of regulatory scrutiny,

770
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:53,939
but then from a long-term perspective,

771
00:37:53,939 --> 00:37:55,740
we need to develop and utilize tools

772
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:59,009
to mitigate the mule
problem from our books.

773
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:01,490
So get rid of the mules,
sitting on our books today.

774
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:06,098
So short-term, let's stop
them from getting in the door.

775
00:38:06,099 --> 00:38:09,150
Long-term, let's get
rid of them and protect

776
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:14,003
ourselves from a reputational
risk and perception issue.

777
00:38:14,003 --> 00:38:17,620
But also from a regulatory
oversight perspective, let's stay

778
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:20,480
off the radar as well, because
we're doing the right thing.

779
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,515
And that's the most important thing,

780
00:38:22,515 --> 00:38:23,852
let's do the right thing.

781
00:38:23,852 --> 00:38:27,040
- Okay, can I go back to Paul 40% again?

782
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:30,419
Paul was that a 40% reduction in the

783
00:38:30,419 --> 00:38:35,040
in the customers fraud
or the bank's fraud?

784
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:38,820
- Yeah, that's a 40%
reduction in the banks fraud,

785
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:41,210
but also that has a direct correlation

786
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:44,281
with fraud against customers
because we're detecting

787
00:38:44,281 --> 00:38:45,223
those mule accounts.

788
00:38:46,369 --> 00:38:48,640
And neither of these
things occur in isolation,

789
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,482
so we're helping out customers.

790
00:38:51,483 --> 00:38:53,900
- All right, folks, we need to wrap up.

791
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,973
Andy, I hope that you were convinced.

792
00:38:57,153 --> 00:39:00,136
- Yeah, I'm getting there (laughing).

793
00:39:00,136 --> 00:39:02,203
- And at the end of the day,

794
00:39:02,203 --> 00:39:04,223
everyone is in the same boat.

795
00:39:05,978 --> 00:39:08,510
And just like, you know, 10 seconds call

796
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:12,570
to action by Stacie, maybe,

797
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:14,944
what would be your, you know,

798
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:17,255
let's say that you have like
a "Superbowl" commercial

799
00:39:17,255 --> 00:39:19,380
and you need like a
sentence just to summarize

800
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:21,267
and wrap up all of this.

801
00:39:21,267 --> 00:39:22,240
What would you say?

802
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,779
- I'm going to steal the Nike slogan

803
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:26,910
and I'm going with, "Just Do It", right?

804
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:29,787
I was gonna go with
Spike Lee, I think it is,

805
00:39:29,787 --> 00:39:31,968
"Do the right thing", right?

806
00:39:31,968 --> 00:39:33,299
(laughing) I think that that's
probably not it, but yeah.

807
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:35,495
Let's just get it done.

808
00:39:35,495 --> 00:39:38,830
Invest now ,it'll save you
down the road, really will.

809
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:39,840
- Okay.

810
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:44,587
Hey guys, I hope that it
was insightful, interesting.

811
00:39:44,587 --> 00:39:48,060
We're happy to connect around all of this

812
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:51,330
and bash those mules.

813
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:52,560
Thank you very much.

814
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,620
- Absolutely. Thank you guys.

815
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:55,640
- Thank you all.
