1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:01,933
- Good afternoon.

2
00:00:01,933 --> 00:00:03,010
My name's Anna Wheeler.

3
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:06,560
And we are here for today's panel

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,000
on being One Step Ahead: Keeping
Security at the Forefront

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,120
through obviously referencing COVID.

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,750
So I'd like my panelists to go ahead

7
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:16,309
and start introducing themselves.

8
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:18,599
So Kelley, would you like to kick us off?

9
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,760
- Absolutely, thanks for having me.

10
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,260
I'm Dr. Kelley Misata.

11
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,210
I am Founder and CEO, Sightline Security.

12
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:30,210
We help nonprofits assess and
prioritize cybersecurity risk.

13
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,110
I'm also Executive Director

14
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:35,000
of the Open Information
Security Foundation

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,163
and we build sacado which
is an open source IDS.

16
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,069
- Hi, my name is Theo Zafirakos

17
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:44,100
I'm a CISO for Terranova Security.

18
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,590
In addition to being responsible

19
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:47,050
for our internal security program,

20
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:50,430
I assist our clients
implement effective security

21
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,760
awareness programs to defend
against cyber threats.

22
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,210
- And I'm Michael Sechrist.

23
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:56,460
I am Executive Director

24
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,023
for Threatened Risk
Management at Athenahealth.

25
00:00:59,023 --> 00:01:01,890
Athenahealth is a healthcare IT company

26
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:05,340
and we serve the healthcare
industry particularly.

27
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,730
Within Athenahealth I am focused on

28
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:09,920
threat intelligence cyber risk management,

29
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,111
control compliance as well
as attack surface reduction.

30
00:01:13,111 --> 00:01:14,440
- Thank you all for the introductions

31
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,759
and thank you for being here.

32
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,780
I know it's been definitely
an interesting year

33
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,090
to kind of watch with
quite a few curve balls.

34
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:24,780
So I'd like to start
with a general question

35
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,630
kind of going into as we
had this big rush and push

36
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:31,910
to move online when the
pandemic hit, how did the focus

37
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:36,910
on accessibility affect
the security conversation?

38
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,289
Did it push it more to the forefront?

39
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:41,910
Did it kind of get
pushed to the background?

40
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:44,410
We'd love to hear how
each of you handle that?

41
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:47,580
- Oh, well, I'm happy to kick off.

42
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:52,030
From the nonprofit space
going from serving communities

43
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:54,610
and population is very
much in the physical space

44
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:58,080
to all of a sudden moving
all operations remotely

45
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,810
was a huge shift.

46
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:02,520
And so their first challenge
for many of our members

47
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,610
was really about how do
we just handle technology

48
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:09,810
with security right on the heels of that.

49
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:14,330
But for them, it really was
how do we serve our mission

50
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:17,508
with a business environment that was

51
00:02:17,508 --> 00:02:19,763
in some respects very foreign to them.

52
00:02:20,705 --> 00:02:23,210
So it's been an interesting challenge

53
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:26,420
particularly as I think
many of the organizations

54
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:30,149
in our community felt
like it was going to end.

55
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,900
I think as many of us did,

56
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,480
it was gonna end in a few months

57
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,760
and we were all gonna
go back into the office.

58
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,769
So a year later now they're
really starting to think

59
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:41,177
about security in a whole new way.

60
00:02:43,417 --> 00:02:44,950
- I could go next.

61
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:48,709
What we noticed is that a lot
of organizations were focusing

62
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,570
on being productive and
they were very concerned

63
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:55,132
with the physical and the mental
health of their employees.

64
00:02:55,991 --> 00:03:00,070
So security was a little
bit of an afterthought.

65
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:02,000
In our case, it was really a test

66
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,710
of our business continuity plan

67
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:08,340
because this was really a
business continuity test.

68
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,740
The technologies and what we had in place

69
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:15,230
allowed us to deploy all
our workforce remotely

70
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:17,200
and everybody was able to work remotely.

71
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,380
Organizations had to start thinking

72
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,640
about how to protect their connections.

73
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,070
How are they're going to connect.

74
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,630
how they're gonna protect the systems

75
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:27,769
that these employees are
gonna be using remotely

76
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:31,495
or how all the systems
were going to be accessed

77
00:03:31,495 --> 00:03:35,540
on a regular basis to
perform their daily routines.

78
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,470
And finally, the biggest concern was

79
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:40,150
how are we gonna continue
protecting information

80
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,320
now that everybody's working remotely

81
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,500
and we need to have different approaches

82
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:48,180
for collaboration and sharing documents.

83
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:51,740
And the last challenge I would say was

84
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:54,600
how do we detect and
respond to security events.

85
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,410
When everybody's in the office
it's much easier to talk

86
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:00,799
to someone, to call someone,
to reach to a colleague

87
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,830
when we're working remotely
detecting and responding

88
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:07,523
to security events became
more of a challenge.

89
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,910
- Yeah and to kind of piggyback
on what Theo was describing

90
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,870
it was similar.

91
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:18,970
During the pandemic I
transitioned from another company

92
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:22,710
that was also doing
managed services in effect

93
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:26,212
and in some ways
Athenahealth does as well.

94
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:33,110
And it had to be a quick pivot
to get a lot of positions

95
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,721
and folks that typically do cybersecurity

96
00:04:37,721 --> 00:04:42,721
in locked locations with
multiple badge entries

97
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,990
and even potentially fingerprint entries

98
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:50,560
into now we've got to
reposition those folks

99
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,253
to have them work in an
environment that is bounded at home

100
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:02,100
with other potentially
non cleared individuals

101
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,729
in their households
nearby to be near the data

102
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:10,533
that is being accessible on their devices.

103
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:13,560
So it's not something
that hasn't been thought

104
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,950
about before obviously with BYOD policies.

105
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,310
I have been top of mind in a lot of places

106
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:21,820
for the past half a decade or so

107
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:26,550
but this just is really
brought to light the fact that

108
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:29,570
when we talk about digital assets

109
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:32,670
a lot of times we talk
about, are they on premise

110
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:35,230
or are they gonna be cloud-based

111
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,580
and immediately we had to switch and pivot

112
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:42,580
from on-premise device
thinking to also now

113
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,720
how many folks that
typically have worked those

114
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,880
on premise devices, how
can they access them

115
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:53,740
from a cloud environment
or remotely speaking?

116
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,520
So it really brought that to life.

117
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,560
The other part of it too
is that work-life balance

118
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,560
literally just came into the cyber world

119
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:07,991
in a much more impactful way.

120
00:06:07,991 --> 00:06:12,991
We have our devices now at
home primarily with employees

121
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:19,397
and the work-life separation
is also blended together

122
00:06:19,397 --> 00:06:22,730
for a lot of these devices.

123
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,930
And so that brings
another security challenge

124
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:27,400
'cause you're really trying
to secure doing a whole

125
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,380
of human approach with security rather

126
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:33,610
than just securing the
person when they're at work.

127
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:36,610
- So Mike, Theo obviously
did a really great job

128
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:39,240
explaining the business
continuity requirements

129
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,220
and all of that.

130
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:43,810
How do you feel that the
security conversation changed

131
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:48,810
and evolved pre during and
post kind of the initial rush?

132
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:53,820
- Well, I think it was
Kelley who was touching on

133
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,140
with the two weeks to flatten the curve.

134
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:59,380
And we remember that
and that this was likely

135
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:02,710
a temporary thing when that...

136
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,930
This is like a straight out
of a force majeure clause

137
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,730
in a contract, this is act of God.

138
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:14,730
It overrides basically the
previous clauses and concerns

139
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,910
that you would have around security

140
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:19,060
'cause you literally have to take in

141
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:21,320
the physical health first.

142
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:24,120
So it flips the conversation
to just making this

143
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,290
forcing the issue that this is going

144
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:30,590
to be work from home for
a long period of time

145
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:34,020
and that securing that experience

146
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,060
for your employees is a lot different

147
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,610
than securing them when you're

148
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:42,259
in a just a traditional work
environment work setting.

149
00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:43,559
- Thank you.

150
00:07:43,559 --> 00:07:46,210
Theo, can you tell us
about the human risk factor

151
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:47,450
and how that plays a role

152
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:50,223
in leaving organizations vulnerable?

153
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:56,277
- Yeah, so the human risk
factor addresses many

154
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:59,760
of the new cybersecurity concerns

155
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,270
that we saw organizations face.

156
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:05,479
We saw an increase in the
number of phishing attacks

157
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,970
leveraging the current
events to target users.

158
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:12,210
Also a data leakage and
data loss became a concern

159
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:14,070
because now users were working remotely,

160
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:17,810
they were potentially
using personal devices,

161
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:21,430
personal systems to
connect and store data.

162
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:23,450
So data loss, data leakage

163
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:27,320
and things that we were typically
taking for granted before.

164
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:31,050
People tend to connect
at work on a network

165
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:33,440
that is secured and protected

166
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,990
whereas now they're
working from a home network

167
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:38,070
where they are the administrators

168
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:40,100
of that home environment
and that home network

169
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,698
and we have to make certain

170
00:08:41,698 --> 00:08:45,490
the apply the same
strong security policies

171
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:49,230
and controls within
their home environment.

172
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:52,590
So do they know how to
protect wifi connections?

173
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:55,100
Do they know how to
maintain all the systems

174
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:58,490
on the network are secured and patched

175
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:01,940
protecting both the corporate
and the personal devices

176
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:05,390
from viruses and so on.

177
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:08,870
So the challenge became
how do we communicate now

178
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:11,670
all these requirements during a pandemic

179
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:13,349
where everybody's stressed,

180
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:15,871
everybody not only fears about their job

181
00:09:15,871 --> 00:09:17,780
but also fears about their health.

182
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:22,020
So providing effective
communications became a challenge.

183
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:25,689
So we saw a lot of our
clients looking at ways

184
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,140
to effectively communicate the threats

185
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,840
because they were important.

186
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,750
And the value was not only
in the professional side

187
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,170
but also on the personal side.

188
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:38,819
So it became really, really
important to teach users

189
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:42,280
on how to detect and how
to appropriately respond

190
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,630
to the security events.

191
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:47,333
If you see something, say
something don't ignore it.

192
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:50,100
Establishing a culture of security

193
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,690
not just defending myself

194
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:53,453
but depending everybody around me.

195
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,300
- So just as you're talking

196
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,260
I was getting inspired and thinking

197
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:02,250
about actually some of the
other things that we saw too

198
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,910
was that people are distracted.

199
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,480
So when you take people out of

200
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,690
that physical work environment,
you bring them into home,

201
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:12,000
all of a sudden they've
got all this stuff going on

202
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,540
around them and they're
juggling so many aspects

203
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:18,207
that we were actually
seeing that the people

204
00:10:18,207 --> 00:10:20,410
or the organizations that fell prey

205
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:23,300
to particularly phishing
attacks were the ones

206
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,030
that really were just trying
to get their work done

207
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:28,209
with all of that other
stuff going around them.

208
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,110
It wasn't as if they weren't trained

209
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:31,940
or weren't aware of stuff,

210
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:36,540
but those distractions
really made a huge impact

211
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:39,439
on their own ability to step back and say,

212
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,980
Oh maybe I should take
a pause before engaging

213
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:46,920
with this particular email
or this particular situation.

214
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,969
And I think that's been really difficult

215
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:54,410
for a lot of people to
manage as we're moving

216
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:56,833
into what this next
phase is gonna look like.

217
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:01,760
- Pause for a moment, take the time

218
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,470
to inspect the message,
to inspect the website.

219
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,400
Think before you click.

220
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,673
- Yes, yes.

221
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:10,800
- Absolutely and thank you both.

222
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,770
So I guess to follow up to that,

223
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:15,630
do you feel that the security awareness

224
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:17,960
and the education efforts have been

225
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,640
since they've obviously
been kind of redoubled

226
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,210
throughout the new
environment, do you feel

227
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:26,030
like those are really had a big impact?

228
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:29,520
And do you think they're
actually being more effective

229
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,550
in preventing kind of the fallout

230
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,349
before, during and after the crisis?

231
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,780
- Well, it's better than doing nothing

232
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:40,180
and only time will tell but
we have the responsibility

233
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:45,180
as organizations to inform
our employees on what to do.

234
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:48,220
Since the pandemic we saw a huge increase

235
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:51,000
of organizations implementing
awareness programs

236
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,940
and phishing simulations
because they were lacking

237
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,340
the program before and they needed

238
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,230
to inform their employees.

239
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:00,810
I hear a lot of times people say that

240
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,780
people are the weakest link

241
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,300
and I don't agree with that term.

242
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:09,449
I like to say it's the
link that has been given

243
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:12,250
the least attention and
love over time, right?

244
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:15,830
Everybody's focusing on
technology and processes

245
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:17,869
but we've always forget the people

246
00:12:17,869 --> 00:12:20,430
who are behind and not only implementing

247
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:23,099
but also using those
technologies and processes.

248
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:27,020
So we have a responsibility
at least we informed them

249
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:29,790
and for users to understand
that they have a role to play.

250
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:33,329
It's not just the responsibility
of the IT department

251
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:36,213
or the ISS department to stop everything.

252
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:41,420
It takes participation from everyone.

253
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:45,819
In recent surveys that we
have conducted among end users

254
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:48,970
almost 50% of the users survey believe

255
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:51,270
that technology alone could
stop social engineering

256
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:54,010
and they don't have a
role to play in that,

257
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:55,350
which is not true.

258
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:58,380
Social engineering
targets the human element

259
00:12:58,380 --> 00:12:59,650
not just the technology.

260
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:02,906
So people need to know
that the they need to

261
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:05,220
and it can be part of the solution.

262
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,420
- I could not agree more.

263
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:10,219
I actually think it's worth
kind of highlighting the fact

264
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:12,240
that we have applications
and we have programs

265
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,890
who they have a specific job to do

266
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:16,660
whereas people have 50 jobs to do.

267
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:19,469
So throwing this in on top
is definitely something

268
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:24,470
that has come to the
forefront and ways I think.

269
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,050
I think when you needed to happen

270
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:28,780
but kind of got that nice shove.

271
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:31,709
- I think what's interesting
is sort of the organizations

272
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:36,710
that have created those cultures
around security early on

273
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:39,910
so when you have employees that move

274
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:43,079
into the work environment
or the remote environment

275
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,453
they have muscle memory.

276
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:48,900
We always equate it
back to password usages

277
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:52,040
way back in the day when
we were doing passwords 123

278
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,839
and the admin and my favorite dog.

279
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:59,839
Now we actually have users
doing passwords much better

280
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:03,860
not perfect, but much better
because it's muscle memory

281
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,800
it's habits that are being formed.

282
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,740
And I think one of the biggest takeaway is

283
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:11,970
that the underserved sectors
that I particularly work in

284
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:16,490
is that how do we help
create better muscle memory

285
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:19,970
so we don't have to wait
for another big global event

286
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:23,120
to happen to sort of raise
that level of awareness.

287
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,623
How can we just kind of
bake it back in again?

288
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:27,693
- Absolutely.

289
00:14:27,693 --> 00:14:29,720
And unfortunately in the cyber world

290
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,830
we have events all the time.

291
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:34,100
So definitely appreciate that.

292
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:37,910
Before I continue on, I was
so excited to kick this off.

293
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:41,180
I was completely remiss in my
duties of please asking people

294
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,463
if they have questions to jump in

295
00:14:43,463 --> 00:14:45,269
and to put those in the chat

296
00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:48,120
don't worry about waiting until the end.

297
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,450
So for the next question,
we're gonna go to Mike.

298
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:54,080
Mike, the healthcare industry
was directly affected

299
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:58,050
by the pandemic on an
unreasonably large scale.

300
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:01,099
How did bad actors take
advantage of the pandemic

301
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,440
to carry out cyber attacks?

302
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,690
And what steps did the
healthcare industry take

303
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:09,340
to secure tele-health and what
did they still need to do?

304
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,730
Kind of give us that last mile as well.

305
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:13,150
- Okay, sure.

306
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,610
I'll probably break it up into chunks.

307
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:15,610
There's a lot there.

308
00:15:16,861 --> 00:15:21,780
I think one of the first
things that was concerning

309
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:26,780
was the trends in ransomware
have gone up quite a bit.

310
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:32,385
There was a big kind of doll in the past

311
00:15:32,385 --> 00:15:36,480
like a few years ago, and
then they kind of re-emerged

312
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,480
as a threat actors became
better at monetizing the data

313
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,569
than they had before.

314
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:46,600
And that also coincided with the growth

315
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,910
of cryptocurrency payments

316
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:53,910
for that whole kind of
cottage criminal industry.

317
00:15:55,630 --> 00:16:00,630
And so the initial concern is
ransomware going to go after

318
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:06,582
this thing and kick these
healthcare organizations

319
00:16:06,582 --> 00:16:08,020
while they're down.

320
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,780
Are they going to start
to take them offline

321
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:15,780
and when they're overflowing
with patients potentially

322
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:18,113
from COVID-19 exposures.

323
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,901
And so that was a big fear.

324
00:16:20,901 --> 00:16:25,901
We saw that there was
essentially kind of a pause

325
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,459
from cyber criminals for a period of time

326
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:34,460
where they took a break because
of this kind of acceptance

327
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,210
that they didn't want to kick
these organizations too hard

328
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:43,020
while they're down because
likely it would probably bring

329
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,770
further law enforcement
action at that time.

330
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:49,400
So there was a bit of a
period that didn't happen

331
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:53,530
but then it did re-emerge
quite a bit in May of 2020.

332
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:56,079
And it hasn't really slowed down

333
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,620
where there is constantly a daily influx

334
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:02,019
of organizations that are
getting infected with ransomware

335
00:17:02,019 --> 00:17:03,940
that they are potentially able

336
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,910
to do double extortion threats

337
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:09,069
where they're not only
asking for you to pay

338
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:12,220
for a decryption key but
then they're also asking

339
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,770
for payment faster and more money

340
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:16,730
because they're going to
sell the data on the internet

341
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:20,050
and to have a reputational
hit impact the company.

342
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:24,599
So that is for companies that deal

343
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:26,219
with protected health information

344
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:29,715
that's a significant
concern because of the fines

345
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:34,715
and requirements associated
with PHI loss and a breach.

346
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:37,760
So that initially was the biggest concern.

347
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,013
It still remains.

348
00:17:40,909 --> 00:17:45,909
So the healthcare industry
really responded to it

349
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:51,120
by ramping up intelligence
efforts to coordinate.

350
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,020
There was the COVID-19
cyber threat coalition

351
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:59,600
that was created among
kind of cyber responders

352
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,000
within the industry to
track different threats

353
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,593
and indicators that might
be associated with groups.

354
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:12,050
And this is turned into really a blend

355
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:14,280
of life and death in some instances.

356
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:18,670
There was a good quote
I pulled out of a study

357
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:23,020
that was done two years ago
from Vanderbilt University.

358
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:27,090
And it said, this was just with breaches.

359
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:30,050
And it found that hospitals
that had been breached

360
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:32,820
or post-breach over the
next two to three years

361
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,810
saw increases in the 30 day mortality rate

362
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:37,550
for their patients.

363
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:42,550
It also found that the
time it took to require

364
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,590
to get an EKG increased in some cases

365
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:47,169
by more than two minutes.

366
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:49,190
And the quote was in two
minutes is a big deal

367
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:50,430
when you're suffering a heart attack

368
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,873
obviously that's the case.

369
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:57,800
So they're real world implications
of these data breaches

370
00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:00,380
more so with ransomware we saw hospitals

371
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:04,360
and other organizations taken
offline sometimes for weeks

372
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:08,379
and in one case there was
a first recorded death

373
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,360
of a cyber breach.

374
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,479
I think that took place
at a hospital in Germany

375
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,170
when they needed to transport a patient

376
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:15,610
from one hospital to another

377
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:18,979
because their system had been
infected with ransomware.

378
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:23,980
So all this is to say that
I think the investment

379
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:27,629
that was already, this
industry is already been

380
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:29,610
under invested over a period of time.

381
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:30,990
It was quickly seeing we really need

382
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:35,220
to make a significant investment
more than any other time

383
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:39,700
in the past to grab a better handle

384
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,590
on what our attack surfaces

385
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:44,250
for each organization within healthcare,

386
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:49,250
how to secure that data and
then how to build the trust

387
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:53,040
that really is essential for whether it's

388
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,840
in the physical world with healthcare

389
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,230
but also in the cyber
world with patient data

390
00:19:58,210 --> 00:19:59,840
from privacy and cybersecurity.

391
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,850
And that was really a
big push from our company

392
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:06,379
as well as what I saw across the industry.

393
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:09,210
And you could see that
and just the reporting

394
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:13,640
and the alerting that we were
getting in the United States

395
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:17,950
like the healthcare AIESEC organization.

396
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,870
So that would be a kind of the overview

397
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:23,320
of what has transpired a little bit

398
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,419
with healthcare industry in the past year.

399
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:29,399
- What do you see as
the most prevalent thing

400
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,640
that needs to be done now
that we're kind of getting

401
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,723
through some of the shell shock?

402
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,733
- That's a good question.

403
00:20:36,733 --> 00:20:41,733
I still find that when
you think health care

404
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:45,163
you don't typically think cybersecurity.

405
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:49,946
And I think that if a healthcare executive

406
00:20:49,946 --> 00:20:54,280
they've been totally focused
on all the physical issues

407
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,910
that have come arise with COVID-19,

408
00:20:56,910 --> 00:21:00,630
I think that the voting
more time and investment

409
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:05,050
especially as patients have come to rely

410
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:07,560
upon virtual care more and more

411
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,260
that they need to make that investment

412
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:13,340
in the IT infrastructure
and the security of that

413
00:21:14,613 --> 00:21:16,610
than they ever have before.

414
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:19,209
And so whether that's are going to argue

415
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:24,210
with boards or with seeking
outside financial investment,

416
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:29,210
things have to happen to improve

417
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:32,760
and provide a level of
care now that the country

418
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,970
and citizenry has come to expect

419
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:36,933
that of our healthcare industry.

420
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,409
- Thank you.

421
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:41,090
So Kelley, we've kind of just heard

422
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:42,540
on what these big industries

423
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:45,120
with these really large
budgets have been up to.

424
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,030
How do nonprofits kind of differ in that

425
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:51,460
and do you feel like the
nonprofit requirements

426
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,270
tend to get a little bit left in the dark

427
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:56,093
or does that vary across
the nonprofit industry?

428
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,370
- Yeah, it's a great question.

429
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:01,129
I think one of the
biggest challenges is that

430
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:03,770
when we think about
nonprofit organizations

431
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:08,440
and at last count which was 2016 actually

432
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,353
I'm waiting for updated numbers.

433
00:22:10,353 --> 00:22:13,460
Last count we had 1.5 million nonprofits

434
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:15,820
in the United States alone.

435
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:18,730
I would bet as we get through the pandemic

436
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:21,370
and you can just imagine all the profits

437
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:24,899
that have spun up in
response to the pandemic

438
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,100
that that number's gonna leap.

439
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,860
But what's been challenging is
is that the nonprofit sector

440
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:32,669
as a whole has just
been sort of categorized

441
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:36,020
as one big thing whereby we are still,

442
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:38,100
and this is some of the work
we're doing at Sightline

443
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:41,879
is we're actually unpacking
what does the sector look like.

444
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,610
How many fit in the small bucket,

445
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:45,016
how many will fit in the medium bucket

446
00:22:45,017 --> 00:22:48,660
and how many are the big
guys like these big companies

447
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:53,540
of my fellow panelists that
might have security teams

448
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,990
in place.

449
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:57,700
For some of the organizations
that we're working with

450
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:02,110
we're starting to see them look
at security very differently

451
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:05,600
for a lot of the reasons
that Mike just mentioned

452
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,459
they've had to go to remote environments.

453
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:11,430
They have to serve these
populations very differently.

454
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:13,380
I mean, imagine a food bank

455
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:17,020
where you can't have your doors
open for people to get food.

456
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:19,220
So where do you do in lieu of that?

457
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:21,560
Many of them are giving gift cards

458
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,500
so that people can go buy groceries.

459
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,410
That's a whole different dynamic

460
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:27,260
for their business structure.

461
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:29,440
So they're starting to think about it.

462
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,920
The other thing that's
really been startling is

463
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,200
that they're finding that
they're actually more prone

464
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,240
for attacks recently.

465
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,640
So we're seeing a lot of our members say,

466
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,813
why are we being fished
now more than ever?

467
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:46,050
The good news is that they're recognizing

468
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:48,300
but they are still falling prey to it

469
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:52,680
and so we're helping them
unpack that personal feeling.

470
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,950
And I think nonprofits
are because their missions

471
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:58,070
are so close to their
hearts that they feel like

472
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:00,929
if there's an attack on
them, it's a personal thing.

473
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:03,480
And we're trying to help
them unpack that idea

474
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:07,670
of that you might just
have been one of many

475
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:09,430
that got this phishing attack.

476
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:12,803
It wasn't directed
necessarily at you yourselves.

477
00:24:13,992 --> 00:24:16,159
And I think where the
challenge is particularly

478
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,950
from the security standpoint comes from

479
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:21,610
is that because we're bucketing nonprofits

480
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:23,629
in this big, massive space,

481
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:26,580
we're also bucketing a
lot of the assumptions.

482
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:29,050
So many in the security space are saying

483
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,500
nonprofits don't have money.

484
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,870
They don't have resources.

485
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:34,040
They don't have understanding of this...

486
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:37,330
That is we're finding actually some

487
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:40,449
of that not to be true,
which is really exciting.

488
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:42,620
Some of it is true, I will admit

489
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:46,100
but some of it really isn't that pervasive

490
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:49,110
as you would imagine in the security space

491
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:52,260
or in that security
mindset of the non-profits.

492
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:56,210
So it's an ever evolving process

493
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:58,280
and I think they're trying to keep up

494
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:01,560
with the rest of the world
as far as cyber security

495
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:04,290
is concerned and information
security is concerned

496
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:06,330
but they're asking all
the right questions,

497
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:07,610
which is wonderful.

498
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:09,250
I mean, it's very, very exciting

499
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:11,950
to see that they're
stepping up and saying,

500
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:14,230
do I need to worry about having Zoom on

501
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:16,920
and having people around me listening?

502
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:20,170
What if I actually am
engaging with a donor talking

503
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:22,040
about their private information

504
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,420
while my kids are running around?

505
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,830
Do I need to be thoughtful around that?

506
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:27,870
So they're starting to think about that

507
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:29,899
and that's a huge win.

508
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:32,500
So the doors for better cybersecurity

509
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,753
in the nonprofit space are now opening.

510
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:38,060
I will say that an area of caution

511
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:40,659
that we are seeing is that
they're relying more and more

512
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:43,190
on third parties to help them.

513
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:46,340
So they are moving to the cloud
as I think Michael mentioned

514
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:52,060
and where they're starting to
reach out for help is to say,

515
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:54,250
how do I know that the third party

516
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:57,560
that I'm going to be engaging
with actually has the security

517
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,659
in place that we need?

518
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:02,280
And by the way, what is the
security in place that we need

519
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,980
for the data that we're gonna be sharing

520
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:04,900
with that third party?

521
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:08,750
So from the nonprofit space,
we've got lots of work to do

522
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:11,460
but boy, they're asking
the right questions

523
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:14,220
and they're totally seeing
the need for it right now,

524
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,283
which is exciting.

525
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:17,420
- That's wonderful.

526
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:19,600
Do you feel like they're making progress

527
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,010
and kind of overcoming the threat levels

528
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:25,260
and really keeping that
sensitive information safe

529
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:29,233
in a way that is not only
responsible but also efficient?

530
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,540
- I think they're getting there.

531
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:33,280
I think they're starting to recognize

532
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,113
that what they have is a value.

533
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:39,000
I think they were even in
the mindset a few years ago

534
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,570
of who's gonna want to attack us.

535
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:43,669
Who's gonna want anything that we have?

536
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:46,510
And as we're working with them and sort of

537
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:50,720
helping them understand that
value of that data, right.

538
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,380
And actually, what are
the most important assets

539
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:57,670
to a nonprofit is something
that Mike mentioned is trust.

540
00:26:57,670 --> 00:27:00,880
So they are starting to
understand that the trust

541
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,580
that they have with their communities

542
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:05,620
along with the data that
they hold about donors,

543
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,290
about the people that they serve,

544
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:11,693
about their business operations
is a value to an attacker.

545
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:15,515
The challenges is to help them understand

546
00:27:15,516 --> 00:27:17,827
what does that attack reserve look like

547
00:27:17,827 --> 00:27:20,150
and what are the behaviors around it?

548
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:22,830
Because to them right now
in the nonprofit space

549
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:26,600
they're looking at it
like all big attackers

550
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,060
are all gonna come get us.

551
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:30,340
So we need to hunker everything down

552
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,877
which in a smaller organization

553
00:27:31,877 --> 00:27:34,050
and a medium size organization

554
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:37,730
makes it really tough to do their jobs.

555
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:41,074
So there are things
that they're doing well

556
00:27:41,074 --> 00:27:43,680
and there are things
that we are helping them

557
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:46,313
sort of figure out along the way.

558
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:48,590
- Well, thank you for that.

559
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:50,540
That's an incredible
mission and particularly

560
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:52,950
as you mentioned those
nonprofits are so focused

561
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:55,633
on whatever that passion element is.

562
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:59,580
So I've got a general
question now to the panel

563
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:02,740
and it's really something
I think everybody's got

564
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,840
an opinion on whether
you're in cyber or not

565
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:07,209
but what direction do you
see the workforce going?

566
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:08,910
Do you think it's gonna be fully remote?

567
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:10,520
There's gonna be a hybrid.

568
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,610
Do you think we're gonna go back

569
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:13,689
to the office as things were?

570
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:15,910
I'd love to get your
insight on what you think

571
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:17,060
the new normal will be.

572
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:20,889
- I love this question
if you guys don't mind

573
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:22,580
if I jumped in.

574
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:25,679
So as I've been an executive director

575
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,710
of the Open Information
Security Foundation

576
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:29,100
for eight years now.

577
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:32,600
We've been a virtual company for 11 years.

578
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,620
So when the pandemic hit, all of a sudden

579
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:38,429
all of you were in my work environment.

580
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:41,940
So we didn't do Zoom calls, we did Skype,

581
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:44,020
we did conference calls.

582
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,080
So people were saying,

583
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,980
Oh, well you're used to working remote

584
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:49,810
you're just gonna continue.

585
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:52,830
I'm like, yeah, but the
remote work environment

586
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:56,710
that I exist in pre
COVID is very different

587
00:28:56,710 --> 00:29:00,000
than the remote work environment
that we exist in today.

588
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,100
I've never had so many Zoom calls

589
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:06,600
in my entire career as I've
had in the past 12 months.

590
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:10,360
That all being said, what
I am seeing from colleagues

591
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,889
who were in those
physical work environments

592
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:14,740
is that they're starting to recognize that

593
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:18,800
as the world opens up those distractions

594
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,909
that us who have been working
remote probably each years

595
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:24,240
sort of learned how to
manage those distractions of,

596
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,010
Oh, I wanna go for coffee,

597
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:27,990
or I can just run to the grocery store

598
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:32,410
or I can do these things now
actually impacts their workday.

599
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:37,410
So my supposition is that
organizations are going

600
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:40,740
to allow their employees to
have a little bit more say

601
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:43,800
in what they do whether they work remote

602
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,620
or whether they go back in the office.

603
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:47,560
But I think us as human beings,

604
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:50,960
we need that human
connection on some level.

605
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,223
So maybe it's not gonna be
all remote all the time,

606
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:58,500
but I do think that some
people might actually gravitate

607
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:01,160
to this weird space of remote working

608
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,000
but I kind of hope that we kind of go back

609
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,310
to when it was remote
working before the pandemic

610
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:09,470
'cause it was lovely
(laughs) I have to say.

611
00:30:10,633 --> 00:30:12,740
I mean, I'd love to seeing all of you,

612
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:15,763
but wow of course the Zoom
calls are kind of crazy.

613
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:22,090
- Yeah, I think that's been
a culture shock to all of us.

614
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:24,020
Theo, what do you think?

615
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,153
- Yeah, and it's interesting

616
00:30:25,153 --> 00:30:27,810
because we saw the workforce transition

617
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:31,050
from the office
environment to fully remote

618
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:33,550
in a very short amount of time.

619
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:37,149
And don't forget technology
and information security

620
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:39,250
enabled us to do that, right.

621
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:43,253
VPNs, two-factor authentications,
cloud, mobile devices.

622
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:47,590
And I do believe that the
next era is going to be

623
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:51,199
like a hybrid model,
organizations see the value

624
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:55,713
of the office space but
also the flexibility

625
00:30:55,713 --> 00:30:59,670
of allowing people to work
remotely, but also hire remotely.

626
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:02,220
Now, not only you could hire from anywhere

627
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,963
if you have this hybrid model.

628
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:07,830
And based on the individual requirements,

629
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:09,629
there's going to be a mix.

630
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:11,790
Maybe a younger generations that are used

631
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:13,443
to going into the office
they wanna go into the office

632
00:31:13,443 --> 00:31:16,030
that don't have any home responsibilities,

633
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:21,030
wanna do the office
where parents appreciate

634
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,890
that flexibility to be
able to pick up their kids

635
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:25,900
and continue working into the night.

636
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:30,900
So I see a balance and I
see organizations offering

637
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:33,123
that flexibility and balance.

638
00:31:35,987 --> 00:31:38,480
- And Mike, (indistinct) has gone virtual.

639
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,590
I'd love to hear your
perspective because I think

640
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:43,653
that's also a very unique
hands-on demographic.

641
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:46,650
- Yeah.

642
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:48,727
I mean, so with respect to Athenahealth

643
00:31:48,727 --> 00:31:50,500
we're healthcare IT companies

644
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,410
so we're the different flavor of it,

645
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:57,287
but we have gone fully
remote by and large.

646
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:02,169
I'm sure there have been
some essential personnel

647
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,970
that have to be pulled in
to do some of the things

648
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:08,720
that are necessary for
physical work on site.

649
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:13,720
But I believe hybrid is
something we'll likely see

650
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:20,060
given just again like the assessment

651
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:22,600
of where we stand with this virus

652
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,500
and potentially other things down the line

653
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:31,390
giving more flexibility
to employees to choose

654
00:32:33,456 --> 00:32:35,840
what makes sense for
their work-life balance,

655
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:40,270
I think will be a much
bigger topic of conversation

656
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:41,520
with those employees.

657
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,560
But I do think hybrid is the way...

658
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,952
Again this is all dependent on

659
00:32:44,952 --> 00:32:47,310
is there gonna be another
breakthrough variant

660
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:49,620
that gets through potential vaccinations

661
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:50,453
and things like that.

662
00:32:50,453 --> 00:32:54,633
I mean, this is all part and
parcel with making this call.

663
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:57,950
And I think that you've seen
some companies already shy away

664
00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:00,560
from even having to discuss
that and just decide,

665
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:03,450
Hey, we're gonna be a fully remote company

666
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:05,710
and we're gonna have to deal in that

667
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:08,650
and I'm not sure if they're gonna offer

668
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:11,000
even the potential sometimes for hybrid.

669
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,880
I know we've kind of shied
away from having the hybrid

670
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,620
in place right now.

671
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,879
I think that's gonna be lifted soon after

672
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,620
once we get the vaccinations
in a better spot

673
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:24,469
in the United States, particularly

674
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:26,930
but again, it remains to be seen

675
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:29,679
I would say the trend
though is towards hybrid

676
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,630
for us and for the healthcare industry.

677
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,870
- I think one of the
things that this pandemic

678
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:38,879
has sort of given and
maybe my fellow colleagues

679
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:43,330
also have opinions is that
you're starting to recognize

680
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:47,449
what industries and what
businesses absolutely need

681
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:49,430
to have that human interaction

682
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:52,783
and what businesses can move remotely.

683
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:56,020
We see it in our world all the time

684
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:58,763
that there are just certain organizations

685
00:33:58,763 --> 00:34:00,689
that have certain missions

686
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:05,210
have to find a way to do things in person.

687
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:08,340
But what it's done is it's
helped them to sort of think

688
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:10,770
about those business continuity plans

689
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:15,540
of how do we deliver this in a safe way

690
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:19,250
to communities that need us in person.

691
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:21,909
Domestic violence, shelters
are a great example.

692
00:34:21,909 --> 00:34:23,920
How do we do that safely?

693
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:28,110
So I think what I hope will
come out of all of this is that

694
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:31,492
across industries and across
businesses of all sizes

695
00:34:31,492 --> 00:34:34,340
that we start thinking a
little bit more creative

696
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:37,438
of how do we deliver the best of ourselves

697
00:34:37,438 --> 00:34:40,620
in multiple different ways and we adjust

698
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:43,013
to the world a little bit easier.

699
00:34:43,013 --> 00:34:45,230
- And I think they need
for a social interaction

700
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:47,380
is compounded by the fact that we can't

701
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:50,239
even socially interact
on a personal level.

702
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:53,179
So if you go still hanging
out with your friends

703
00:34:53,179 --> 00:34:56,699
and work remotely, I think
a lot of people would accept

704
00:34:56,699 --> 00:34:57,893
that situation.

705
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,313
- Absolutely.

706
00:35:00,313 --> 00:35:01,940
So we are almost out of time.

707
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:03,990
We have about four minutes left.

708
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:08,640
So if anybody has a really
great either success

709
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,120
or something you really got to learn from

710
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:14,690
because you've failed miserably,
I'd love to hear that.

711
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:17,170
I'm sure our audience would as well.

712
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:21,970
- Well, I think for the work
that we're doing at Sightline

713
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:24,953
we're really seeing the
best of people come out

714
00:35:24,953 --> 00:35:26,650
in the situation.

715
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:31,590
And not only are we seeing
organizations really step up

716
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:33,650
to the plate, but we're starting to see

717
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:35,660
that people are looking at security

718
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:40,339
and we focus very much
on using the terminology

719
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:43,453
around information security
versus cyber security.

720
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,890
But they're starting
to step into this space

721
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:49,690
and it's really exciting for us to

722
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:54,590
celebrate the successes as we see them.

723
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:57,590
There's so much that's
weighing on all of us, right?

724
00:35:57,590 --> 00:36:00,998
So whenever we have an
organization or we see something

725
00:36:00,998 --> 00:36:05,780
in our domain that's even
the smallest of wins,

726
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:07,470
we make a big deal out of it

727
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:10,663
because people's need to
sort of feel that sense of,

728
00:36:10,663 --> 00:36:12,950
Oh, I'm doing that right.

729
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:16,859
I'm actually making my
organization more secure,

730
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:19,010
being more mindful about remote working,

731
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,310
being more mindful about

732
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:25,240
how to creatively serve our
communities and still stay safe.

733
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,959
These are all wonderful things

734
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,590
that we could start celebrating.

735
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:32,300
And I think we need more
celebration right now.

736
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,550
We're all super tired. (laughs)

737
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:37,680
We all need naps and we
all need to celebrate

738
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,370
and hug the people.

739
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:41,203
- Absolutely.

740
00:36:41,203 --> 00:36:43,360
I also think it's helpful
at least in Virginia

741
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,420
that they started delivering
from the liquor store

742
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:46,987
but that's just me.

743
00:36:46,987 --> 00:36:48,387
(all laughing)

744
00:36:48,387 --> 00:36:50,930
So we have room for one
more person to jump in.

745
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:52,960
Michael, Theo would either
of you like to come up

746
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,640
with a big success or something

747
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,223
that was a great learning moment?

748
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:00,880
- Mike, or I could go with...

749
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,650
I'll be short so I'll give you some time

750
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:04,160
to say something as well.

751
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:07,299
- And to answer a bit to
Kelley's comment about

752
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:10,500
why would they target us,
organizations and individuals

753
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:13,190
have to remember that the
moment you use technology

754
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:16,340
you have an online presence
you're a fair game to attackers.

755
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:20,500
So it doesn't matter what you
think you have or don't have,

756
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,490
you have to be careful.

757
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:24,009
So organizations, individuals

758
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:26,800
have to reevaluate how they work,

759
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,820
how they access the internet

760
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:31,943
and how they behave themselves online.

761
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:35,700
- I think just one
thing that's interesting

762
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:38,640
is that a number of
breaches went up last year

763
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,549
but the number of individuals
affected went down

764
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,790
considerably from 2019 to 2020

765
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:46,470
based on just health
and human service data.

766
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:50,350
So with everybody going
to this whole remote

767
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:51,476
work from home environment

768
00:37:51,476 --> 00:37:54,110
it didn't greatly affect the industry.

769
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:58,700
In fact, we were able to
secure more health information

770
00:37:58,700 --> 00:37:59,669
than we did the year prior.

771
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:01,230
So I think it's a big win overall

772
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:04,433
for the sector to have
that as a data point.

773
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,393
- Absolutely.

774
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:12,100
I'm in the VA health system
and it was about 10 years ago

775
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,299
every quarter you get
something saying your stuff

776
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,520
had been lost on somebody's
laptop or breached

777
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,980
and haven't had one of those in a while.

778
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:20,240
So I think we're all
grateful to see healthcare

779
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:24,540
are definitely taking care
and being good custodians.

780
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:26,009
Well, I would like to thank all of you

781
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:28,920
for not only what you do,
but for being here today

782
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:33,683
and your expertise and
thank RSA for having us.

783
00:38:34,875 --> 00:38:35,850
- Thank you.
- Thanks so much.

784
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:36,899
- Thank you very much.

785
00:38:36,899 --> 00:38:38,307
- Thanks Anna.

786
00:38:38,307 --> 00:38:40,473
(silence)
