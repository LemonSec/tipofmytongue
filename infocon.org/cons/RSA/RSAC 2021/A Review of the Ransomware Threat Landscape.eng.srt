1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:03,410
- Hi, I'm Shannon Vavra and I'm a reporter

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:07,640
at Cyberscoop and big thanks
to RSA for hosting us.

3
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,459
Today We'll be talking about the scourge

4
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:11,460
of ransomware and how to tamp down

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,760
on ransomware attacks moving forward.

6
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,630
Joining me today are
Michael Daniel, Phil Reiner

7
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:18,119
and Jen Miller Osborne.

8
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,070
And we'll just kick it off

9
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:21,310
with a brief set of
introductions from each of us.

10
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:24,900
Michael, why don't you get us started?

11
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,119
- Sure, I'm Michael Daniel.

12
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,150
I'm currently the president and CEO

13
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:30,070
of the Cyber Threat
Alliance, which is a group

14
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:32,580
of cybersecurity companies
that share threat intelligence

15
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:33,839
with each other.

16
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,770
Formerly I was the Special Assistant

17
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:38,670
to President Barack
Obama for cybersecurity

18
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:41,770
and the white house cyber
security coordinator.

19
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:42,857
- Thank you, Phil.

20
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,980
- Yeah, thanks for having me.

21
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:47,320
I'm looking forward to this conversation.

22
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,120
I'm Phil Reiner I'm the CEO
of the Institute for Security

23
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,430
and Technology.

24
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:55,519
We are a California based
organization that works

25
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,170
to address emerging security threats

26
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,360
through which we bridge
national security policy makers

27
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,360
and entrepreneurs innovators
out here in California.

28
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,260
I'm someone who's, as I like to say,

29
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:09,770
a recovering bureaucrat.

30
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:12,920
Spent about 10 years in
Washington in OSD policy

31
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,810
and then about four years working

32
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:17,430
for President Obama at the
National Security Council.

33
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:18,630
Looking forward to this.

34
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,443
- Great and Jen.

35
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:24,089
- Hi everybody.

36
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:25,490
I am Jen Miller-Osborne.

37
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:28,030
I am the Deputy Director
of Threat Intelligence

38
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:31,250
at the Unit 42 here at Palo Alto networks.

39
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:34,310
I have been in the field
for almost 20 years.

40
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:36,760
I actually started out
as a Chinese linguist

41
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,593
in the Air Force.

42
00:01:37,593 --> 00:01:39,930
And then I was just kind
of in the right place

43
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:41,560
at the right time and able to transition

44
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,584
into cyber when this whole thing started.

45
00:01:43,584 --> 00:01:45,510
No idea it was gonna turn into a career

46
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:48,160
but I am super happy and I love what I do.

47
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,360
I spent about 15 or so
years with the government.

48
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,380
I am one of the original
creators of the Attack Framework.

49
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,470
It's kind of my main claim to fame.

50
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:58,660
And I've been here with Palo Alto Networks

51
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,342
and Unit 42 for almost seven years now.

52
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:04,030
- Great, thank you all.

53
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:07,351
So we're obviously
talking about ransomware

54
00:02:07,351 --> 00:02:09,910
at an incredible moment of tension

55
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,520
for our nation and for the world.

56
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,550
The coronavirus pandemic has been going

57
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,470
on for over a year now at this point.

58
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,770
And we've seen ransomware attacks increase

59
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:20,950
in the last year, astronomically.

60
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:23,910
Humbling hospitals, schools, governments,

61
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,500
local municipalities.

62
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,880
And I wonder if Jen, you could kick us off

63
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,600
by giving us a bit of an overview

64
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,380
of the threat landscape
and what you're seeing

65
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:35,100
at Unit 42 and how things have changed

66
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,870
in the last year on the threat landscape.

67
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:38,703
- Thank you, Shannon.

68
00:02:38,703 --> 00:02:41,520
And that is exactly why
Palo Alto Networks decided

69
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:46,060
to publish our 2021 Unit 42
Ransomware Threat report.

70
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,520
Because the problem
has grown exponentially

71
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,300
over the past four years,

72
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,790
since we lasted did look into this.

73
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:55,280
And we really felt now is
the time to take a deep dive

74
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,390
and a look and let the global community

75
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:59,350
be aware of what kind of threats they're

76
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:01,230
and how vastly they've grown.

77
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:03,290
The criminals are starting
to make more money.

78
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:05,143
They've actually doubled the amounts

79
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:08,270
of they're asking for up to 30 million.

80
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:10,220
The highest known ransom
that's been paid has doubled

81
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,770
in the last year to 10 million.

82
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:14,556
I mean the average ransomware
that's been paid has tripled

83
00:03:14,556 --> 00:03:18,570
from about 115,000 to over 300,000.

84
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:21,329
So you see that they're just
gaining more and more money.

85
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:22,940
When that happens, ransomware becomes more

86
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,810
and more popular in their criminal sector

87
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,380
and they're also evolving their tactics.

88
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:30,320
So we're starting to see
things like double extortion

89
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:34,019
where doctors are not
only encrypting drives,

90
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,800
they're pre-staging and exfiltrating data.

91
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,410
So we wanted to kind of call attention

92
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:39,630
to all of these issues as more

93
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:43,005
of a bit of a call to action
for the community at large.

94
00:03:43,005 --> 00:03:44,210
- Thank you.

95
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:47,606
And I'm curious if we could
talk a little bit about some

96
00:03:47,606 --> 00:03:50,239
of the alerts we've been
receiving from the government

97
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,610
over the last year.

98
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:53,500
Obviously from the Treasury Department

99
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,640
we've seen OFAC issue guidance

100
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:59,359
that victims may not be
interested in paying ransoms just

101
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,830
in case the ransomware
gangs targeting them are

102
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:04,210
on sanctions lists from
the U S government.

103
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:07,270
We've seen alerts from the
FBI and other federal agencies

104
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:09,620
about hospitals and ransomware attacks

105
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:12,670
and different specific ransomware
strains to watch out for.

106
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:16,209
Is that enough and should
the government be doing more?

107
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:19,589
And if so, what should that look like?

108
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:20,789
I'm curious, Michael

109
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:23,493
anyone can take this, Michael, Phil, Jen.

110
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,410
- Well, I can start.

111
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:29,110
I think Shannon that
the short answer is yes

112
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:31,670
we need the government to be doing more.

113
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,820
We need, frankly, we need

114
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,760
all parts of the ecosystem doing more.

115
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:40,409
I mean, this is a threat that
has, as Jen has talked about

116
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:45,410
has really moved from economic
nuisance eight years ago,

117
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,550
to national security and public health

118
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:50,530
and safety threat today.

119
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:53,289
And once a threat moves
into that category,

120
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:56,920
you very much need the
government bringing its resources

121
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,910
to the table.

122
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:01,730
You need the private sector
and the non-profit sector

123
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:03,680
also engaging on this.

124
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,690
And I shouldn't say that it's
not just the U S government.

125
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:08,240
This is an international problem as well.

126
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,410
So we're gonna need to be working

127
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:13,760
with our international partners
to really try to address it.

128
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,360
So it's really gonna take
and as Jen pointed out

129
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,290
it's such a lucrative
business now for the criminals

130
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:22,490
it is going to take a full court press

131
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:25,610
to change that business
model, reduce the level

132
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:27,480
of value that the criminals get out of it

133
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:31,090
and to reduce that overall
scourge of ransomware.

134
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:32,140
- And I wanted to get

135
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,490
on one thing you just said there, Michael.

136
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:37,910
You said ransomware has gone
from an economic nuisance

137
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:39,750
to a national security threat.

138
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,550
Could you walk us through
that a little bit?

139
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:46,320
- Sure, if you look back say 2013

140
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:51,320
the ransomware typically
targeted an individual's computer

141
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:56,219
a laptop or a desktop or a server.

142
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:59,390
And the average ransom
was, I don't know exactly

143
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:01,240
but it was like a hundred, 150 bucks.

144
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,830
So it was a fairly minimal affair.

145
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:10,169
Now, if you just listen
to those statistics

146
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:13,800
that Jen was talking about
there in that report,

147
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,893
I mean those are some staggering numbers.

148
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,320
Ransom's in the millions and some

149
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,730
of them actually being
paid in the millions.

150
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:26,260
The average ransom
being north of $300,000.

151
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:30,810
I mean, those are some very
significant amounts of money.

152
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:33,220
And now it's not just
individuals being targeted

153
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:36,300
but it's things like school systems.

154
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,690
I mean most people know
about the stories of Atlanta.

155
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,900
The city of Atlanta being
offline for a while due

156
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:42,960
to a ransomware attack.

157
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,849
The Buffalo City Schools,
just, hospitals being hit

158
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:49,230
during the middle of a pandemic

159
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:53,500
and being forced to go to paper services.

160
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,750
Manufacturing companies, large enterprises

161
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,050
anything you can think of.

162
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,210
And so now this, is not just
putting, an economic burden

163
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:06,539
on society but imposing
a real public health

164
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,220
and safety threat and essentially

165
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,250
a national security threat.

166
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,630
It's pretty unusual for criminal activity

167
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:13,580
to reach that level.

168
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,782
But in this case, it has.

169
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:20,400
- And I'm curious, Phil, if
you could tell us a little bit

170
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,739
about how you see the threat these days.

171
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:25,580
And what you think the American government

172
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,601
and other governments
and the private sector

173
00:07:27,601 --> 00:07:29,250
can be doing about it.

174
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,323
And you've also recently been involved

175
00:07:31,323 --> 00:07:33,870
with a task force focused on this.

176
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,790
Tell us a little bit about that too.

177
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,440
- Yeah, for sure.

178
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,420
I wanted to piggyback a little
bit on the data that Jen

179
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,500
is sharing and the trends
that Jen is talking about.

180
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,480
I think the report really
summarizes it in a powerful way

181
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,740
as to how their targets are shifting

182
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:50,910
and what Michael is talking about as

183
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:54,760
to how the collective nature
of this activity starts

184
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,812
to rise up to a different level of threat.

185
00:07:56,812 --> 00:07:58,718
I think it's really important to note

186
00:07:58,718 --> 00:08:00,860
there's a lot that's happening.

187
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:03,020
The FBI, as you noted Shannon
is doing a lot on this,

188
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,229
DHS is doing a lot.

189
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:06,490
They've got campaigns where they're trying

190
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:10,810
to get information out
to potential victims

191
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:12,600
to try to help them in terms of preparing,

192
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,830
but also responding when
and if they do get attacked.

193
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:17,359
Industry, this is not something

194
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,313
they haven't been paying attention to.

195
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:23,320
But what has happened
and I think this is what

196
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,610
the Palo Alto information points toward

197
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:27,280
and what Michael was just talking about.

198
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,150
This has begun to expand in such a way

199
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:32,130
and the commoditization
of these capabilities

200
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:33,429
for the criminals.

201
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:37,059
It makes it so easy to
do this, what we've seen.

202
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:39,599
And this is what happens in cybersecurity.

203
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,330
A vector opens up, people seize upon it

204
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:46,810
and the bureaucracy is
not necessarily focused

205
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:51,000
or equipped to respond as quickly.

206
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,120
And so I think in large
part we've stood up

207
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,140
the ransomware taskforce to try

208
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,840
and actually address just that.

209
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,670
Where you've got something
that's moving incredibly fast,

210
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:03,459
you've got a bureaucracy
that doesn't really

211
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,293
move that quickly.

212
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:06,670
It's an aircraft carrier,
it doesn't turn that fast.

213
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:10,939
How can potentially private
industry get together

214
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:13,010
with maybe some folks who can talk to us

215
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,131
from government and how can
we come up with solutions

216
00:09:15,131 --> 00:09:16,740
to get after this ?

217
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:19,360
Now, from my perspective
as someone who sat

218
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,193
at the White House

219
00:09:20,193 --> 00:09:22,115
and dealt with incredibly
challenging problems,

220
00:09:22,115 --> 00:09:24,520
whether it's the war in Afghanistan

221
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,750
or other national security challenges.

222
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:32,160
It takes senior level top-down interest

223
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,650
in a problem like this to really get

224
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:36,160
after it with the resources
that are required.

225
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,620
The prioritization of the
issue needs to be raised

226
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,770
in order to actually do
something differently.

227
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:42,958
It's not business as usual.

228
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:46,069
This is not just a normal
cybersecurity threat.

229
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:47,570
It's a plague.

230
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:50,190
And I think the data that's put out

231
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:53,170
in that Palo Alto report
really points to that fact.

232
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:55,939
More can be done and it's not as if folks

233
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:58,150
don't understand that
it's just the bureaucracy

234
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:00,189
has to organize itself and
concentrate its energies

235
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:02,010
and put the resources against it

236
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:04,069
in order to effect that kind of change.

237
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,570
But the biggest thing for us

238
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:08,840
and this is the thing that
I harp on all the time

239
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,410
at the end of 2020, everyone looked

240
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,959
at each other and said,
wow, this was brutal.

241
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,130
2020 was awful when it
comes to ransomware,

242
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:18,350
but man 2021 is gonna be worse.

243
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:20,690
That's just not acceptable.

244
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:22,750
So I do think there's a
lot more that can be done

245
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,810
but it has to be a top
down coordinated effort

246
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:25,642
in my opinion.

247
00:10:26,514 --> 00:10:29,310
- And in terms of coordinating that effort

248
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:31,890
what specific areas do you see

249
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:34,670
as potential rooms for improvement here?

250
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:37,729
Are we talking about going
after infrastructure?

251
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:39,900
Are we talking about going on the offense,

252
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,730
on offensive from the US government?

253
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:44,550
For instance from the
military side of things

254
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:47,319
are we talking about more
law enforcement action?

255
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,900
What should be the first next step here

256
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:53,622
that the US government and the
private sector take together?

257
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,760
- And I'd love to hear
from, from Michael and Jen

258
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,900
on their thoughts with this as well.

259
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:02,140
But at risk of sounding like
the recovering bureaucrat

260
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:06,430
that I am, I think a large
part of the signaling

261
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:08,500
that needs to take place here is

262
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,390
that from the US federal government,

263
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:13,610
the signal needs to be
sent that this trajectory

264
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:16,260
is not going to be acceptable anymore.

265
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,620
And that the government is going to change

266
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,970
its tact entirely.

267
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:21,020
They're gonna work with
international partners

268
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:24,670
in a coordinated way, all the
way down through the system.

269
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:25,930
They're gonna direct their departments

270
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:27,630
and agencies to make this a priority.

271
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:32,160
Whether it's FBI, Treasury, DHS, DOD,

272
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,610
the intelligence community,
all of those elements need

273
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:37,950
to put this higher on their
list of priorities in order

274
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:40,600
to change the trajectory of this.

275
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:44,150
I don't know that one is the
higher priority over the other.

276
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:48,569
In my firm opinion, this has
to be a comprehensive approach.

277
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:49,890
You're not gonna solve ransomware

278
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:51,110
with some little silver bullet

279
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:54,870
that just fixes the
crypto payments problems.

280
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:57,580
You're not gonna solve it by
just sending cyber command

281
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:02,580
after somebody who's sitting,
in perhaps in Eastern Europe.

282
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,690
These all have to happen at the same time

283
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:07,510
if you're really going to
affect significant change

284
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:09,670
and shift the trajectory.

285
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:12,360
I'd love to hear what others
think might be a priority

286
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,530
but I really think it has to all be kicked

287
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:15,880
into gear at the same time.

288
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:19,620
- I would agree with that, Phil.

289
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:23,400
From my perspective the,
when you put together

290
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:27,939
these kinds of efforts
to counter this a threat

291
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:31,300
that has reached to this level,

292
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,930
you need all of those different
elements put together.

293
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:38,329
It is going to have to
involve increasing the ability

294
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:41,679
of businesses across the
board to be more resilient

295
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:44,100
and more resistant to
ransomware in the first place.

296
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,220
But it also is gonna require
more aggressive disruption

297
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:50,650
of what the bad guys are doing.

298
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:53,040
It's gonna require more creative thinking.

299
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,319
And a lot of it is going to
be outside of the cyber realm.

300
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,830
Phil just mentioned the
cryptocurrency markets.

301
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:03,750
I mean, it's pretty clear that
one of the big fuels of the

302
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:07,770
or one of the reasons why
we've seen this scourge emerge

303
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:09,210
in the way that we have is the growth

304
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:11,120
of the cryptocurrencies.

305
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,670
Because they enable
payments to occur in a way

306
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:16,553
that the normal financial
system can't track or block.

307
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,849
So clearly you're gonna
have to address that part

308
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:24,270
of the ecosystem which has nothing to do

309
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,023
with cybersecurity directly.

310
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,240
So it's gonna really
take combining a bunch

311
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:32,510
of different normally disparate elements

312
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:35,870
and bringing them together in
order to actually really put

313
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,833
a damper on ransomware.

314
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:42,280
- And I know Jen, you've had a bit

315
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,120
of a front row seat to
some law enforcement action

316
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,510
and sort of joint coordination
between different nations.

317
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:50,120
And I'm curious if you
could sort of spell out

318
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,940
for us how you see the progression
of law enforcement action

319
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:57,580
against ransomware gangs
and cyber crime in general

320
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:00,130
and how you see that
playing out in the future.

321
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:03,710
Is it, do we have a
good path set before us?

322
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,483
What needs to change if not?

323
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,920
- I actually think that we're doing well

324
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,949
especially over the
past year or two years.

325
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:17,540
You've seen a much greater
and broader recognition

326
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,040
of the problem that this is.

327
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,839
And more willingness from not
only private industry partners

328
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,660
but also law enforcement,
international law enforcement

329
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:28,010
that previously, maybe weren't part of,

330
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:30,100
some of the coalitions
are now willing to join

331
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:33,240
in so that we can start
affecting real world change

332
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,073
against these things.

333
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:36,819
So we can start arresting
people that are involved,

334
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,520
arresting the affiliates, arresting people

335
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,530
that are hosting the infrastructure.

336
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:43,040
The Netwalker take down
recently as a good example

337
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,599
of some of that private-public
kind of partnership

338
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,640
along with law enforcement
on an international scale.

339
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,870
So that you can get a good
picture of what these are doing

340
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:53,340
and where they're coming from

341
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,739
and who the financial people are

342
00:14:54,739 --> 00:14:57,200
and then start arresting them.

343
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,380
And if not, arresting them
start doing financial sanctions

344
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:02,030
against an organization or a country,

345
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:04,180
if you can't necessarily do arrest

346
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,430
but that really is what needs to happen.

347
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:08,673
I'm in total agreement with everyone else.

348
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,980
And that we're seeing a
lot of progress to it.

349
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,790
Like my team's involved in
a number of these efforts

350
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:16,900
and just the willingness
to share and coordinate

351
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,670
and work together that we've seen.

352
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:21,849
The increase in change over
the last two years has been,

353
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:25,173
it's really been incredible so good signs.

354
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:28,540
- Security research alludes to this

355
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:32,209
and suggests this and various number

356
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:34,480
of people say it a little
bit more bluntly than others

357
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,570
but there are, and
there appear to be links

358
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:40,600
between nation states
and ransomware gangs.

359
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:44,110
Whether these governments
are actively backing them

360
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,140
or ignoring them, turning a blind eye

361
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:49,290
allowing them to operate in
order to work with them later,

362
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:51,110
for instance or just
allow them to continue

363
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:52,560
to do their operations.

364
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,180
How do we, how does the US government,

365
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:59,209
how do multiple governments
instill that fear

366
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:02,740
into adversaries, allies alike in terms

367
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:03,810
of whether they're paying attention

368
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:06,160
to the problem themselves
in their own country?

369
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:09,397
- So I can take a stab at that.

370
00:16:09,398 --> 00:16:11,790
Jen, I can take a stab
of that to start with

371
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:14,760
but I think when you look at this

372
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:19,760
it's all about the linkages
for those governments.

373
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:23,110
Right now those governments
find it in their interest

374
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:26,410
to harbor those gangs

375
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:28,620
or they're incapable of dealing with them.

376
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,160
But you know, that's a smaller subset.

377
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,500
And I think what you
have to do is you have to

378
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,947
use both carrots and sticks in
the international ecosystem.

379
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:42,790
And you have to change the calculus

380
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:45,347
of what's in those countries interest.

381
00:16:45,347 --> 00:16:48,600
And so you put pressure
on them diplomatically

382
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,120
that they'll pay a price
for being known as a country

383
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,770
that harbors criminals.

384
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:57,720
You offer incentives for
how they can get resources

385
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:01,133
if they stop doing that
and collaborate more.

386
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,389
There's not a magic formula
to this, and sometimes

387
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:09,191
there's not much you can do
to change their interests

388
00:17:09,191 --> 00:17:13,690
but you can certainly take steps
to change it at the margin.

389
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:15,500
And in some cases you can really change

390
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,630
that overall calculus.

391
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:19,810
But as Phil was saying
that that is not something

392
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:21,369
the United States can do by itself.

393
00:17:21,369 --> 00:17:24,520
It is really something that
has to be done in concert

394
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,550
with a large group of
like-minded countries

395
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:30,360
that are all working
towards that same goal.

396
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:34,753
To really achieve that change
in those countries interests.

397
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:40,450
- And I'd love to be able to
turn to Jen and let her talk

398
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:42,170
to this a little bit
too, but I couldn't agree

399
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:43,070
with Michael more.

400
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,220
Again, as I've noted, a couple of times

401
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,900
there has to be a suite of things

402
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,830
that are happening at the same.

403
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:52,389
There has to be diplomatic pressure.

404
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:54,020
There has to be economic pressure.

405
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:56,200
There are levers that can be pulled

406
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,920
via the international financial system

407
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,740
when we find ourselves in
these sorts of situations.

408
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:04,050
Those countries where
these people reside care

409
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:06,399
about those sorts of financial systems.

410
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,100
And so there are things that can be done

411
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:12,399
at an international level
with diplomatic means

412
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,490
that don't necessitate cyber command going

413
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:17,230
after somebody somewhere.

414
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:19,730
There's a lot more that
can be done at that level.

415
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,880
I think that has to be
combined with very real sticks.

416
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:27,479
And that's what Michael was talking about.

417
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:31,080
These actors, they feel like
they can operate this way

418
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,600
because they've got safe haven.

419
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,010
And so they have to know that

420
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:36,710
that is not going to
be acceptable anymore.

421
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:40,370
And that hitting a hospital
where there's people

422
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:43,570
who are dying is just not acceptable.

423
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:48,070
Going after kids in schools
is just not acceptable.

424
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:50,929
And there has to be something put down

425
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,437
and not just by the United States.

426
00:18:52,437 --> 00:18:54,010
It has to be something
that's done in coordination

427
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:57,629
with other countries, that
just sets red lines here.

428
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:59,660
I know that's maybe sounds naive,

429
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:02,110
but there are those actors out there.

430
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:04,909
The criminals that I think
most of us are cognizant

431
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,240
of that won't even cross over that line

432
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,370
because they know what's
going to come their direction

433
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:09,489
if they do.

434
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:11,560
Well, what's happened?

435
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,159
What's happened to those
folks that have crossed

436
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,310
that line that needs change.

437
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:18,690
And that needs to be part, I
think in my opinion of a part

438
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:20,840
of a coordinated strategy
that actually changes

439
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,750
their calculus.

440
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:25,080
I'd love to hear more from
from Jen on how she sees

441
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,312
that nexus though, too.

442
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:28,919
- I totally agree.

443
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:32,090
I'm heartened to see that
it seems like the kind

444
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:35,449
of building blocks and
processes that we needed to have

445
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:38,280
in place to get to that
point where we can scale

446
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,080
and do more and have that cooperation.

447
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,470
I think that's there now.

448
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:44,800
Now I really think it's incumbent upon,

449
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:48,850
the rest of the organizations,
public, private sector,

450
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:50,360
people that can play in this space

451
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:53,760
that maybe haven't joined yet
because they weren't aware

452
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,517
that we're being successful at it now.

453
00:19:56,517 --> 00:19:58,750
And I think we need to
highlight those successes

454
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:01,430
so we can increasingly
draw in more organizations.

455
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:05,090
So then we can get to that near real time

456
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:07,060
if we can, kind of interdiction

457
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:09,909
because we'll have buy-in
and active participation

458
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:12,970
from everyone while this
is happening globally.

459
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:15,270
And I agree, I really think
that's what we need to get to.

460
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:17,900
And I think we're at the
point now where we really

461
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,673
that's an attainable goal
if people stay focused.

462
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:25,940
- Now here's a question
in terms of whether you

463
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:29,010
think the Biden administration
has this on their radar,

464
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:31,170
and whether you feel that
they're up to the task

465
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:33,890
of elevating this ransomware
issue to the levels that you're

466
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:35,640
all talking about.

467
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,550
In your conversations
with government partners,

468
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:39,100
have you gained an understanding

469
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:42,399
that the Biden administration
is interested in raising this

470
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,450
in high-level diplomatic talks?

471
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:48,380
Or in back channels or
stringing foreign governments

472
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:51,720
and holding different carrots and sticks

473
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,533
in the ransomware conversation?

474
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:57,669
- So I'm by no means going
to try and speak on behalf

475
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:58,550
of the administration.

476
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:03,550
I do think what you can point
to is that the DHS secretary

477
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:08,710
Mayorkas has already shown an
interest in making this one

478
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:13,410
of his top, if not his top
cybersecurity priority.

479
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:18,410
I think it is something that
the NSC is fully cognizant of

480
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,720
and it's something that
they are concerned by

481
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,740
and want to do more about.

482
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:26,360
I think this, something
that is incredibly important

483
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,943
to think about here
this is not SolarWinds.

484
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,830
This is not the exchange server problem.

485
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:35,560
Those are instances that
need to be grappled with

486
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,129
and there probably needs
to be something more done

487
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,990
about the broader problems
associated with that.

488
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:43,340
Ransomware is something that deserves

489
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:47,730
a sustained campaign
effort to get after it,

490
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:49,700
and I can't overemphasize that enough.

491
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,780
I think you know having
sat at the White House,

492
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,899
you can see what powers can
be brought to bear with,

493
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:58,770
tools can be brought to bear
from senior levels I think.

494
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:01,090
I am incredibly encouraged by the folks

495
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:03,209
who have been brought
into this administration.

496
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:07,560
There's an absolute, it's
a rockstar group of folks

497
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,960
who I think if anybody's gonna to be able

498
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:14,300
to prioritize this as a
policy item, this team is,

499
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,673
I think really very well-placed to do so.

500
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:22,639
- I would support Phil's
observations there.

501
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:27,020
And just say that, it's clear
that this administration

502
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:30,920
is doing two things that I
think are incredibly important

503
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,780
to being able to achieve that goal.

504
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:35,840
One of which is they're
bringing in the people,

505
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,760
the right people like
Phil was talking about.

506
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,280
It's absolutely some rock
stars and a really solid team

507
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,373
all up and down the chain.

508
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:48,800
But also they are clearly
willing to expend time and effort

509
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,760
and attention on it.

510
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,180
I mean, you have the national
security advisor spending time

511
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:56,020
at pressors actually
talking about at meetings

512
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:58,440
with the press, talking
about cybersecurity.

513
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,430
That's a big deal cause
their, that's clearly showing

514
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:04,540
the level of priority that
they're putting on this.

515
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,690
And as you say, it's coming up

516
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:08,130
in secretarial level conversations.

517
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:10,690
What this administration
is now needs to do

518
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:12,480
is they've got to rebuild a lot of

519
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,980
the inner agency coordination mechanisms

520
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:18,570
that frankly atrophied under
the previous administration.

521
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:20,159
To be able to build

522
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,260
and have that kind of coordinated campaign

523
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:25,780
that Phil was talking about and
to scale up those activities

524
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,920
that Jen has been referring to.

525
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:31,200
And so that's there, that's
gotta be part of their task

526
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,530
but I think they're up
to it, but we do have

527
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:36,970
to give them a, help and b some runway,

528
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:38,803
'cause that takes time to do.

529
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:41,665
- Yeah, I would totally agree.

530
00:23:41,665 --> 00:23:46,560
And a lot of, as you know, at
42, we, a lot of engagement

531
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,250
with government and law enforcement

532
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:50,150
and Intel agencies globally.

533
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:54,330
And we've definitely seen
a lot more engagement

534
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:57,030
and buy-in with the administration shift.

535
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:59,960
We've seen a lot more
kind of effort put back

536
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,580
into some of the sharing
agreements and the working groups

537
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:05,139
and the desire to have more data

538
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:07,130
that they can take action on.

539
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:09,450
And they've also been
doing quite a bit more work

540
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:11,490
with kind of trying to push advisories

541
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:13,370
and things out in a timely manner.

542
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:15,649
So I think we've really seen that the

543
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:16,560
at least what we're seeing

544
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:19,030
like publicly and engagements
that we're having,

545
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:21,000
there's definitely an
understanding and a buy-in

546
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,720
that this is a massive problem
that they need to address.

547
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,290
And there needs to be that partnership.

548
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:28,780
- In terms of advice or suggestions

549
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:33,010
that you'd be interested in
offering to the administration.

550
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:35,129
Do you see sort of the path forward here

551
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:37,970
as there's going to be
an order of operations

552
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:40,680
for doing this coordinated
strategic effort

553
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,730
to curb ransomware.

554
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:45,580
Must it be for instance
a three-pronged effort?

555
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:47,060
Military action, perhaps last.

556
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,659
You all sound a little
reticent, correct me

557
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:52,078
if I'm wrong to involve
cyber command at the get-go

558
00:24:52,078 --> 00:24:54,960
in disrupting these ransomware gangs.

559
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,955
But then also paired with
private sector operations

560
00:24:56,955 --> 00:24:59,810
also paired with law
enforcement operations.

561
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:02,510
Is there something that you
think should be done first

562
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:04,069
to tamp down on ransomware gangs

563
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:08,293
or does it depend on the
specific situation, the timing?

564
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:13,878
- I think the the most
effective approach that's gonna

565
00:25:13,878 --> 00:25:16,699
have to take place here
is that it's going to

566
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:21,640
be steps that are taken
almost in simultaneity.

567
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:25,320
So steps that are taken
to deter this behavior,

568
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,270
steps that are taken to
disrupt this behavior

569
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:31,211
and steps that are taken to
actually help people prepare

570
00:25:31,211 --> 00:25:34,260
and prevent this sort of attack.

571
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:37,430
Those things, so that you can
almost point to one agency

572
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:40,820
within the United States
government for each one of those

573
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:42,639
that's gonna have to
take the lead on that.

574
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,640
And I think if you've
got that coordinated,

575
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,700
the one thing that I would
say is that we're all worried

576
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,720
about the next threat.

577
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,710
Something else is going to happen

578
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:54,950
that is of national level concern.

579
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:57,270
That is extremely disruptive.

580
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:59,650
You can't take your eyes off of ransomware

581
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:01,500
while that's happening.

582
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,620
So this process that
needs to get set in motion

583
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:06,870
where you're actually
working on all of these lines

584
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:10,080
of effort that needs to
keep going while we deal

585
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,780
with all of those other problems.

586
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:14,810
And that's what the
White House is there for,

587
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:15,909
that's what they're good at.

588
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:18,080
They can walk and chew
gum at the same time.

589
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,330
So you can set a process in
motion and actually gets after

590
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:24,590
all of these pieces while
dealing with other crises

591
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:25,439
at the same time.

592
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:29,530
- Yeah and I think the, you mentioned

593
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:33,070
the cyber command in there,
and I think that Phil's point

594
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:37,572
is actually on point for here in that,

595
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,340
while we are dealing with
this ransomware problem

596
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:43,730
we've got other cyber problems
from our other adversaries,

597
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:45,470
from nation state adversaries.

598
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:48,220
And so again, you can't sort of pivot all

599
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:52,270
of cyber command off of dealing
with the threats from China,

600
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:53,720
dealing with the threats from Russia,

601
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,340
dealing with the threats
from Iran and North Korea.

602
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:59,370
And so what I think, we're really saying

603
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:01,159
is there are places where there may be

604
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:04,800
some targeted intervention
for the military side

605
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,879
that would make sense.

606
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,800
But I think first and foremost
you really want to increase

607
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,000
your level of law
enforcement activity here.

608
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:14,740
And that sort of that defensive side

609
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:17,120
because this is really what
law enforcement is built for

610
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,379
and is good at.

611
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:21,630
Is dealing with these with
these criminal elements.

612
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:26,240
And I think that, again we
are going to have to walk

613
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,550
and chew gum at the same time.

614
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:29,960
Because we are not gonna
be able, even in cyberspace

615
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:34,700
let alone like the other crises
that will inevitably come up

616
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:37,123
that have nothing to do
with cyberspace at all

617
00:27:37,123 --> 00:27:38,850
that the White House
will have to deal with.

618
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:42,959
So I think that that's why
it's important to really

619
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,790
be continuing to increase our
capacity across the board.

620
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,590
And I would also throw in that we're gonna

621
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:53,230
have to increase our capacity
in non-security agencies.

622
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:56,220
In places like Treasury,
in places that we don't,

623
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,880
that we're not even really
thinking about right now

624
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:01,070
like maybe HHS needs to
be able to give more help

625
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:04,570
to the hospitals and the medical system

626
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:05,403
and things like that.

627
00:28:05,403 --> 00:28:08,200
So, and Department of Energy working with,

628
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,680
the energy sector to
make them more resilient.

629
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:13,680
EPA working with the water
sector to make it more resilient.

630
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:17,240
So I think there's a lot of capacity

631
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,230
that we need to build
across the US government

632
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:22,590
or increase the capacity
that's already there

633
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:24,659
that isn't traditionally thought of

634
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:26,913
in sort of the cyber security area.

635
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:32,300
- I'm curious too, Jen and any of you

636
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,340
from the technical side of things

637
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:37,340
when we look at the threat and
different ransomware actors,

638
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,699
and different ransomware strains

639
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:41,000
and how they've evolved over the years.

640
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,480
We've heard from several of
them saying we're disbanding.

641
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,920
There's been security research

642
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,080
on different groups
coming together appearing

643
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,520
to morph together or looking
like they're the same

644
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,980
over the years.

645
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,250
Even in recent months there's
been research published

646
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:59,010
from Chainalysis about what
appears to be increasing overlap

647
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:02,320
between different groups
and increasing coordination.

648
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,929
From your perspective, looking forward,

649
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:07,920
does that paint a good picture
for those of us working

650
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,530
on tamping down here?

651
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:12,180
Is it that the problem is smaller

652
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:14,510
and more able to get our
arms around it more easily?

653
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:17,600
Or is it evidence that
there's much more work

654
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,230
that needs to be done to
understand who these groups are

655
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:21,590
and where they're coming from

656
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:25,225
and how to get at them
and change that ecosystem

657
00:29:25,225 --> 00:29:27,629
like Phil you keep mentioning?

658
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:31,970
- I think it, actually the
fact that ransomware is

659
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:36,790
just an increasingly large
and well-resourced threats.

660
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:38,590
Because of all of the
money that's coming in,

661
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:40,980
because of all of the people
you see that want to get

662
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:43,770
into this, because there's
very little barrier to entry.

663
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:46,460
It's literally just having
some cash that you can float

664
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,020
into this, to be able to start carrying

665
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:50,710
out these attacks and then making money.

666
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:53,810
I think we've been somewhat lucky to date

667
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:55,990
with the fact that the lot of the people

668
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:57,510
behind this haven't necessarily been

669
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:59,850
the most technically savvy

670
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:01,889
or aware of the kind of investigations

671
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:04,150
and data that you can
do using the internet.

672
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:07,840
Which has allowed us to track
them and to pay attention

673
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,510
and to recognize when
they've rebranded something

674
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:12,540
and all they did was change
the color and the logo.

675
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,970
And here's a new account name

676
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:16,200
but they're like, Oh, we're totally new.

677
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,080
(Jen laughs)

678
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,610
One group closes down and
the next thing you know

679
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:21,459
there's another group that
seems awfully similar.

680
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:23,570
It seems to have a lot
of the same affiliates.

681
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:25,200
Nothing's happened to them.

682
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,510
They haven't really had to be concerned

683
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:28,570
that they needed to be careful

684
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:30,149
because law enforcement
was gonna come knock

685
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:31,740
on their door one day.

686
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,680
Or they were gonna spend time in jail

687
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,270
or they'd lose their
access to their network

688
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:36,790
and they might have really upset customers

689
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:38,030
or things like that.

690
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:39,620
They've been able to operate pretty much

691
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:41,840
without any, with impunity.

692
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,889
And that doesn't really drive a lot

693
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:47,330
of effort into hiding
yourself because why bother?

694
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:48,514
I'm multimillionaire now,

695
00:30:48,514 --> 00:30:50,100
(Jen laughs)

696
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,610
I don't need to worry about these things.

697
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:52,929
So I think that points to a lot of

698
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:55,440
what we've been discussing,
where we need those,

699
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,620
the cooperation and the
higher level interdictions

700
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:59,800
and what we were just talking about before

701
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,950
if there was one component
that was more important

702
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:02,880
than the other.

703
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,460
I think having them be
coordinated where they hit

704
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:09,240
across the board is what
we're really going to need.

705
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,060
Not just for it to be effective from a

706
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:13,330
like a policy and planning side, but also

707
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:17,310
for the attackers to actually
care and take notice.

708
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:20,679
It's one thing if they
see whack-a-mole going on,

709
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,220
where you're hitting
here, you're hitting here,

710
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,385
you're hitting here.

711
00:31:23,385 --> 00:31:24,890
And they're like, whatever,
I'm safe, where I am.

712
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:26,380
It's another thing if you start to see

713
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,920
a coordinated response where

714
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,410
we take everything down.

715
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:30,810
we take your infrastructure down

716
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:32,909
we can, your affiliates are arrested

717
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:34,910
you're arrested, things like that.

718
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:37,370
And then you'll see if people
starting to take a step back

719
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:38,870
and be like, oh wow

720
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:40,600
is this something I really wanna be into?

721
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,510
Like, are there easier
ways I could make money

722
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:44,510
that don't involve me going to jail?

723
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:46,850
And you'll start to see
people kind of leave

724
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:50,209
this ecosystem for things where
there are less consequences.

725
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:52,400
So we'll start, the attacks will go down.

726
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,410
The overall kind of
ecosystem we'll start to get

727
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:55,880
a handle on.

728
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,700
To what Michael said earlier cyber crimes

729
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:58,980
are never gonna go away.

730
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,830
There's always going to be
people that are going to do this

731
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:04,540
especially as more and more
of our lifestyle is online.

732
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:08,040
But the more people we
can kind of price out

733
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,700
or discourage from doing
these kinds of activities

734
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:13,260
the safer everyone's
going to be as a whole.

735
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:16,525
And that really takes
everyone, takes a global effort

736
00:32:16,525 --> 00:32:17,625
to be able to do that.

737
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:19,570
- And I should warn us.

738
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:24,530
We have just a few minutes left
here about one minute left.

739
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:28,493
Michael, Phil and Jen, any
final words for our audience.

740
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,810
- I would just say that in
conclusion of what we've

741
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:36,629
been talking about here, we
need to really step up our game

742
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:38,317
and what we're doing.

743
00:32:38,317 --> 00:32:41,200
Ransomware is now a really,
really significant threat

744
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,720
and we are going to have to
work together to counter it

745
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:49,253
or we will face ever increasing
disruption to our society.

746
00:32:51,589 --> 00:32:53,129
- Phil?

747
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:55,650
- I think the other thing to hack back

748
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:57,640
to here is this is real.

749
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:00,970
It hurts it doesn't just
hurt companies bottom lines,

750
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:05,370
it hurts seniors, it hurts kids.

751
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:08,489
And it puts at risk our
critical infrastructure

752
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:12,020
in ways that I don't
think we can just think

753
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:15,070
of as another cybersecurity problem.

754
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:17,030
This deserves, I think a higher level

755
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:20,620
of attention and resourcing as a result.

756
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:23,733
And that's what we're
gonna continue to push for.

757
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:29,480
- Great, well, I just
wanna thank our panelists

758
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,320
for joining us today and our audience

759
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:34,480
for listening in and RSA for having us.

760
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:38,750
And I hope everyone enjoys
the rest of the conference.
