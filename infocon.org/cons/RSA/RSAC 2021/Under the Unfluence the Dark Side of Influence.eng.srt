00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:03,849
- Welcome the Under the Unfluence:

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:06,070
the Dark Side of Influence.

3
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:11,070
This is RSA Session HUM-R04
and I'm Ron Woerner.

4
00:00:14,537 --> 00:00:16,300
"I love you.

5
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:19,350
You are the best thing
that ever happened to me.

6
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,930
We have so much in common.

7
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:26,259
Every moment we can spend
together is so special.

8
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:30,410
I know we're separated and can
only talk like this online,

9
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:34,330
someday, we'll be together,
just as soon as I can afford

10
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:36,790
a plane ticket, maybe you can help.

11
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:39,180
So don't, don't leave me.

12
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,767
I don't know what I'd do without you."

13
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,290
Creepy, huh?

14
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:50,870
That is un-fluence in action.

15
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:54,709
We see it every day with our online lives.

16
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:56,280
Who do we talk to?

17
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,610
How are they talking with us?

18
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:00,640
How do we know what they're saying to us?

19
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,260
That's what I'll talk
about in this session

20
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:05,330
'cause by knowing and understanding

21
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:08,780
how these evil, malicious people work,

22
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:11,430
we can better understand
some of our defenses,

23
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:15,580
both at the people, process
and technology level.

24
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:19,970
So, hi, I'm Ron Woerner, or
at least that's the persona

25
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:22,190
I'm using for this session.

26
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:25,750
I may or may not have a few other personas

27
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:28,350
I may use across time and space.

28
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:31,380
I teach for university,
Bellevue University.

29
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,310
I have my own cyber security consultancy.

30
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:36,240
So I'll tell you what, rather
than me giving a whole intro,

31
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,800
feel free, look me up,
Twitter, LinkedIn, or go ahead,

32
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,460
Google stalk me, I double
dog dare ya, it's okay.

33
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,910
Everything there should
be there, and if it's not,

34
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:47,330
we'll have a fun conversation

35
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:49,370
because we'll get to meet each other.

36
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:52,750
So let's talk about some
room rules, like if we have

37
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:55,490
a Zoom bomber, has that
ever happened to you?

38
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,470
Actually, it did happen to me.

39
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:58,720
It was rather entertaining, to be honest,

40
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,860
ask me later.

41
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,840
Other room rules though,
please ask questions.

42
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:06,020
I'll be online with the
chat so you can talk

43
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,210
to me during the chat.

44
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,549
That's kind of the cool thing,
I'm recording this right now,

45
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:13,620
but we can talk and have
multiple conversations at once.

46
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:18,620
If you have any TLAs or FLAs, please ask.

47
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,690
Oh, what's that?

48
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:23,400
What's a TLA or an FLA?

49
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,640
Three-letter acronym or
a four-letter acronym,

50
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,299
not just for my session,
any session at RSA,

51
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,290
if someone says something
you don't know, ask.

52
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:34,239
That's what we're here for.

53
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,980
We're here to learn and grow.

54
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:38,810
So why are we here?

55
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:41,200
Not just on the planet, (indistinct)

56
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,570
why are you here at RSA?

57
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:45,280
What are you hoping to
get out of this session?

58
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,810
Again, put it in the chat.

59
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:47,643
Where's the chat?

60
00:02:47,643 --> 00:02:50,010
That way, I don't know
which way the chat is.

61
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:51,602
Tell me why you are here.

62
00:02:51,603 --> 00:02:53,870
What you're hoping to
gain from this session?

63
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:57,080
You'll learn from me 'cause we
all learn from each other's,

64
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,780
it's I've learned.

65
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:03,610
Romance scams are just
one form of un-fluence

66
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:05,000
that we see in our lives.

67
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,600
It tends to be actually very prevalent.

68
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,810
You see, if I wanna attack an
organization, what do I do?

69
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:13,990
I'm not gonna walk
through their front door,

70
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:16,520
I'm gonna find out, who works there?

71
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,730
What are they like?

72
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:21,359
I'll build rapport, maybe
some of the dating sites

73
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,460
they go to, or maybe other
types of adult sites,

74
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:30,460
become friends with you
there and then infiltrate

75
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,739
from the inside.

76
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:35,860
So it's a common form of
scam that we're seeing,

77
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,680
even from the Federal Trade Commission.

78
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,480
We see this as a form of un-fluence.

79
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,840
It's not the only form.

80
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,840
FTC, though has reported over
$200 million lost in 2019.

81
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,850
And that's just those who reported.

82
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:55,620
My guess, it's actually a lot higher.

83
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:59,130
Most people who are
victims of romance scams,

84
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:02,430
they're too embarrassed to admit it.

85
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:07,430
So how do we even know how
accurate these numbers can be?

86
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,920
This is why.

87
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,470
Think about the stories
behind the numbers.

88
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:14,830
We keep seeing this number
rise, is what's also important.

89
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:19,420
And if you think about it,
even one victim is too many.

90
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:22,280
Now, if you talk to the FBI, they will say

91
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,409
business email compromise
is one of the top scams,

92
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:28,721
but if you were ask them,
they'll say it often starts

93
00:04:28,721 --> 00:04:30,393
with a romance scam.

94
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,360
So it's just one way in,
even within our own industry.

95
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:39,163
Breaking news, everybody.

96
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:45,040
There was a North Korean company
posing as security experts.

97
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,873
What are they called?

98
00:04:45,873 --> 00:04:47,620
Secure Elite?

99
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,810
Posing as security
experts, sharing their data

100
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:54,400
and information, I mean, "Please hire us."

101
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,340
Reported that not quite
who they seem to be,

102
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:01,109
but they look legitimate, don't they?

103
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:04,230
Though Sun Xu says, "I do
recommend reading books

104
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:07,370
outside of traditional cyber security.

105
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:11,417
To know your enemy, you
must become your enemy."

106
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,739
This has been a debate in cybersecurity

107
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:17,880
ever since I've been involved.

108
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,469
How do we understand fully
what our enemy may do?

109
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:23,770
We're just having that general perspective

110
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:26,719
so we can put some of the
top types of blockades,

111
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,930
and at the end of the
session, I'll share some ways

112
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:31,513
you can prevent un-fluence.

113
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,940
So how does this happen?

114
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:37,370
Whether it's romance scams or phishing,

115
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:40,580
your own complacency and errors.

116
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:43,539
We tend to be our own worst enemy, right?

117
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:47,680
This deals with earth day,
this cartoon, Pogo from what?

118
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,780
1971.

119
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:51,840
We're our own worst enemy.

120
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,599
This is actually improving.

121
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,640
Look at the Verizon Data Breach Report.

122
00:05:55,640 --> 00:06:00,640
The 2020 report has almost
50% of all reported breaches

123
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:06,330
has to do with the human
element, whether it's errors

124
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:10,810
or use of social attacks, so
romance scams, social attack,

125
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:12,260
but what about errors?

126
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,440
We often forget about that.

127
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,670
Let me share a story.

128
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:19,690
I was at a fraud conference
and it was during a keynote

129
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:23,420
and you get kinda, I took
out my elite hacking...

130
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:26,140
Okay, that was just my
iPhone, and I looked to see

131
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:28,870
what were the open WiFi
channels, and I saw one

132
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,880
that said "Auditorium".

133
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,180
Okay, so I click on, it
takes me to a website

134
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:37,020
for the projector high up on the ceiling.

135
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:37,853
I'm like, okay.

136
00:06:37,853 --> 00:06:39,780
I can 'cause a little trouble here.

137
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:43,640
Hey, there's a button on
the side that says "Admin".

138
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,690
So I click on, it takes me to a webpage,

139
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:50,143
User ID, Admin, password blank.

140
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,342
What do you think the password was?

141
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,310
Yeah, actually, I don't remember.

142
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,200
It was either admin or password.

143
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,330
Either way, I had a 50
50 shot of getting it.

144
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:03,380
I owned that device.

145
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,930
Oh, by the way, is what I did legal?

146
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:06,893
Technically no.

147
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:08,733
Ethical?

148
00:07:08,733 --> 00:07:10,290
Well, I did tell the IT guy

149
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:12,780
as soon as we went on break,
I took no other steps,

150
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,679
I knew the keynote speaker and
I didn't wanna mess him up,

151
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,240
but it's like, oh my
gosh, if I can do this,

152
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,310
other people can do this.

153
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:21,400
So that's an example
of just a common error

154
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,919
because the it guy, "Oh yeah,
I reset it at the beginning

155
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,680
of the week and I forgot to fix that.

156
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,900
How often does that
happen in our environment?

157
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,700
So we sometimes are our own worst enemy.

158
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:36,560
Let's talk about other types
of un-fluence techniques.

159
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,960
How does it happen?

160
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,590
So we can understand how
to best protect against it.

161
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:44,310
Number one, blind trust.

162
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:47,420
So if you're playing conference, bingo,

163
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:51,520
where you're listening for
keywords like Zero Trust Cloud,

164
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,770
you know the words I'm talking about.

165
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:57,080
Zero Trust means we shouldn't
necessarily trust our users,

166
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,450
but we need to trust our users

167
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:01,120
for them to be able to
connect to our systems,

168
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,600
the question is knowing how,
when and where to trust.

169
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,410
Let me just give you an example.

170
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:11,410
Abraham Lincoln from 2006,
this looks legit, right?

171
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:16,479
How often do we just
trust quotes like this

172
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,860
without thinking about it?

173
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:20,123
So how do we prevent CYA?

174
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,203
No, no, no, no, no, not that CYA.

175
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,250
Check your assumptions.

176
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,710
Sometimes I'll say
challenge your assumptions

177
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:33,750
'cause we make assumptions
based on our fast brain working.

178
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,000
So let me explain a little
bit of brain science here.

179
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,870
This comes from Daniel Kahneman's
thinking fast and slow,

180
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:41,653
Nobel Prize, winning author,
columnist, I believe.

181
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,970
We have a fast brain and a slow brain.

182
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:48,810
Fast brain is how we normally
operate, very efficient,

183
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:51,849
but room for error, which
goes to the slow brain

184
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:54,033
where we process, takes more time.

185
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:58,360
Those con artists, those evil
people try to take advantage

186
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:02,020
of us being mindless,
getting us not to think.

187
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:06,420
So by calling a quick timeout,
moving from fast brain

188
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:11,420
to slow brain, we can prevent
this type of blind trust.

189
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:16,570
Okay, looking at it go, wait,
no wait, that ten second pause

190
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:20,630
can save a lot of heartache later on.

191
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:24,997
Another challenge we see, complacent,

192
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:26,189
"That'll never happen to me.

193
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:30,410
I'm too small, who would ever
want to get my information?"

194
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:33,360
Yeah, until it's too late.

195
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,503
You all have seen it, or
"I'm too smart for this,

196
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:40,763
I've been doing this for years.

197
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,730
I'd be able to tell if
someone was coming after me.

198
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:47,507
I can tell if it's a romance scam or not."

199
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,843
They are really good at what they do.

200
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:54,829
They will go through a lot of
effort to try to trick you,

201
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:58,180
whether it's romance scam
or a foreign nation state,

202
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:01,693
trying to get at our country's secrets.

203
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,570
If it takes them six months
to a year to infiltrate

204
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:09,920
the attack and exploit
those vulnerabilities,

205
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,860
they'll spend that time.

206
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:14,830
So don't think that it couldn't,
it can happen to anybody.

207
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:16,160
If you talk to Chris Hadnagy.

208
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,319
So Chris Hadnagy wrote
one of the top books

209
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,000
in social engineering,
"Social Engineering:

210
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,630
The Science of Human Hacking".

211
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:24,870
He's been phished.

212
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:25,880
We've all been there.

213
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,200
We've gotten a phish, I've done too,

214
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,860
it's like I've literally
had to take and stop my hand

215
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,580
from clicking on it.

216
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,190
It can happen to any of us.

217
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:38,190
We're just being so busy
that we don't even realize

218
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:41,016
that we've become complacent.

219
00:10:41,017 --> 00:10:44,150
"Yeah, I'll do that
security stuff tomorrow."

220
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,417
And then tomorrow comes and then,

221
00:10:45,417 --> 00:10:48,080
"Oh wait, oh, I gotta get this done."

222
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,810
And we don't prioritize well.

223
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:53,140
So don't allow your own busy-ness to be

224
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,833
what stops you from noticing.

225
00:10:55,870 --> 00:11:00,380
Taking a breath, taking
the time out and allowing

226
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:03,180
your slow brain to work is actually

227
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:06,819
one of the best techniques
that I tell my students

228
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,860
for when they're thinking
through a problem.

229
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,663
Works for professionals as well.

230
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:15,110
I wanna talk to you next about a resource.

231
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:18,870
Chris Hadnagy mentions it in his books.

232
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:22,330
It's probably the most
referenced cybersecurity book

233
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:26,210
that has nothing to do with
technology or anything cybery.

234
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:29,557
Okay, Dr. Robert Cialdini's, it's called

235
00:11:29,557 --> 00:11:32,710
"Psychology of Persuasion"
about influence,

236
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:35,950
and it's how we can positively influence,

237
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:37,920
but we can use it if we
take off our white hat,

238
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,849
put on our black hat, understand how those

239
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:43,890
who are trying to un-fluence us can work.

240
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:47,560
Let me talk through the
six elements of influence.

241
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:52,560
First is likability, where we like people

242
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:56,170
and if we like people,
we'll listen to them more.

243
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:59,959
Why I work at making
myself more attractive.

244
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,050
I know, it doesn't really
work all that well.

245
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:03,430
I try though.

246
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:06,579
So being more likable, being human

247
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,099
increases your attractiveness.

248
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:12,893
Those who are more attractive
are better social engineers.

249
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:16,700
By the way, who's better
at being a social engineer?

250
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:17,663
Women or men?

251
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,860
Scientific studies show
women, 'cause guys are stupid.

252
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:23,693
I admit it.

253
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,790
If an attractive female,
smiles and ask for help,

254
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,610
I gotta do my macho male
thing and I'm gonna help,

255
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:35,870
and yeah, so that's likeability.

256
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:38,116
Or think about the example
here of Sally Field.

257
00:12:38,116 --> 00:12:41,250
She won the Oscar and she "You like me,

258
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,017
really, really like me."

259
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,250
Why do a lot of people win awards?

260
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:50,430
Not only because of a great
accomplishment, but likability.

261
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:53,469
So think about how it can be
used positively and negatively.

262
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:56,527
Another one of these aspects, authority.

263
00:12:56,527 --> 00:12:57,540
"I'm in charge."

264
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:00,250
So let me show you something
right now in a t-shirt,

265
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,910
I call this the law of the suit coat.

266
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:04,382
I taught this to my son.

267
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:08,250
All of a sudden, you put on a suit coat,

268
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,600
my authority goes up.

269
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,880
This is why I love working from home.

270
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,930
I can change wardrobe
between meetings to match

271
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:17,689
whoever I'm speaking with,
'cause actually matching

272
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:20,743
is a great social engineering
technique as well.

273
00:13:20,743 --> 00:13:23,320
Just be aware of it, how it could be used.

274
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,070
So authority.

275
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:27,637
Someone you can take
charge, or if they're saying

276
00:13:27,637 --> 00:13:29,457
"Well, do you know who I am?"

277
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,840
It could be, they're trying
to social engineering you.

278
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,420
Another technique, reciprocation.

279
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:39,839
So when we're back live in San Francisco

280
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,790
at the Moscone Center, as
you're walking through the hall,

281
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:45,266
you see this all the time with vendors.

282
00:13:45,267 --> 00:13:48,630
"Here, would you like the squishy ball?

283
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:51,670
Would you like ice cream
or a t-shirt or socks?"

284
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:52,880
Why do they do it?

285
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,453
'Cause they're really nice.

286
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,319
Law of reciprocation.

287
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:01,840
If you take something from
them, you feel indebted to them.

288
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,980
The example I really
like, and if you watch

289
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:07,390
the "Big Bang Theory", great
examples of social engineering

290
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:09,050
throughout that show.

291
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:12,413
If you watch it, there's an
episode with Penny and Sheldon,

292
00:14:12,413 --> 00:14:17,413
Sheldon, the scientist,
penny got assigned his napkin

293
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,663
from Leonard Nimoy.

294
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:23,400
She gave it to Sheldon
for a Christmas present

295
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,367
and he freaked out, okay?

296
00:14:26,367 --> 00:14:29,372
And he went and he got her
a dozen Christmas presents.

297
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,570
He was trying to reciprocate.

298
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,350
He's like, "I have to give you something

299
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:35,490
that's worth as much as
what you just gave me.",

300
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:37,830
'cause he felt indebted to her.

301
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:39,450
That's reciprocation.

302
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:42,300
So be careful when someone
tries to give you something

303
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:47,130
for free, what are you
really giving in exchange?

304
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:48,253
Is it really free?

305
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:54,627
Four to five security professionals say,

306
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:57,469
"You need to be careful
of social engineering."

307
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:00,150
Okay, 42% of all statistics
are made up anyway,

308
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:02,473
so that's social proof.

309
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:07,200
For example, you see a
rating, have you ever not gone

310
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,140
to a restaurant or purchased something

311
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,970
because of the rating?

312
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:13,720
But we know ratings are
sometimes fabricated, right?

313
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:17,150
But that's that social proof,
"Everyone else is doing it,

314
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,247
So it's okay for me to do it, right?"

315
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,293
Maybe not.

316
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:24,040
Another common technique we hear

317
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,497
from Dr. Robert Cialdini's

318
00:15:25,497 --> 00:15:30,190
"Influence the Art of
Persuasion" is scarcity.

319
00:15:30,191 --> 00:15:32,600
"Act now."

320
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,020
We see this on sites
where we go buy items,

321
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:39,430
whether it's plane tickets,
"There's only three tickets left

322
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:40,819
at this price."

323
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,417
Or it could be time-based.

324
00:15:42,417 --> 00:15:46,897
"If you want it within the
next 24 hours, click here."

325
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,560
They're operating off of scarcity.

326
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,392
What's scarcity?

327
00:15:51,393 --> 00:15:53,960
I guess it depends on
where you're from, right?

328
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:57,530
Be aware of how this can be
used for un-fluence as well.

329
00:15:57,530 --> 00:16:00,079
Last one, commitment and consistency.

330
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:04,940
Now I use this for positive
when I'm working with executives

331
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,470
who want to accept the risk.

332
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:09,430
I'm like, okay, so you're
willing to accept that risk,

333
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:13,306
are you willing to sign
saying you own this risk?

334
00:16:13,307 --> 00:16:16,157
"Well, it's your job in
security to own risks."

335
00:16:16,157 --> 00:16:19,050
"No, I just report the
news, you own the risk

336
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:21,579
because it's your decision,
'cause business people

337
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,687
make risk decisions all the time, right?"

338
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:28,170
Something to consider,
once you have commitment

339
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:30,430
to something you're willing
to stick through it.

340
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:33,910
Now the law of diminishing
returns is the economics term,

341
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:34,870
if you will.

342
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:37,950
You're already involved
in this presentation,

343
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:40,460
so you're like, "Hey, Ron's just okay.",

344
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,610
but I gotta see this
through, I gotta figure out

345
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:44,690
what he's really getting
at, so you're committed

346
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:47,040
to hanging out with me,
thank you very much,

347
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,990
please talk with me and chat.

348
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:52,590
This idea of being committed,
we can take advantage

349
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:54,730
of this for positive or negative.

350
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:58,730
One way to do it, why we
have people sign petitions,

351
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:02,110
soon as you sign, you feel
more committed as well.

352
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:06,800
So those are Robert. Cialdini's
six parts of influence.

353
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:10,530
Think about how we can
use these both positively

354
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:14,000
and how those dealing with
un-fluence use them as well.

355
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,522
Now, where do we see this in action?

356
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,510
Phishing.

357
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:21,000
Oh, by the way, if you're
playing conference bingo,

358
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,150
here's your Dilbert slide required

359
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:25,869
in your security presentation, right?

360
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:28,379
We're already familiar with phishing.

361
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,793
By the way, phishing is never going away.

362
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:33,630
How do I know this?

363
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:35,190
It's too easy.

364
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:38,240
So in chat, I'm putting a
link where you can learn

365
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,940
more about phishing.

366
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,663
It's a good link, trust me.

367
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,030
It's too easy.

368
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:48,310
So the story, my son
working at a McDonald's

369
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:51,010
here where I live, two
weeks after he started,

370
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:54,677
he got an email, said, "Click
here to see your paycheck."

371
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,860
He was a 16-year-old, he wanted
to see how much he earned.

372
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:00,572
So he clicked here, took him to a website.

373
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:05,740
First name, last name, blank,
social security number.

374
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:10,030
It was not McDonald's, the
email was not from McDonald's.

375
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:12,660
A little background on my
son, he's a football player,

376
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,863
he does construction.

377
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,973
So not a geek like his old man.

378
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:20,523
What do you think my son did?

379
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:24,080
And now, for the rest of
the story, (indistinct),

380
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,560
My son asked me, "Dad, this looks weird.

381
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,486
Can you help?"

382
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:34,820
Yes, that simple act.

383
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:35,879
So what do you think?

384
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,233
Was that legitimate or is that phishing?

385
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,629
Most of you are gonna say phishing.

386
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:42,360
It look just like phishing.

387
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:46,379
No, it was legit, it was the
local human resources company,

388
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:49,750
managing the franchise for my area.

389
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,630
That's how they get paychecks out

390
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,710
to new McDonald's employees.

391
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:55,490
You can tell by the little
writing at the bottom

392
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:57,523
of the email that no one ever reads.

393
00:18:58,390 --> 00:18:59,650
Phishing is too easy.

394
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:01,530
Now, you're familiar with SMS,

395
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:03,070
that's where you get the text message.

396
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:05,179
"Congratulations, you have a package.

397
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:07,190
Visit vishing voicemail."

398
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:08,453
What's wishing?

399
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:13,670
When I came up with webinar
phishing, so if I wanna break

400
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:16,150
into a company, I'm not
gonna phish your email,

401
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:19,493
no, there are spam blockers
now, I'm gonna hop on your Zoom.

402
00:19:20,647 --> 00:19:23,730
I'm gonna attend a seminar
that you're attending

403
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:26,730
or your executives attend,
or your finance people

404
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:30,910
or your attorneys and I'm
gonna social engineer people

405
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:34,907
in chat, webinar phishing.

406
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:38,360
"Hey, I have this great
article I wanna share with you.

407
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,570
Go ahead and click on this Word document."

408
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:43,620
Not realizing it has a macro
that might not be caught,

409
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:47,270
'cause it's a form of spear
phishing, if you will.

410
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:50,190
So be aware, all these different
communication channels now

411
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:53,280
for phishing, it's not
just for email anymore.

412
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,143
Also finding information.

413
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:59,050
Like I asked, go ahead and Google me,

414
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:00,790
but what are other ways?

415
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:04,230
What if we had one website you could go to

416
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:08,040
with a lot of other resources
and links where you can search

417
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,260
for people's usernames,
email addresses, IP,

418
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:14,280
what social networks people use.

419
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:18,220
So homework time, I've told
you I'm a college professor

420
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:20,280
and I give homework, right?

421
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,660
My homework's kinda fun, I think.

422
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:25,479
And let's be honest, homework begins after

423
00:20:25,479 --> 00:20:26,810
you're done with school.

424
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:29,590
We're always doing homework,
that's why you're here now.

425
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:33,770
Go to osintframework.com,
check it out first,

426
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:35,550
but verify, perfectly okay by me.

427
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:39,440
Go to osintframework.com,
look through these resources

428
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,440
so you can find out
information about people.

429
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,320
All of these are links
where you can learn more

430
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,723
and gain information.

431
00:20:47,572 --> 00:20:51,649
Talking with the FBI,
the two top resources

432
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:55,243
social engineers are using
for business email compromise,

433
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:57,990
of course, Facebook,
Instagram, and nothing

434
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,113
against these places, but also LinkedIn.

435
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:06,490
I want to create a whole
organizational chart for a company

436
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:07,653
that I'm interested in.

437
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:10,633
I can do that through LinkedIn.

438
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:16,210
Google, of course, another,
but it goes beyond.

439
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:19,550
Information, we leak information all over.

440
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:21,260
So where is your information?

441
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:23,050
Where is it leaking?

442
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:26,409
How are you containing it as a consumer?

443
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:30,570
And then on the counter side,
as a security professional,

444
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:33,263
what are you doing to
protect other people's data?

445
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,370
Another common problem that
I've been seeing my career

446
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:43,139
as a cybersecurity professional
is people just don't listen.

447
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:46,200
They don't read, they
don't look at instructions.

448
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:51,200
They don't RTFM, read the
fine manual, by the way,

449
00:21:52,643 --> 00:21:55,560
it's a military term, I am prior Air Force

450
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:59,159
and when someone wouldn't
read the instructions,

451
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,502
we just say, "RTFM".

452
00:22:01,502 --> 00:22:04,452
I still use this with the some
of the students I work with.

453
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:08,870
Make sure you're looking
through all of the instructions.

454
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:10,842
It often is right in front of us.

455
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,020
One of the quotes I love using

456
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,780
with other security professionals though

457
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:19,087
is Dr. Eugene Spafford
from Purdue University

458
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:21,850
"Practical UNIX and Internet Security".

459
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:25,793
Hard to believe that book,
21-years-old this year.

460
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:30,057
His law, first principle
of security administration,

461
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:31,980
"If you have responsibility for security,

462
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,810
be you don't have the
authority to enforce it,

463
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:36,399
you're just there to take the blame

464
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,857
when something goes wrong."

465
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:42,150
How many of you are in
that position right now,

466
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:43,123
or have been?

467
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:48,660
I've quit jobs because of
this where, "Hey, yeah,

468
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:52,180
you're our security guy and
you're the guy we're gonna fire

469
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,730
after we get breached."

470
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:56,320
But you're not letting me change anything,

471
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,852
it's called a security
figurehead syndrome,

472
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:02,700
been known for well over 20 years.

473
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,320
I think I have a paper from 20 years ago

474
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,070
about security figurehead syndrome.

475
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,320
It's making sure, so
if you're an executive,

476
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,730
making sure those responsible
have the authority

477
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:15,180
and if you don't have the
authority use these techniques,

478
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:17,840
maybe you just need to wear a suit coat.

479
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,493
Try not to fool yourself.

480
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:24,240
Be honest with yourself,
know your own blind spots,

481
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,170
have trusted advisors in
your life who can tell you

482
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:30,050
the truth, maybe not
what you want to hear,

483
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:31,572
but what you need to hear.

484
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:35,939
So what are the different
sides of influence?

485
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:38,633
Now, I'm showing this
coin, well, first of all,

486
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:43,543
is it influence or manipulation?

487
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,520
I had a student actually
asked me this in class once,

488
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,120
my Social Engineering class.

489
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,979
Are you just teaching us
to influence or manipulate?

490
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,822
Yes, both.

491
00:23:54,822 --> 00:23:56,850
It really comes down to your intent.

492
00:23:56,850 --> 00:24:00,340
If you're trying to promote,
help people, it's influence.

493
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:02,409
Maybe if you're trying to
get them to do something

494
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:04,920
not necessarily in
their own best interest,

495
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:07,030
that's more manipulation, right?

496
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:10,379
So be would be aware of
how this can be used.

497
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,980
Put in chat, what do you think?

498
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:16,300
Is what I'm telling you
influence or manipulation?

499
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,220
How about this?

500
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:19,660
Why I also teach social engineering,

501
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,810
it's actually a primary reason,

502
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:24,050
not just because it's kind of a fun topic

503
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:25,633
to talk about human hacking,

504
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,223
we really need more security leaders.

505
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:32,763
We need people who know how to lead.

506
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:39,090
If you read Dr. John Maxwell,
very well-known author

507
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:43,917
on leadership, so read his books
like "Winning With People",

508
00:24:43,917 --> 00:24:46,699
"21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership",

509
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:49,930
I believe is one of Dr. John Maxwell.

510
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:51,960
Leadership is influence.

511
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,980
Use these same techniques.

512
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:57,600
Let's talk about some of
these techniques you can use

513
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,469
to help build yourself as a leader

514
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:01,760
and then you can understand

515
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,990
how it can be used for un-fluence.

516
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:06,910
Well, first of all, building a rapport.

517
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:09,350
And just starting with
something of interest,

518
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:11,679
so before I'll connect with somebody

519
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,690
or I'll meet with someone,
I'll connect with them,

520
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:16,303
find out what you're interested is, okay?

521
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,740
It could be phishing, it
could be baking, whatever,

522
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:23,570
just start that conversation

523
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:26,060
and then maybe build your ego.

524
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:29,179
So here's a tip for you, if
you're connecting with me

525
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:31,430
on LinkedIn, by the way,
thank you, I love connecting

526
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:34,520
with people, but put a note where we met.

527
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:37,260
So when I'm connecting
with someone on LinkedIn,

528
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:40,657
I'll include a note and then
I'll appeal to their ego.

529
00:25:40,657 --> 00:25:43,929
"Ooh, I really liked your
post on", or "I like this",

530
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:47,890
or "I appreciate that", showing interest,

531
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:50,200
but coming to their ego.

532
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,623
So the flattery still does work.

533
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:57,383
Dr. John Maxwell, I mentioned
he has his 32nd rule.

534
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:03,670
Within 30 seconds of meeting
someone, find something honest

535
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,047
you can compliment them about.

536
00:26:06,047 --> 00:26:09,790
"Hey, I really liked that suit
coat." or "I like that pen.",

537
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:14,790
or find something to appeal to
their ego, build the rapport.

538
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,457
You can always try
volunteering information,

539
00:26:19,457 --> 00:26:22,060
"Hey, I got a secret for you."

540
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:24,600
And then you're more willing,
it's that reciprocation,

541
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,903
quid pro quo, if you will.

542
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:33,120
Or you can also try to
exploit instinct to complain.

543
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,486
What is that?

544
00:26:34,487 --> 00:26:38,730
"I can't believe the RSA
Conference just did this, can you?

545
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:42,050
You may just begin complaining,
because I've built rapport

546
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:43,832
based on something in common.

547
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:47,980
Someone's complaining, well, first of all,

548
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:50,910
they're going negative,
I like being positive.

549
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:52,720
Second of all, could be un-fluence

550
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:57,260
or using an erroneous statement.

551
00:26:57,260 --> 00:27:01,060
I'll do this because it
makes you feel superior

552
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:04,246
if I say something I know to be untrue.

553
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:06,307
"No, Ron, it's really this."

554
00:27:06,307 --> 00:27:07,860
"Oh, you're right.

555
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,750
Oh, you're so smart."

556
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:13,173
Now I'm blatant with it there,
but I can be really subtle.

557
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:17,062
So be aware, if I say
something that's incorrect,

558
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,723
I may be doing it on purpose.

559
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:25,877
Silence, awesome way to get
people to talk, like right now.

560
00:27:28,697 --> 00:27:30,387
"Did he freeze?"

561
00:27:30,387 --> 00:27:31,940
"No"

562
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:35,720
When you're in-person,
if you have silence,

563
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,160
you can use it to get the other person

564
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,260
'cause they're gonna try to fill that gap.

565
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,700
And then last for adults in the room,

566
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:46,220
assuming everyone here is
an adult, alcohol does work.

567
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,700
I once had a student performing

568
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:51,040
a social engineering experiment for class.

569
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,990
He was trying to see if
he could social engineer

570
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:56,090
someone's cell phone, okay,
and he was in military.

571
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:59,393
So he went off post, went to a
local drinking establishment,

572
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:05,280
bought another military person
an adult beverage, alcohol,

573
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,370
and that person pretty
much leaked all sorts

574
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:11,750
of fun information, some
of his military secrets,

575
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:15,650
and my student was like,
"OMG, I can't believe

576
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:17,510
what this person told me.

577
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:20,657
I was just being friendly and
they gave me their cellphone."

578
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:24,800
Where can you learn more?

579
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,430
One of my favorite books
is "How to Win Friends

580
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:31,590
and Influence People"
by Dale Carnegie, 1930s.

581
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:35,230
So keep in mind, different
mindset back then,

582
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:40,230
a different frame of thought,
so it is biased, somewhat.

583
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,310
The principles still apply.

584
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:44,750
If you want a more modern version,

585
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:49,270
you can read like Adam Grant
or as I said, John Maxwell.

586
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:52,450
So relax, smile, that
increases like ability,

587
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:54,343
saying people's names.

588
00:28:55,273 --> 00:28:59,469
A person's name is like
gold to their ears, okay?

589
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:00,303
So, say it.

590
00:29:00,303 --> 00:29:02,260
I used to go off and repeat someone's name

591
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:04,303
'cause I want to remember people's name,

592
00:29:04,303 --> 00:29:07,223
used as a trick for myself,
how do I remember names?

593
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:11,010
But also with an increase
in my likeability,

594
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:12,563
getting back to that principle.

595
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:14,840
Talk about listening ear.

596
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,939
Other people's interests, and
as I said, building rapport,

597
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,627
finding what interests them

598
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,490
and then making you feel important.

599
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:27,490
I try to do this just because
I like building people

600
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:31,740
just naturally, great way
to increase your influence.

601
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,820
Where does it often start though?

602
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:35,639
How do you start doing all this?

603
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,653
Well, first of all, observation.

604
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:41,540
Observe, what is behind people?

605
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:44,610
So I put up a white backdrop on purpose.

606
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:47,490
During these sessions, I love
to see what's behind people

607
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:49,580
'cause I've used this to social engineers,

608
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:50,699
actually, it was a presenter talking

609
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:53,190
about social engineering about a year ago.

610
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:55,570
I saw she had guitars behind her.

611
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:59,230
So, "Oh, you must be a
great guitar player."

612
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:02,620
And we had a fun
conversation about guitars.

613
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:04,703
So yeah, build rapport.

614
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:09,513
We have two years, two eyes,
one mouth for a reason.

615
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:14,023
Try to listen more than
twice as much as you talk.

616
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:17,260
Let me give you another tip though,

617
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:20,800
actually I started giving
this tip back in about 2007

618
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,639
at the RSA Conference when I was talking

619
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,563
about how does security
people become people people?

620
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:30,527
We tend to be introverts,
geeks, nerds, quiet.

621
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:36,290
Do you know how I start
my social engineering

622
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:38,653
and how I start many conversations?

623
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:41,370
Hi, I'm Ron.

624
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:44,020
I'm virtually shaking hands,
or now we're doing fist bumps

625
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:47,080
'cause we're supposed to be
socially distanced, right?

626
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,090
Even online.

627
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:48,923
Okay, maybe not.

628
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:51,973
Really, it starts that simple.

629
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:55,750
Just get out and say hi,
and I'll challenge you

630
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:57,040
a little more with that on a moment.

631
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,750
But how do we prevent un-fluence?

632
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:03,333
Share your tips in chat, by
the way, I wanna hear from you.

633
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:08,129
First of all, this technique
is the number one technique

634
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:11,970
that I've heard from the
department of Homeland Security

635
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:13,580
and the FBI.

636
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:17,233
It's the most efficient,
cost-effective method,

637
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,460
ask for help.

638
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:22,050
So right now, as I'm recording
this, it's tax season

639
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:25,332
and even RSA just done with tax season.

640
00:31:27,607 --> 00:31:29,760
"I just got this email from the IRS

641
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,379
and it says I'm behind in my 2020 taxes

642
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:34,950
and they didn't receive it, I have...

643
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:37,270
They're saying that I need to pay

644
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:40,787
and they want me to pay with
a Green Dot card or Bitcoin."

645
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:46,120
Now, again, that seems
obvious, but not everyone

646
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,810
is knowledgeable about this.

647
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:50,340
It's like my son just asked for help.

648
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:53,250
Do you have an aunt Sally or
an uncle Joe in your life?

649
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:55,880
You know that person that will,
"Well, you know computers,

650
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,507
can you help me fix mine?"

651
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:01,770
For me, it's my 88-year-old
mom, and what I tell my mom

652
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:04,420
is if something doesn't seem right,

653
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:08,270
please ask for help, okay?

654
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:10,460
So takes how long?

655
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:14,960
How long did it take for me
to stop, call time out, ask.

656
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,840
Now, does the person you're asking need

657
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:19,165
to be a cybersecurity expert?

658
00:32:19,165 --> 00:32:20,033
Nope.

659
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:24,360
Getting a second opinion goes a long way.

660
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,750
It could be one, but it
doesn't make a difference.

661
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:30,370
One person asking the
other, it's slowing down,

662
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:33,820
allowing your fast brain
to pull in your slow brain

663
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:36,706
and go, "Wait a minute,
this doesn't look right."

664
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:40,986
So it's becoming of what we're doing.

665
00:32:40,987 --> 00:32:44,870
And from Homeland
Security, "Stop and think

666
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:46,447
before you connect."

667
00:32:46,447 --> 00:32:50,520
"Stop and think before you connect."

668
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:54,400
That's simple, "Pay me
now or pay me later"

669
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:59,400
Take maybe 20 seconds now,
or it can take time later.

670
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:03,562
I hear this from identity theft victims.

671
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:08,535
What hurts more, the
amount of money they lost

672
00:33:08,536 --> 00:33:10,003
or the comfort?

673
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,830
Usually it's the comfort and their time.

674
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:15,960
So yeah, I didn't lose
any money, but it took me

675
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:20,320
about 10 hours to confirm
that really it was not me

676
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:24,572
with my credit card company
or my health insurer or law.

677
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:28,590
Any of those, it's
losing that peace of mind

678
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:30,649
after something bad happens.

679
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:34,800
So ask for help, be mindful,
I already talked to you

680
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,330
about that CYA challenge

681
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:39,493
or some, when are you assuming things?

682
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:42,940
Trust, but verify.

683
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:46,160
You said this for so
long in cybersecurity,

684
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:49,290
we need to listen, do it ourselves.

685
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:51,860
If you see something, say something.

686
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:54,580
Has this happened to
you, you're on a website

687
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:56,220
and you get in there and
you see they're running

688
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:59,043
Apache Tomcat version 8.5.4.

689
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:05,123
First thing I do is,
"Dear Mr. Administrator,

690
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:08,985
you're leaking information.

691
00:34:08,985 --> 00:34:10,179
Did you realize?"

692
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:13,020
Quite often it's like, "Oh,
wow, we didn't realize,

693
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,620
thank you for saying something."

694
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,123
If you see something, say something,

695
00:34:17,123 --> 00:34:19,969
don't think someone
else will say something.

696
00:34:19,969 --> 00:34:22,250
It's actually, again,
read Cialdini's book,

697
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:26,862
he talks about back where
people saw someone being beat up

698
00:34:28,219 --> 00:34:30,716
in New York, everyone thought,

699
00:34:30,717 --> 00:34:32,847
"Well, someone else will call the cops."

700
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:35,310
You see something that's from New York,

701
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:37,105
New Jersey Transit Authority,

702
00:34:37,106 --> 00:34:40,377
don't think it's insignificant,
and be humble about it,

703
00:34:40,377 --> 00:34:43,860
"Hey, I noticed your
website is doing this."

704
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:45,833
Just wanna let you know.

705
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:47,639
And you're not looking
for anything in return,

706
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:50,529
this is not for reciprocation,
you can confirm,

707
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:52,460
or you don't have to do anything,

708
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:54,283
I do it for my own peace of mind.

709
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,543
What are your tips?

710
00:34:58,350 --> 00:35:00,650
Please share them with me in
chat, and know by the way,

711
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:04,430
I'm gonna be hanging out
after this for a live Q and A,

712
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:08,649
so I'd love to hear your
ideas, hear your stories.

713
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:12,250
Share not just with me,
but share with others

714
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:16,450
'cause that's really the
power of the RSA Conference,

715
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:19,669
it's taking what we're
learning during the sessions

716
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:23,870
and actually applying
it to our real lives.

717
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:28,130
Very unique to the RSA Conference
is this application slide,

718
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:32,150
which I use it in so many
of my other types of talks.

719
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:37,150
So first of all right now,
right now, meet someone new.

720
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,790
(indistinct)

721
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:41,210
They're not gonna take away your birthday

722
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:43,050
or bite your head off,

723
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:45,800
people at RSA Conference are wonderful,

724
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,530
I love the people here,
which is why I love coming

725
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:50,120
and doing the RSA.

726
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:54,589
So find someone new,
practice your influence,

727
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:59,080
not un-fluence, techniques
with him or her or them,

728
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:02,920
whatever you wanna go by, whatever, they,

729
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,323
people want to be called.

730
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,850
I'm open to that.

731
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:11,230
Not to get political with that
because I want other people

732
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:12,313
to feel comfortable.

733
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,920
Meet someone new, try these techniques,

734
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,003
also catch someone doing something well.

735
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:22,792
Quite often, we go negative with security,

736
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:27,497
rather than just saying,
"Boy, your security sucks."

737
00:36:27,497 --> 00:36:29,497
"Boy, you're doing a great job with it."

738
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:34,090
That's from "The One Minute
Manager" by Jordan Johnson,

739
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:36,000
another good leadership book I recommend.

740
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,770
Within the next month, actually
within the next week also,

741
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:41,650
where are you seeing an un-fluence?

742
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:44,850
If you're shopping for a car, you see it,

743
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:46,850
where are you seeing it on TV

744
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:49,120
or any other types of advertising?

745
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,663
And then use techniques on your own.

746
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,070
And then rewatch this
video, if for nothing else,

747
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:55,903
for the laughs.

748
00:36:55,903 --> 00:36:58,330
You have to watch me talk through

749
00:36:58,330 --> 00:37:01,009
all of these different techniques,
these are good reminders.

750
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:03,150
It's often we're not
learning anything new,

751
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:05,653
but just remembering maybe what we forgot.

752
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,350
At this point, I'm
really curious to connect

753
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:11,450
with each of you.

754
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:14,240
Please ask me questions in chat,

755
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,493
connect with me on LinkedIn.

756
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:24,550
So yes, I do love you, but no,
not in the way you thinking,

757
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:27,160
it's Philo's rather than arrows love.

758
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,270
I just love helping people.

759
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:31,383
Philos, brotherly love.

760
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:36,010
I love helping people learn
how to protect themselves.

761
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:39,260
My job is to help is to
work myself out of a job

762
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:42,970
knowing I never will,
and that's why I do this.

763
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:46,770
So there's resources on romance
scams, you can use these,

764
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:50,470
these slides are available,
but really, connect with me.

765
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:53,129
Love, hearing your stories and please

766
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:56,920
keep sharing your stories,
help others making sure

767
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:59,493
they are not under the un-fluence.

768
00:38:00,761 --> 00:38:04,650
I'm Ron Woerner with Bellevue
University and Cyber-AAA,

769
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:06,650
and I look forward to chatting with you.
