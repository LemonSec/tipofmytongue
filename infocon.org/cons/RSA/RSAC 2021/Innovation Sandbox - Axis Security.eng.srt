00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:10,940
- Please welcome,

2
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:14,437
the CEO of "Axis Security",

3
00:00:14,437 --> 00:00:16,817
"Dor Knafo"

4
00:00:16,817 --> 00:00:18,980
- "Axis", is a fundamental need,

5
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:21,420
but today "Axis" is broken.

6
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,570
It started a VPN, giving
full network access,

7
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:26,740
then we needed something
to protect us when

8
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:27,950
accessing the internet,

9
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:30,290
so "Secure Web Gateway", was made.

10
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:33,040
when "RSA'C" merged, "CASBY" was created.

11
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,660
and there are many more solutions we use

12
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,260
for Axis everyday,

13
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:38,589
such as VDI is at "Axis Jump Box",

14
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:40,390
application delivery controllers,

15
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:41,820
the Modesto gateways,

16
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,480
and the list goes on.

17
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,519
So we ended up with much
complexity and excessive access.

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,160
We have way too many
policies to manage the cost

19
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,209
of many solutions.

20
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,600
There is no visibility to what's going on.

21
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,380
We need to take care of segmentation.

22
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:58,220
There are many vendor relationships
that we need to manage

23
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:01,310
and above all, a massive
attack surface is created,

24
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:03,430
when one extends the network,

25
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:04,640
and you don't solve the problem

26
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,760
by just pushing those legacy
solutions to the cloud,

27
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,340
and this is why we
started "Axis Security".

28
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,250
We built,

29
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,270
from the ground up, a
unified access cloud,

30
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:15,560
so no matter if users go

31
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,530
to the cloud on-prem or SAS,

32
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:20,120
there is just one policy to manage,

33
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,570
it's session that is worked through Axis,

34
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:23,570
is authenticated,

35
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:26,229
monitored ,and continuously authorized,

36
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:27,710
when no one is on the network,

37
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:30,240
and no network changes are needed.

38
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,309
For example, a pallet now connects

39
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:36,540
from an unmanaged device
without any agents.

40
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,100
All they see are the applications that are

41
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,570
authorized to access,

42
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:41,360
the accident delivery app they need,

43
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,950
and nothing more.

44
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:45,560
The entire session is
monitored and controlled,

45
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,110
and department stays of
the network the whole time.

46
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:50,720
These applications are not published

47
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,200
for direct internet access.

48
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,820
They do not have a public IP address,

49
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,433
and they cannot be scandal pope.

50
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:00,030
Next, we have a sales lip using a managed

51
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:02,270
device with the latest operating system.

52
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,170
They initiate peer to peer voice call

53
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:05,090
to their colleague

54
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:06,563
which is worked through Axis.

55
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,789
Unlike with VPN,

56
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:12,500
neither of their devices
touch the corporate network.

57
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,750
The connection is always
strictly one-to-one,

58
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,550
is one unified solution.

59
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:18,580
We are at the intersection

60
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:21,000
of all users, devices, and applications

61
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,910
enabling deep visibility
over all activity.

62
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,859
So you can make smart queries, like

63
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,110
we felt about his access

64
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:29,050
to certain table in a database

65
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:31,920
or would download a certain
file from SharePoint,

66
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,753
and you can also

67
00:02:32,753 --> 00:02:35,950
generate reports and partners
activities, and so on.

68
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:39,618
The Axis team knows how to
innovate modern solutions,

69
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:42,170
we know better web installation and CASBY,

70
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:43,760
and then we were acquired to modernize the

71
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,239
secure web gateway.

72
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,397
Now we apply ourselves to
reinventing "Enterprise Axis".

73
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,839
We are already working
millions of connections daily

74
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,230
to the biggest companies
in the world and begged

75
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:57,090
by some of the greatest
investors in cybersecurity.

76
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:59,362
It's time for simple and
powerful, secure access

77
00:02:59,362 --> 00:03:02,400
and we are proud to be winning the change.

78
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,530
Thank you for giving us this opportunity.

79
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:05,363
I would love to share

80
00:03:05,363 --> 00:03:07,290
with the product at our
virtual booth afterwards.

81
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:08,123
Thank you all.
