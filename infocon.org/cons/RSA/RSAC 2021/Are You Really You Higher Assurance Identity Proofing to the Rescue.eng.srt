1
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:03,120
- Hi everyone.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,730
I'm Lorrayne Auld.

3
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:06,790
And thank you for attending.

4
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:08,470
In this session I'll be talking about

5
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:10,370
Higher Assurance Identity Proofing

6
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:14,040
in accordance with NIST
digital identity guidelines.

7
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,620
Through the use of these guidelines,

8
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,220
I will provide you with the tools

9
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,799
to give you greater confidence

10
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,360
if the applicant truly
is who they claim to be.

11
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:25,140
Now, I know we're in a
virtual environment today,

12
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,270
but I will be there through chat.

13
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:31,720
So if you have any questions
throughout the presentation,

14
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,663
feel free to shoot a question
and I'll be there to answer.

15
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:41,030
So this is the agenda for today.

16
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:45,350
I'll be speaking to you
for about 35 minutes or so,

17
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:46,986
regarding what's driving the need

18
00:00:46,986 --> 00:00:50,019
for Higher Assurance Identity Proofing.

19
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:53,670
What exactly do I mean
by identity proofing,

20
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:58,670
for in accordance with
this special pub 80063?

21
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,290
And then I'll go over
some of the techniques

22
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:04,289
and technologies to identify fraud.

23
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:06,233
And then wrap up with some guidance.

24
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,680
So remote work has exploded
during the pandemic

25
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,700
up to 18 times more remote work now

26
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,480
than what has been done in the past.

27
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:20,260
This pandemic has truly changed
how we do business today.

28
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:23,773
What was once done in
person is now done remotely.

29
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,380
Technology and executives
aren't driving these changes.

30
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:32,929
It's really COVID-19 that
has transformed telework,

31
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:35,060
with everyone working from home

32
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,600
and no longer come into the office

33
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,020
or going in person to their local bank.

34
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:46,020
What confidence do I have that
you are who you claim to be?

35
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:50,059
So, fraudsters are also working from home.

36
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:53,650
They are no longer working from 9-5.

37
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:55,770
With more people working remotely,

38
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:58,839
fraudsters will have
many more points of entry

39
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,250
to attack your organization
or your service.

40
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,870
But it's not just in the workplace

41
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:06,360
where fraud is taking place.

42
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,729
This chart, shows that
fraudsters are targeting

43
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:13,040
those facing heartstrings or hardships,

44
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,250
especially those out of work
who need that unemployment,

45
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:19,690
or that stimulus check or tax refund.

46
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:21,140
As an example,

47
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:25,410
corona virus unemployment insurance fraud,

48
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:29,673
was first identified in Washington
state in may of last year

49
00:02:29,673 --> 00:02:33,063
and has since spread to all 50 States.

50
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:37,109
So now that we've laid out the drivers,

51
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:39,010
so let's shift and talk about,

52
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:41,920
what exactly do I mean by Higher
Assurance Identity Proofing

53
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,549
and why it's so important
in a COVID-19 world

54
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:47,753
to help combat identity fraud?

55
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:54,750
So, why is identity proofing needed?

56
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:57,380
So traditional identity proofing

57
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:00,710
was performed using static
knowledge face authentications.

58
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:03,990
That means to establish
trust in a digital identity.

59
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:08,100
Questions such as, what is
your mother's maiden name?

60
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,480
Who's deemed satisfactory
in establishing that trust?

61
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,769
However, with the rise in data breaches,

62
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:15,470
what's once was a secret,

63
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,210
has now been stolen.

64
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:20,480
So new approaches are needed
in establishing that trust,

65
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,480
in a digital identity to
ascertain that you truly are you.

66
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:27,590
This trust is key in
providing a foundation

67
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:29,600
for all future interactions,

68
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,739
where I have confidence
that the digital identity

69
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,290
as being presented,

70
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,940
truly belongs to your real life subject.

71
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,560
So there are new risk situations

72
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,660
where you can not be
a dog on the internet,

73
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:43,210
and it reliably establishes association

74
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:46,210
of the digital identity
with a real life subject.

75
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:48,590
There are also situations
where the association

76
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,780
is required to establish accountability

77
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,290
for high risk actions

78
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:55,840
such as changing the release
rate of water from a dam

79
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,763
or transferring $50
million to a bank account.

80
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,700
Identity proofing establishes

81
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,049
that a person is who they say they are

82
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:07,070
based on the validity
of one or more pieces

83
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:09,040
of identity evidence.

84
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,829
The more due diligence incorporated

85
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:14,400
into the identity proofing process,

86
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,500
the higher the confidence
that the applicant

87
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,320
is who they claim to be.

88
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,620
For example,

89
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,850
one would place little confidence

90
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:23,763
on self asserted identity.

91
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,207
I say I'm Sally Jones.

92
00:04:26,207 --> 00:04:28,770
Therefore I am Sally Jones.

93
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:32,070
However, if I claim to be Cindy Joe,

94
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:35,320
and can provide written and
corroborated identity evidence

95
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,950
proving I truly am Cindy Joe,

96
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:42,210
there is much higher confidence
placed in that identity.

97
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:45,169
Now, if I provide all that documentation

98
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:47,160
to a credential service provider,

99
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,283
you could be pretty sure
I am who I claim to be.

100
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:55,000
So identity proofing is
thought to be done once,

101
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,940
at the time of enrollment or registration.

102
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:00,520
But that may not be the only case

103
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,890
you may be required at various stages

104
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:04,520
of the digital identity life cycle

105
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,830
where life events worked it.

106
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,740
So thinking in the physical realm,

107
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,770
I get identity proof periodically

108
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:12,669
for renewal my driver's license

109
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:16,550
or renewal of TSA's
Global Entry Pre-check.

110
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:19,150
same thing applies in the digital realm.

111
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:19,983
For example,

112
00:05:19,983 --> 00:05:22,040
I may initially have
been identity proofing

113
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,130
lower assurance level,

114
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:27,140
but based on required access
to higher risk transactions,

115
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:29,210
I may be asked to be identity proofed

116
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:31,960
at a much higher level of assurance,

117
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,030
or in times of emergency

118
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:36,570
or transactions between strangers.

119
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,300
One may need to be identity proofed

120
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,280
to ensure that that digital identity

121
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,929
still belongs to that real life person,

122
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:46,630
who was initially identity
proofed at enrollment.

123
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:49,670
Or in the context of progressive proofing.

124
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:54,460
My account was initially created
based on minimal proofing

125
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:58,400
and as new privileges
or roles assigned to me,

126
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,893
I may be subjected to
additional identity proofing.

127
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:08,563
So in 2017, NIST released
an update to SP 80063.

128
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:12,959
The Digital Identity Guidelines.

129
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:16,210
This four volume set provides an overview

130
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:19,849
of general identity frameworks
that use digital identities,

131
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,210
authenticators,

132
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:25,080
and assertions together
any digital system.

133
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,919
One of these volumes 63A,

134
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:33,450
is solely dedicated to
enrollment and identity proofing.

135
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:36,180
And I want to mention
that these guidelines

136
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:39,310
are not solely meant
for government agencies,

137
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:42,020
but can also benefit commercial industry

138
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:45,022
where higher assurance needs are required.

139
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:51,280
So, let's talk a bit more about 80063A.

140
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,799
The identity proof in enrollment document.

141
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,280
So NIST describes the process regarding

142
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,489
how applicants could
prove their identities

143
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:02,250
and then become enrolled
as a valid subscriber

144
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,470
with an identity system.

145
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:06,920
The document also provides requirements

146
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,470
for applicants going through
the identity proofing

147
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:12,220
for both in-person and remote scenarios

148
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:15,050
at three different
identity assurance levels,

149
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:17,230
ranging from the lowest
level of assurance,

150
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:19,793
to the highest level of assurance.

151
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:26,130
Identity assurance level
one is the lowest level.

152
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:28,540
And essentially is self asserted

153
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:33,540
that these attributes are
neither a validated nor verified.

154
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,220
I am Sally Jones.

155
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,793
Therefore I am Sally Jones.

156
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:40,200
Identity assurance level two

157
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,780
essentially states that
some sort of a remote

158
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:46,940
or in-person identity
proofing is required.

159
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,490
For this level,

160
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:51,740
the applicant typically
uses their own equipment

161
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,653
to perform the remote proofing.

162
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:56,000
At the highest level,

163
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,800
IAL3, require some sort
of physical presence,

164
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,790
either in-person or via supervised remote.

165
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:05,440
Supervised remote means that

166
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,460
there is a person physically present

167
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:10,340
during the entire
identity proofing process.

168
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:14,330
Typically a kiosk in controlled spaces,

169
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:17,539
oversee the entire proofing process.

170
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:20,190
At the other end is a trained operator

171
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:23,320
utilizing a web cam for example,

172
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,050
who can remotely supervise

173
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:27,400
the entire identity proofing process

174
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,609
from the time that you arrive

175
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:34,962
to the time that you
complete the entire process.

176
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:40,683
If you have any questions,
feel free to put them in chat.

177
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,230
So, how does determine exactly

178
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:48,090
what identity assurance level to pick?

179
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:49,950
Well, NIST developed a decision tree

180
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:52,320
to help organization
select the appropriate

181
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,140
identity assurance level.

182
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,180
This decision tree uses the results

183
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:58,910
of a credential service
provider's risk assessment

184
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:00,939
of the digital services offered

185
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,839
to provide the assurance level

186
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:06,650
provided by the identity proofing process.

187
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:08,709
The risk assessment determines the extent

188
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:10,590
to which risks must be mitigated

189
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:13,230
by the identity proofing process.

190
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:15,360
So I'm going to walk
through this decision tree

191
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,570
real quickly.

192
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:17,480
So for step one,

193
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,600
the organization will first need to ask

194
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,580
if whether they have any
personal information collected.

195
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:27,730
If no, you are at IAL1,

196
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:29,660
and it could stop the process.

197
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:32,069
Otherwise you proceed to step two.

198
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:34,850
Step two determines if any
of the personal information

199
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:36,810
needs to be validated and verified,

200
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:40,030
or if self asserted
attributes are acceptable.

201
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:41,610
If any of the personal information

202
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:43,790
needs to be validated and verified,

203
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,380
you proceed to step three.

204
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,350
Otherwise you are IAL1

205
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,310
If an organization actually
makes it to step three,

206
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:53,199
it means that some sort of

207
00:09:53,199 --> 00:09:56,560
higher assurance identity
proofing is required.

208
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,969
Step three is intended to
look at the potential impacts

209
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:02,040
of an identity proofing failure,

210
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,740
to determine if IAL2 or IAL3,

211
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:07,060
is the most appropriate selection.

212
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:12,060
If any of the questions are
in step three is at high risk,

213
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:15,210
then you are at IAL3.

214
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:18,240
If not, you proceed to step four.

215
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,700
So step four asks the
question regarding whether

216
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,540
the personal information
required by an organization,

217
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:26,790
will ultimately resolve
to a unique identity.

218
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:30,240
If yes, the process gets
stopped here at IAL2.

219
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,260
But the organization should consider

220
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:35,600
steps five and six are a value to them,

221
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,320
where the acceptance of claims

222
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,290
will reduce exposure to
the risk of over collecting

223
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:44,030
and storing more personal
information is necessary.

224
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:46,839
A federated environment is a great example

225
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,630
of receiving claims as
the service provider

226
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:52,939
is not in control of the
attribute information.

227
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:55,030
If the organization deems that

228
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:58,140
a federated attribute
approach is acceptable,

229
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:02,560
a similar decision tree
is available in 80063-3

230
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,713
to determine which Federation
assurance level to use.

231
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:11,170
So once an identity assurance
level is determined,

232
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,760
the credential service provider,

233
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,420
can follow a general process flow

234
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,810
to implement the required
identity proofing

235
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,969
identity assurance level.

236
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:23,540
So NIST defines three
steps for the enrollment

237
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,310
and identity proofing process.

238
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:28,313
Resolution, validation and verification.

239
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:32,349
So resolution uniquely
distinguishes an individual

240
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:33,710
from all other people

241
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:37,890
using a minimal set of
core attributes or PII.

242
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:39,380
This is the only step

243
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,439
that the credential service provider,

244
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,140
may use knowledge based verification.

245
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:46,010
Note that is extremely important

246
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:48,470
to use dynamic out of wallet.

247
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:51,850
Now let's say face verification
sets a question such as

248
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:53,950
what was your last mortgage payment?

249
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:56,533
Or what is the amount of your auto loan?

250
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:02,750
So step two is validation of
your physical identity evidence

251
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:04,800
that is collected or captured.

252
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,270
Examples of identity evidence
are a driver's license,

253
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:10,723
a passport or a bank statement.

254
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,210
For example,

255
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:15,450
when one goes to the
department of motor vehicles

256
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:16,730
for their driver's license,

257
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:19,940
the applicant must provide
an unexpired picture ID,

258
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,030
proof of residence,

259
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:24,640
and perhaps additional support
documentation to the clerk.

260
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,819
The clerk looks to see if
there's any evidence at tampering

261
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:30,350
as well as look at the
information contained

262
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,550
on the identity documents.

263
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:33,510
In the digital world,

264
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:35,090
this is essentially what is performed

265
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:36,930
during the validation stage.

266
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:40,359
The identity information is
presented in digital form,

267
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,700
is validated against authoritative sources

268
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:47,560
to ensure that the identity
evidence is genuine, authentic.

269
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,869
It contains information that's correct.

270
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:52,360
And then it contains
information that pertains

271
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,573
to a real life subject.

272
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,110
Once the identity evidence
has been validated,

273
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,480
the last step is verification.

274
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:03,220
This step verifies the applicant
to the claimed identity.

275
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:06,060
Going back to the DMV example.

276
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:09,709
After the clerk reviews the
presented identity evidence,

277
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:11,130
the clerk will determine whether

278
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:13,700
the individual standing in front of them

279
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:17,070
is indeed the individual
on the picture ID.

280
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,010
In remote proofing,

281
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:20,930
this is accomplished by
matching the identity evidence

282
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:22,280
via a biometric check,

283
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,510
such as by the applicant taking

284
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:27,900
and uploading a selfie
picture of themselves

285
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,350
to the credential service provider.

286
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:32,910
Liveness detection and
other fraud detection checks

287
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:36,750
are performed to ensure that
the image is of a real person.

288
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,820
Lastly,

289
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,610
the credential service provider

290
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,320
issues an enrollment code,

291
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,740
either via mobile phone

292
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,390
or through the postal service,

293
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,510
to confirm address of record

294
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:48,610
through verification the address contained

295
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:51,920
on the supplied valid
piece of identity evidence.

296
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,959
Once all of these steps
are successfully completed,

297
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,973
a digital identity is created.

298
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,800
So let's walk through an example

299
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,199
of what the identity proofing
process would look like.

300
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,520
So for this example,

301
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:10,329
we'll assume that we're
using IAL2 remote proofing.

302
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:12,780
For resolution to unique identity,

303
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,280
the credential service provider

304
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,540
would need to collect minimal
PII from the applicant,

305
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,000
such as their full name,

306
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,170
date of birth,

307
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:22,349
full mailing address and phone number.

308
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:23,470
In addition,

309
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:24,940
the credential service provider

310
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:27,100
needs to collect identity evidence.

311
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,080
NIST offers specific requirements

312
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,440
for strength of identity evidence required

313
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,940
for each of the identity assurance levels.

314
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:34,880
In this example,

315
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,670
the credential service provider,

316
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:39,329
provides one form of
strong identity evidence

317
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:41,280
such as a driver's license,

318
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,470
and two fair pieces of identity evidence

319
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:46,523
such as a utility bill and bank statement.

320
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:50,610
NIST released implementation
guidance last July

321
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:54,080
where examples of identity
evidence are provided.

322
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,360
And I'll revisit the
implementation guidance

323
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,963
later in this presentation.

324
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,210
Once the identity evidence is collected,

325
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:02,620
the credential service provider

326
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,530
validates the core attributes that gets

327
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:06,877
authorities sources such as credit bureaus

328
00:15:06,878 --> 00:15:10,470
or EMVO for driver's license information

329
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:13,150
to ensure the information is both accurate

330
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:15,033
and belongs to a real life subject.

331
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,190
For instance,

332
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:20,247
forensics checks are performed
against the identity evidence

333
00:15:20,247 --> 00:15:23,110
to ensure that the documents are genuine.

334
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:25,000
These checks include,

335
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,280
checking the font,

336
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,113
the color,

337
00:15:27,113 --> 00:15:29,010
and watermarks.

338
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:31,230
Once the identity evidence is validated,

339
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,810
the Prudential service provider

340
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:34,540
needs to establish a linkage

341
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,300
between the claims identity

342
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:39,250
and the applicant providing the evidence.

343
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,960
verification typically is done

344
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:44,450
by matching the strongest
piece of identity evidence

345
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:46,210
via a selfie.

346
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:47,990
Once the credential service provider

347
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:50,235
is satisfied with the selfie match

348
00:15:50,235 --> 00:15:52,020
to the identity evidence,

349
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,490
the credential service provider

350
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:56,233
sends an enrollment code to
the validate phone number.

351
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,410
So, now that we've walked through

352
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:00,459
a high level overview of review

353
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,500
in this Higher Assurance
Identity Proofing Guidelines,

354
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,300
let's now focus on answering the question.

355
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,370
Why is it so hard to do?

356
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:10,040
And by doing that,

357
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,790
we'll provide a use case

358
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:14,166
of a NIST conformance
credential service provider

359
00:16:14,167 --> 00:16:15,470
detecting fraud,

360
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:17,590
and then walk through
some of the techniques

361
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:19,240
and technologies that are used

362
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,163
to help detect fraud.

363
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:26,170
So, remember that slide back
earlier in the presentation

364
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:27,839
where we talked about identity theft

365
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:32,800
and the vast amounts of data
stolen about an individual?

366
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,589
This data is readily available to purchase

367
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:37,210
on the dark web by fraudsters

368
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:39,870
to then obtain access
to your bank account,

369
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:41,490
receive your stimulus check,

370
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:43,320
or your tax returns.

371
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,110
It's due to this high
increase in stolen identities

372
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:47,530
where organizations are finding

373
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:50,140
that they no longer trust
that digital identity.

374
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:51,410
For example,

375
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:52,870
these fraudsters are targeting

376
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:55,920
unemployment insurance
benefits and stimulus checks

377
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,250
using stolen credentials

378
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:01,430
to apply for unemployment
benefits through state websites.

379
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:05,460
This is a key reason why higher
assurance identity proofing

380
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,099
can help provide confidence

381
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:09,409
that you are who he claimed to be.

382
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:11,220
So how can identity proofing

383
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:14,140
help identify, defeat fraud?

384
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:16,410
The following slides will first introduce

385
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,780
credential service providers

386
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,527
who offer this Higher
Assurance Identity Proofing

387
00:17:20,527 --> 00:17:22,690
and then provide an example

388
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:25,470
of how the Higher
Assurance Identity Proofing

389
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:27,603
can detect and prevent fraud.

390
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:29,790
So there are currently

391
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:32,180
two full service credential
service providers,

392
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,890
who have either completed

393
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:37,810
or are currently going
through IAL2 certification

394
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:40,020
by the Kantara initiative.

395
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:42,110
Kantara is a nonprofit

396
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,870
who provides third-party assessment

397
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:47,080
for special pub 80063 revision 3,

398
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,610
based on their conformance criteria.

399
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,240
The first credential
service provider ID.me,

400
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,220
has been certified by Kantara at IAL2,

401
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,690
and offers both remote

402
00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:00,080
and virtual in-person
identity proofing via web cam,

403
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,750
to assist those applicants
who need additional help

404
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:05,100
through the identity proofing process.

405
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:08,990
The second is US Government
Services Administrations

406
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:11,770
since then seen login.gov.

407
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:15,960
login.gov is currently
being certified for IAL2

408
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,870
and offer us remote
identity proofing services

409
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:22,449
for citizens who are seen to
do business with some agencies.

410
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:25,230
These two credential service providers,

411
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:27,840
offer higher assurance
remote identity proofing

412
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,080
and strong authentication

413
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:35,510
in accordance with NIST
special pub 80063-3 guidelines.

414
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:37,210
Since the start pandemic,

415
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:41,543
requests for this remote
proofing services have increased.

416
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:46,430
So, the need for unemployment
insurance benefits

417
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:50,350
is one area that has certainly
increased since COVID.

418
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:52,810
Given that the unemployment
insurance program

419
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:55,290
allows claims to be filed online.

420
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:57,280
This certainly presents an opportunity

421
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,410
for fraudulent filings.

422
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:04,040
The cares act presented an
opportunity for fraudsters

423
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,940
as well as scam rings
as noted on the slide.

424
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:10,160
In fact, the U S labor
department reported fraudsters

425
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,640
were able to still billions of dollars

426
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,200
in filing unemployment payments

427
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,950
since from the US last November.

428
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,520
One of the reasons is that

429
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,820
the state unemployment insurance offices

430
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:25,409
are working with decades old technology

431
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:27,540
that cannot keep up with the fraudsters

432
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:30,010
who have bypass identity safeguards

433
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:32,363
by using stolen and fake identities.

434
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:36,970
So instead of battling with
the decades old technology,

435
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:39,290
20 States have selected ID.me,

436
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:42,460
to provide identity verification services

437
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:45,380
in accordance with the NIST guidelines

438
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,230
for those individuals requesting

439
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:49,800
those unemployment benefits.

440
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,240
The numbers you see here on the slide

441
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,060
are how those individuals were verified.

442
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,530
90% pass through

443
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:59,370
a completely unlined
remote proofing experience,

444
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:04,370
and 10% required additional
assistance via a video call

445
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:08,280
with a trained ID.me representative.

446
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,580
Since the end of January of this year,

447
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:14,483
ID.me has blocked over
800,000 fraudulent claims.

448
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:19,620
So, these are the types of fraud

449
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:22,129
that were detected during
the identity verification

450
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:24,270
for the unemployment benefit payment.

451
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:25,810
While these percentages listed

452
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:27,750
are based on the numbers
of fraudulent claims

453
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,010
for this particular use case,

454
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:31,480
the types of fraud listed here

455
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,010
can be applied to many use cases.

456
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:37,700
So how do credential service
providers following NIST 80063

457
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:40,330
detect and prevent these types of fraud?

458
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:41,780
How can I be confident

459
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,940
that the individual at the
other end of the device,

460
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,580
is who they claim to be?

461
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:48,040
The following slides will
cover the types of fraud

462
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,889
seen in the identity proofing process,

463
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:52,490
as well as best practices to help detect

464
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:54,890
and prevent fraud following
the NIST guidelines.

465
00:20:56,501 --> 00:20:58,500
So now face verification

466
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,040
has historically been used

467
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:03,190
and continues to be used
to verify claimed identity,

468
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:05,100
by testing and knowledge of the applicant

469
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:08,280
against information obtained
from public databases.

470
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,260
However, RPII has been
stolen from data breaches

471
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:14,510
which truly defeats the
purpose of using KBV

472
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:16,340
to verify an applicant.

473
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:18,399
We therefore must limit the use of

474
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:23,030
static knowledge based
verification as much as possible.

475
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:25,950
Answers to static
questions are easy to find.

476
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:27,750
For example, all one has to do is

477
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:31,320
look at social media to fine
ones mother's maiden name,

478
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,153
date of birth,

479
00:21:32,153 --> 00:21:35,480
and most likely names of family
members and names of pets.

480
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,313
In addition,

481
00:21:36,313 --> 00:21:37,700
many are now posting pictures

482
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:40,840
of their COVID vaccine
cards on social media.

483
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,520
Please do not do that.

484
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,360
It lists important PII beyond

485
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,500
just your name and date of birth,

486
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,840
including the vaccine
type and the lot number.

487
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,139
If one must use KBV,

488
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:54,100
limit its use and make those questions

489
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,060
as dynamic as possible,

490
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,690
as well as basing the questions

491
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:00,140
from multiple authoritative sources,

492
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:02,993
and not just from financial
or credit bureaus.

493
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:06,900
So synthetic identity fraud,

494
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,420
combines real information

495
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:11,010
such as once social security number

496
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:13,680
with false information like a fake name

497
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,770
to create a new identity.

498
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:18,379
This type of fraud is
typically financially driven.

499
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:21,160
And those who create these
synthetic identities,

500
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,730
will spend months
cultivating their identities

501
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:25,950
and building up lines of credit.

502
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:29,010
These fraudsters frequently
target individuals

503
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:32,020
who are less likely to check
their credit information often

504
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,150
such as children,

505
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:36,260
the elderly or even homeless people.

506
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:39,890
So how does one combat synthetic identity?

507
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:41,060
The number one thing to do

508
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:44,860
is query authoritative sources
such as the credit bureaus

509
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,510
AMPA for the DMV,

510
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:50,150
as well as see if the social
security number being presented

511
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:52,360
is on the master death file.

512
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:55,409
Some examples that may be

513
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:58,810
that one may be dealing with
a synthetic identity include,

514
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:02,179
is there an ability or inability to match

515
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:06,530
and or verify an identity
across all PII attributes

516
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:08,820
provided by the applicant.

517
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:12,040
Or are there multiple
identities associated

518
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,370
with the same social security number?

519
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:17,090
Or check for multiple
candidates originating

520
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:18,723
from the same IP address.

521
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:23,389
User behavior can also help
detect patterns and anomalies

522
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:26,040
that indicate potentially
fraudulent behavior.

523
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,100
For example,

524
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:29,290
user behavior could be used to determine

525
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:32,420
if the identity is stolen or synthetic,

526
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,990
based on how familiar the applicant is

527
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:37,980
with filling out the data on the form.

528
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:38,813
For example,

529
00:23:38,813 --> 00:23:41,560
does the individual pass entering PII

530
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:45,240
that the true person should know about?

531
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:49,113
Or are they using control
keys to fill out the form?

532
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:54,639
So let's talk briefly
about identity evidence.

533
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,473
For this step,

534
00:23:55,473 --> 00:23:57,680
the applicant will take pictures
of the front and the back

535
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,890
of their identity evidence

536
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:01,560
such as their a driver's
license and passport

537
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,290
and submit that information

538
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:05,550
to the credential service provider.

539
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:07,460
The type of identity evidence required

540
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:09,360
depends on the strength of evidence

541
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,830
required by the credential
service provider.

542
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,500
So I like to use the example

543
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,690
of going to the department
of motor vehicles

544
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:17,680
to receive your driver's license.

545
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,061
The type of documentation required,

546
00:24:19,061 --> 00:24:23,899
varies with the type of
driver's license received.

547
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,180
If you get a real ID,

548
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:26,780
you're required to provide additional

549
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:28,432
forms of identity evidence

550
00:24:28,432 --> 00:24:32,170
then you wait for a
traditional driver's license.

551
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:33,750
That clerk at the DMV,

552
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:37,160
is also trained to detect
altered identity evidence.

553
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:40,733
The same applies in the
context of remote proofing.

554
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:44,800
The higher the identity
assurance required,

555
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,610
the stronger forms of
documentation are required

556
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:49,459
to resolve that identity.

557
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:52,200
Forensics checks are
also performed to detect

558
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,513
the authenticity of the
identity evidence provided.

559
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:59,050
Some checks performed include,

560
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:01,879
are the holograms in the correct location?

561
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,200
Is the font the right size?

562
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,090
Is the blue the, excuse me.

563
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:08,763
Is the color the right shade of blue?

564
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:13,560
So take a look at the picture on the right

565
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,139
while I speak to this slide.

566
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:18,460
I'll be coming back to the photos shortly.

567
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:21,300
So during the higher assurance
identity proofing process,

568
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,430
one is required to capture a biometric,

569
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:25,590
usually in the form of a selfie.

570
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:28,360
The selfie is then compared to the picture

571
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,770
in the identity evidence

572
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:32,910
such as your driver's license or passport.

573
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:34,300
Liveness detection,

574
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,500
helps determine that there is a live human

575
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,930
instead of a fraudster

576
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:40,660
circumventing this
channel by using a mask,

577
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:42,160
an altered photo,

578
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:45,180
or recording a doctored video.

579
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:47,960
So deepfake, takes key characteristics

580
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,600
of a person's appearance or voice,

581
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,990
and overlays these
characteristics onto another's.

582
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:56,110
These deepfakes are now
starting to make an appearance

583
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:59,440
to attempt to bypass
the liveness detection

584
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,950
and selfie checks.

585
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:02,683
So how are they doing this?

586
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,274
Liveness checks are performed by

587
00:26:05,274 --> 00:26:08,489
possibly asking the applicant to blink,

588
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:11,800
smile, nod or speak a phrase.

589
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,220
This pattern does not vary,

590
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:15,790
which makes it fairly easy to spoof

591
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:18,520
by a deepfake or an animated GIF.

592
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,162
So currently they are
rudimentary deepfakes

593
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:22,480
that are being discovered.

594
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,910
But those will improve in time.

595
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:28,400
So some things to consider
when combating deepfakes

596
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,950
is the selfie check.

597
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:31,960
Is to never use the same directions

598
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,490
for each identity proofing events.

599
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:36,190
So what do I mean by that?

600
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:38,880
So if I as a credential service provider

601
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,980
always ask the applicant to blink,

602
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,850
it's fairly easy for a fraudster to use

603
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:45,419
the blinking animated GIF or a deepfake.

604
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:48,740
However, if I asked the applicant

605
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:52,700
to turn their head to your
left and then to the right,

606
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:55,810
and ask another applicant
to smile or frown,

607
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:58,320
and then another applicant
to read some words,

608
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,840
it makes it much harder

609
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,820
for a fraudster to use these techniques

610
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:05,889
to defeat the liveness detection check.

611
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:08,690
Use of artificial intelligence
in the liveness detection

612
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:10,010
will help as well.

613
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:11,620
The artificial intelligence,

614
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:13,199
used in the liveness detection,

615
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,310
could help determine that
something is not quite right,

616
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:20,210
such as is the background
embedded a static image,

617
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:21,540
or is a lighting off

618
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:25,100
where shadows in the room
doesn't affect the face.

619
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:27,570
So speaking of shadows and static images,

620
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:30,740
let's get back to the
pictures on the right.

621
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:32,680
So imagine them animated.

622
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,280
Can you tell which one is real

623
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,683
in which three are fake?

624
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:40,870
See anything blurred or
missing in any of the images?

625
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:43,283
Are the reflections of
the Iris's different?

626
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,813
Feel free to put your answer in chat.

627
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:50,620
So if you picked image number three,

628
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:55,100
that's the real person
and you are correct.

629
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,350
The others were computer generated.

630
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:59,403
And I did not get that right.

631
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:03,750
So think of a Fraud Consortium Network

632
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:06,020
as a watch list in digital realm.

633
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,840
For example, in the real world,

634
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,600
your identity is already checked

635
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,189
on the do not fly list

636
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,060
prior to checking to the airport.

637
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:15,590
This do not fly list is only applicable

638
00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:18,189
to those who fly on commercial aircraft

639
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:21,360
within, into or out of the United States.

640
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,719
Other countries, such
as Canada and Pakistan,

641
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:26,730
have their own form of a do not fly list.

642
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:27,950
So in the digital world,

643
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:30,860
organizations within
industries affected by fraud,

644
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:33,020
often rely on consortium data

645
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:36,450
as assistant defense against
new fraud strategies.

646
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:39,160
Consortium data for fraud prevention,

647
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,180
is a system that shares information

648
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,810
with a group of customers.

649
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:43,990
In other words,

650
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:45,580
if a fraudulent actor

651
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:48,836
is known to commit fraud
at one customer website,

652
00:28:48,836 --> 00:28:50,950
and then that individual

653
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:53,550
attempts to commit the same type of fraud

654
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:56,030
in a second customer website,

655
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:59,893
then that attempt will be flagged
as fraudulent and blocked.

656
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:03,750
These Fraud Consortium Networks,

657
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:07,450
pool information of
known fraudulent events,

658
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:09,180
sources, or IP addresses

659
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:12,230
and could be leveraged during
the identity proofing process.

660
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:13,340
For example,

661
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:15,540
when presented with a
new customer identity

662
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:18,520
an organization can ask the
Fraud Consortium Network,

663
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:21,889
whether they name, email
address and device to identify

664
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:24,380
this new customer belongs

665
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:27,890
to an identity other members
of the network trust.

666
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:29,690
Other more member organizations

667
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:31,420
could then respond based on their

668
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:33,190
own identity proofing efforts,

669
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:34,870
and their own transaction histories

670
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:36,443
with that customer identity.

671
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:39,410
So my personal opinion is,

672
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:40,740
that it would be beneficial

673
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:42,620
for the government and industry

674
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:44,189
to partner together to create

675
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:46,550
a wider fraud collaboration network.

676
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:48,240
This will capture and share

677
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,970
a known fraudulent identities and devices

678
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:52,543
on a much broader scale.

679
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:55,129
So now that we have learned

680
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:56,930
about Higher Assurance Identity Proofing,

681
00:29:56,930 --> 00:30:00,320
where do I go for guidance
or best practices?

682
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,570
So NIST released implementation resources

683
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:05,500
early July of 2020.

684
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,980
The implementation resources
offered guidance to

685
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:10,140
facilitate understanding implementation

686
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:13,070
a special pub 80063-3.

687
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:14,439
And they are broken down

688
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:17,283
by topic area for each
of these three volumes.

689
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:23,010
One of those areas in the 63A piece

690
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:26,710
includes a list of
example identity evidence,

691
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:30,280
such as, as driver's license and passport

692
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,139
and social security number

693
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:34,240
and other items.

694
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:39,083
So definitely take a look for
their examples in that piece.

695
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:43,350
Furthermore for volume 63A,

696
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:45,350
one of the areas NIST mentions,

697
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:46,379
it's a requirement that

698
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:49,070
the identity proofing
enrollment processes performed

699
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:51,210
is based on applicable written policy

700
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:53,090
or practices statements,

701
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:55,990
that document all the
steps taken to verify

702
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:57,690
an applicant's identity.

703
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:58,760
Within this section,

704
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:02,313
NIST points the reader to
MITRE's guidance for this area.

705
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,219
So last year MITRE
internally funded an effort

706
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:09,520
to document in the form of
practice statement templates,

707
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,100
the requirements and processes

708
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:13,560
to achieve compliance with

709
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:18,043
either remote identity
assurance levels two and three.

710
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:21,420
So I want to quickly step through

711
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:23,510
what the template looks like,

712
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:26,190
that we created and published.

713
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:28,710
Again, that these are our interpretation

714
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:31,070
of documenting all the processes

715
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:32,970
used in enrollment and identity proofing

716
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:35,320
as well as capturing any proofing errors

717
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:40,293
as required in 80063A
section 42 requirements 6.

718
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:44,690
On the left are the steps of
the identity proofing process

719
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:46,340
that we've walked through earlier.

720
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:47,669
For this example,

721
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:50,810
I will step through what
the template looks like

722
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:53,310
for collection of identity evidence.

723
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:56,230
In the center is an
overview of what is required

724
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:58,120
in the collection of identity evidence

725
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,540
as well as the bottom center

726
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:03,899
showing examples of the
types of documents required

727
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:06,960
for the strength of identity evidence.

728
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,750
On the upper right hand
corner of this slide

729
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:11,120
provides a blank table

730
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,189
to allow the credential service provider

731
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:15,690
to fill in the collected
identity evidence.

732
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:18,540
Each column along the top of that table

733
00:32:19,428 --> 00:32:24,428
is defined below to guide the
credential service provider

734
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:27,650
in filling out the required information.

735
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:29,000
Lastly,

736
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,450
there is a table to capture any errors

737
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,850
that may occur as well as what technology

738
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:37,230
or process be used to resolve the error.

739
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:38,063
For example,

740
00:32:38,063 --> 00:32:39,940
the number of retries allowed,

741
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:42,360
proofing alternatives
such as going in person

742
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,240
if remote fails

743
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:48,123
or fraud counter measures
when anomalies are detected.

744
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:54,129
So NIST plans to update
this special pub 80063.

745
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:57,630
Last year, NIST sought public
comment to revision three,

746
00:32:57,630 --> 00:32:59,690
to be taken into consideration

747
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:01,920
when they work on revision four.

748
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,140
What you see on the
slide is the timeline for

749
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:08,070
all the milestone activities
associated with this revision.

750
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:10,560
The plan is to publish revision four

751
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:13,993
by third quarter of fiscal year 2022.

752
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,240
So, here are some items you can apply

753
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,580
based on what you have learned today.

754
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:22,850
So next week you should
download and start to

755
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:27,370
review this special pub
80063 revision three.

756
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:31,610
NIST implementation resources
in MITRE's templates.

757
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:32,979
These documents will help you

758
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:35,847
with the development of the
required identity proofing

759
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:39,080
and enrollment practices
statement documentation

760
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:42,149
starting with 80063 revision three,

761
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:44,280
start following the decision tree

762
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:48,100
to help determine the
assurance level you are based

763
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:50,500
on the amount of risks
that must be mitigated

764
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,760
by the identity proofing process.

765
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,610
Start gathering your organization's

766
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:56,179
identity proofing requirements

767
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:59,313
and document them using MITRE"S templates.

768
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:03,080
All the links provided on this slide

769
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,723
are for the documents I just mentioned.

770
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:09,969
So, the first three months,

771
00:34:09,969 --> 00:34:12,639
you should be doing your market research.

772
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,120
While doing that market research,

773
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,969
please keep in mind the types of fraud,

774
00:34:15,969 --> 00:34:17,573
such as forced documents

775
00:34:17,574 --> 00:34:21,770
or the risk of deepfakes
and synthetic identities.

776
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:23,570
Ask the credential service providers

777
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:24,989
how they mitigate these

778
00:34:24,989 --> 00:34:27,053
and other types of threats and fraud.

779
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:29,980
Once you have made your selection

780
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:31,530
of credential service provider,

781
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:34,550
work with them to complete the templates,

782
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:36,620
to ensure that they
satisfy the requirements

783
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:39,210
to mitigate the identity theft and fraud,

784
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:40,490
you have identified

785
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:43,980
So Higher Assurance Identity Proofing

786
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:46,130
can help detect and prevent fraud.

787
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:49,070
Use as many channels
and sources as possible

788
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:51,780
to help render decision regarding,

789
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:54,850
is that applicant who
they really claim to be,

790
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:56,839
or is in fact a fraudster?

791
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,440
Fraud mitigation measures

792
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:01,790
include inspecting the identity
evidence for any forgeries,

793
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:04,279
examine the device characteristics

794
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,310
used by the applicant,

795
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:08,710
and evaluate behavioral
characteristics of the applicant.

796
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:12,030
Is the applicant using shortcuts
while filling out the form,

797
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:14,680
or pausing to fill out the street address?

798
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,810
Check multiple authoritative sources

799
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:19,240
as well as vital statistic repositories

800
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,939
such as the death master file.

801
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:22,773
Lastly,

802
00:35:22,773 --> 00:35:25,500
include liveness detection
for the selfie check

803
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,480
and ensure that randomness is used

804
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:30,610
to avoid animated GIFs and deepfakes.

805
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:31,902
All of these techs.

806
00:35:31,902 --> 00:35:33,970
All these tools and technologies

807
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:35,700
will help answer the question.

808
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,310
Are you really you?

809
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:38,143
Thank you.
