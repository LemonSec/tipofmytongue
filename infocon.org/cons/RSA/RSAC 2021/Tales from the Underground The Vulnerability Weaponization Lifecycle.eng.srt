1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:05,380
- Thank you for joining us
at the RSA Conference 2021.

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:08,080
My name is Mayra Rosario Fuentes,

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,900
and I'm going to talk to you today

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,070
about Tales from the Underground,

5
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:15,213
The Vulnerability Weaponization Lifecycle.

6
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:22,180
So first let's start talking

7
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:24,012
about how this research came about.

8
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:27,900
This research covers a year long study

9
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,849
in the underground
market of N-day exploits

10
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:34,973
offered from January,
2019 to December, 2020.

11
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,879
We compared our findings
with what we were seeing

12
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,720
from our trend security
detection products.

13
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:45,410
We looked into over 600
underground cybercriminal forums

14
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,440
and due to the volatility
of dark web marketplaces

15
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,239
with exit scams and take downs

16
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,513
these sides were excluded
from this research.

17
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:58,070
The majority of the
forums were free to join

18
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:02,000
with a few asking for low membership fees.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,980
This research was focused

20
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:07,410
mostly on English and
Russian language forums.

21
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:10,570
Other language-based
forums do sell exploits

22
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,169
but Russian and English
forums were the most robust.

23
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:17,169
Some examples of popular forums included

24
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:20,920
in this research were Russian
language-based exploit,

25
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,930
WWH Club and XSS.

26
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:27,410
Examples of English language
forums included REA Forums,

27
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:29,913
Hack Forums, Nulled, and Cracked.

28
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:33,600
So what are we going to cover today?

29
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,410
The agenda for today we'll cover
what the underground market

30
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:38,869
for N-day exploit look like.

31
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:42,323
Explain the life cycle of
exploit in the underground.

32
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,970
A quick background of the types

33
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:46,913
of underground exploit coders,

34
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,240
and what the outdated
exploit market looks like.

35
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,270
Also include a section on the feature

36
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:55,600
of the n-day exploit market

37
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,933
and discuss two lifecycle samples.

38
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,440
We've researched advertisements

39
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,610
from sales of exploits from January, 2019

40
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:06,290
to December, 2020.

41
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:09,710
We tried to filter out
advertisements with either scammers

42
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:13,400
or had a low reputation, but
that is not an exact science.

43
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,850
We also looked at what cybercriminals

44
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:17,870
were requesting to purchase

45
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:20,600
sort of like a wishlist of exploits.

46
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,400
Microsoft products made up 47%

47
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,850
of all requested CVE's in the underground

48
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:31,090
while IOT only made up 5%.

49
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:33,860
The increased bandwidth
of connected devices

50
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:36,880
with the new 5G entering the market.

51
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:40,799
IOT devices will become more
vulnerable to cyber attacks.

52
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,040
The average price people listed

53
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,333
that were willing to pay was $2,000.

54
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:51,150
52% of exploits requested were
also less than two years old.

55
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:55,010
We also saw some users
willing to pay up to 10,000

56
00:02:55,010 --> 00:03:00,003
for a zero day exploit
targeting Microsoft products.

57
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:04,790
Here we have two examples
of requested exploits.

58
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:07,739
Topographic is an English language forum

59
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:11,300
for the CVE-2019-1151.

60
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:15,020
This CVE is a remote code
execution vulnerability

61
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,560
that exists when the windows font library,

62
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,713
you properly handles specifically
crafted and better fonts.

63
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,769
The bottom graphic is from
a Russian language forum.

64
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:27,500
The user is looking for assistance

65
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,990
with an Apache web server vulnerability

66
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:33,090
and is willing to pay up to $2,000

67
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:35,410
for help with finding a payload.

68
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:37,500
This is probably someone
who's going to turn this

69
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,100
into a bug bounty program.

70
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,440
So the most popular advertise exploits

71
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,320
in the last two years were
from Microsoft Office,

72
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,790
Microsoft Windows, Internet Explorer

73
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:50,959
and Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol

74
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,790
for 61% of the market share.

75
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:58,790
The most advertised N-days in
English forums was from 2017

76
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:04,360
while Russian forums were
mostly one day old exploits.

77
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,990
Russian forum ha a more of
already have it exploits

78
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:10,210
for sale unlike English forums

79
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:13,973
that often advertise Microsoft
Office and Adobe PDFs.

80
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:17,560
Russian language forums
were more professionally run

81
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,000
than in English forums.

82
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,769
Affordable and they exploits

83
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:23,909
for sell in Russian
language forums included

84
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:27,890
a Microsoft Remote
Desktop Protocol for $200,

85
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:30,440
a WinRar exploit for 300

86
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,873
and Cisco exploit
starting from a thousand.

87
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,420
And an English forum Microsoft Word

88
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:39,077
and Excel exploits can
start as low as $35.

89
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:45,110
We also found 54% of the exploits offered

90
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,539
for sell were less than two years old.

91
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:53,240
We took into a deeper look into
what cybercriminals wishlist

92
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:57,520
versus sold market for
Microsoft products look like.

93
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,890
We noticed what was
requested was very similar

94
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:02,010
to what the market was offering.

95
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:05,300
Several criminals may have
seen the requested items

96
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,230
from users before deciding what exploits

97
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:08,380
to offer in the market.

98
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,163
Word and Excel both in wishlist
and sole market dominated.

99
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:20,710
These are two sells
advertisements for N-days

100
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:22,253
from Russian language forums.

101
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:26,120
The graphic on the left,
the sellers advertise

102
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:30,470
in a bundled exploits from
2020, from $6,000 and up.

103
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:34,430
The graphic on the right, the
sellers advertising the CVE

104
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:37,787
in 2018 and 2020 for $1,000.

105
00:05:39,037 --> 00:05:41,703
CVE-2018-0296 and CVE-2020-3452,

106
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:46,640
are vulnerabilities and the web interface

107
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,039
of the Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance

108
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,993
that could allow an
unauthorized remote attacker.

109
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,229
Here's a typical life cycle

110
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,780
of an exploit in the underground.

111
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:59,250
It starts with vulnerability
being developed by the hacker.

112
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,100
The capability is then weaponized

113
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,893
by cybercriminals and kept secret.

114
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:07,033
A zero day is offered for
sell in the underground.

115
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,470
The vulnerability is
either sold to a bug bounty

116
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:13,610
or discovered by a researcher

117
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:15,760
or sold to a third-party vendor.

118
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,853
Next the vendor becomes
aware of this vulnerability,

119
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,753
patches created and released.

120
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:26,480
Striving criminals will either
stop selling the exploit

121
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:29,159
or the cybercriminal will continue

122
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,550
to sell the patch
exploit now at a discount

123
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:35,483
that it's no longer a zero day.

124
00:06:36,398 --> 00:06:40,690
Cybercriminals can continue
selling this exploit two years

125
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:43,219
and beyond at a lower price.

126
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,540
Or some criminals will begin

127
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:48,380
to bundle these outdated
exploits to make more profits.

128
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:53,380
And finally, when the
exploits no longer profitable,

129
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:56,073
the cybercriminal will stop
selling this in the underground.

130
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,040
Most of these are no longer sold

131
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,450
because it's either due to a newer release

132
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:04,270
of the product being used

133
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:06,520
or the exploit is too
well-known and patched.

134
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,390
These two pictures are two actors

135
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:12,289
that have been selling exploits

136
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:15,020
for more than three
years in the underground.

137
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,330
Most of these experienced sellers

138
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:18,770
sell only a handful exploits a year

139
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:21,330
since the prices started start ranging

140
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:23,553
from $10,000 up to half a million.

141
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:26,539
These sellers have a high
reputation in the underground

142
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:29,420
or sometimes called out
by name and the forum

143
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:32,133
when users are looking
for a specific exploit.

144
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:36,797
We saw a forum users discuss
multiple bounty programs

145
00:07:36,797 --> 00:07:40,180
and the negatives and positives
of submitting to them.

146
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:42,130
While the majority were pleased

147
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:44,200
with their experiences there was a handful

148
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,890
that were disgruntled with them.

149
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:48,750
Some forum users complain
about the long wait times

150
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,440
for submission with wise

151
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:54,550
or not received in the bounty
amount they had expected.

152
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:57,100
Some forum users discussed maxing out

153
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,760
bounty program submissions
allowed for the year.

154
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,060
And we're looking into
selling our remaining exploits

155
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,540
in the underground.

156
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:05,490
Some bounty sellers ask for assistance

157
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:07,640
to complete a submission
by offering money.

158
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:12,870
We did see a few advertisements
where some of these people

159
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:17,700
that submit to bounty programs
actually added their resume

160
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:21,140
of the types of bounties
that had had been paid out

161
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:23,603
in order to get people
to buy their services.

162
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:28,380
In our research we also
found exploit brokers

163
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:29,510
in the underground.

164
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:33,250
These brokers offered to
buy exploits for patch

165
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:36,809
and then turn around and
submit them to bounty programs.

166
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:40,349
Some offered high payouts
for finding zero days

167
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:43,460
while many did not advertise
the potential payouts.

168
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:47,370
The graphic on the top is
from a Russian language forum.

169
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:49,220
The advertisement is a private company

170
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,810
that is looking for
zero day vulnerabilities

171
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:53,546
unless their wishlist of exploits

172
00:08:53,547 --> 00:08:56,700
but the version numbers
of certain products

173
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,630
while the bottom graphic
is an export broker

174
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:01,530
from a Russian language forum

175
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:03,970
looking for Internet Explorer zero days

176
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:07,663
and he's willing to pay up
to a $1,000 per exploit.

177
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,740
Some cybercriminals like English forums

178
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,530
are so an exploit builders
for a monthly fee.

179
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:15,560
Exploits are constantly updated

180
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:19,270
according to these advertisements
to avoid detection.

181
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:23,653
Prices can range from
$60 up to $2,000 a month.

182
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:27,209
Some of these subscription
services offer exploits

183
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:28,670
that are over three years old.

184
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:32,110
So bundling them can demand higher prices

185
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,683
than selling them individually.

186
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:37,119
The graphic on the left is an example

187
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,240
of an exploit builder subscription service

188
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,990
from an English language forum.

189
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:44,530
Prices from this seller
range from $60 to $120

190
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:48,293
for three months.

191
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:51,200
We also looked at the distribution

192
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,150
of these exploits
offered in these bundles.

193
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,170
And we saw that the majority

194
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:59,363
of the bundles offered are 29% from 2019.

195
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:05,730
These two are more examples of
subscription-based services.

196
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:08,580
The one on the left is from
an English language forum

197
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:13,580
offering CVE's as old as
2014 for Microsoft Word.

198
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,030
The graphic on the right the advertisement

199
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:19,390
for another English language forum.

200
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:24,390
The sellers offering CVEs
in 2017 and 2018 for 1,150

201
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,403
to explain Microsoft Word products.

202
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:34,583
One of the specific ones CVE-2017-11882

203
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:37,980
it's actually a 17 year
old memory corruption issue

204
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,840
in Microsoft Office.

205
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,510
When exploit is successfully

206
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,370
it can let attackers execute remote code

207
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:44,870
on a portable machine.

208
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:46,280
This specific CVE was used

209
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,023
by Loki info stealer banking malware.

210
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:52,849
Cybercriminals will use the cheapest tool

211
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:53,850
to get the job done.

212
00:10:55,201 --> 00:10:58,590
In most cases that require a zero day

213
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:01,040
or recently released vulnerability.

214
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,069
And instead turn to more than
10 years old vulnerabilities.

215
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:10,020
For instance, underground
relied on MS17-010

216
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:12,449
or the external blue vulnerability

217
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:14,270
for which a patch was already available

218
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:16,470
before the outbreak of one underground.

219
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:19,370
Yet almost four years later using Showdown

220
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:22,320
which is the search engine for
internet connected devices.

221
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,320
We discovered over 668,000
devices were still not patched.

222
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:30,170
And vulnerable to underground.

223
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:33,319
Just recently in February, 2021

224
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,700
we started to see an
increase on underground

225
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,760
The oldest vulnerabilities discovered

226
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,390
by detection systems was from 1999.

227
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:46,470
CVEs as oldest 2015 are still
being used for ransomware

228
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:49,163
and malware toolkits exploits in 2021.

229
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:53,050
Comparing our trend detection systems,

230
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:54,910
what we're seeing in the underground,

231
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:59,370
we saw 22% of exploits
sold in the underground

232
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:02,720
were three years and older.

233
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,720
Exploits have been patched
for years are cheap

234
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,100
to find in the underground.

235
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,350
English form users often
ask for old exploits

236
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:12,190
or with help implementing
an outdated exploit.

237
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:15,790
In 2020, we investigated
an actor selling an exploit

238
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:19,132
by targeted XL versions from 2007.

239
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:25,020
And was offering an
exploit from $15 and up.

240
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:28,579
And an English language forum,
we saw a bundled exploits

241
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:31,313
from 2010 selling for $800.

242
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:35,300
So outdated exploits in the underground.

243
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:40,300
So here we saw requested
exploits from 2014

244
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:46,030
and this included and CVE-2015-6639.

245
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:48,480
The oldest CVE sold in
the underground include

246
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,447
CVE-2012-0158 and CVE-2016-5195,
known as Dirty Cow.

247
00:12:57,122 --> 00:13:01,400
CVE-2012-0158 has been used in ransomware

248
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,300
in 2020 targeting a hospital.

249
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:09,300
CVE-2017-1182 was listed
as a top 10 CVE exploit

250
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,450
by the FBI in 2020.

251
00:13:13,942 --> 00:13:17,790
CVE-2016-5195 Dirty Cow,

252
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:21,372
We saw this offered in the
underground for $3,000.

253
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,150
And we saw this and Exodus Spyware

254
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:27,350
and outlaw hacking group
using this exploit.

255
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:30,569
So the future of the exploit market.

256
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:33,540
The market for zero day exploits

257
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,530
used to be a lucrative market.

258
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:38,110
But in the last two years we've
seen a declining advertising

259
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,540
in some underground.

260
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:42,449
Bounty problems are still
more liquid than ever,

261
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:44,420
but bounty programs have increased payouts

262
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:47,510
making the black market
for zero days to be scarcer

263
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:51,939
and with dark web market
volatility, the lack of trustily,

264
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:54,040
the underground export market is changing.

265
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:57,820
So we believe the
feature of exploit market

266
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,820
is access-as-a-service.

267
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:02,330
Access-as-a-service has
become a new hot commodity

268
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:03,900
in the underground market.

269
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:07,939
Many sellers mentioned
specifically which exploit or CVE

270
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:10,410
was used to compromise
the business entity.

271
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:13,459
Access-as-a-service is also more lucrative

272
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:16,440
as they can demand
higher prices in N-days.

273
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,200
And does not require as much
scrutiny from forum users

274
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:23,130
like exploit sellers usually
receive for potential buyers.

275
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:25,800
There are two types of sellers
of access-as-a-service,

276
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,319
the more professional ones
and the script kiddie types.

277
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,200
The script kiddie types are sellers

278
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,910
that don't dedicate all their
time to access-as-a-service

279
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,520
and just happened to get lucky

280
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,530
finding an exploit that worked

281
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:41,430
while forums like exploits
are professional sellers

282
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:44,689
whose complete portfolio is
mostly access-as-a-service

283
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:47,540
and have a wide variety of
businesses available for sale.

284
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,680
The top graphic is from
my Russian language forum.

285
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:56,199
The seller is offering email
servers from $2,000 and up.

286
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,690
And this specific seller
is saying you can use this

287
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:01,283
to do business, email compromise attacks.

288
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:05,370
The graphic on the bottom is
from an English language forum.

289
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:06,890
The seller is offering access

290
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:09,790
to two banks starting from $1,200.

291
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:13,319
The seller advertisers, they
use a remote code vulnerability

292
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,723
to access this business.

293
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:19,060
So next we're going to
discuss two case studies

294
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:19,973
of what a lifecycle of a vulnerable

295
00:15:19,973 --> 00:15:21,793
that it looks like an underground.

296
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:26,630
The first one is CVE-2020-9054.

297
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:29,610
So this is the ISO and firewall products

298
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:32,550
are affected by remote
execution vulnerability.

299
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:34,709
Users are advertised
to install the standard

300
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:37,370
for more patches or follow
the workaround immediately

301
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:38,520
for optimal protection.

302
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:42,090
So this specific one starts off

303
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:44,780
with February, 2020 being
sold in the underground

304
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:48,420
by an actor on XXS a
Russian language forum

305
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,447
starting from $20,000.

306
00:15:51,453 --> 00:15:54,970
A security researcher
discovered this vulnerability

307
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:56,570
and writes about it in February.

308
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:02,570
Then in March the CVE is
publicly disclosed and patch.

309
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:08,300
Shortly after we see a new
miral variant called Mukashi

310
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,313
seen in the wild.

311
00:16:10,288 --> 00:16:14,780
A later we're starting to
see our customers targeted.

312
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:19,570
We're starting to see hits
on our trend's systems.

313
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:20,790
Then in May,

314
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:25,790
now it's been two months since
this was first discovered.

315
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:29,650
The actor ARIMF started
selling this exploit

316
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:31,400
now at a discount instead of 20,000

317
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,483
he starts selling it at 10,000.

318
00:16:34,499 --> 00:16:38,790
Then in August 2020
another actor called Quote

319
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:42,469
started requesting the CVE

320
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:44,740
and was willing to pay up to $2,000

321
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:47,393
for someone who could
sell them this exploit.

322
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:53,270
The next one is CVE-2016-5195.

323
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:55,430
So this is known as the Dirty Cow exploit.

324
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:57,150
It's a kernel vulnerability

325
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:59,100
that allows any unprivileged existing user

326
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,698
to escalates privilege root.

327
00:17:01,698 --> 00:17:04,510
Root is the highest privilege
on any UNIX or LINUX system,

328
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:06,233
which has access to all the files.

329
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:10,060
The vulnerability is known
as a privileged escalation

330
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:12,419
or COW, Change on Write.

331
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:14,010
And this is a technique used by Linux

332
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:16,843
to reduce duplication of memory objects.

333
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:20,910
So example of this
vulnerability is four years.

334
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:23,130
It started in November, 2016

335
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:25,473
when the vulnerability
was publicly disclosed.

336
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:29,620
The following year in September, 2017,

337
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:34,003
we started to see first Android
malware targeting the CVE.

338
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:38,520
A year later, we're seeing
a Hackforum user asking

339
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,193
for help how to implement this.

340
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:43,900
February, 2019, we've seen an actor

341
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:47,990
from the Russian forum
exploit selling this exploit

342
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:49,053
for $3,000.

343
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:53,030
And April we start to see
this exploit being used

344
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,333
for Exodus Spyware.

345
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:59,020
Then in February, 2020

346
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:01,680
we started to see the
Outlaw Crypto mining group

347
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,610
using this exploit.

348
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:05,620
And still in May, 2020

349
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,540
we started seeing another user asking

350
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:10,143
for assistance on how
to implement this CVE.

351
00:18:10,143 --> 00:18:12,740
So this CVE is actually still active

352
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,450
in the underground and it hasn't died.

353
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:16,440
It's still being sold and traded.

354
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,053
So next step moving forward.

355
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:22,040
The COVID-19 pandemic has
caused massive destruction

356
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,879
on how individuals enterprises

357
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,570
operate on a day-to-day basis.

358
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:30,147
At a time when remote
work has become essential,

359
00:18:30,147 --> 00:18:32,610
the COVID-19 pandemic
has seen a large increase

360
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:33,699
of remote work.

361
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:36,950
But also it's a significant
increase in our tax services.

362
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,930
Most just actors have grown both in number

363
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:41,780
and sophistication are looking
to exploit weak security

364
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:44,649
on the people working
from home and at work

365
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:48,100
making it more important to
find and fix vulnerabilities

366
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,000
that can be used as part of an attack.

367
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,800
And average organization, for instance,

368
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,879
reportedly takes about 50 days

369
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,950
to patch a critical vulnerability
and its application.

370
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:02,593
So you can't possibly
patch all CVE's each year.

371
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:07,160
So we recommend in
patching plans factor in

372
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:11,430
what exploits criminals
wish to use and can buy

373
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:13,740
and not simply by severity.

374
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:17,480
Underground actors sold
and requested more Adobe

375
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,370
and Microsoft exploits
in the last two years.

376
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:23,090
It's simply unrealistic to
prevent all vulnerabilities

377
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:25,260
from getting access to your system.

378
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:29,870
However, virtual patching
will help by additional time

379
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:33,129
for security systems to patch
these necessary updates.

380
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,310
Virtual patching also
provides an additional layer

381
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:38,270
of security when patches
are no longer available,

382
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:40,290
no longer issued for legacy

383
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:42,653
and at the end of support software.

384
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:46,889
Over time, the price of
the vulnerability drops

385
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:49,920
all the way down to zero
after patch, Tuesday

386
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:54,390
exploits price began to drop
'cause they're now N-days.

387
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:56,660
This makes the exploits accessible

388
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:59,010
to more cybercriminals has months pass

389
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:02,220
at each stage your attack
surface (indistinct) has more

390
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,820
and more attackers incorporated.

391
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:07,450
The longevity of a valuable exploit

392
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:09,110
is longer than most expected.

393
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:11,490
Patching yesterdays popular vulnerability

394
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:14,280
can be more important
than today's critical one.

395
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,000
Thank you for your time today.

396
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,954
And I hope the session was
useful and you enjoyed it.

397
00:20:18,954 --> 00:20:19,787
Thanks.
