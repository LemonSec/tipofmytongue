3
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:16,920
- Hi, I'm Tim Junio.

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,010
I'm the head of engineering
for Palo Alto Networks Cortex.

5
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:22,610
Before joining Palo Alto
Networks, I was the CEO,

6
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:24,360
and co-founder of Expanse,

7
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,990
the leading attack surface
management company.

8
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:29,099
Today, we're pleased to
share with you new research

9
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,900
from Palo Alto Networks on
attack surface management.

10
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:35,320
Specifically, how Fortune
500 companies are at risk

11
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,970
from attackers that can
discover exposed assets

12
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:41,710
on the public internet
faster than ever before.

13
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:43,550
When you think of the global internet,

14
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:45,830
you probably think large scale.

15
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:47,250
The internet is huge.

16
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,220
If you look at any of the common metrics,

17
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:50,610
like how many websites there are,

18
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:53,160
how many internet protocol
addresses there are,

19
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,300
the numbers are gargantuan.

20
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,410
And when you look at the future
of the internet with IPv6,

21
00:00:58,410 --> 00:00:59,980
the numbers get even bigger.

22
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:02,760
However, what we observed
going back almost 10 years

23
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,240
now is methodologies in network science

24
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,240
to explore the internet
space much more rapidly

25
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,759
than was ever possible.

26
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:14,690
So what used to take weeks
or months in indexing devices

27
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:17,080
and assets across the global internet,

28
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:21,570
in about 2013 could be
done in say 45 minutes,

29
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:24,410
well under an hour, for a given protocol.

30
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:26,970
So for example, if you
wanted to index every webpage

31
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:29,350
on the public internet using new methods

32
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:31,539
openly published in 2013,

33
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:34,480
you can index every webpage
in about 45 minutes.

34
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,140
And what we saw in the eight years since

35
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,920
has been the discovery
of additional methods

36
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,830
for parallelizing how internet scanning

37
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:44,840
is done such that you can actually scan

38
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,500
for a given protocol
in about five minutes.

39
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,930
So what this means is from
an attacker perspective,

40
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:52,350
if you know that you want to
look for a particular type

41
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,440
of exploit across the global internet,

42
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,970
or you just wanna watch
for opportunistic threats,

43
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:59,429
or you wanna keep an eye on
certain types of targets,

44
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:02,230
like just banks or
pharmaceutical companies,

45
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:04,270
or US government agencies,

46
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:06,530
or whatever your subset of targets is,

47
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:09,740
you can use these methods
to persistently observe

48
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:13,180
either the entire internet
for a given type of exposure,

49
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:16,080
or a target for any exposure that shows up

50
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,290
across a wide range of known exploits.

51
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:22,940
So what we see is attackers
are using this network science

52
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:25,400
to be able to scan
networks extremely quickly

53
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,790
with something like an upper boundary

54
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:29,820
today on 45 minutes for
scanning a given protocol,

55
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:33,430
and then automated methods
to within those data

56
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:35,780
discover things specific to a target,

57
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,050
and even start to test for whether or not

58
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:40,360
they are immediately
exploitable or connected

59
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,220
to anything sensitive
that you might want to try

60
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:44,660
and access after gaining illicit access

61
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:47,820
to that first exposed
device on the internet.

62
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:51,489
One of the recent events
in 2021 was the publication

63
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:53,470
of zero day exploits associated

64
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,470
with Microsoft Exchange servers.

65
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:57,790
This was an interesting
moment in the history

66
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:59,760
of the internet, because we actually saw

67
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,739
within minutes of
publication of the exploits

68
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:07,030
an increase in scanning for these assets

69
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,090
on the public internet.

70
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:11,210
What this meant is what used
to take maybe a few weeks

71
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:14,720
after the publication of how
to exploit a piece of software,

72
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,190
now we saw just within
minutes that attackers

73
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,829
were looking across the global internet

74
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:21,610
for something that they could use to try

75
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,540
and gain illicit access to a network,

76
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:26,060
for criminal attacks like ransomware,

77
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,680
or for nation-state level attacks

78
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,640
going for sensitive information.

79
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,670
Whereas on the defender's side,

80
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:34,230
we were seeing that it took days to weeks

81
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:36,329
for large organizations to find

82
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:38,450
where all of their exposed servers were,

83
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:42,380
and identify which ones needed
to be patched to defend them.

84
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,430
So when we think about
this from the perspective

85
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:47,640
of what's the range of
sophistication for cyberattacks,

86
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,510
we tend to think of the most sophisticated

87
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,980
and effective as zero day attacks.

88
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:54,769
When you definitionally have an exploit

89
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:56,910
for software that nobody else knows about,

90
00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:00,070
and can get into a device
that has no protections,

91
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:02,489
because nobody knew that
the software flaw existed.

92
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:05,160
We tend to think of that as
something that governments do.

93
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,690
And at the opposite extreme,

94
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:09,609
we think of baseline cyber
hygiene as making sure

95
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:11,230
you don't have exposed,

96
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:13,690
say database servers with no passwords

97
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:16,589
or other low level things
on the public internet.

98
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,269
The new network science
that makes possible scanning

99
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:21,159
the entire internet
that has now been around

100
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,420
for almost a decade,
means that cyber hygiene

101
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:28,540
is actually similar in
importance to zero day attacks

102
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,180
by sophisticated threat actors.

103
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:33,280
And even very, very
sophisticated threat actors,

104
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,049
like governments, are likely to be looking

105
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:38,840
for that low hanging fruit as well to try

106
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,020
and break into networks.

107
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,520
When we look at this in
balance between attackers

108
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,580
and defenders, what is very interesting

109
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,690
about this problem is that
attackers can within seconds

110
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:50,920
start scanning the entire
internet on a given protocol

111
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,110
for exploitable systems.

112
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:57,180
On the defender side, we see
that it takes days, weeks

113
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,960
and sometimes much longer
than that to discover

114
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,799
all assets associated
with an organization.

115
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,560
And the reason that happens
is digital transformation

116
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,980
has resulted in an explosion
of internet-connected devices,

117
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:11,370
including in different
commercial cloud environments,

118
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:13,950
regions around the
world, for subsidiaries,

119
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,740
after merger and acquisition events.

120
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,830
And that means that if
you're a large organization,

121
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:20,039
a company or a government agency,

122
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,210
you have to be much slower than attackers

123
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:25,969
today at trying to find what
is your true attack surface,

124
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:28,310
and what is the risk associated with it,

125
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,990
especially when something bad happens

126
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:32,020
for internet security like publication

127
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,090
of a new software exploit.

128
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:36,070
When we look at how
organizations try to defend

129
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:38,990
themselves today, there
is a two-by-two access

130
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:42,930
that helps understand what approaches

131
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:45,140
companies and government
agencies are taking.

132
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:47,219
One is known versus unknown assets.

133
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,270
So what are you checking against?

134
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:52,750
Things that you are sure of,
like your IP master list,

135
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:53,910
what are your IP ranges?

136
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:56,540
And then unknowns, like did
you have a developer set

137
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,880
something up in a cloud environment

138
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,430
that was not provisioned
through central IT,

139
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,830
and therefore you need to find it,

140
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:04,330
and get caught up to
what your employee did?

141
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:06,590
On the other axis is speed.

142
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:09,039
So at what cadence are you
using different methods

143
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,820
to protect your attack surface?

144
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,810
And if we look at the primary methods

145
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:14,240
that organizations use,

146
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,710
something like penetration testing

147
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:17,210
has been around for a long time.

148
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,380
That's basically checking deeply on assets

149
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,820
that you know about for whether
or not you can exploit them.

150
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,219
That's typically done
on a quarterly cadence.

151
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,350
Some are slower and do
it only once a year.

152
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:28,810
Some are faster and do it
on a more regular basis.

153
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:31,830
But around once a quarter
is when pen testing happens.

154
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:35,219
And then some organizations
invest further in red teaming,

155
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,980
which is a more expansive approach,

156
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,290
looking at how you can
break into a network across

157
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:40,530
many different methods.

158
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:42,530
Not just looking at your known assets,

159
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:46,219
but looking across potentially
discovery of new things

160
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,870
that would let you get
into an organization.

161
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:52,120
And then the kind of last
few years have evolved

162
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,770
to have vulnerability
management as a standard,

163
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:57,159
which means scanning parts of your network

164
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,780
that you know about to see
whether or not the software

165
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,849
is up to date and if it's exploitable,

166
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:04,730
to try and create a work
process around fixing

167
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:07,070
that software and patching that software.

168
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:09,599
However, all of these methods are slower

169
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,330
than what attackers do.

170
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:13,539
So attackers are constantly monitoring

171
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:17,400
the global internet and
specific targets of interest

172
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,060
using the network science
methods mentioned earlier,

173
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,710
such that in sub hourly scanning,

174
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:25,690
and even in just a few minutes scanning,

175
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:28,370
an attacker could find
an asset that pops up

176
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:30,350
that was not intended to be routable

177
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,030
over the public internet.

178
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:36,489
We at Palo Alto Networks only
observe the top one or 2%

179
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:39,070
of security organizations operating

180
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:40,750
at the same pace of attackers.

181
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,920
Almost the entire
industry in cybersecurity

182
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,860
is operating more slowly than attackers.

183
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:49,860
We think of this as, hopefully
not being too cheeky,

184
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:53,230
security needing an
out of body experience.

185
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:56,180
So the average security
organization is looking

186
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:58,210
at a fairly narrow aperture,

187
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:01,239
which is what do you
believe your network is,

188
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,000
and then applying
security tools against it.

189
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,260
Whereas what attackers are
doing is taking a holistic view.

190
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,170
They're looking across
the global internet,

191
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:12,080
or they're looking across
targets and entire sectors,

192
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,130
to see everything and then
wait for something to pop up

193
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:19,110
that they can go after to
try to gain elicit access.

194
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:21,430
Security organizations need to do the same

195
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:24,180
as attackers in monitoring
the global internet

196
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,890
for their assets to be
able to quickly update

197
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:29,719
their inventories such
that if anyone throughout

198
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,830
the entire organization puts
something on the internet

199
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:36,360
that attackers could discover
the organization's IT

200
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,030
and security teams know about it as well.

201
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:41,500
And therefore, if there is a security risk

202
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,660
then or in the future,
they can very quickly move

203
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:48,699
to gain control over that
asset or patch its software,

204
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,770
and otherwise avoid the risk
of attackers going after it.

205
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:54,060
So one of the benefits
of digital transformation

206
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:57,020
is that you can try and get
data from networked assets

207
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:59,370
for business productivity and other gains,

208
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:01,660
like being able to
update software quickly,

209
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:05,329
maintain patch status, and
optimize business processes.

210
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:08,490
However, embedding internet
access in almost everything

211
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:11,920
that we would consider IT, or
information technology today,

212
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,099
means that your attack
surface is getting larger.

213
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,770
And over the last several
years in particular,

214
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:19,560
what we have observed is during COVID,

215
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,660
large numbers of people working from home,

216
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,319
further increasing the attack surface,

217
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,470
because you have people who
are using corporate equipment

218
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:29,460
from their homes or other
places that are not the office,

219
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,270
and not on a corporate network,

220
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,850
but using the public internet,

221
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:35,500
and also SaaS applications
and the explosion

222
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,190
of commercial cloud, such
that we're seeing less

223
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:41,600
in managed data center and
co-location facility services,

224
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,820
and much more in public services,

225
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:48,330
like from Amazon, Microsoft
Azure, from Google.

226
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:50,650
A metric that we're
seeing the most advanced

227
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:54,069
organizations use is
Mean Time to Inventory.

228
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:56,120
So when we talk about
the top couple of percent

229
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,800
that have high degrees of
automation around this problem,

230
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,120
they're thinking about
security with an inventory

231
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,910
first mentality, which
is you can only protect

232
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,030
what you know about.

233
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,660
And if you don't know about assets,

234
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:09,380
then all of your
investments are for nought.

235
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:11,189
You could be spending hundreds
of millions of dollars

236
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:12,880
per year on cybersecurity,

237
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,850
but if an asset is not under management,

238
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:17,410
then it's not getting the
benefits of that program.

239
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:19,530
We are recommending to our customers

240
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:22,800
and what we're seeing as the
industry leading approach

241
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,490
is for you to measure your
mean time to inventory,

242
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:26,870
how long does it take you to discover

243
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,770
a new asset that is stood up by somebody

244
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:31,100
in your organization if it is not through

245
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,820
a central provisioning service?

246
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,460
So if say an employee set something up

247
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,790
in a commercial cloud environment,

248
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:38,000
how long does it take
you to find that device

249
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,320
and be able to add it
to your inventory along

250
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,760
with the business context,

251
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,260
of which part of your
organization stood it up,

252
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:47,890
who is the person, and are
you able to maintain it

253
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:49,960
under the management
of the rest of your IT

254
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,670
and security infrastructure?

255
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:53,300
Today, we're pleased to publish

256
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,569
our first Attack Surface Management Report

257
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:57,480
from Palo Alto Networks.

258
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,120
What we did is look at a
subset of Fortune 500 companies

259
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,540
to get a sense for how
quickly their environments

260
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,640
are changing on the public internet,

261
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,920
and also what the rates
of security exposures

262
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,920
are across those assets.

263
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,329
What we found is that for the
average Fortune 500 company,

264
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:17,950
an exposure that we would
consider a serious exposure

265
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:20,870
occurs every 12 hours.

266
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:24,020
What we mean by a serious
exposure is either an asset

267
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:26,760
that should never be routable
over the public internet,

268
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:30,300
or that has a known
exploit associated with it.

269
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,660
The most common category
was remote desktop protocol.

270
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,500
RDP is a remote access
protocol that lets you interact

271
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,950
with a Windows workstation
as though you were sitting

272
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:41,170
in front of it, but from
anywhere in the world

273
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:42,610
over the public internet,

274
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:45,850
which could be a windows virtual
machine in a data center,

275
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:47,880
or it could be an employee's laptop.

276
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,939
And if it's not configured correctly,

277
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,870
then anyone in the world
would be able to gain access

278
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,660
as though they were
sitting at that machine.

279
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:58,550
And the reason that this
happens is we tend to see

280
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:02,699
connections that are supposed
to occur over corporate VPNs,

281
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:06,370
but then if misconfigured,
when the VPN drops,

282
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:08,050
which happens on a regular basis

283
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:11,170
because of just internet connectivity,

284
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:14,140
if that device will automatically connect

285
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:17,630
to the next available
internet, when not on the VPN,

286
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:20,192
a significant proportion of the time

287
00:12:20,192 --> 00:12:23,400
a Windows workstation will
end up on the public internet

288
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,420
without a proper firewall configuration

289
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:29,329
such that anyone in the
world would be able to start

290
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:31,680
to test exploits or test usernames

291
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,662
and passwords against
that Windows machine.

292
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:37,920
We tend to see that at a high rate.

293
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,370
It is actually about 1/3 of everything

294
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:43,970
that we observe in Fortune
500 serious incidents.

295
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:46,840
And that happens both on
premises and in the cloud.

296
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:50,110
When we look across all of
the data in our white paper,

297
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,880
greater than three-quarters

298
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,550
of all of these serious exposures,

299
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:55,829
we see for Fortune 500 organizations

300
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:57,480
are in cloud environments.

301
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,310
This implies that the rate
at which organizations

302
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:03,089
are standing up and
standing down environments

303
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:06,660
in public cloud, means
they are not well monitored

304
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,150
from an attack surface
management perspective.

305
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:12,880
And we even see that roughly
one in five of exposures

306
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,580
are still on premises,

307
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,860
which is supposed to be the best monitored

308
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,610
and parts of the organization that IT,

309
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:22,440
and security are supposed
to know the most about.

310
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,850
When we look across the
categories of things

311
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:27,010
that we see, it's not just RDP,

312
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:28,730
and it's not just cloud workers.

313
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:31,260
We're also seeing a
wide range of exposures

314
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,930
for the Fortune 500 that
are current lower rates,

315
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:36,770
by things like simple
database server exposures

316
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:39,920
and misconfigurations associated with IoT,

317
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,860
operational technology,
and other types of assets

318
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:45,240
that now have internet protocol in them.

319
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:49,170
We see them at frequent rates,
maybe not every 12 hours,

320
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:52,260
but on the days to weeks
cadence in the Fortune 500,

321
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,530
meaning that when attackers are monitoring

322
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:57,810
for anything that shows up
across targets of interest,

323
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:00,109
they are very likely to see those assets.

324
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:02,040
And if those assets happen to be connected

325
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,380
to any sensitive systems, not
have proper defense in depth,

326
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:08,490
or have sensitive corporate
information on them,

327
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:11,680
they are at high risk of
discovery by attackers

328
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,670
before they can be found
and remediated by defenders.

329
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:16,270
The last thing I'd like to communicate

330
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:19,210
is that this is not an unsolvable problem.

331
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:21,950
And so even though attackers
have a strong advantage today

332
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:25,100
in finding weaknesses in attack surfaces,

333
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:28,090
what we see in the top couple
of percent of organizations

334
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:31,600
is a high degree of automation
in resolving this problem.

335
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,480
And the rest of the world
could actually catch up

336
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,810
and also deploy processes
and technology to help solve

337
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,530
the attack surface management problem.

338
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:40,550
Thank you for your time,

339
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:42,699
and we hope you're enjoying
the RSA conference.

340
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:45,560
We are posting to asmtop10.com

341
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,989
our attack surface management white paper

342
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:50,170
with our research on the Fortune 500,

343
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:53,219
and also best practices
on how you can help

344
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:56,290
get your attack surface under control.

345
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:57,140
Thank you, again.
