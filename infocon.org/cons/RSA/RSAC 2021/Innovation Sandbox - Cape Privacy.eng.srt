00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:13,090
- [Announcer] Please
welcome Cape Privacy's

3
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:15,773
Chief Executive Officer Che Wijesinghe.

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,390
- As the data exhaust grows exponentially,

5
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,250
data privacy for machine learning

6
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,080
is a massive problem.

7
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,839
Organizations that want to share on

8
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:26,830
and collaborate on data

9
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:29,029
between departments and across companies

10
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:31,903
are boxed in by competitive
and legal red tape.

11
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,010
The Cape encrypted learning platform

12
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:36,769
removes the box limitations

13
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:39,507
of sharing data between multiple parties.

14
00:00:39,507 --> 00:00:42,640
As an example, Alpha
Investments wants to enrich

15
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,030
their machine learning models

16
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:46,560
with better retails credit card sales data

17
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,580
to improve understanding
of consumer spendings

18
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:50,793
to generate alpha.

19
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,020
At Cape, we expanded on Google
TensorFlow's 2015 white paper

20
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,920
on large scale machine learning

21
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,890
by combining distributed data flow

22
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:02,580
with secure computation.

23
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:04,443
We call it Encrypted Dataflow.

24
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,973
Secret sharing secures the
model and training data.

25
00:01:08,877 --> 00:01:10,580
Homomorphic encryption

26
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:13,720
secures the protocol
between the two parties.

27
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,429
Optimize secure multiparty computation

28
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:19,030
trains the encrypted model
on the encrypted data

29
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:21,153
with minimal computational overhead.

30
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:24,390
Finally, with differential privacy

31
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:26,410
noise is added to protect the new model

32
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:28,399
from ever leaking the train data.

33
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,360
The result is a smarter model

34
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,290
train through to Cape's
secure privacy preserving

35
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:34,393
cloud platform.

36
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,259
Cape was designed for
machine learning engineers.

37
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,430
Your existing models
can be easily deployed

38
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:42,983
to your choice of cloud.

39
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,640
The adoption of Cape's
technology is further accelerated

40
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,440
by its open source platform

41
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:52,270
and seamless integration with
common machine learning tools.

42
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:54,020
Thanks to these integrations,

43
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:57,253
working with Cape as a data
scientist is second nature.

44
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:03,070
Over time, more and more
parties working together

45
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:05,580
will benefit from each
other's encrypted data,

46
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:08,250
creating a massive network effect.

47
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,020
Each new subscriber and provider

48
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,760
creates more value for the existing users

49
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,912
of the Cape platform.

50
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:16,239
Great innovation and great products

51
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,050
only ever make it to market successfully

52
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:19,580
with great teams.

53
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:22,320
At Cape we have assembled a
world-class leadership team

54
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,400
that brings an incredible
depth and breadth

55
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,003
of technical and go-to-market experience.

56
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:32,109
Beyond our initial success
in financial services

57
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,150
we are driving interest
from other industries

58
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:36,910
including health and life
sciences for drug discovery,

59
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,049
and government agencies

60
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:40,250
in support of counter-terrorism programs,

61
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,083
and much more.

62
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:44,880
We believe that this technology

63
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,600
is truly a watershed moment
for machine learning,

64
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,692
much like SSL was for the
adoption of online commerce.

65
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:57,230
In closing, we're excited to
pioneer this new technology

66
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:01,000
to enable secure and trusted
data science on encrypted data.

67
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,200
We anticipate that Cape's innovation

68
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,570
aligns with the future
of distributed computing

69
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:07,320
and large scale machine learning.

70
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,704
Thank you.

71
