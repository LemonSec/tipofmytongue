1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,417
(lofty orchestral music)

2
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,743
(upbeat music)

3
00:00:28,136 --> 00:00:30,802
(air whooshing)

4
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,390
- Hello, everybody, and welcome.

5
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:41,760
Thank you for joining us.

6
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,070
I'm Wendy Nather.

7
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:45,820
And the first thing I wanna
do in this presentation

8
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:48,730
is talk about why I don't like benchmarks.

9
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:51,516
I don't like going to
other peers and saying,

10
00:00:51,517 --> 00:00:52,847
"What are you doing in security?"

11
00:00:52,847 --> 00:00:54,300
"I don't know, what are you doing?"

12
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,290
Because what if your peers
are not good at security?

13
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:59,190
What if their idea of security

14
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:02,280
is making burnt toast
sacrifices to the cloud,

15
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,210
or something like that,

16
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,069
are you gonna do that too?

17
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:06,300
I don't think so.

18
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:09,710
We wanna know what works in security?

19
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:11,380
What actually works?

20
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:14,009
And when it comes to data-driven research,

21
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,360
that's why I pulled in my
good friend, Dr. Wade Baker.

22
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,000
Say hi, Wade.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,833
- Hello, everybody.

24
00:01:19,833 --> 00:01:22,303
And thank you very much, Wendy,
for pulling me into this.

25
00:01:22,303 --> 00:01:23,759
It's been fun.

26
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,090
- It has been fun.

27
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:28,550
Now we'll talk about the
research that we actually did.

28
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:32,850
What we did was, first
of all, we talked about,

29
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:36,850
well, we talked to 4,800
IT and security pros

30
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:38,410
around the world.

31
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:40,030
After we surveyed them,

32
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:41,730
we narrowed down the responses

33
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:45,740
we were gonna look at to
about 150 well-qualified

34
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:48,899
actual security people responses.

35
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:52,320
But we took them from all
types of organizations

36
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,240
from 25 countries.

37
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,360
And we asked them about
11 program outcomes,

38
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,770
things that you would wanna
get from your security program.

39
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:05,690
And we also asked them
about 25 security practices

40
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:07,723
that they might or might not be doing.

41
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:13,090
Well, we categorized
these different outcomes

42
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:14,830
into three categories,

43
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,130
enabling the business,

44
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:18,950
managing the risk, and
operating efficiencies.

45
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:21,679
So you can see all 11 outcomes here.

46
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,360
They're everything from
getting executive confidence,

47
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,840
to minimizing unplanned work.

48
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,120
We all wanna do that, right?

49
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,220
And recruiting and
retaining security talent.

50
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:36,870
These are the 11 that we got from CSOs,

51
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:40,730
and we asked everybody about them.

52
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:44,530
Then we also asked them
about 25 security practices,

53
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:46,470
this isn't all of them on the slide.

54
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:49,050
This is just a representative sample.

55
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:51,900
But, again, under three categories,

56
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,350
like business and governance,

57
00:02:54,578 --> 00:02:57,733
and architecture and operations.

58
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:03,100
What you wanna do is get
things like clear reporting.

59
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,850
You want IR and recovery streamlined.

60
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:09,060
You wanna make good use of automation.

61
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,280
All of those practices,

62
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,900
we asked them whether they were doing

63
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,513
them successfully or not.

64
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:18,560
And we wanted to find out does
anything matter in security?

65
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,837
This is our Metallica slide.

66
00:03:20,837 --> 00:03:22,220
"Nothing Else Matters,"

67
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,440
does anything matter at all?

68
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,620
And Wade will talk about what happened.

69
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:30,290
- We need some music in
the background there.

70
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:31,459
- That's right.

71
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:34,150
- So the important thing
about this, like Wendy said,

72
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:38,440
we have 25 security
practices and 11 outcomes.

73
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:42,177
What we did not do is say,

74
00:03:42,177 --> 00:03:45,030
"Hey, Mr./Mrs. survey respondent,

75
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:49,120
do you think this practice
achieves this outcome," right?

76
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,580
We weren't seeking opinions

77
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,870
on what people think matters in security.

78
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,750
We took all of their responses

79
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,650
about how well they're
doing in those 25 practices,

80
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:01,660
and how well they're
achieving those 11 outcomes,

81
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,150
and we crunched all the data

82
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,800
using some advanced
multivariate statistics.

83
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,770
And the idea was to find patterns

84
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:11,837
in the data where the data tells us,

85
00:04:11,837 --> 00:04:16,019
"Hey, this practice and
this outcome are correlated,

86
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:18,049
have some kind of relationship."

87
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,190
And this graphic that you see here

88
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:22,290
turns out to be a nicely formatted grid.

89
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:23,400
And that's actually one of the ways

90
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,340
that we visualized it in the report.

91
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:28,169
If you go to the Security Outcomes Study,

92
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:29,090
download the report

93
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:31,460
or look on the page where
the report is hosted,

94
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:34,659
you'll see this image here.

95
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:37,800
And along the bottom, you
have the 25 practices.

96
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,270
Along the Y-axis there,
are the 11 outcomes.

97
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:46,240
And anywhere that you see
something other than white,

98
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,300
it is saying that that practice
correlates significantly

99
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,640
with success in that outcome.

100
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,640
So I'm gonna take the top-left
corner just as an example.

101
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,320
So organizations that told us

102
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,320
they had a really good proactive
approach to tech refresh,

103
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:08,690
were 8.9% more likely to
report that their organizations

104
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,539
were successfully keeping
up with the business.

105
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,390
And every single other thing

106
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:16,320
on this slide can be read like that.

107
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,200
And so, you know, if we
take a step back here

108
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,870
and use this as a way

109
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:25,940
to see a data-driven approach to,

110
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:28,540
hey, we see good evidence
that these practices

111
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:31,180
actually do increase the likelihood

112
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,930
of achieving these certain outcomes,

113
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,400
there's a lot we can learn from this.

114
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,810
I know this is dense, you
don't have to read everything.

115
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:39,800
You can see all of this after the talk

116
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,970
and go through it in detail.

117
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:45,550
But for now, I wanna do three
very high level observations

118
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:47,580
that we took from this.

119
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:51,450
One, 23 of those 25 practices

120
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:54,800
were linked to improving
the chance of success

121
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,543
in at least one outcome.

122
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:59,480
I'm glad for that, right?

123
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,350
There's not a lot we're doing

124
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:02,580
that's just ineffective

125
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,791
and not accomplishing anything at all.

126
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:08,023
So that's something to
consider and remember.

127
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,520
Second, 11 out of the 11 outcomes

128
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,659
benefited from at least nine practices.

129
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:18,790
In other words, if you
want to achieve an outcome

130
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:21,830
like keeping up with the
business that I read out earlier,

131
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:25,530
you have at least nine different ways

132
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:27,270
to go about doing that.

133
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:28,919
Not that any one of those things

134
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,740
is going to magically unlock success,

135
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,640
but at least nine different things

136
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:38,729
statistically, significantly
contribute to that outcome.

137
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:41,260
And, again, that's good news.

138
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,210
And then furthermore,

139
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:45,210
if you look at all of that entire grid,

140
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:49,159
45% of those practice
and outcome intersections

141
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,593
have a significant correlation.

142
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,040
And that's good, of course,

143
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,960
that means that 55% are
white space, or do not,

144
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,500
and you could interpret
that as less than half

145
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,650
of what we do in security matters.

146
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:04,280
But Wendy and I prefer

147
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:07,686
the more glass is half full
interpretation of that and say,

148
00:07:07,687 --> 00:07:10,300
"What we do in security matters!"

149
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:13,470
There is good evidence here
that these standard practices,

150
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:15,610
all of which, by the
way, are pretty general,

151
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:18,390
nothing gets super, super, super detailed,

152
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:21,950
but the things that we
generally believe in security

153
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:24,719
do actually achieve the outcomes

154
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,750
that people tell us that
they want to achieve,

155
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:31,180
and I was very refreshed by that actually.

156
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,740
What about you, Wendy?

157
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,250
- Yes, very much so.

158
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,400
Thank goodness.

159
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,739
Now I'm sure you all wanna know,

160
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,720
what matters most overall?

161
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,480
And this is where it
gets kind of interesting,

162
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,040
hold onto your hats.

163
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,720
Ready? Here we go.

164
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,640
The top five practices
that were most correlated

165
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,610
across the board with successful outcomes

166
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:53,560
included number one,

167
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:57,550
having a proactive tech refresh strategy.

168
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:58,760
And then the second one

169
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:03,480
was having well-integrated technology.

170
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,630
And this led us to conclude

171
00:08:08,089 --> 00:08:10,350
in our report that,

172
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:12,080
according to these statistics,

173
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,340
the organizations wanting to
maximize their overall success

174
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,799
of their security program

175
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,160
should ideally start with a modern,

176
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,840
well-integrated tech stack.

177
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,450
Now I know what you're thinking.

178
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:26,440
I do, I know what you're thinking.

179
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:30,670
You're thinking, did Cisco
influence these findings?

180
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:34,110
Because, yes, I work for a
vendor and we wanna sell stuff.

181
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:36,320
And I'm here to say that, no,

182
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,470
we did not influence these findings.

183
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:40,840
Not even with Jedi mind tricks.

184
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,700
Wade, can you back me up here?

185
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:45,000
- I back you up 100%, Wendy.

186
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,930
And the Cyentia Institute
did the analysis for this.

187
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:50,760
And so if there is a bias

188
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:55,319
or any kind of error in these
results, it's our fault.

189
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,827
And Cisco actually brought
this to our attention.

190
00:08:57,827 --> 00:08:59,943
"Gee, this doesn't exactly look,

191
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:04,120
you know, like we're being truthful here."

192
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,870
But it's totally legit.

193
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:10,000
Those were, per the data,
the strongest correlations.

194
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,590
- Yes, and this study, by
the way, was double-blinded.

195
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:15,900
They didn't know who was
asking the questions,

196
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,819
we didn't know who was answering.

197
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,090
So there you have it.

198
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:22,970
Now as soon as I saw those results though,

199
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:24,297
my first thought was,

200
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:26,940
"What is this going to
do for organizations

201
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,870
that can't afford to update
their stack all the time,

202
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,380
or to integrate it?

203
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,480
You know, what about those people?"

204
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,950
And that's a really interesting
and difficult question.

205
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:39,070
But there are different ways,

206
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:42,630
different options, for
getting something like that.

207
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:44,580
Now, of course, the first one is upgrading

208
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,970
to the best available
hardware and software.

209
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:48,480
Nice, if you can do it.

210
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,450
If you've got a huge budget

211
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:54,150
and you've got the flexibility
to do that, that's nice.

212
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:56,550
But another option you could try

213
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:59,680
is migrating to SaaS and
cloud-based services,

214
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,250
because at least your
provider is responsible

215
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:06,090
for updating that part of your tech stack.

216
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:08,240
So at least you don't have to try

217
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,690
to do it inside of your organization.

218
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:14,640
Moving to built-in
security is another option.

219
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,449
The good thing about security technology

220
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,000
is as it's been evolving,

221
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,730
a lot of these technologies

222
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:24,020
are getting more security built in.

223
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,240
We're seeing that more and more

224
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,300
with operating systems and so on.

225
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:31,270
So you're automatically
getting some advantage

226
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:33,960
just by updating what you have right now.

227
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,010
And then if you wanna get really bleeding,

228
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,300
cutting edge, you wanna get all fancy,

229
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:43,300
you wanna try adopting something
like Sounil Yu's DIE model,

230
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,459
where he includes ephemeral
architectures in there.

231
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,940
I hope you're gonna hear

232
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:53,053
Sounil Yu and Josh Corman's
talk at the conference.

233
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:56,700
You can try something like that to see

234
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:01,700
if ephemerality will help you
with updating and upgrading.

235
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,423
So those are some options to think about.

236
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:09,110
Now let's look at the other
three in the top five.

237
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:12,420
The other three that are most correlated

238
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:15,420
are timely incident response,

239
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:19,290
prompt disaster recovery, and
accurate threat detection,

240
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:21,360
which if you'll notice don't necessarily

241
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,520
have anything to do with technology.

242
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:27,270
In fact, if you look at Sounil
Yu's Cyber Defense Matrix,

243
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:30,819
these are all right of
boom, as he describes them.

244
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:33,830
These are all after the breach happens.

245
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:38,800
These practices are good
things for you to be practicing

246
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,920
in terms of your process
and your people anyway.

247
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,630
Wade, you got comments on this one too?

248
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:48,770
- I do, and specifically, you know,

249
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:51,980
if you hear detection, response recovery,

250
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:52,960
you might start thinking

251
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,810
of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework,

252
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:57,282
because it uses that same language.

253
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:02,607
And I think it prompted us to wonder,

254
00:12:02,607 --> 00:12:05,000
"Oh, well, you know,
what does that look like?

255
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,430
Is there any connection there?"

256
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:09,810
So we actually asked respondents

257
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:13,500
and grouped the practices
according to where they fit,

258
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,900
what category they're in
the identify, protect,

259
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,170
detect, respond, recover,

260
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:20,870
that the NIST Cybersecurity
Framework is built around.

261
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:24,150
And if you're familiar with
that, that's the order of them.

262
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:26,010
It's not saying that identify

263
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:29,180
is more important than recover,

264
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:32,060
it's just saying that that's
typically where you start.

265
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,900
You identify a threat
and protect against it,

266
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,300
before you can detect,
respond, and recover to it.

267
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:40,099
So there's a little bit of a
timeliness built into that.

268
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,380
But we were more interested
in what does the data say

269
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:47,180
about the correlation

270
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:50,189
of any of those categories
to overall success?

271
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:51,120
In other words,

272
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,760
is identify more important
than recover, vice versa?

273
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:00,540
So on the second column
there, under the data heading,

274
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,610
this is, in crunching the data,

275
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:07,170
what we found to be the
ordering of importance

276
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:09,780
in terms of driving program success.

277
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:12,280
And the most notable thing here for us

278
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,630
is that protect is at the bottom.

279
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:17,280
You know, it is the least correlated

280
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,709
with building a successful program.

281
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:24,140
Now we were careful to,
you know, throw up a caveat

282
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:27,860
that we do not see this as saying

283
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:30,490
that protect isn't important.

284
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:32,450
In other words, oh, rip
out all your protect

285
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:34,260
and prevent based technologies,

286
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,710
and you'll have a successful program.

287
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:39,760
We see this as more indicative of the fact

288
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,650
that we need to build
more diverse programs.

289
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:44,340
For a long time in security,

290
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:47,600
we were very, very protect heavy.

291
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,610
We relied on that most of all,

292
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:52,910
but now detection, response, and recovery

293
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:54,969
are at least equally important, right?

294
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:58,630
And this is good evidence that
that is, in fact, the case,

295
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,650
that those things are driving

296
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:04,370
and really critical to success
in addition to protection.

297
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:07,330
So I think it's probably a good time

298
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:10,650
to look at the next set

299
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:12,740
and, you know, ask the question,

300
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:15,500
what comes after those top five?

301
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,300
And we thought this was important

302
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:20,469
to throw up on the screen here,

303
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:22,500
because if you look at these,

304
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:26,770
they kind of take on a
different characteristic.

305
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:28,150
We have metrics.

306
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:30,720
Automation, I think
would slide very easily

307
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,940
into the detection,
respond, recovery phase.

308
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:36,010
But developing a sound strategy,

309
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:38,830
having a sufficient budget
for all of these things,

310
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:40,533
and then role-based training.

311
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:45,420
If I had to put a label on these,

312
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,510
I think I'd put governance, right?

313
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:49,540
And I think it's a good reminder

314
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,500
that successful programs, you know,

315
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:55,200
we saw architecture is extremely important

316
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,980
to successful programs.

317
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,070
I think when we look at the detection,

318
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:00,470
respond, and recovery,

319
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:02,210
process and technologies,

320
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:05,590
and those kinds of things are important.

321
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:07,230
And this tells me that governance,

322
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:10,552
and people, and money, and strategy

323
00:15:10,552 --> 00:15:12,870
is important as well.

324
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:17,870
So we're not going to
achieve success in security

325
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:22,510
just by buying good tech or
just by hiring good people.

326
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:23,819
The data really is suggesting

327
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:26,120
that all of these things work together

328
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,363
to get us where we need to be.

329
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:30,820
- Right.
- So that brings

330
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:33,490
up the question, what
matters least overall?

331
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:37,593
And I think this is may be
the most important question,

332
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,257
because a lot of people say,

333
00:15:40,257 --> 00:15:41,829
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, I
wanna know what works.

334
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:44,470
But I also wanna know what doesn't work,

335
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:45,840
because I need to consider whether or not

336
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,650
we should be investing as heavily there."

337
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:51,030
And there were several surprises.

338
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:52,439
Wendy, we probably talked more

339
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:56,059
about these than the
ones on top, I feel like.

340
00:15:56,059 --> 00:15:58,963
- Yeah, this is kind of
the womp, womp, womp slide.

341
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,780
- So there's some stuff on
here that might surprise you.

342
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:07,410
Identifying top cyber risks,
you know, is number 21.

343
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:08,949
Secure development,

344
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:10,960
someone being in charge of compliance,

345
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,220
understanding security in the business,

346
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:16,470
and then security measures being reviewed.

347
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:18,777
Now if you put these in
front of me and said,

348
00:16:18,777 --> 00:16:21,510
"Hey, Wade are these unimportant

349
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:22,850
in building a security program?"

350
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:24,617
There's not a single one
of those that I would say,

351
00:16:24,617 --> 00:16:25,980
"Oh, nope, that's not important."

352
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,900
And they're in here, they're
among the 25 practices

353
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,853
because we thought they were important.

354
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,560
But, you know, as far as the data says,

355
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,739
some of these were correlated

356
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:42,730
with not a single one of the
outcomes that we measured.

357
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:47,230
And then others are just one
or two of those outcomes.

358
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:50,623
So not as effective overall.

359
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,220
But there's a caveat here

360
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,650
that I think is important to mention.

361
00:16:56,650 --> 00:17:01,050
And that is numbers one through 25,

362
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:02,079
and just in general,

363
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:05,230
the things that matter most in security

364
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:09,690
change based on organization size,

365
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:14,319
the industry, the geography
that that organization is in.

366
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:17,460
We saw a lot of variation
across these things.

367
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:20,670
So that just because
it's number one overall,

368
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:22,660
doesn't mean it's gonna
be number one for you.

369
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:25,200
And to highlight that point,

370
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,089
this chart is looking at
different size groupings,

371
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:30,040
so small and medium business, large,

372
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:33,280
and then large, enterprise at the bottom.

373
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,220
And just look at the last row.

374
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,800
What you're looking at
here is how things changed,

375
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,030
these practices changed,

376
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,899
in terms of driving overall success

377
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,980
from the overall set of respondents

378
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,060
to just those in enterprise.

379
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:50,090
And here's that identifying
top cyber risks,

380
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:53,870
which is at 0% because it was
not significantly correlated

381
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:57,409
with program success and
the overall data set.

382
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,630
But it was one of the key differentiators

383
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:01,920
for enterprise security programs,

384
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,790
and really unlocked and
became very important

385
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:06,970
in terms of achieving success

386
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:09,800
for those really large organizations.

387
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,850
And there's probably a
lot of reasons for that.

388
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:14,080
You know, larger organizations
have more threats,

389
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,240
it gets more complex
to manage against them,

390
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,730
and it becomes, therefore, more important

391
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:21,130
to really know what
you're defending against,

392
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:24,160
is my hypothesis of why that might be.

393
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,280
But the important thing to remember here

394
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,050
is that, I hate to say it,

395
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:30,980
but everything we're
telling you kind of changes

396
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:33,640
a little bit depending on who you are,

397
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,890
and where you're doing business,

398
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:36,340
and those kinds of things.

399
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:39,070
But at least we have some evidence

400
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:40,870
to base some good decisions on here.

401
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,810
- Yep, now which practices

402
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:45,429
offer the biggest bang for the buck?

403
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:47,150
I know everybody's waiting for that.

404
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:49,540
And I've got

405
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:52,003
some bad news.

406
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,330
In this chart,

407
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:56,370
you can see across the bottom,

408
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:58,969
the percentage of respondents who said

409
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:01,470
that they were doing
a particular practice.

410
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:04,770
And on the left side, along the Y-axis,

411
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:07,410
you can see the increase in probability

412
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:09,840
of overall program success.

413
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,790
Now you notice there's nothing
in the upper-right quadrant.

414
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:17,820
I'm sorry, there just isn't
anything that's so magical

415
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:20,189
that everybody said that they could do it,

416
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:23,630
and it gave a very high probability

417
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:27,530
of giving you success in your
outcomes across the board.

418
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:30,240
If there were, we'd probably
already be doing it.

419
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,100
So that's kind of sad.

420
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,010
But anyway, if you look at
all the black dots here,

421
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:37,250
these are the practices

422
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:41,520
that were statistically significant.

423
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,070
And not everybody said
that they could do them.

424
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:48,060
Clear reporting to exec,
seems to be the highest one.

425
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,940
But this is another great illustration

426
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:52,710
of by how far and away,

427
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:55,850
the proactive tech refresh
and the well-integrated tech

428
00:19:55,850 --> 00:20:00,129
stood out in their impact
on overall program success

429
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:01,970
compared to everything else.

430
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:05,130
Again, this was really surprising to us.

431
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:06,410
Now don't feel bad.

432
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:09,060
If you're looking at the
light blue practices,

433
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:11,919
these are the ones that were
not in and of themselves

434
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:15,900
statistically significant
across the board.

435
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:20,020
But several of them are
statistically significant,

436
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,560
again, based on who you are,

437
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:25,120
what your organization is,
you know, the size and so on.

438
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,620
But, also, if you took a bunch of these

439
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:28,639
and put them all together,

440
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,620
I bet that they would end up being

441
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:33,139
statistically significant together.

442
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:37,040
So don't feel too bad about
there's no one quick win,

443
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,990
but we still have a lot of indications

444
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:40,523
of what we can be doing.

445
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:45,510
Now what should you be
doing with these findings,

446
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,425
besides having a drink first?

447
00:20:47,425 --> 00:20:48,740
(Wade laughs)

448
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,790
Go ahead, Wade.

449
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:54,270
- So we tried very hard

450
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:56,233
to make this report,

451
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:02,450
you know, a roadmap for
helping you find your way

452
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:04,820
in building a successful security program.

453
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:09,370
So our first recommendation
is to grab the report.

454
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:10,889
And in that report,

455
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:12,800
you'll find this thing that we call

456
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,560
the Security Outcomes Matrix.

457
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,429
I showed you a version of that earlier,

458
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:17,803
and here you see it again.

459
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:21,679
And I just wanna take a minute here

460
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,703
and kinda tell you how to read it.

461
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,389
We started affectionately calling

462
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:29,310
this the choose your
own security adventure

463
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:31,013
as we were developing this.

464
00:21:32,428 --> 00:21:34,230
And there's a reason for that.

465
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:37,180
It brings back good
memories of those fun books,

466
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:39,900
but this is exactly the way that works.

467
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:40,950
In other words,

468
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:43,170
if you are on a route

469
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:46,860
to a program that keeps up
with the business, right?

470
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:50,290
You'd take that row and you
scan across this matrix,

471
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:55,170
and you've got about a
dozen different practices

472
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:59,800
that, overall, are
statistically significant

473
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,960
in helping you get there, right?

474
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,980
These are the things where you can choose

475
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:06,280
that one and the book progresses,

476
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:09,070
and you go to the next
step and that's good.

477
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:12,290
And you can do that for
all of these, right?

478
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:15,370
We do not expect every single program

479
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:16,439
keeping up with the business

480
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,490
is the number one thing
they're trying to achieve.

481
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:20,760
It might be meeting compliance regulations

482
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,550
for another organization or
minimizing unplanned work.

483
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:26,990
So we wanted this to be your tool

484
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:31,170
for achieving what you need
to achieve for your program.

485
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:33,730
And then, additionally,

486
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:35,360
you don't have to read it horizontally,

487
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,169
you can read it vertically as well.

488
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:40,720
In other words, if you have been investing

489
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,720
in a particular practice,

490
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,410
I'm just gonna pick one,

491
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:47,060
security awareness training, right?

492
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,300
It's kinda middle of the pack

493
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,060
over to the right a little bit.

494
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,870
And you scan up that,

495
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,679
there's three different
outcomes that the data says

496
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:57,930
that that practice will increase

497
00:22:57,930 --> 00:23:00,264
your chances of success in.

498
00:23:00,264 --> 00:23:04,639
And so both of these
ways are valid methods

499
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,160
of putting this data to use for you.

500
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,220
And we want it to be that way.

501
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,170
You'll find an interactive version

502
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:14,950
of this chart on the report website,

503
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:17,140
there you see the URL.

504
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,610
And you can kind of mouse over

505
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:20,949
some of the outcomes and practices,

506
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:22,870
and just have fun with it, right?

507
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:24,253
That's why it's there.

508
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:28,530
So after you get bored of doing that,

509
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:31,030
we recommend that you check out

510
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:34,720
some of the regional,
industry, and size based

511
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,330
derivative reports that have
been created around this.

512
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:40,470
So keep in mind that we
mentioned a while ago,

513
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:43,530
that that grid

514
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:44,950
is gonna look different

515
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:46,720
if you're a very small organization

516
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,980
versus a very large organization.

517
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:53,100
And, therefore, we've tried to highlight

518
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,530
some of those differences for you

519
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:56,129
in some follow-up research

520
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:58,810
that has been published after that report.

521
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:01,440
Again, you'll find a lot
of those on that same page

522
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,750
when you go to the URL
on the previous slide.

523
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:07,100
So if there's one for your
industry or your size,

524
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:10,560
check it out, read that,
and you'll find a whole host

525
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:14,383
of things that matter for your
organization in particular.

526
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:18,670
And then, furthermore, we
have had a bunch of feedback

527
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:21,300
since publishing this
report from security leaders

528
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,430
that are saying, "Hey, those 11 outcomes,

529
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:24,820
they're really quite useful.

530
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:28,149
You know, I read this
report and I started seeing

531
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:31,900
how we could think about our own program

532
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,520
in light of those 11 outcomes.

533
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,080
And how we might achieve
and report on those,"

534
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,449
and things like that.

535
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:39,240
And so our last recommendation here

536
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,250
is to look at those 11 outcomes and ask,

537
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:42,420
how can you measure them?

538
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:44,050
You know, how could you assess

539
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:46,639
your own progress toward those objectives?

540
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,970
And what kind of metrics
would let you know

541
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:50,990
where you are along that path?

542
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:53,750
And if you look in the
appendix of the study,

543
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:54,770
you will find at least

544
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:58,290
some prompter things about organizations,

545
00:24:58,290 --> 00:24:59,760
how you might know if you're struggling

546
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,780
or succeeding in those outcomes.

547
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:03,639
But we really viewed these as a way

548
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,760
to build an overall successful program.

549
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,790
And we hope that this talk, this report,

550
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:11,750
and everything that
has happened around it,

551
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:12,963
helps you get there.

552
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:16,940
Thank you very much for
listening to us today.

553
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:19,020
I thoroughly have enjoyed this research

554
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,893
and thank you.

555
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:22,733
- Yes, thank you.

556
00:25:22,733 --> 00:25:25,010
And please reach out to
us if you have questions

557
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:27,090
and suggestions for further research.

558
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:29,139
Our information is right here.

559
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:31,497
Thanks and enjoy the
rest of the conference.

560
00:25:31,497 --> 00:25:35,164
